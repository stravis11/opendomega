----------
They are convening, having arrived, all members of the House will please report to their assigned
seats.
All members of this House will please report to their seats, the clerk will ring the bell.
You
All right, we're going to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber
and the clerk will unlock the machines.
All members voted have all members voted
If so the clerk will lock the machines
Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed
I usually begin by wishing you a good morning, and we'll do that, so good morning.
But I know this morning that I share with you the outrage and the shock and grief over
the senseless violence which claimed the lives, yes to afternoon, of eight people, most
to whom were Asian-American.
As a society, we cannot tolerate this lawlessness.
Only evil can walk into a small business and wantonly gun down innocent people.
There will be plenty of opportunity to determine motive and all the circumstances surrounding
these hideous crimes. Our justice system will work. But today is a day to remember. It's
a day to remember the lives of eight people to mourn their loss and to lift up their family
and friends in prayer. May God bless and comfort them during this most difficult time. Thank
Thank you very much.
We will begin our day now with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 131st House District
Representative Beth Kemp, Representative Kemp.
Good morning.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
Pastor Billy Smith is a friend to everyone.
He is one of the most humble people that I know.
When I asked Pastor Billy if he would come and speak with us
and send me his bio, he simply sent me three sentences.
Like I said, he is very humble.
Painting on the wall of the massive entry space
at the new church building, it was just finished last summer,
is the phrase saved people, serve people.
And it commands attention.
Pastor Billion, his team, and the members truly
lived by this message.
I came to know Pastor Billy because I
was a volunteer in the backpack program, which
Christchapel orchestrates, it's a multi-faceted outreach program, and they help kids who
have food insecurity. Kids who don't have food on the weekends, and these volunteers
come and they love and we pack this food, they bring it to the schools, and very discreetly
is this food given out via teachers and school buses. During the pandemic, Christchapel
covertly delivered many roles of toilet paper. Maybe not because people needed
the toilet paper, but as a way to show that they were being thought of.
Pastor Billy and his team wanted to share the good news even during the pandemic.
So one Sunday morning I received a text from a dear friend saying if you want
to come to church come to the field across from the school. And when I got there
I was shocked. There were hundreds of cars. Everyone had their windows down and they had every speaker they possibly could
so everyone would have an opportunity to hear the good news of the gospel.
Christ Chapel loves people and encourages community building by serving others as Christ showed through his example
Both spiritually and temporally. The scripture comes to mind, Matthew 7-20.
wherefore, by their fruit, ye shall know them. Billy Smith does not have to tell
others about his church. He simply shows them. Billion his wife Tina started
Christchafel Community Church in Zebulin in 2003. Christchafel has about 2,000
people attending in services. His family consists of his wife Tina, of course,
and four beautiful children, Cole, Laney, Max and Ruby, and at this time I would
to introduce Pastor Billy Smith.
I almost had to hug my representative
to make it to the podium there.
Hey, good morning everybody.
It's great to see you.
Thanks for the leadership
for allowing me to be here today
and for my representative for the invitation.
I'm a stickler for rules,
says five minutes. You can go ahead and start your clock. I'll be done on time.
I was just asked by my church to make sure I took an offering up before I left. I said, I don't think.
I don't think that's going to happen up there. Be careful if you want to be asked back, right?
But there is an old proverb. He who is short-winded shall be heard again.
And that works for us on the weekends around our place.
Several weeks ago I was upstairs at our house and I was given my two youngest
children the what-for. They're 11 and 9. If you have kids at age you know that
they compete. Everything's a competition from who can dress the quickest, who
can eat the fastest, who can get the car in the car, you know first, then I was
just talking to them about their attitude. They'd really been at each other and
I told them some of these things that I think are important. I said hey you're
attitude can make or break you. And your attitude can heal or hurt you. It'll make you friends or to make you enemies.
Your attitude can make you happy or miserable. It can make you a success or failure. And when I got done talking to him, I felt really good about myself.
I'm like, that's a good, bad moment. Until I went to descend the stairs back to the main floor of our house and I was overly convicted about talking to my kids about their attitude when mine had been pretty sorry lately.
There's a story of an old grandfather who was having a couple of his grandkids over
one weekend and he was going to take a nap.
They had been out playing but they came in and they found some Lynn Burger cheese.
I don't know if you know about that but it stinks.
And while he was napping they put it on his mustache and when he woke up he just kind
of jolted and said, man this bedroom stinks.
He walked out into the hallway and slammed the door and then declared that the hallway
stunk as well.
Went into the parlor of the living room and said the living room stinks.
Went outside to the porch and took a big breath thinking he would get a clean breath of
air and then declared the whole world stinks.
But it didn't.
The grandfather stunk.
He had to own that.
And often when it comes to my attitude, I'm pointing to people around me and I'm really
the problem.
There's some things about attitude today that I want to share with you just briefly that
I think are important in our office every now and then somebody will come in in the morning
They'll have a rough day maybe a rough commute or maybe they had an argument with a spouse
Before they got there and and they say these words I just got up on the wrong side of the
Bed I love it when they say that because I'm always prepared. I want you to go home
I want you to undress get in the bed
roll over, get up on the right side of the bed, read, dress, and come back to work
because we want to work with the attitude of Christ with all that we do at our
church. Just three things quickly. Number one, your attitude reveals the real
you. I don't like that. I don't always like the way I respond, but that's what's in
my heart. Proverbs says this in the 23rd chapter, for a man thinks in his
hard. So he is. My heart exposes my attitude. There was a guy in education, a teacher who was
doing an illustration for his class and he brought in a Mason jar, a canning jar for
y'all who are in rural areas like I am. And he filled it up with water and he left the lid
just loose on it. He walked into the classroom and he began to shake it violently and he said,
does anybody know why does this water come out of this jar and one of the
students raised her hand and said yes because you didn't tighten the lid and
he said you're right another student said it's because you're shaking it
teach if you would just quit shaking it it would stop spilling out another
kid said no it's science you know it's gravity you shaking the can and and
when you shake it it rises and what rises falls it's just coming out and he said
well all of you are right there's a bigger picture water is coming out of the
because water is what's in the jar.
And unfortunately, when we're shaken in life,
the real attitude and the real heart is exposed
during those difficult seasons of our life.
When we are shaken, what comes out of us is who we really are.
There was a man working on a project at his house one day
and he had a bunch of people watching.
They were admiring his work and he was hammering away
and he hit his thumbnail.
I don't know if anybody's ever done that before,
but he hit his thumbnail and he kind of danced around
and he kept saying, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
And I don't know that it would have been the first thought
that came to my mind, but that was what he was saying.
And somebody asked him,
he said, why do you keep saying that?
He said, because that's what's in me.
What's in us during difficult times
is exposed on the outside of us.
Number two, attitude determines the success and failure
of every relationship we have.
Whether that's with our wives or husbands or spouses
or kids or friends or coworkers,
all of those relationships are either strengthened
strengthen or they're weakened by good or bad attitudes.
And the Old Testament in the book of Numbers,
there's a guy named Moses, maybe you remember him,
who went up on the mountain, got the 10 commandments,
came back down, then the Israelites
out of Egyptian captivity,
pretty important Old Testament guy.
But he had some family members
who had a really bad attitude, Miriam and Aaron.
Now, their excuse for the attitude was
that he had married outside of their tribe,
but that was just their excuse.
They were really jealous that Moses had been given permission
God to lead. See, the leaves on the tree were, hey, you married outside of the
tribe, but the root was jealousy. Here's what I'm trying to say today. Is there
family relationships, our work relationships? All of those are determined where
they're going to be good, bad, poor, or healthy based off, based off our attitudes.
The third and final thing is this. Attitude is always our choice. Nobody controls
our health and our emotions, but us. It's always our choice. Often you'll
hear people say, I just had a bad day. Well, those circumstances don't determine
your attitude. We do. I love a guy one time who was asked the question about his
college career, about his academics. They said, were you in the top half of the
class? And he said, no, I'm sorry to say I wasn't in the top half of the class,
but I'm happy to announce that I was in the part of the class that made the
top half possible. Right? There's summa cum laude and then there's thank you
lotto. Has anybody with me this morning? Right? Just thankful I got out. But his
attitude was this, you know what? I didn't finish in the top half, but I did
finish. There was a holocaust survivor named Dr. Victor Franco. Endured the
unimaginable. When he got to the concentration camp, they took his clothes
away from him. They took his watch. They took his wedding ban that his wife had given him on his
wedding day and they tried to take his dignity. But what they couldn't take was his attitude.
He says he survived not because he was stronger than everybody else but because he had an attitude
that reflected joy, hope, and positivity. One last thing and then we're going to pray together.
Every morning, across this nation, two birds leave looking for a meal.
One's a vulture, and he's looking for things that are dead and rotten and things that smell.
And guess what? He finds it.
But over the same deserts in our country every day, hummingbirds also leave looking for a meal.
They're looking for something that's sweet and something that's fresh and something that's good and wholesome.
them. And guess what? They find it. And I think today when it comes to my attitude and yours,
it sounds like a, this sounds like a kids church sermon doesn't it? But the more I talk about
attitude, the more I realize it isn't for kids. It's for grown folks like me. I'm just asking you
today to evaluate throughout the day how you treat people, how you honor people, how you love
and care for people. Today is the anniversary of my dad passing away. He passed away one year,
when you're a go-to-day, have his towel in his honor.
I wanted to do that today.
One thing my dad left me, we weren't rich,
we were just rural middle-class family,
but he taught me you get up every day.
You treat people fair, you treat people right,
and you determine your own attitude.
I'm just asking you to do the same today.
Let's reflect the attitude, the heart, and the mind of Christ.
Thank you so much for an opportunity today.
Will you battle and let's pray?
Father, today, thank you for this house and what it represents.
We have an incredible nation and a great state, and I'm so proud of what's happened here
over the course of the last year during a very difficult season.
Maybe our country's most difficult.
Man, but the hardship and the perseverance has done nothing but make us stronger and make
us better.
I pray for every house member who's here today.
I pray for their families and their homes.
I pray that you bless them and you keep them safe.
And I pray those things in Christ's name.
And we all say together, amen.
We're going to do the pledge.
Allegedly, we just feel the flag of the United States of America
and due to the Republic for which
And one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Georgia House.

If you have no interest in the morning orders, that's fine, but just step outside in case
there are people in here that wish to hear them.
recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Mandy Ballinger.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yesterday, on March 16th, a violent disturbed man perpetrated a heinous series of murders,
killing six Asian women and two whites.
As a former victim advocate, my heart goes out to the victims of this senseless act.
My job at the time was used to be to assist victims of crime like this.
I am intimately familiar with a sense of staggering loss and long road to recovery, as family
and friends of the lost face.
But I have confidence that Georgia's prosecutors will hold this man accountable for these heinous
acts.
assisted by the tools given to them by the General Assembly,
such as the hate law we passed last year.
Let us have a moment of silence to remember the victims.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Charlise Bird
for a morning order representative bird.
Good morning. I stand here to bring light to the tragic events that occurred
yesterday evening. It is heart-wrenching to think of the families of those
many of whom were women were killed and injured at the shooting that happened
at the Asian-owned run business in Cherokee County, my own district.
This is a horrific event and I am thankful to the Sheriff's Office
office who quickly identified and apprehended the suspect. I too live not far from these tragic
events that happened. First and foremost, I am an American, but I proudly recognize my Chinese
heritage and my culture every day. My dad, a full-blooded Chinese, married my mother who is Irish
English in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1949. Something very unheard of in those days.
And in fact, it was called a mixed marriage. In fact, the Chinese population was
relatively small because of the Chinese Exclusion Act signed by the president
author in 1882 and was not repealed until 1943. I really didn't think much about being Chinese
until my siblings and I started elementary school. We didn't look like everyone else. Our skin
color was different with dark, slanted eyes. At recess, the boys most cruel by pretending to
shoot us with machine guns, that's what we heard on most days at recess hurtful
yes painful yes scars yes we too suffered by the people who are ignorant and
filled with hate obviously kids back then heard discussions at home about World
War II and the horrible Japanese people, thus the beginnings of prejudice right in your
own home with your own family.
I certainly, my parents taught me to embrace our differences, stand strong and never let
anyone get the best of you.
I was also reminded this morning of words in our Bible study,
sticks and stones may break my bones,
but words will never harm me.
Bevin Jean, my parents, taught us Jesus
loves the little ones, red, yellow, black, and white.
My prayers go out to the family of the victims,
And I hope they get the justice they deserve.
Please join me for a moment of silence
for all of these victims for the senseless crimes
committed last evening.
Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Noel Williams
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today wanting to, of course, say how sick
and we all were to what happened yesterday afternoon
and in the evening.
And I just wanted to commend my sheriff in Crisp County
and the Georgia State Patrol of Eggs at 101.
By doing the duty that lies nearest, they protect us.
At 3 o'clock this morning, my sheriff had a phone call.
They apprehended the subject on I-75 this morning.
And I just want to say to you all how proud we are of our law enforcement, our Georgia State Patrol.
There does not a day goes by that we do not need to thank them.
And we are certainly certainly sickened by what happened yesterday.
And may God hold them in the palm of His hands.
Thank you.
to recognize his representative will wade for a morning order.
Good morning. I rise today to pay honor to my father.
He passed on Thursday night but right now he's he's he's in heaven and to those
reps that are from the Sumter County area and the making city of making and
then myself being in Dawson County that was the history that my dad and his
legacy had in this state his family settled in Sumter County in the 1700s but
But today I rise to tell you that I'm thankful for the man that taught me to feed love and
starve hate.
He showed students who lived in homes in my community that still had dirt floors in the
70s and 80s that they could do anything that they put their mind to.
He was an educator.
Roy Wade was the tallest man in Dawsonville.
at six foot nine in his heyday, every child looked at him as a giant, but he was gentle.
My message is for you today, especially given the events of yesterday, ring true and what
my dad taught me.
And I want to share it with you and remind every one of us of the message that he taught
myself and my brother and every student that ever had his fifth grade in my class.
into this. Good Lord made all of us in his image and what he made is beautiful. And I
look to each of you, each of you are beautiful because you are what God has made. Do your
best. Feed love, star of hate. Thank you. Let us pause for a memory of my father. Thank
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Petri and the Chatham County delegation for a morning order.
You, Mr. Speaker, we rise today to wish everyone a happy St. Patrick's Day.
This is the second time in history since 1824 that we have not had a St. Patrick's Day
parade in Savannah, but the people of Irish heritage will always celebrate our patron
St. Patrick who brought Christianity to the people of Ireland.
I also want to make a special thank you and recognition of the honorable Don Hogan who as I understand it was there with St. Patrick as he drove the snakes out of Ireland.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative win for a morning order.
Fifty seconds remaining.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm here today to talk about the horrific and violent tragedy that took the lives of eight people at three different Asian businesses in Cherokee in Atlanta.
Of those eight victims, six were Asian-American women.
We don't know the details of the shooting or the motives of the shooting, but we do know in the last year that hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased by 150%.
And of those hate crimes, 68% of them are directed towards Asian-American women.
This is a result of xenophobic rhetoric.
The labeling of the COVID-19 virus has been longing to or as the fault of China and other
Asian people.
So today, I want to remind us that there has been this history in this country of excluding
AAPIs, including an exclusion act directed towards an entire continent, the incarceration
of Japanese-American, the violence against Chinese real workers, and we have been taught
as Asian-Americans to keep our heads down because our parents believed it was safer for us.
But what's happened is that we are now invisible, and when things happen to us, people don't
speak up until a tragedy like this one occurs.
It is invisibility that hasn't shielded us from hate crimes, xenophobia, or gender-based
violence.
And we saw all of these intersections happening yesterday.
In the next few days, our priority is getting resources in support to victims of the families
and respect their needs and their confidentiality.
And we know there is a lot of fear in the Asian American community right now, and we're
working together to support the greater community as a whole.
And my ask of this chamber is to stop and call out any xenophobic rhetoric to condemn hate
against any community and to keep these victims and families in your thoughts and prayers.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Time for morning orders, as expired.
We are going on now to the rules calendar, going on to the rules calendar.

State your inquiry.
Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the judicial canons
that all judges are required to follow make clear
that they're not supposed to interject any party biases
when making their determinations and thus,
this is aligning the canons that they swear to with,
with what they're doing.
That is my understanding.
What purpose does the minority caucus
will representative Wilkerson rise?
Parliamentate inquiry.
State your inquiry.
Is it not true that there is no disagreement on that?
That this could easily be fixed by making every judge,
magistrate, and probate court judge across the state,
nonpartisan, we could do that in one quick billing.
Be done.
I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be accurate.
We're not going to debate this any further.

Chair recognizes representative Gamble to present the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Members, I rise today to ask for your support on Senate Bill 43.
This is a bill that the optometrists and the ophthalmologists see eye to eye on, which
as you know is somewhat of a rarity.
Senate Bill 43 prohibits insurers from requiring optometrists and ophthalmologists from being
mandated to give discounts on non-covered materials or services.
For example, many vision plans mandate that doctors provide a discount on a second pair
of glasses when the second pair is not covered by the vision plan.
This bill would outlaw the mandate, but doctors of optometry can still choose to offer
the discount at their own discretion.
This is modeled after similar legislation that was passed in 2011 for non-covered dental
services.
And in short, Senate Bill 43 would give greater flexibility for businesses to choose
how they offer these discounts to their customers.
So with that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the body's favorable consideration Senate
Bill 43, and I'm happy to stand for any questions.
You have no questions.
Thank you.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable

So it's to provide that the Georgia teacher of the year shall be invited to serve as an advisor
ex officio to the state board of education as bill have inferred the committee on education.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative Lorickia to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
colleagues I rise to present Senate Bill 88, and like many of you, I'm sure you have
a teacher that had a tremendous impact on your life.
And for me, that teacher was my sister with being a public educator for almost 40 years
and she still teaches school today, and she was born to be a mother and an educator.
And you've heard the story of Representative Will Wade's dad, a giant of a man at six
but nine and teaching fifth grade math and I needed a man like that teaching me
math because I was struggled a little bit but with the help of this legislature
since day one governor camp has championed education and specifically in the
area of recruiting and retaining our teachers and that's what this bill does
this bill has six parts and first this bill would allow the Georgia teacher of
the year to serve as an advisor and ex officio member of the state board of
education. Next Senate Bill 88 supports and enhances a pathway for our veterans to become
alternatively certified teachers. This bill would also utilize an excess of observational
resources for new teachers or teachers who need a little extra observation. Some of those
high performing teachers that have had a history and long record of being a quality educator
don't need to be observed as much and they can use those resources for new teachers or
teachers that need a little bit of help. It also improves differentiated instruction and
reading instruction for future teachers, especially new teachers, with those at-risk
students, some that may have learning disabilities or even for advanced students. And finally
this takes this enhances historically black colleges and universities role in teacher
preparation and programs to make sure that the teachers that are standing in front of
the classroom are representative of what the communities look like where they're leading
these children. So Mr. Speaker, this bill speaks for itself. If there are no questions,
I would ask for your favorable consideration. You do not have any questions. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. I'd appreciate your favorable consideration.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous

control I think that's just a matter that each member is going to have to
decide for themselves all right one more parliamentary inquiry if that's what it
is to what purpose is represented or chairman he's Clark rise parliamentary
inquiry isn't it true the earlier we had some bills dealing with local control
deciding on how to do their elections and some of the people that are voting

Those are provided replacement of the monument and honor of the honorable Zell Brian Miller
upon the capital of grounds, the state capital building.
Ms. Bill Evans referred to the Committee on State Properties, that committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Speaker Ralston to present the bill.
Thank you, Madame Speaker.
It is my honor to bring before you today Senate Bill 140, sponsored by the Senate Rules
Chairman.
This measure enjoys a long bipartisan list of co-sponsors, including the President,
ProTIM, and the Minority Leader in the Senate.
It was unanimously passed by our colleagues in the State Senate.
Bill 140 would erect a statue or other monument on our capital grounds in memory of our 79th
Governor and former United States Senator, Zell Brian Miller.
Zell Miller has been called the Governor who gave Georgia Hope more than 1.9 million students
have been able to attend college through Georgia's Hope Scholarship Program.
more than 1.6 million four-year-olds have attended Georgia's pre-kindergarten program.
In total, the Georgia lottery has generated some $23 billion in funds for education in
our state.
Zell Miller had a vision of a state where your opportunities were only limited by your
willingness to work for them.
He was a man who, both as an elected official in the United States Marine, was guided
by resolute moral compass and an unyielding belief in the value of hard work and the power
of education to change lives.
For those of us fortunate enough to have known him, Governor Miller had the heart of a line,
And at the same time, the stubbornness of a mountain mule.
But in the mountains at Zell, and I call home, there are fewer traits, more praiseworthy,
than having the courage of your convictions, and having a good independent street to stick
by them regardless.
He's the only individual, and probably the only individual who could have, he noted both
the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. And when I attended his funeral in 2018, along
with Dean Smiley, we saw him eulogized by three count of one, two, three former presidents
of the United States from both political parties. In the last three or four years of his life,
I made a point of visiting with him two or three times a year at his home.
Not because he needed company, he had plenty of that, but because to be with him made
me better, and I learned so much during those visits.
In the man from Young Harris, Georgia got a leader who stood above partisan politics and
yet enjoyed as much as anybody, the give and take of the battle.
And Zell Miller, Georgia, got a leader who looked down that dusty dirt road he often talked
about that ran through young Harris.
And he saw that as a road to a brighter future for this state and particularly its children
and a road that could take you all over the world.
Madam Speaker, it is for these reasons and many more that I ask every member of this
House to join with me in honoring a favorite son of our state, Governor and United States
Senator, Zell Bryan Miller, and I ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill
140. I know others want to speak to the measure and I yield the will.
The gentleman has yielded the well. The chair recognizes Representative Williams to speak
to the bell.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
There are many in here that knew Governor Miller with the exception of probably the speaker
because of his age.
Few knew him longer than I did.
I made him in 1972 on the floor of the Democratic National Convention when he was executive
director of the party.
That was a volatile convention.
That was the very first convention that the governor did not pick delegates to the convention.
And it was a tight rope to walk, the jail miller walked brilliantly.
We formed a friendship.
A few years later he came and asked me to help him run for Lieutenant Governor, which
I willingly did.
The pay was fantastic and occasional Coca-Cola in May, but Hamburg on a good day.
But he was, when he was elected, he did what had never been done before.
He made the Lieutenant Governor's office look like Georgia.
I was the first African-American session aide to lieutenant governor in Georgia.
In that first session, I met a young guy who had a huge afro, a long car, and he walked
in replaced Moses, I was Dean Smarrick, and then that group of us, he hired two African
Americans, administrative assistants, Elizabeth Martin, and Lillian Lewis, the widow of John
Lewis. He was a mountain populist, and I knew nothing about mountain populists until I got
to know him. Yes, he was dubbing as a mule. But I was used as a sacrificial lamb a couple
of times. When he was really hot and he and the speaker were a speaker murphy where
at each at arms, he'd send me to take the message to the speaker. I think he knew I was the
most expendable person in the office.
I'd go over, he'd give me this rip-raring message,
not written out, I had to repeat what he said and he'd say,
you tell him just like I said it.
And I'd walk in and when I'd tell the speaker to speak
and look at me and said, I know he didn't say it like that.
And he'd said, see God of his mouth,
but you tell him just what I said when I got back.
He'd ask me what he said, not water it down.
He said, hell will you if you're a liar.
But he had a heart of gold, but he was a liar.
In his later years, many of you, particularly Democrats,
who remember only him speaking at the Republican National
Convention in some of the candidates he supported.
But I remember the zeal miller that created an atmosphere that makes it possible in many
ways that this capital looks like it looks today.
He had a genuine love for people, and one of my most treasured items is the wedding gift
he gave to Olivia and I 43 years ago, this coming decently, but above all else.
He had one of the strongest wives I've ever known in my life, and that was Shirley Miller.
Now you talk about a lady, she was strong.
And because this state has always been like that, it didn't pay cost to law officers and
especially legislators, what they were worth, hand-hand.
It was a very low pay for Lieutenant Governor's.
But he was available.
time ever heard a country song was in his office and I didn't know what the
world that was he was playing and I said what is that he had a love for
country music like you wouldn't believe I'm not going to ever forget him I know
very few people more deserving of a statue at this Capitol in Zell Brian Miller
But a giant of a man, or a dear friend, or my misforever, I urge you to vote yes to this
resolution.
The fan, Madam Speaker, I yield the well.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
The chair recognizes Representative Smari to speak to the well.
Speak to the bell.
How you doing?
Thank you Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure for me to come today and speak on Senate Bill
140, Zebra and Miller, and I want to say first that I talk with Shirley Miller maybe two
or three times a year and his grandson, Brian, and have a relationship with the Miller's
And one of the biggest honors I've ever received,
I think you received it in 2018,
the Turtle on the Fence Pose award.
And I received it in 2019,
with the Zell Miller Foundation.
And I really got to know Zell Miller
at the early, early time.
I met him in 1975.
In fact, that gentleman right there, from the 168th district, set up the meeting.
He was a staffer at that time, Lieutenant Governor Miller.
And I went to CM and we've had a relationship and a friendship since that time.
And he's been said that he's been stubborn and we had a great, great relationship, Governor
Miller.
And sometimes we had some very, very spirited comments.
He was, that would be on the mile side.
But he is, in my opinion, one of the most consequential
governors in the history of our state.
And if you've never heard it, I think you ought to listen
to his 1993 state of the state of dress.
is one of the most courageous, timeless,
and prophetic messages.
I've listened to it maybe six or seven times.
And in that speech, he talks about leadership.
And he talks about the state in the fall of moving state.
And he talked about, for the first time,
changing the Georgia state flag, which was very courageous.
I could almost call him his election,
a one by 30-some thousand votes at that time.
And after he won, he called us in one day
and said, you know what?
He said, Georgia needs hope.
And he came up with the Hope Scholarship Program.
That was not the first time I heard the word hope and lottery.
Guy named John White, state representative down
and all being a representative.
We just remember, talked us about a lottery.
And, but Zeal talked about it.
Gov.
And Moe talked about the lottery.
And he said, what we ought to do is
designated money for the future of our state,
and invested in the intellectual capital
of the young people in our state.
We keep our best and our brightest in our state.
And so, Zell Miller, in his book written by Richard Hyatt,
the governor who gave Georgia hope,
as one of the best reads I've read,
and it talks about his entire life.
And so I want to come this morning and say, in 1991,
I remember I was on the committee.
That time, how you it was called
a University System of Georgia Committee.
And I went on later to chair that committee.
After Dubos Portal was, at that time,
one of his flow leaders, and he handled the legislation
in hope, and I think Representative Joe Green
represented Butch Parish, and represented Mary Margaret Oliver, and
representative Ellen Powell, I think, with the members that were here in
19, in that time, I might have missed somebody I apologize, but
those are the ones I can remember that we're here when we passed, when we
had the committee, the bill in the committee, and the University System of
Georgia, and I went with ZL when he bought the first lottery ticket on
a great moment for the state of Georgia and the rest is history.
So, Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and delighted to come.
And to give recognition to a giant of a man,
a man who gave a lot to this state,
a man who was historic in his governorship
and remember going to the state senate,
going to lieutenant governor for 16 years,
years going to governor for eight years and going to the U.S. Senate for six years.
He just was a tremendous governor and a tremendous person and I enjoyed it, rolled out together
to his, you know, and having a conversation about Zell Miller.
So Mr. Speaker, this is very timely and very appropriate that we erect a statue in the
honor of a giant of a man, an individual who gave much for this state, and you've heard
me say this a 100 times, you make your living by what you get, what you make your life
by what you give, as the another made his life by giving, but that we all be very, very
thankful.
So I'm asking everyone if you would please vote in favor of Senate Bill 140 so that we
can move on, get this done, and have the ceremony, and get this family over here, and salute
to an individual that gave much of his state, and gave much to Georgia, and much to this
nation.
With that, Madam Speaker, I will yield the well.
Thank you.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
