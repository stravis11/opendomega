Oh, it's not the back's working in front, it's not.
So work in progress, as many of us are,
works in progress.
As is our custom, we will begin our day
with a scripture reading in prayer by our chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning is no stranger.
How many years now?
36.
36.
36.
He's come to this body and served as chaplain.
Appreciate him and his ministry,
Brother Benny Tate, but I'm gonna let Clint Crowe introduce him
a little bit better than I did.
So with that, the gentleman from the 118th House District
Representative Chairman Clint Crowe
is recognized to speak to our chaplain of the day.
Representative Crow.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I heard that they had gotten the sound system.
They were almost had it fixed.
Then they found out I was coming up to talk so they thought they'd wait and
leave it turned off while I was up here.
Now, good morning colleagues. It's a pleasure to once again welcome back
Pastor Benny Tate.
Many of you in this chamber have been here and heard him and met him
and been blessed by what he's had to say.
Pastor Bitty has been at Rock Springs Church for 36 years now.
And he does a lot of things.
He's an author. He has a new book that's on your desk.
I got a copy for everybody, so I hope that you found it on your desk this morning.
I hope you'll take some time to read that.
I think it's a wonderful book and I think you'll be blessed by it
and I hope you enjoy that.
The Pastor Benny does that.
We have multiple campuses, several missions.
He's the founder and chancellor of Rock Springs Christian Academy,
where my kids get to go to school,
and I'm honored to get to serve on the school board there.
We have a group of our kids here today.
We have all of the eighth grade,
and a lot of the seventh graders here,
including my son, Jason, sitting up in the gallery,
so we want to make them welcome.
I'm glad to have them here.
Pastor Benny has also been the president of our church
denomination. He's done a lot of things.
But I want to tell you what I tell people when they ask me
about Benny Tape.
Any time asked somebody asked me about him,
I tell him a story.
As many of you know, five years ago,
as we ended session, 2021, right at the end of session,
my dad was sick, we brought him home from the hospital,
and we knew we had a short time with him.
We got to talking one day, specifically
he and my wife, who is a much better Christian
than I am than Pastor Benny can attest to that.
But my wife got to talking to my mom and my dad about their salvation and
wanted to make sure they were prepared.
And they said that they weren't sure.
They weren't convinced.
So my wife, being who she is, got on her phone called Pastor Benion, his cell phone
and said, would he come and talk to them?
That evening, he and his wife, Ms. Barbara, drove from their house in Versailles,
Georgia to the north end of Butts County to my mom and dad's house,
brought some banana bread that Barbara had made. I may have eaten the banana bread. I shared it with
them, but he came up there, sat with my parents for nearly an hour and prayed with both of them to get saved.
Now, I don't care what else anybody ever does for me. There will be nothing that will mean more
than that for me and what he did for me and my family. So when people ask me about him,
That's who he is. He is a pastor. He is reaching people for Jesus. That is his mission. That's what he
does. And I am honored to have him be my pastor. And I'm even more honored to have him be my friend.
Please welcome back, Dr. Benny Tate.
Well, good morning and thank you so much for being here. Thank you for the client,
for those kind words. As he was introducing me, I was praying. I was praying for a
client, and I was actually asking the Lord to forgive him. I said, God, forgive brother
client for overpraising me. And then I prayed to prayer and I said, God, forgive me for enjoying
it so much. Amen. A good good morning. Good to see all of you. Just I honored to have the
students just have a curiosity. How many would say Pastor Benny? I've never heard you before.
I've never heard you before. Could you raise your hand? I've never heard you before. Just a few of
you. Just a few. Well, I'll say to you few, what a list of Taylor said to her eighth husband.
I'm not going to keep you long. Amen. Not going to keep you long. I want to talk to you this morning
in a scripture that's found in 2 Timothy, chapter 1, verse 16. This is what the scripture
says. The Lord give mercy unto the house of own Cypheras, for he often refresh me and
was not ashamed of my chains. He often refresh me and was not ashamed of my chains. I want
talk to you this morning about what every person needs, what every person needs. I
remember a few years back, a few years back, I was with Mr. Truitt Cathy. And Mr.
Truitt Cathy said to me, he said, Pastor Benny, do you know how you can
determine whether or not a person needs encouragement? I said, no, no, Mr.
How do I know if a person needs encouragement?
He said, Benny, if they're breathing, they need encouragement.
If they're breathing, they need encouragement.
During this time, we've got a lot of people running for office.
I heard about a guy the other day that was running for office
and he was making a speech.
And while he was speaking, a heckler stood up and the heckler said,
I wouldn't vote for you if you was Saint Peter.
And the politician spoke back and said,
if I was Saint Peter, you wouldn't be in my district.
Amen?
Everybody needs encouragement.
I heard about him, Mrs. Johnson.
She was a teacher, Mrs. Johnson.
And she had Johnny in her class.
And Johnny would literally make these ugly faces.
And Mrs. Johnson said, Johnny, when I was a little girl, the teacher told me that if you
make ugly faces, your face will literally freeze that way.
He said, Mrs. Johnson, you can't say you wasn't warned.
Amen.
Well, here's what I know about every person.
This is what I know about every 80 members of this body, 180 members of this body, every
one of you need encouragement.
And if you don't own day three, you will, by day 40, every one of you need encouragement.
And what's so encouraging to me is every one of us can do it.
Every one of us can encourage other people.
Your surpasser helped me out, I will.
How can I encourage somebody today?
First of all, you can encourage people with your praise.
With your praise, Proverbs 18 and 21 says,
death and life is in the power of the tongue.
Folks, this world that we get to live in,
I believe, was spoken into existence.
Spoken words created this world.
That's what I believe.
hope you do too. I don't want to be like the guy that said once I was a tadpole
beginning to begin and then it was a frog with my tail tucked in and then I
was a monkey in a banana tree and now I'm a professor with a PhD. I don't believe
that. I believe that God spoke this world into existence. Friend listen to me
closely. If words created this world, your words can create somebody else's
world because death and life's in the power of the tongue. How can we encourage
people? We can encourage people with our praise. Let me tell you a second way
we can encourage people. We can encourage people with our presence. Notice what
it said, the Lord gave mercy into the house of Ohm Cypherus for he often
refresh me and was not ashamed of my chains. Proverbs 17 and 17 says a friend
love it at all times and a brother is born for adversity. Said Pastor Benny I
want to I won't encourage somebody I'll tell you how you can do it. I'll tell
you how you can do it. You can encourage somebody with your presence just be
there for that person. We encourage people, we encourage people with our praise, we encourage
people with our presence, but I'll tell you a third way. I've been the pastor and he said 36
years at Rock Springs Church. How do you stay at a church 36 years? Well, when you want to leave,
you just stay. And when the people want you to leave, you just stay. I just figured it would be
easier for them to move their membership than me to move my furniture.
Amen? I just stay.
I'm speaking a few weeks ago on a lady walked out the door and she said that was a warm message.
I thought what does that mean? Don't do that today.
The following week I'm standing at the door, she came out the door and she said that was a warm
message. I said, wonder what that means. The third week she came out the door, Mrs. Speaker,
and she said, that's a warm message. I said, ma'am, what does that mean? She said, not so hot.
We encourage people with our praise. We encourage people with our presence, but let me tell you
third way you can encourage people. You encourage people with your pen. I know we're in the electronic
age. Sometimes it don't work elsewhere, am I man? I do believe when the devil's not bothering us,
I believe is in sound equipment. But we're in the electronic age and everything's digital today,
but folks let me tell you something. Politicians listen to me closely. There's power in picking up
your pen and writing somebody a handwritten note. I don't save a lot of stuff, but I save
handwritten notes that have been written to me. Look here. I'm almost finished. If you get finished
before I do, just slip out. I'm almost finished. But we encourage people with our praise. We encourage
people with our presence. We encourage people with our pain, but there's one other way we can
encourage people. We can encourage people with our prayers. You say, well, I'm praying for people.
Yeah, but here's the thought. Let them know you're praying for them. Because if you live long enough,
if you live long enough, you'll get to the point sometimes it's hard to pray for yourself.
When you've got somebody who comes alongside of you and says I just want you to know I'm
praying for you.
One of my heroes in the political arena and first of all I want to say thank God for every
one of you.
I came today to encourage you.
I want to say thank God for every one of you.
You say I'm a Republican, I'm a Democrat.
folks, we're Americans. We're Georgians. That matters not. But I want to come and say thank you
for what you do. But I'll tell you who I really wish I could speak to. I wish I could speak to your
mates and your children. Because I'd like to say to your mates and children, thank you for the
sacrifice. Thank you for the sacrifice you give, for your
mate, your husband, your wife, your mom, your dad, to do this
service to our great state. Abraham Lincoln was was
killed tragically. And when Abraham Lincoln was killed
congregation, they started looking at what he had on him when
was killed. He had a pair of glasses, he had a pocket knife, he had a handkerchief, he
had a $5, $5 Confederate $5 bill. Then they noticed something else. He had a couple
newspaper articles. And then these newspaper articles were tattered. But in these articles
the writer had spoke complimentary of President Lincoln and so from time to time he'd get
him out and he would read them because Mr. Truett was right. Everybody including you needs
encouragement and everybody around you needs encouragement because listen, I'm done.
If you treat everybody, if you treat everybody, that means you, that means you, that means
you.
If you treat everybody, if you treat everybody, you'll be treating 90% of the people correctly.
Let's pray.
we bow our heads and hearts in your presence. I spoke of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln said
those words, I've been driven to my knees by an overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else
to go. My wisdom and all about me seemed insufficient in the day. I pray your wisdom upon this delegation.
I pray your wisdom upon this house. I pray God that every member of this house, Lord,
that you would give them your goddess, that they would be led by you. Not only do I pray for them,
but I pray for their families. Keep them safe. Protect them, Lord. Meet the needs of their families.
I pray for traveling mercy. Many travel from North Georgia, South Georgia to be here and serve.
The coast to be here, serve this body. I pray that you will keep them safe on the roads.
God, I just ask you to bless them and keep them, make your face to shine up on them, be gracious
and to them, lift your countenance upon them, and may they experience your peace for I pray
this prayer, respecting all faiths, but I pray this prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Thank you brother Benny door keepers you may unlock the doors brother Benny thank you for being here and providing those words of encouragement

properly.
Let's try that.
I don't think you have to get close to the microphone.
You did a great job, by the way.
Thank you so much.

Today we have on your desk your beautiful flyer and it's for the Georgia Legislative
Black Caucus meeting today, the weekly meeting, will be held at 3 p.m. CLOB 310. Today's
special guest is Georgia Alliance. We look forward to hearing from them. In addition,
there's a letter attached, welcoming all members back, and we're getting ready for a very
interesting session. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Which room was that? CLOB 310.
310. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Dickey, what are you up to this afternoon?
Yeah. I want to wait and find out. Well, the gentleman's recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I want to take a quick moment of personal privilege.
Today is my and Cindy's anniversary. And she is a great partner with me. And I just put her back home at the farm taking care of my
business and our family. Thank y'all. That is very kind. I got to introduce to her
a long time ago. We were teenagers at high school and she stuck with me through
thick and thin for a long time and I just want to tell our loved one and thank
you for all she does for our family. I wanted for wife, mother, and grandmother so
Happy anniversary.
A beautiful lady.
And we appreciate her and what she's done for Georgia as well.
And what she continues to do for Georgia.
Not just your family, but all of our families in Georgia.
Cindy, we love you too.
Thank you.
Good job, Mr. Chairman.
You're back in good graces.
I'm not sure if you're out of them, but you're in good graces now.
Now, Representative Bale is recognized for an afternoon order.
Representative Bale.
Gentlemen's recognized.
Good morning, colleagues.
And what a joy it is to be back with you today.
Before I start, I would just like to know,
let you all know how much I love you.
I love this state, and I love this nation.
So in our nation, a mother, a wife, a daughter,
was killed on American soil.
Her life had a purpose.
Her life had value.
And her life mattered.
Dr. King reminds us that the measure of a nation
is not found on the strength of his forces,
but on the depth of his conscience.
When the mother is taken from her children,
whole country is diminished. When the power is exercised without restraint, liberty
itself is at risk. Now let us say it plainly. As someone raised to respect the law, order
and the rule that stands for all of us and that no one stands above it, America is the
strongest, the authority is disciplined and accounted for. The government that acts
for our very trust is niece earned every day.
Bad actions by anyone wearing a badge
or holding the title is dishonor
and dishonor to the good men and women
that serve our nation faithfully daily.
We can believe in both borders
and still in human dignity.
We can stand for enforcement
and still stand against injustice.
We can put America first.
We can put America first
without putting compassion down.
Renée Nicole Good should still be alive today.
Her children should still hear her voice.
It is the republic that must endure.
It is our democracy that must endure.
And with her death, it must not be ignored, excused, or buried.
As a great Georgian once said and taught us, the arc of the moral universe bends towards
justice, but only with patriots that are brave enough to bend with it.
Let us honor, let us honor Renée Nicole Goodman, not with empty words, but with truth, accountability,
and renewed commitment to our nation
to protect life, liberty, and justice for all.
Because that is what America means to put America first.
Thank you, colleagues.
Georgia first.
Thank you, Representative.
Thank you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen I'll be brief I know that this session has gotten
off to a quick start this year it feels.
Member of law enforcement myself is an assistant district attorney knowing the judicial process
like I do.
I just feel compelled to come here to this well to say that the rule of law is what rules
in this country that there's an opportunity for review.
Any time that national politics are going to influence the debates and discussions that
we have here at the state capital, potentially we may be doing so with more of a political
slant than policy-driven approach.
And what I would just say is this, we back the blue here in Georgia, the caucus that
I lead has been very clear about that, that we have no intent of doing anything differently
and it's proud as a proud member of the caucus that I serve as majority leader for, intend
to do so here in the future.
There's an opportunity for discussions and investigations to take place, but at the end
of the day we cannot allow the rule of law to be criticized or influenced in such a way
that it gets us off track from focusing on the needs of Georgians here in our state.
With that in the speaker, I yield the well.
Thank you, Representative.
That concludes our afternoon orders.
We'll move on to announcements.
