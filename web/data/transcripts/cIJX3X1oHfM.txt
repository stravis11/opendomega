chair recognizes
the chairman of the house rules
committee
chairman smith
there may not be much cheering after i
tell you what i'm going to tell you
we're being inundated with rule
substitutes
as of right now we still have people
dropping off rule substitutes
the chances of those rules substitutes
that have
been dropped recently or will be
proposed to be dropped
something may freeze over before they
come out of the rules
i
i hate to be that way but uh
and next year i am going to recommend
that there'll be no rule substitutes
after day
36 or 37 to give us adequate time to
look at those things
[Applause]
because we've got rule substitutes now
that are coming out
that we don't have a clue what's in them
until we have time to read them
and and do what we're supposed to do for
this state
um i don't want to see any more rules
substitutes thank you sir
be warned
clerk will read the caption to house
resolution
11 47.
house resolution 1147 by representative
donohue the 30th and others a resolution
urging the president of the united
states to consider the current
geographical tensions and support
policies and take measures
to ensure america's long-term energy of
affordability security leadership and
progress
this resolution have been referred to
the committee on
economic
energy utilities and telecommunications
that committee recommends that this
resolution
be adopted
chair recognizes representative donahoe
to present the resolution
thank you mr speaker
ladies and gentlemen of the house
i bring before house resolution 1147
we're urging the president of the united
states to allow america's long-term
energy affordability
security leadership and progress
including actions that result in the
continued operation of existing oil and
natural gas pipelines the construction
of new pipelines and the end to
restricting on developing our nation's
own short and offshore
national resources
basically every five years we have a
contract where we can lease properties
offshore and onshore this july we will
have that come up to be signed again
this pretty much wears all oil and
natural gas
vital components of our nation's economy
providing more than 11 million jobs
nationwide including 247 000 total jobs
30.8 billion in gross domestic home
income of georgia alone
whereas the world is looking to america
for energy leadership and stability as
current
events pose potential economic
disruptions when inflation already
affects households both in the u.s
across europe
if we remember gas was 1.69 to 1.89 16
months ago
and now you can fill up for about 449.
diesel is somewhere around 529. so all
we're doing is asking for us to be
allowed to use the resources that we
have in georgia and the u.s of a and i
challenge each person here to at least
think about when you go home tonight you
feel your vehicles up
my truck goes 34.9 gallons my bass boat
is 57 so guess what that's about 400
when i go to fill up both of them i'd
sure like to get back down to the
natural but thank you mr speaker i yield
well
all right we have another member that
wish to be heard
and then we have a minority report the
chair recognizes
representative beth moore
to speak to the bill
colleagues i know that today's our last
day in the house including my last day
and so i expect that there will be
accusations of politicking going on in
this well from both sides
there's probably some merit to that
but you know this this resolution came
through the energy utilities and telecom
committee and you know i've so enjoyed
being a member of that committee because
we do really good work in that committee
uh this year we focused on uh you know
on electric vehicle charging stations
we've done a lot of work with solar
energy
the future of energy in america is not
digging up dinosaur bones all right it
is it's in the sun it's in the wind so
for us to get up here and say let's dig
our heels more into oil and gas
is not the look that we want to give the
public here in the georgia house
so i rise in opposition to this house
resolution you know if there was ever an
accusation that the president has a
direct
impact on oil and gas i would say that
person is mistaken and i would say that
no matter whose party held the
presidency
so i ask you to vote no on this and when
i do that i'm also asking you to
remember that this
this assertion that politics is causing
gas prices to go up
let us remember
that the oil and gas companies are
private
for profit companies
they set the gas prices so to say that
oh the president is causing gas prices
to go up congress is causing it
geopolitical politics yeah maybe that
has something to do with it
but it is the ceos
of oil and gas companies that set the
prices so if we're going to urge the
president to do something about it i
thought it might only be fair to ask the
ceos of the oil and gas companies to do
it so while we're here let's call on
david lawler chairman and president of
bp america michael k worth chairman and
ceo of chevron richard moncrief
president ceo of devon energy daryn
woods ceo of exxon scott d sheffield ceo
of pioneer natural resources and
gretchen watkins president of shell usa
they are the ones taking advantage of a
geopolitical conflict to raise gas
prices and then using the whole oh let's
ask the president to do something about
it as a way to distract
from the profiteering
of oil and gas companies in a time of
crisis
so we should urge them
to stop
raising gas prices at a time when
americans
need a little bit of relief
thank you
there also is a minority report on this
measure
is this your last time to speak in the
house or am i just
hoping that
[Applause]
you know i had a member this morning uh
representative that wanted
me to uh
ignore the fact that we don't have to do
immediate transmittals
this today to immediately transmit you
to the state senate
not you
the chair recognizes representative
mclaren for the minority report
thank you mr speaker you know
to to address the chairs question i
think
all of us in here know that we do a lot
better when we let the spirit move us to
speak than when we meticulously go home
and write out speeches a day in advance
so in that spirit mr speaker the house
rules provide for a minority
report which was duly filed on this
resolution in the eut committee and here
we are pursuant to the proper procedure
and process delivering a minority report
in opposition to this resolution which
as you heard the members say is a
political stunt in an election year but
let's talk about the substance of this
resolution using
this minority report to elucidate
why this resolution is being brought
[Applause]
and why it might miss the mark from a
factual standpoint
if you look at line 19 of this
resolution it says
whereas the biden administration
continues to increase costs and delay
efforts to develop oil and natural gas
leasing on federal lands and waters
despite the fact that the program
provides billions of dollars in revenues
to federal state and local governments
and supports
conservation programs throughout the
country i almost hope that my opponent
clips that to make it sound like i said
it because that would be entertaining
but that is the rhetoric that has been
put before the house today the rhetoric
that democrats in opposition committee
moved to amend out of the resolution to
make a bipartisan statement about the
difficulty that americans are facing
with gas prices but that amendment was
rejected ladies and gentlemen why
because we face an election year of
historic proportions in this state where
every single thread of potential
partisan conflict we must grasp onto in
order to make our case to our base
that's going to turn out anyway because
of how polarized the country is and they
don't need one oil and gas resolution to
do that but we're insistent
because we say to our base don't worry
we've got your back not just on one bill
but two bills and five bills and ten
bills and also this resolution and every
issue that's ever polarized you
everything that's ever graced tucker
carlson on fox news at nine o'clock when
you're tired and you don't know what to
hate and so the tv tells you for you
what you need to hate don't worry
because we've got your back
you can hate president biden for his
increasing costs and delaying efforts
well unfortunately facts are a stubborn
thing say some of our favorite
conservative commentators and one of the
facts to consider in this case is that
just days ago in fact probably minutes
before the eut committee passed this
resolution the biden administration
began taking steps to release tens of
millions of barrels of oil in order to
decrease
oil and gas prices because as the member
aptly stated in speaking up in
opposition to the bill
what would you do if you were an oil
company with a de facto cartel over a
global supply
and the price just happened to increase
because of wartime conditions you might
say
i don't know if i'm ready for these
prices to drop just yet
it may be that we want to enjoy an
artificially restricted supply for the
moment
so that we can make a couple bucks while
americans are suffering
and those same oil companies who you
know this resolution says that
regulations are
all poor exxon mobil is like trying to
make it through the day but they can't
because these regulations are like the
brush that they're walking through
disorienting and stinging
but these regulations are not the
problem why because we all know
another fact
that these oil companies are sitting on
millions of least acres of federal land
that they aren't using
they're undeveloped
this is not that they have to develop
new land
because they've already got it
and again if you were an oil company
what would you do would you rush to
start producing on your undeveloped
lands that you're already leasing to
take down your prices
record level profits that you're
enjoying no
what's much easier to do than that blame
the biden administration am i right
i'm right
now with this minority report that is
granted under the rules of the house i
would like to take a quick detour a very
short detour mr speaker into a more
thematic approach to opposition to this
resolution
which is to talk about partisanship and
the usefulness of partisan messaging by
a show of hands nobody's going to raise
their hand but i'm going to use this
device
how many people in here have heard their
voters say republican or democrat
we're tired of the bickering right
we're tired of opposition for the sake
of opposition
that's just meant to inflame partisan
tensions my voters have said that even
my most dedicated liberal voters in the
base
who
want me to vote
left on all the stuff we do there those
same people say to me
i just wish that it weren't so vitriolic
i wish that we weren't constantly
sniffing at each other for nothing
now let me admit something to you
when i first ran for the state house in
2018
i ran because of donald
trump
i went to my primary care physician i
said doc
there's something wrong and i don't know
what it is and they put a stethoscope on
my chest and they used a little thing to
look in my ear
they said say ah
and i was in there for about 20 minutes
and the nurse came back and she said we
have some bad news
it appears you have trump derangement
syndrome
that was a hard day
that was a hard day because you know i
thought maybe it's just me you know
but no it was something that a lot of us
came down with
and so you know actually little known
fact every member of the d17
who
got elected in 2018 the democratic
incoming class we were all
simultaneously gardening
uh
when we found out trump got elected we
were all like different parts of the
garden
and when we found out
is it like two in the morning right when
the results were called
we all looked up in this very dramatic
way towards the sky
we dropped our garden implements in slow
motion
and each of us from the corners of the
state started walking to the state
capitol
all at once
now the reason we did it is because we
were trump deranged
it was very partisan we were explicitly
like this country's going down the tank
this this one guy right this one guy is
the problem
i am going to make a point madam chair i
promise
this one guy is the problem
and
we got here and you guys remember i'm
talking to people in my class do you
remember when we got here and we
realized how much more there was
to state legislative service
to caring about the public caring about
voters and more importantly and i've
spoken to this from the well
relationships
within this body that matter a lot to us
we learned a great deal about how
complex representation is
and how important it is to come together
to put the small stuff away because
ultimately that's what it's about it's
putting the small stuff away and
recognizing that a lot of what we do
here is bipartisan
i have changed a lot as a person since
we got elected in 2018. i have grown to
appreciate perspectives that i would not
have appreciated when i came in when the
whole reason for coming in was like
national politics whatever
i've grown i've changed and i've
recognized that i like being here for
reasons that have nothing to do
with the headlines on cnn and msnbc
so
in a very serious way
the last thing i'll say is
this resolution
you know
is not in that spirit
this resolution is just a quick bite
for an election year and
look maybe we'll do this too right i
mean this is the argument you can always
make so if you guys are in the majority
you do the same thing maybe we will do
this maybe we'll hit a future republican
president and maybe that'll be
appropriate when it happens i don't know
maybe it'll be good maybe it'll be bad
um
but we all know what this is and at the
end of the day whether you think climate
change is real or not whether you have
arguments about energy or not that you
think are you know reasonable people can
disagree about
we're only going to win long term like
we're only going to make it out of this
funk we're in
if we think long and hard about whether
we want to do this and whether it's
worth it
and you may make the judgment today that
it's worth it but in general
remember this is playing with fire
remember that the base voters are going
to respond to the signals we give them
and if we want a happy
state that lives in community with each
other
we got to make sure when we take our
shots we really want to take them okay
i appreciate your time thanks for my
shenanigan for tolerating my shenanigans
love you guys mr speaker yield well
what purpose does representative ridley
rise
parliamentary inquiry inquiry
mr speaker is it not true that my friend
in the well does put on a great show
but from the mountains where we're from
it's just simple if you've got to ship
stuff from halfway around the world it
costs a whole lot more than to get it
here at home is that not true
if you say it is it is
all right
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered
the chair here's none the previous
question is ordered is there any
objection
to agreeing to the report of the
committee which was favorable to the
adoption of the resolution
the chair here is none the report of the
committee has agreed to
shall this resolution now be adopted all
those in favor of the adoption of the
resolution will vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machines
what purpose does chairman parsons rise
parliamentary inquiry inquiry is not
true uh mr speaker that what this is all
about actually
uh is not attacking the president or
anything like that but it's about urging
the president to take certain actions
that he can take
to either do things or undo things that
he's done
that will
allow for more drilling
allow for more exploration without
penalties which he has proposed he's
actually proposed just this past week
penalties on drilling further penalties
for drilling on government lands isn't
it true that's what this is about is
helping the american people people here
in georgia to pay a more reasonable
price for the gasoline is that not true
i
it appears to me to be the language uh
worded that way
it would also strike the chair that
somehow i don't think that they're
holding their breath in washington
waiting on this to get up there
um
any more than they did in the prior
administration hold their breath for
things like this
to get up there but they are interesting
and
give us a diversion from
the legislation that we need to be
working on
having said all that have all members
voted
have all members voted

pdd being able to emit a sound uh by
three x from two feet to six feet we
lower the speed of the robot on a
sidewalk to four miles per hour which is
the average walking speed of an adult it
requires a phone number be attached to
the pdd or the robot so it's answered by

coverage to 250 000 from 100 000 and
