So, like the second day of school here today to have the whole team back on board, we were
encouraged this morning by our majority leader that committees needed to get to work, that
We had a lot of backed up bills from the last year
and that we needed to make good use of our time here.
So we went ahead and called a meeting.
Start off just kind of having a refresher
on one of the subject matters
that we know we're gonna deal with again this year
and that sports betting.
So I thought I might give a little bit of an overview
of what happened last year, the different bills
and their outcomes.
And we really only have one left in the breast
this committee and that Senate bill 172 that deals with sports betting was enabling
legislation for sports betting that I introduced and it was tabled just before crossover day
and was not taken off the table or acted on by the Senate, you know, either yay or
nay. So it got recommitted to our committee yesterday morning along with all the other
bills that had been tabled or that were sitting in rules committee. I made some notes just
sort of thinking back. This feels like it's been a sort of a long process almost. It's
been multiple years we have been dealing with these different gambling issues. This became
kind of a hot issue. I think it was 2019 when the United States Supreme Court struck down
federal law that prohibited sports betting. It actually had carved out an
exception for states that wanted to opt out of that bill and as far as I can
recall it was only Nevada and Oregon that opted out and that's why all the
casinos allowed sports betting out in Las Vegas but that was not permitted
anywhere else in the country. That was challenged by the state of New Jersey
went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that was inappropriate to prevent
certain states from participating in activity and giving others the exclusive domain there.
And so it was thrown back to all the different state legislators to decide whether or not
they wanted to legalize sports betting or not.
And there's been a movement pretty much nationwide since then, as states have considered
this issue, many have now permitted it.
Last count I heard was somewhere between 36 and 38 states
now permit some form of sports betting.
Many are going with the online route,
where you do it on your cell phone or on your computer,
instead of going to a live casino.
Some have only live casinos or sportsbooks where you can go.
Some have a mixture of both.
but we're seeing quite a bit of that.
So last year in the Senate,
there were three different bills that dealt
with sports betting.
One was Senate Bill 57,
that was sponsored by Senator Hickman.
It did not come through this committee.
It went through economic development,
and it passed out.
It provided for both sports betting and horse racing.
And that bill was heard, it got out of that committee, got on the rules calendar, and was defeated on the floor of the Senate.
I think it was 19 votes in favor, and 37 votes against.
And that bill was crafted in such a way that they argued that it did not require a constitutional amendment.
And it did that by defining sports betting as a lottery game that has already permitted
under the lottery corporation.
Unique approach and it failed in the Senate.
A similar bill, it's significantly different, but the same concept attempting to legalize
sports betting without addressing a constitutional amendment is pending in the House.
And I don't believe it's gotten out of committee.
We will see what happens this year.
I got interested in this subject matter.
It's got to be four or five years ago now.
Because I've been active in a group called Nickel G's,
National Conference of Legislators from Gaming States.
And they review and summarize and keep up
today on all different forms of gambling.
That would of course include sports betting now,
but particularly casinos, Indian casinos,
horse racing, lottery, and I had a particular interest
at the time in making certain that the Georgia lottery
had a high enough rate of return or profitability.
It was not returning what we had dictated
by statute that it should, which is 35% of all the bets made.
And it troubled me that that law was being pretty much
disregarded. So I wanted to learn what other states were doing. And I learned that most
of them have very similar statutes that require a particular rate of return. And they average
about 30 to 32%. We were a little bit above the average, but there are a lot of states
that were 35%. At the time, Georgia was returning somewhere between 23 and 25%. We were
talking about revamping the hope scholarship program because it was inadequately
funded and it occurred to me that will heck the money's there if you just don't
give away so much in prizes and advertising and you keep that 35% for profit but
I wanted to get the data so I started attending these meetings of this
organization and in the course of that I learned about quite a few different
types of gaming and as this issue came to the forefront with that Supreme Court
decision I began to learn about it. I had a meeting I think this was four years
ago at the Atlanta Braves offices with not only their personnel but all the
major league sports franchises who were pushing for it. And they're pretty
honest that one of the reasons is this increases viewership. People will pay
attention to games that's not their home team. Or even after the outcome of the game is over,
it's determined you might still have other bets that are proposition bets or live bets that
make you want to keep watching. That increases the TV ratings, which increases, of course, the TV
rights contracts that all of these leagues have been renegotiating and the increases in those
contracts has been exponential.
Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Maverick,
says the value of his franchise has doubled
just since the acceptance of sports betting.
It is that much more lucrative because the interest in the sport
has increased, which means the viewership has,
so the TV rights have increased, and other forms of revenue.
So it is a game changer.
It's really unique to have watched the change over time from the Black Sox scandal, from
Pete Rose being banned from baseball, old folks like Tripp here, Paul Hornig got suspended,
football running back, I mean it was taboo to relate, you know, have any gambling association
with sports and one of the main reasons is because it impacts the integrity of the sport.
If you don't believe it's a pure contest that's being played without one team or the other
shaving points or somehow having a financial benefit from changing the outcome, it's
much less appealing to viewers.
Well, that's changed so much now.
When you watch ESPN down at the bottom line, it's telling you what the betting line is.
What's the spread on a game?
They have on college game day, used to be the bear.
I don't know the new guys name where they, hey, picks his games of the week.
You know, what's the best bets?
What are your super dogs, et cetera?
So times have changed quite a bit.
Some years ago, when I became chairman of this committee was when I was getting intrigued
by this and thinking maybe it was time for us to prove it, but to regulate it.
And I persuaded our lieutenant governor, Bert Jones, to carry the bill because it was coming
before this committee and some of you may remember that the lobbyist in the room, well
we heard that bill thoroughly a couple of times and then I was instructed by leadership
not to vote it out of committee. So we never took action on that. Some years later there
been other versions that have come and so finally last year I introduced Senate Bill 172
is in our folders here today gentlemen ladies and also a constitutional amendment SR 140 and that
was to give constitutional authority for sports betting 172 was the enabling legislation and just before
crossover date SR 140 was presented and it also failed to send it and it had 30 votes in favor of
of that approach and 26 against versus the 19,
four and 37 against for the version
that had no constitutional amendment.
So both of them failed and once that constitutional amendment
failed, we just kind of moved on.
So here we are again, it's just got thrown back to us
and I got the bill and I said, you know, really,
we have spent a couple of years in this committee
thrashing through all the angles, all the pros, all the cons.
I had where we had three different hearings last year.
We had a hearing only on both the CA and the Navy and the legislation on February 16th of
last year, again on February 23rd, and then we passed this bill out on February 28th
out of committee.
And it passed 7-1, by the way, last year.
failed on the floor. I had spent a lot of time and I'm looking at our minority
leader here as I mentioned this trying to generate bipartisan support. I think
when you make a significant public policy change like this that you need to
have buy-in from everybody and all parties need to be at the table so I have the
original blue back to copy from last year. I was the first signer our minority
leader was the second signer. Senator Brendan Beech was the third
signer. Elena Parent was the fourth signer. Carden Summers signed and it went on
and on and we had my friend Senator Harbison signed so it was pretty equal
numbers of Democrats and Republicans that supported this bill. One thing that
we spent a lot of time working out was where would the proceeds go and
And one big advantage of a constitutional amendment is that is the only way that now that we
are permitted to dedicate funds instead of going into the general fund.
And we had worked out a formula that was agreeable to everybody, I think, maybe not Senator
Lucas.
We worked on him.
He was our one no vote.
And I'll tell you why.
We had 50% of the money went to needs-based scholarships, which are not provided for under
our hope scholarship system.
25% went to health care, economic development, mental health treatment in rural areas of
the state and poverty stricken areas of our state, even if they're not rural.
We had 15% that went for problem gaming, both education to prevent it and treatment for
it, because that has become one of my major concerns in this area.
We had 5% that went to innovation educational programs, and 5% to promotion of sports in
the state of Georgia.
And that I think is where I lost you, Senator Lucas, all that we tried to word the language
to give you money to promote that sports hall of Georgia,
football sports hall of fame that you have in making.
We wanted to promote sporting events in our state,
like Final Four for Basketball,
College Football Playoffs, Super Bowls, World Series, et cetera.
So some of that money of that 5% would be spent
for those type of efforts.
In any way, that was done with everybody at the table,
But we didn't get agreement of 38 votes in the Senate,
the two thirds.
And so now we're back to the drawing board
and kind of a Hail Mary pass for me is I'd like to see us look
again at SB 172.
It has not been changed.
No changes other than a little bit
of grammatical corrections by the editors
in the legislative council's office.
And the changing of the name where the lieutenant governor was given certain powers to appoint
people to president of the Senate.
And that's just a drafting preference of legislative counsel's office.
But other than that, this is the exact same bill that we've talked about at Nazim last
year and have voted out of this committee before.
I wanted to talk a little bit about this whole concept of constitutional amendments versus
going around that process.
And I have in your folders committee members a copy of our constitutional provision that
created the lottery.
And I just made a photocopy out of the book.
So that is the area in the Constitution that mentions this is Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph
8.
And it specifically allowed Lotteries and the nonprofit bingo games.
And it told what the money would be spent for.
It created the Lottery Corporation in accordance with this and dedicated its resources to pre-K
programs and hope scholarships, and that program has been wildly successful for our state.
Part of the deal, though, part of the social contract, so to speak, when the voters of
the state of Georgia agreed to have a lottery, there's enough gray hair out here in the
room that remembers that was one of Zell Miller's big sort of ideas, or his agendas, his
initiatives, what his idea to start with, he fought it first and then bought in and
endorsed it and it helped him get elected.
But part of that constitutional amendment allowed the lottery, but at the same time very
specifically prohibited Casino gambling and paramutual betting.
So it made it clear, all right, Georgia voters, we're going to ask you to approve a lottery,
we're going to dedicate the money to education, but to make sure that we're not opening
up the gates wide to all kind of gambling, we're going to make it part of our constitution
that there's not going to be Casino gambling, there's not going to be paramutual horse racing,
is how they take horse racing bets in this state. It did give the lottery a little flexibility,
gave the legislature some flexibility to allow other lottery games. Now, so I would
remind you at that time, there was no sports betting in the state of Georgia or any other
state except Nevada and Oregon. It was illegal under federal law, so there's no way that
was contemplated when the voters allowed our lottery, in my opinion.
There were other states that had lotteries, but the only kind of lottery games that I'm
aware they had other than the draw games, like Mega Millions, Powerball, now Fantasy
5, were the scratch off tickets, and there were no other states that had sports betting
as a lottery game, so I don't believe Georgia voters were approving that at the time
that they voted on the lottery.
Since then, there have been a few people trying to find ways to circumvent that requirement
of a constitutional amendment.
I don't see anything to fear from a constitutional amendment.
I think if you make a policy change like this, it ought to have the buy-in of both parties
and the citizens ought to be on board to do that.
So I embrace that opportunity.
But we were presented last year with an opinion
from Harold Milton, who was previously
on the Supreme Court of Georgia, that said,
you could do this without a constitutional amendment
if the legislature defined it as a lottery game.
I don't see Josh Belafonte in the room.
He may be, he's a back row like the Presbyterians but he wrote a very insightful letter to Senator
Hickman last February that also said it was possible to have sports betting and even horse racing
without a constitutional amendment, a little bit different line of reasoning in his analysis.
I'm sort of paraphrasing slightly here, maybe greatly, that you didn't even necessarily
have to call it a lottery game since it was not Casino gambling and was not paramutual
betting that you could do it without even running it through the lottery.
And that was because Senator Hickman's bill did not use paramutual betting where you
pool your money and divide it up by winners.
his allowed for fixed odds, horse racing bets, as I recall it.
A friend of mine from Athens, John Barrow, Democratic congressman, previously a city councilman
in Athens and a Harvard law graduate scholar, wrote an op-ed and Atlanta paper that said
that's a bunch of bunk, you gotta have a constitutional amendment to have sports gambling.
I think the majority of you lobbyists in the room probably agree with that, some prefer
another way because they don't think they can get two-thirds votes, but I would bet you
I know of the people that have talked to me, the majority of you, I believe that.
Legislative Council's office wrote a letter to Chairman Alan Powell back in 2021 that
analyze this same situation and said it could go either way, basically. In fact, in a clever
phrase at the end said it's a toss of a coin. But the safe play is to do a constitutional
amendment because there will definitely be protracted litigation afterwards contesting
anybody that tries to go forward without a constitutional amendment. And you're spending a lot of
money on these licenses and that's pretty high risk. From my legal analysis, I
agree with the version that this requires a constitutional amendment. I just
think it's a real stretch to call sports betting a lottery game when that was
certainly not the case at the time we created our constitutional
exception to allow lottery and lottery games. So this to me seems to be the
way to go. It is in my opinion legally required. The other huge advantage of it is it allows
you to dedicate funding. If you do it by a constitutional amendment, you can dedicate
where the proceeds, the tax proceeds, the revenues are spent. And otherwise, there's only
a very narrow exception up to 1% of our budget can be dedicated funding. Otherwise, it naturally
that falls into the general fund.
And we may very well discover or decide, agree together that that's the best place for
any gambling proceeds to go is in the general fund and let us do our job in the budgeting
and appropriations process to allocate it where it's most needed.
But we will be allowed to dedicate the funding if we can reach an agreement.
My proposal last year was not agreed upon by two-thirds of the Senate, so we didn't get
there.
I do think the political reality gives us another reason to use a constitutional amendment.
And that is that there are a lot of particularly conservative Republicans that are very hesitant
support gambling because their constituents aren't all in on this.
And it's much easier to say, I will vote to allow the public to have sports betting, although
I personally don't participate in that, more of a libertarian take on it, you know.
Then might go out on a limb and vote for a bill that isn't a company by a constitutional
amendment.
Just legislation, enabling legislation without that.
I really believe the math will prove as we go through this session, and I think last
year's votes did just that, that show there are greater amount of senators that will vote
for a bill if it's predicated on a constitutional amendment.
And I think it's the right thing to do, to let the people aside when you're making a major
policy change.
I do think times changed.
It's obvious that this is very popular around the country.
But I've also learned that if we're going to do this, we need to do it right.
We are seeing as states have allowed this, one thing is the revenue is not nearly as great
as projected by the proponents of these bills.
I think in my opinion, you're probably going to be closer to the 50 to 75 million range
of revenue to the state of Georgia.
an insignificant amount of money, but when you're getting about 1.2 billion from the lottery,
it is a drop in the bucket comparatively.
And that's one reason why this money was not dedicated in this enabling legislation to
the hope scholarships because they are well funded at this point, and this is not significant
enough to move that needle.
I don't know how that will change in the future,
whether those revenues will grow or not,
but it's relatively limited.
And when you're at a time of $16 billion in reserves,
that is not to me appropriate motivation
to be pursuing this legislation.
If we're going to do it, I do want us to do it right.
And I think we need our job as a legislator
is to set the regulatory framework, the rules,
the guardrails if you please, the protections for the public, and most importantly, I think
we need to deal with the potential for problem gaming.
That's the other thing we've learned through these other states experiments in this area.
The revenue is not nearly as significant as dreamed and hoped for, but there is a drastic
significant increase in problem gaming or addictive gambling.
And for some reason, that is the younger males are particularly susceptible to that.
The 18 to 35-year-old males are the highest incidence of gambling addictions.
And that is destructive.
All right, I see an under 35 that you've got your laptop.
Are you placing a bet now?
I mean, you know what I'm saying, don't you?
Okay, here we go.
I wasn't necessarily planning on taking testimony today,
but we've heard so much, but I'm happy to,
if you want to tell us about it, by name.
Let's talk about a little bit,
a brief refresher of Senate Bill 172.
We do have a new number on it,
LC number, although it is the same bill.
It is LC-36-5642S that we are considering today.
And it does a number of things.
I am going to pass the gavel at this point
to my vice chairman, chairman Summers.
Could you write it?
It could be rough here.
Since I will be, yeah, I'm a little nervous
whenever I do this, so that I can present the bill
before I do so I'd like to say if are there any committee members I know my
friend senator lucas may have a comment what's your number there buddy
yes miss jimin I thought that we had worked out that the part of the
procedure would go to the sports hall of a we did you and I did and our colleagues
did not accept our proposal well I you and our colleagues but one
Codley, son of the beach, it's one is stubborn, well, and opposed it with everything that
was in it.
I do agree with you, though, a constitutional amendment, if we put it on the ballot, the
people will pass it.
The problem is getting it on the ballot.
The other reason on the amendment is that if it's constitutional amendment, the governor
can't veto it as he did when we changed the law to put funds in the ballot.
in the Georgia budget for the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame
and Eli and I had them be told it.
And so we've been dealing with that.
That sports hall of fame and making it's not a local
hall of fame, it is a statewide hall of fame.
And it's the largest in the country.
So consequently, we have bills that affect that thing.
It's basically HVAC all doing it.
But I didn't vote against it.
I voted with you because that language
was was put in for this for something and I'll continue my
support of that as you know I'm a making boy that I visited that
sports museum and I think it's a treasure for the state and it's worthy of
expenditure of state money and I'll continue helping you do that
and the way I envision this is that I know and Senator Somers may have something
to say he has shared with me that he intends to introduce a proposed
Constitutional Amendment this year. Senator Beech has also indicated he intends to do so.
I intend to try to rework mine that failed to see if we can find the magic potion
that would apply only to sports betting. We have some days to do that but since this one's
before us I thought we might as well deal with it first. I will say, I mean if you look to the
the very end starting at line 15-16.
This is a 61-page bill, so it's very comprehensive
that it makes it clear at starting really down at 15-20
that this is contingent upon a constitutional amendment
being passed, right?
And if a one does not, this will be automatically
repealed upon the failure of a constitutional amendment.
So even though we don't know the details
of the constitutional amendment yet,
We know that we have to agree on one
and the voters have to approve it
before this becomes a law.
Fair enough.
Okay.
Anybody else, did you have a comment?
Box Chairman.
Anybody else on the committee have any general thoughts
or overviews or ideas?
Senator Harbison.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I just want to say a few words about,
and you mentioned you're very thorough
and I appreciate you as usual,
you're very thorough in your explanation of it.
And I just want to express the concern that a lot of people
have about look cautionary or concerned about when we
pass these kinds of bills that we ring up.
We try to bring out earmarks and things
to certain programs, including the sports museum
and things like that.
And even kindergarten and looking for moneys like that
and looking for moneys like we had headed in the direction
when we came up with a lottery in the first place.
It was a flat out, need-based scholarship program.
It was, and it was earmarked, and hopefully we'll come up
when we come up with a constitutional amendment.
It will have our concerns in there about pre-K,
technology, deserts, and we can, I think we can do
of those kinds of things, as you mentioned in the Constitution amendment, I just want
to let you know that we have those kinds of concerns in there.
And I know, I think you've been very, very thorough, but in that little area, I think we've
just sort of, we want to do the casual thing, as opposed to putting it into law.
And I understand we can't do it unless it has that Constitution amendment, but I just
want to sound their alarm about the fact that we're feeling the need to have something
done earmarked towards those projects that we mentioned that passed over and over again.
Sports of the pre-Kindergaard programs and some of the programs that we've we've
had numerated from the from our leader all the way down to yeah and and it's a
big need there real hospital account just some things I think we can take
care of not being crazy broad but I'm just saying that we need to say took a
a look at some of those things.
You're preaching to the choir.
There's them.
Okay.
I agree with you completely on that, and I think that's an advantage of the constitutional
amendment process.
That's the only way we can sort of lock in those earmarks as you've called them or dedicated
funding what I call it.
And those are the areas that are calling out for help.
So I'll continue to work with you as we try to get to that point in the game if we can
and reach a consensus of two-thirds of our membership
to agree to one formula or another.
So what this does is a few things,
I'm gonna actually change chairs with you,
Chairman Summers, so that you can preside
and I'll be sort of lay out the bill.
Thank you, John.
Seven?
Okay, so brief overview and I'm not going to go line by line because I really feel like we've talked about this quite a bit already.
In fact, I presented it from the floor of the Senate already as well as us having those three meetings in here last year and multiple meetings before.
And y'all are such loyal committee members.
We have a lot of continuity on this committee that they're not a lot of turnover.
So I think most people know it, but I'm certainly willing to answer any questions.
I'm going to give you the overview.
Number one, it does allow sports betting, which is not presently allowed under Georgia law
under any circumstances, whether it's a constitutional memo or any other type
of legislation that is prohibited now.
And it allows it in two formats.
One is the online applications or really any computer terminal, iPad, telephone,
that's a smartphone, et cetera, that can connect to a sports betting platform and make a bet,
as well as any remote terminals, some call those kiosks.
If you are any gamblers, they've been to Las Vegas and the sports books out there,
they have little, look like little ATM machines where you can go up and type in your bet
and put in your money and place the bet.
Sometimes those sportsbooks in Vegas will have a counter with live humans taking bets
behind it too and also have the terminals where people can make bets where they don't feel
as pressure or maybe it's not as long of a line or feel a little more private or whatever.
I think those sportsbooks, you know, like that because it takes less personnel from their
standpoint to accept the bets. But this permits either format electronically to be placing bets.
So if the Atlanta Braves or the Falcons wanted to have a sportsbook in their stadium and
many pro stadiums do now in other states, then you could go up and place your bets at
the game if you wanted to or you could have terminals either at a sportsbook or perhaps
even in a sports bar if it was licensed to accept those bets.
In order to regulate this, it sets up the Georgia Gaming Corporation that will be made
up of seven members, three appointed by the Governor, two by the Speaker of the House,
and two by the President of the Senate.
Those seven individuals will select an executive director to run the Georgia Gaming Corporation.
It also creates a identical Georgia sports betting commission to supervise and regulate
this entire program.
It's the same people in both the gaming corporation and the sports betting corporation because
that's the only type of gaming that will be allowed under this enabling legislation.
I see Chairman Stevens from the House here with us and I think he and I have a similar
vision in the event, the legislature and the people of Georgia were to want to expand
gambling beyond just sports betting.
It would be very easy to then set up a horse racing commission and a casino gambling
commission as well that would all be under the umbrella of the Georgia gaming corporation.
But this bill is only dealing with sports betting so it sets up a Georgia sports betting
commission.
That commission would then be empowered to issue licenses to people that wanted to provide
sports betting, to bookmakers, so to speak, as well as equipment manufacturers and whatnot.
It provides that there will be at least six licenses granted and it guarantees that the
lottery corporation, if they want to, is entitled to one of those licenses.
So the lottery could serve as one of the providers, one of the licensees to offer sports betting
through their marketing apparatus if they elected and wanted to do that.
And then the others, that could be, there's no limit, but there'd be at least six to allow
fair competition of the different vendors or people that would like to engage in this.
I'd like to see it encourage citizens of Georgia to be providing these betting platforms
not just Las Vegas, and this encourages that.
It also then sets up for the taxation of the revenues, the profits generated from sports
betting has two rates, and I'll tell you why, generally speaking, it would be 20 percent
of the net revenues from gambling activities.
But it would be 25% for certain types of bets
that are very high profit areas for the bookmakers.
And those are parlay bets.
May some of you may remember the old parlay cards
back in the day where you pick a number of teams
and you gotta get them all to win your bet
and they pay higher multiples than just the amount
you bet, they're harder to win, they're more profitable to the bookmaker.
Or proposition bets, which have become very popular as to some outcomes of events within
a game, not just the outcome of a game.
For example, how many yards is a certain running back going to get?
How many receptions is a quarterback going to throw?
Will there be a punt return for a TD?
I mean, you can come up with innumerable proposition bets
that are difficult to win.
They have a higher profit margin for the bookmakers.
And the most recent sort of development in betting
is what's known as live betting, where
there are new bets that are created during the course
of the game.
You know, whether a team's going to make a first down,
this set of downs.
The point spread changes as the game goes.
You may be betting on a baseball game
and you're getting one and a half runs for your team
and they're already losing by four runs.
Well, why not just turn off the TV and go home?
Well, you could start a new bet
that what's gonna happen for the duration of the game.
And you can come up with a million permutations of that,
but those type of live bets,
they keep betters engaged in the game betting
as they're watching the game
or high-profit for the bookmakers,
and so those type of bets,
parlay's propositions and live bets
will be taxed at 25%.
There are also quite a few provisions in this bill
for the protection of bettors.
And that's what we ought to be doing as regulators
is making certain that citizens don't get fleeced
in this whole operation.
You always laugh when they call those slot machines,
one arm bandits back in the way, the day.
You know, now they don't even have a thing to pull,
but that's because they're robbing you of your money.
They're the bandit.
You're the victim, voluntary, many times,
but anyways, in this case, we wanna make sure
if you go place a bet and it's somebody that's been licensed
under our sports betting commission,
they're gonna pay that bet off.
And so they're required to keep certain reserves here
to make sure that they have kept enough liquid reserves
to pay all the bets that they've taken in.
And they have to have a minimum of 500,000 in reserves
or bond in that amount.
We also require them to pay within a certain amount of time.
We require them to use official data
as to the matters that you're betting on.
Everybody can figure out what the score is,
but how do you know exactly how many yards
Herschel Walker got in that ballgame?
Somebody has to be keeping track of that.
And so these bookmakers are required to use either official league data that's provided
by the sports leagues or other official data that's been approved by the regulatory commission.
There are a number of provisions that are to protect betters and I can kind of just,
let me see my copy there.
I can direct you to some lines in particular.
I started line 418 on page 17
where it starts listing a number of things,
really starts at line 420 that the commission must do.
I'm gonna just read a few of these
because this Nickel G's organization,
I talked about came up with some rules or procedures
Those are procedures or principles I think they call it a responsible gaming, responsible
sports betting that were approved by this nationwide organization and encouraged for each
state to incorporate and I've incorporated all of them here.
I was told by folks last year some of you may remember that came, they actually spoke
against the bill.
They came to say how terrible gambling was but how this bill of all the ones they had
scene had the most protections against problem gaming and addictive gambling.
So it requires the commission to establish and administer programs to assist compulsive
or probably problem gamers, including educational information to teach people about making smart
bets, so to speak, and what their odds are, the likelihood of winning bets are losing,
they'll basically know are they making a sucker bet or not? If they are at
least let them do it knowingly, don't take advantage of them. To have programs
to educate folks of warning signs of problem or compulsive gambling and to do
things to prevent or treat the problem or compulsive gambling. To develop and
fund responsible gaming education campaigns coupled with prevention and
educational efforts within communities that raise the awareness of the
potential signs or risk factors of problem or compulsive gambling.
To encourage the use of harm minimizing measures by better such as excluding yourself from
gambling if you know you have a problem you can ask them the platform don't take any
more bets from me or limit the amount of bets that I can take.
We also ask for rules and regulations for betters to cool off self-limit or self-exclude
themselves from gaming activities.
And we won't statewide advertising guidelines to ensure that the marketing of sports betting
is not targeted at minors.
As I mentioned earlier, young people, particularly males, are very susceptible to compulsive gambling.
And we don't want any marketing that has a special appeal to problem or compulsive
gamblers.
We also, like most states have, you'll see the dial 1-800, whatever, I got a gambling
problem number, to make those type of helplines available and highly visible, and finally,
to promulgate rules or regulations to limit the amount of bets a better can place if they
have exhibited signs of problem or compulsive gambling.
It is incredible what we can do with the technology these days, with the data that's accumulated,
gathered on you, but if you are placing bets and they are now being tracked, it's easy
for the bet makers, the book makers that are taking your bets to know who's betting
more than they can afford to or more frequently, who's chasing their losses, who's making
a bunch of dumb bets and losing more money than they need to be, and shoot them a warning
sign to tell them you're exhibiting signs of problems, but you might, we're going to
to have to cut you off for a while.
So there's no whatever there is.
I want that to be part of anything we do.
I'd like it to be a constitutional amendment that
dedicates some money to fund those programs.
But this is going to be required if you pass this enabling
legislation, whatever the terms of a final constitutional
amendment might be.
If I could figure a way to put that in here and require
those things to be funded, I would.
And if anybody else has ideas, I'm
perceptive to any kind of amendments that might do that.
There are prohibitions about any criminals, people with bad records, bad histories, and
being in this business getting licensed or to take away their licenses in here.
There are pretty thorough regulations here in this bill.
I don't know you guys don't want to hear 61 pages lined by line.
If you do let me know, I think I'll stop here, Mr. Chairman.
You're pretty good.
Take any questions that there might be.
Well, he was extremely thorough there.
Senator Calder, any questions from the committee on this bill here?
What number you got?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman, Calder, you are probably the most thorough and well-researched presenter.
We have the entire General Assembly, so thank you for your hard work.
As I refamiliarize myself with this bill because it's been some time since we did it.
If you could just help me, do we have anywhere we're actually defining net revenue as well
as adjusted gross income and those might be standard accounting terms, I just want to
make sure that they're not being used to game the system.
We do let me flip my pages and I'll be able to point you to it.
I can tell you what we basically do in figuring out your taxes so we take the amount of revenue
received as bets, subtract from that federal taxes and the remainder is what's tax.
We are taxing gross revenue not net.
So if your question goes back to, are they able to subtract out marketing costs and
pre-bees and giveaways and comps to heavy gamblers and no?
I can find that point if you give me one more second, it's under the...
No, that's fine.
And I guess to even simplify it further, we would almost like to see it as whatever the
cost of the bet is period to eliminate any confusion.
I think it's a lot easier math for people to digest if the bet's going to be $10.
First, the state is going to take X percent of it, and that's clean and easy, and it's
up to an individual business to figure out their map on the scenes what makes their business
run.
Again, just in an effort to simplify, and I think that might be better.
Of course, AGI is defined a little bit differently from standard accounting terms, and I see
that there's the difference between the two, and I understand you're logic.
However, I think again, in the case of simplifying it, I think from the state's perspective,
that might be easier for people to understand.
Can you help me on that?
John Marie, do you have the site to the place?
I saw it somewhere.
Where is it?
He wants to know what it is to sit.
He wants to know what it is.
Starting old 95, right?
Yeah.
Page five.
Just the gross income means total of all monies actually paid to a licensee as bets minus
federal excess taxes and minus the total amount actually paid out to winning bettors over
a specified period of time.
and that's what the tax has applied to that of gross,
just a gross income.
Not, I mean, that's our definition of it not.
I know what your referencing accounting terms
how that can be, you know, net can be a lot lower for sure.
So I'll continue on another question if I can, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman, as far as the percentages are concerned,
how does that relate?
I remember us looking, I think it was either day 39 or day 40
when we had this on the floor.
We had a spreadsheet we were sharing around that had what other states had for percentages.
Do you know at this time, because I'm sure some have come online since we looked at this
last of where that would rank us?
Above the median.
And there are states significantly less that are 13%, there are some that are higher.
My thinking in setting this tax rate was, what do we get from the lottery?
And the lottery is now generating a profit of somewhere between 25 and 27 percent.
So they have edged up over the years closer to the 35 percent we mandate.
I didn't want this type of revenue to cannibalize lottery sales profits.
people that elected to put their betting money
on sports betting instead of lottery tickets
is staking them make as much or less money.
And so I was trying to get it at least as close
as I could to the average that we receive
essentially in tax money from the lottery.
It's close, it could be higher.
But like I said earlier, this is not as profitable
as you might think for the bookmakers.
if they were betting just straight bets, winner lose.
Point spread is seven.
You bet for Michigan, I bet for Washington or whatever.
One of us wins and wins the amount we bet it.
Say we've both bet $100.
You bet $100, you win your 100.
It cost me 110.
So I had to bet 110.
And so that 10 is their profit.
But they only made it off of me, not off of you.
So they're really only profiting 5%.
You can do your math on that if they're taking in, you know, $1 million in bets, they're
making $50,000 and then we're taxing that at this 20 or 25 percent rate.
Thank you.
And one final question if I could, this may be actually to your constitutional amendment.
For the dedicated funds, certainly, I think you've been so thoughtful in putting together
or the dedicated dollars to those who might be directly
impact, who have a gambling problem,
who we need to make sure we don't cause more harm to sight.
Even though in principle, I don't have a problem with it.
I think the other part that I do have a concern with
is we're constantly trying to pick different folks,
to buy their support and their vote for any particular change.
I personally would like you to maybe consider
as you're going through this all going back
to the hope scholarship, just like we have everything
today, which funds the very successful hope in our pre-K programs, and I think that success
has been there in a time that we are having a bit of a childcare crisis, if you will.
We need more funding there than ever, so just something I would ask for your considerations
before just to help simplify that as well.
Well, I can answer that by telling you this, unless there is a constitutional amendment that
specifically dedicates funding, any tax proceeds from this enabling legislation will
go to the general fund and it's up to you and your colleagues on
Appropriations Committee how to allocate how to appropriate that money which
would include if you wanted to hope scholarships you're not required to if
if the lottery corporation exercises it right it's right to have one of
these licenses their proceeds will have to go to lottery in pre-K I mean to
hope in pre-K but but you raise a great point that that's okay other states
It's envious for our Hope Scholarship Program where we have affordable, accessible college
education, everybody.
Some of us over here believe we can make it better by having the needs-based component
as well for those that still make good enough grades to get in college, but maybe not
quite enough to qualify for the hope.
But it's up to the legislature and I have in each of the proposals I've dealt with over
years have been different negotiations to try to get a coalition of 38 boats, and I'm flexible.
Anybody else have questions for the author?
Yeah, I got one.
One of your eight number eight.
So, would you still do the dedication to the sports hall of fame?
You bet.
I.
You got my vote.
Whatever you think.
Whatever you think.
Whatever you think.
I'm sorry to get.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I was curious from the author.
I know we see a lot of different legislation.
You always have usually some group.
I was curious for the author.
I know we see a lot of different legislation.
You always have usually some group
that's pushing legislation and the kind of things here.
I was curious, who's pushing this particular style
or format on the way that you've got this set up?
Because for me, other than that Senator Lucas said,
but I'm just looking at it from a standpoint of,
standpoint of you know we've had people pushing the horse racing and everything else and this is kind of a unique blend
Can you expound on that a little bit for me? I'm glad to
This might be a unique product
Essentially hand wrote this bill, you know not
virtually I'm good at plagiarizing I
reviewed
sports betting legislation of every state that had it, at least two years ago, and I picked and
chose the parts that I thought made the most sense. It spent quite a lot of time with
Choirmary there and legislative council's office walking through my
concept of what I thought worked. I
Heard many many pitches from lots of different lobbyists representing lots of different gambling interest and
and some of them persuaded me on parts of their ideas
and some of my flatly rejected.
I probably got two thirds of the room mad at me.
That's out here lobbying for that
because they didn't get their way on certain things
and I probably got another two thirds of them.
They're pretty happy with the outcome of this
and think it maybe is a good blend,
but it's not model legislation from anywhere.
anywhere and it is not something that was handed to me from one gambling interest
or another that I edited off of. It's from a malgommation of many many bills
from different countries, different states around the country as well as
different versions of gambling legislation that has been introduced in
Georgia over the last five years. I think I picked the best pieces but
Listen, I have been in this system for a long time.
I have learned that our system is great.
You can always perfect something.
My feelings, I've got a real thick skin.
If you got a way to perfect it, have at it.
Especially if you can do more to bulk up problem gaming
protections.
And if we get through the house, chairman Stevens,
if you guys see some things that can make it better,
bring it on, we'll see what works.
I sat up one night literally a couple years ago tell about 230 in the morning and
I was with my legal pad and pen was putting down the provisions that I wanted to
make sure we're in it the next morning I met with Sean Marie she'll remember
this I probably make sure you might have broken some room or something for all I
know but what do we call the new dining hall over there y'all got a name for it by
L.O.B.
What's it?
No, that Mullis is where you work it off.
Y'all know what I'm talking about.
She met me at a little table over there.
Blereye, she, I think, had pulled it all night or two and I said, okay, here's what I'm
trying to do.
Can you put this together with that together and then she said, you know, I just had stacks
of papers and she put it together and made it work and this is much improved since that
version.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let me reiterate before we talk about taking this off of the table, it without a
The CA, all these 62 pages, is a moot point, basically.
We're not going anywhere with it without a CA.
So we're going to move it off the table here.
The day we'll get the community to write
and move it off the table, it'll go back to us,
and he will have to work on a CA.
As Mr. Chairman, as Chairman mentioned, I have a CA
that I'm going to be presenting to the Senate Committee
and Senator Bennett Beech has a CA.
He's going to be presenting to the Senate Committee
in regards to a constitutional amendment to allow gaming
or to remove the prohibition of gaming in Georgia.
That's where we are, and this will come into play
if we can get those CAs across the table.
So, what is the pleasure of the board?
I have a motion to do pass.
I have a second on that motion.
All in favor, we're gonna have a show hanging.
All in favor of moving this legislation off the table?
I thought you already did that.
The discussion usually happens after a motion.
you already been discussing. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to say I will vote
to pass it forward, but I have asked our formally Senate research to get us a current analysis of
all the states for all the states and what their current percentages as well as what they are
basing that percentage offer. That's right. Make sure that the terminologies there. So in
deference to the chairman for the great work that he has put into this, and I think it's very
thorough but it is an answer that I do want to see before we vote on this and the
four. You want to kill it? I want to kill it. I vote against it. Let's go back over
this one more time. It's not sure if we get this thing right. We are voting
on Senate Substitute Bill 172 LC 365 642S one more time. What is the
It's a pleasure to board.
Hello, session.
All right.
What are you to?
The motion is just to take it off.
The motion is to pass the bill to move it to.
I thought it was a motion to take it off the table.
Was it never on the table?
It was not on the table.
It's not on the table.
It's been on the table.
So the motion is to do pass, not take it off the table.
Motion is to do pass.
without a corresponding CA. Exactly. And I'll re-enter it again. Without a CA, the bill goes nowhere.
Choice is choice. Any more discussion on this bill? You want to move to table this bill.
Well, you don't have a CA, and for me, that's kind of like the one darts in the dark.
I didn't make the motion, but I said I wouldn't make the motion.
That comment I have made the exact opposite argument many times that I didn't want to, you know, I thought to see it.
I mean the enabling should be voted on first so the children to voters would know what it is
they're voting on when they they pass the CA and the same thing would be with us but they are
most definitely interrelated and that's why this does not become effective unless the CA passes.
I agree they're interrelated which is why I think they should be looked at together.
I've only been, this is only my sixth session, but I've never seen a CA presented without,
I'm voted out without enabling legislation on this topic or another.
I mean, there's a deal made here for funding for something, and I think without that bill
being before us, I think it, I think it would be worthwhile for the committee to consider
both of us together.
We did a lot of, we did enabling legislation prior to, before we did the Constitution of
that man. Well, the judge did a lot of it.
Senator Luke's, I was not here. I referred that to Senator
Calzer. I'm open, not that old.
How was I here, sir?
We don't want to lose it.
We don't want to lose it. We don't want to lose it.
You
All the discussion, I think we can figure out, I'm going to call the question one more
time.
This is a motion to do pass.
What is the pleasure of the board?
You're right, Madam Leader, Miss Leader, moved to do pass by Senator Lucas, now I have a second.
No.
I'll second it.
OK, so we have a motion in a second.
All those in favor of passing this bill raise your right hand.
Well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight.
Motion has passed.
All those nose?
I mean, you can put it out there.
We already know, right?
But you need to take the nose.
Oh, we'll count you.
Minority leader?
No.
Serred again?
Nice one.
All right.
Motion passed I mean before y'all got you
No, I don't want it
I don't want to do it. I've never voted on one of these read about this
So anyway
Any more business come for the board
Any more business come anybody got an announcement hold on I got one announcement before you adjourn to sir mr. Chairman
We are gonna have committee dinner
at the 57th Fighter Group where we had last year is going to be on Tuesday, January 23rd
when we get back from budgets.
So anybody interested in helping sponsor come see Cindy, everybody save that date on
your calendars, January 23rd.
Thank you.
If there's no more business coming forward aboard, we are adjourned.
