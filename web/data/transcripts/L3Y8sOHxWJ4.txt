Before the representative introduces the chaplain of the day, I want to remind you all and form you that representative Tish Nagise is at ICU in Piedmont Hospital. She had a kidney stone removed and is not doing so great after surgery. So our prayers should be with the representative. No, let you know. The representative glazes husband is undergoing a medical procedure this morning. Let's make sure we keep both of these families, these individuals and our thoughts and our prayers. As is our custom, we will begin our day with script reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 141st House District, represented Carolyn Hugley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To ladies and gentlemen of the House, I have the honor this morning of introducing our chaplain of the day. And she is the state chaplain of Delta Sigma Theta Sororgy Incorporated. She has with her today her daughter, Tiara Magroup, and let's greet her. Stand to your and let us greet you. Angela's Patty Rose Magroup attended Jackson State University where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. She also holds a Master of Science in Mental Health counseling and a graduate certificate in nonprofit management, both attained from Walden University. She is a licensed associate professional counselor. She is currently employed as the residential program director at Elts at Moore Incorporated in Conjures, Georgia. And this is a residential facility for girls, age 12 to 21, who are in foster care and provides mental health counseling to individuals and families and groups at Interlink counseling. Patty Magroup is a member of the Watercore Community Church of God in Christ in Decatur, Georgia. And she is a jurisdictional marshal for the Georgia Cosmotolitan Fellowship of Churches. In addition to her membership in Delta Sigma Theta Sororgy Incorporated, she is also the second vice president of the New York chapter of top ladies of distinction. She takes great pride in her personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Her role as a wife to her husband Terry of 27 years and of course she loves being mother to her two children. So you've already met Tiara and she also has another son, she has a son, Trey, who is a junior at Jackson State University. So greet her warmly as she comes, Evangelist Patty Magroup. Good morning. To the speaker John Burns, to representative Carolyn Eugley, to the general assembly, and to my senator, Tonya Anderson, and my representative, Doreen Carter. And to my sororors, the dynamic, distinguished, and devastating ladies of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated. I am humbled and honored to be here today. Luke chapter 12 verse 48b says, for unto whom much is given of him shall much be required, and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more. But I'd like the message Bible translation. It says, great gifts, great responsibilities, greater gifts, greater responsibilities. This message is not only to the assembly, but it is to each and every one of us that is in this room today. We, you, the assembly, have been blessed, afforded and chosen with this awesome opportunity to represent and serve the citizens of the state of Georgia. Upon assuming this role and taking the oath to serve came great responsibility. What are those responsibilities you may ask? Well, I'm glad you did. I know that you're looking at me and saying probably saying, I know my responsibilities. I'm aware of what it is that I'm supposed to be doing what I was elected to do. But let me just share these three points with you. The first responsibility is to listen. In James 1 in 19, we are in monash to be quick to hear and slow to speak. Listen to understand with the intent not to answer or to rebut. Solomon had managed us in Proverbs 4 and 7. Wisdom is the principal thing, but in all thy getting, get an understanding. Listen to understand your constituents. Listen to understand the events and the experiences in their lives that have shaped their perspective. Listen to the issues that they feel passionate about. Listen with an open mind to those across the hours and those who may have differing views than you. This will help you to arrive at the best decision for all citizens of the state of Georgia. Listen to understand with the unique needs of the citizens in rural South Georgia to the urban streets of Atlanta, to the suburban streets of Brookhaven, although they may not be your constituents. Your second responsibility is to leave a legacy. Proverbs 13 and 22 says, a good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children. So the decisions that you are deliberating and making today are not just about you and me, not about my children, but children afar off. As you deliberate and pass legislation, remember that they have a lasting impact on generations to come. Leave a legacy of passing legislation to provide a strong educational system that includes safe schools, a legacy of affordable health care and medical access to all Georgians. A strong infrastructure, laws on gun control, laws against hate crimes, racial profiling and police brutality, and a legacy of protecting the voting rights for all citizens. Leave a legacy that funds mental health care for Georgians and ensure that our most vulnerable population are children that are in foster care and the elderly are properly funded and cared for. Leave a legacy of passing legislation for a livable wage. Leave a legacy of fair and impartial policies that will be impactful and felt from doctin to Savannah, from Albany to Lagrange. Leave a legacy of a good name. Proverbs 21 and 1 says, a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches. Leave a legacy so that when your name is mentioned in these hollow halls, it is associated with good and one that has effectuated change for all Georgians. And finally, the third responsibility is to simply lead with love, the Christlike love in which the Bible says that by this will all men know that you are his disciples. It is your love one for another. That compelling love that will compel us to take on the causes of others in C.B. John, gender, race, creed, color, religion, and sexual orientation to ensure that all Georgians have a voice. The kind of love and compassion that will provide adequate housing and resources to the homeless population. After all, Jesus is love and said to us what you do to the least you do unto him. Then put your love in action. What does it mean to put love in action? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said this. Love and action is doing the right thing at the right time. In the right spirit completely given over to a power that is beyond our own. Even and perhaps most especially when the risks are very great. The risks today are as great as they have ever been. Now is the time to take that much that you have been entrusted with and to work cooperatively with one another and love leading us all to a better Georgia. Let us pray. Oh gracious and eternal God, we thank you for this day because this is the day that you have made and we choose to rejoice in it and be glad. We thank you for the multitude of blessings that you have bestowed upon us. We are grateful that we live in a country where we are free to practice and express our religious and political beliefs without persecution. God it is in you that we trust and recognize that we can do nothing of and in ourselves and our own strength. We ask today that you will look upon us and have mercy on us according to your tender mercies. We ask that you bless and keep every representative and senator, protect them and give them courage, wisdom and strength to lead. I pray that as they serve and have undertaken this great task that you will provide for them and their families. We pray today that unity will prevail and Godly love will be exemplified by every member. We pray that the legislation that is deliberated on and passed will be fair and equitable for all citizens and resources and revenues equitably distributed. I pray that the members will not lean to their own understanding but in all their ways acknowledge you and allow you to direct their past, speech and actions. I pray today that every need in this house will be met because you are Georgia, Georgia, and the God that provides for us. Today shines a lot of your presence upon this general assembly. As they wrestle with complexity, show them the way. Lord you promise wisdom to all who simply ask of it. Remind them of your mission to bring deliverance to captives and liberty to the rules. May our lawmakers focus on pleasing you and not on political consequences. Give them contrite and humble spirits. Teach them new and creative ways to cooperate with one another for a common good. May they honor your name and their thoughts, words and actions. Provide them with compassion for the poor and helpless and use them to rescue the perishing. I pray today that a spirit of peace and oneness will permeate throughout this place and that even in the toughest of times that we will each remember that you are a God of love and compassion and not the author of confusion. It is in the matchless name of Jesus Christ I pray, amen. Please join me in the pledge. May the United States of America and the Republic for which it stands one nation under the high. It is invisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. That was strong. Thank you. That was strong. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Leave them unlocked and members may take photos with the chaplain in the south any room. What a great message. Thank you. The three ails. I did it. That was a good one. Thank you.

Chair recognizes chairman Tarvan the chair of the committee on information and audits. Mr. Speaker your committee on information and audits has read the journal the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. Mr. Speaker I was reminded today that courage is what it takes to stand up and speak but courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. That's very profound. Mr. Chairman I think listening goes a long long ways.

Chairman Dipsy, she made her way to the chamber. There she is, Chairman Dipsy is recognized to introduce our position of the day. Good morning and thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my honor to introduce you all today. We have a great doctor here at the Capitol. He's my friend and the friend of many of us from Floyd County, Dr. Brad Bushnell. He was raised in a sweet place, Athens, Georgia, graduating as the valedictorian of Clark Central High School and majoring in religious studies at Vanderbilt University, graduated with the highest of honors and is fluent in Spanish having studied at the University of Madrid in Spain while in college. He received his medical degree at the Medical College of Georgia where he was president of Alpha, Omega Alpha, a medical honor society, completing an internship in general surgery and a residency in orthopedic surgery. He served at the University of North Carolina hospitals in Chapel Hill where he began his huge love of sports medicine actually. Along history they are caring for the athletes there, the Tar Heels. He went on to do many, many other places where he has worked with the programs from the Colorado Rockies, the Denver Broncos. Also serving as team physician for the Barry College Vikings, the Roam Braves, the Tri-On High School Bulldogs and the SWAT team as well as our reserve sheriff's deputy program in Roam and Floyd County. He is a great man who has invested well in Roam, gives much of his heart, shares his generous gifts of time and talent with many. Today, if anything is hurting you, the least little bit in any of your joints, if your knees are your ankles or your shoulders, it's a great day to walk downstairs and introduce yourself to Dr. Bushnell who is just now coming on the floor. So if y'all would please give him a great welcome. I'm hurting all over already, but come on. So one more thing. I'll give you one more great thing that I was trying to move through, not only is he such a caring physician for athletes, he himself is also a great athlete. He's an accomplished triathlete having completed 52 triathlons, including two full Iron Man and 14 half Iron Distance races. Avid. Avid in his athletic ability, generous in his gifts, and in his love of our hometown, Roam and Floyd County. Dr. Bushnell, welcome. Thank you for your service. Would you like to say a word? It was funny. We were just coming across from the Senate and I saw Katie talking. I thought, man, that sounds pretty cool. I wonder who she's talking about. I guess it was me. But I just want to thank everyone here. I'll tell you the same thing I said over in the Senate chamber. I've been doctor of the day many times and ironically, I was doctor of the day here exactly three years ago. My son was a Senate page and he had a trip coming up that summer and it was an exchange program to Japan. And we wondered if the regional virus in Asia might delay his trip a little bit. Little do we know that three years later, that regional virus would become the coronavirus pandemic and all that came with that. But the chaplain of the day in the Senate quoted a hymn that said, I need you and you need me and we need each other to survive. And so I want to thank the leadership in this chamber and in this building. Some of you are new, but many of you have been present since that day three years ago. And not only have we survived as a state and as a medical community, but we have thrived our state has been held up across the nation as the envy of many that didn't make the right decisions during that time. And a lot of hard decisions had to be made and a lot of them had to be made in this room. So as a lifelong Georgian and on behalf of the medical community, I thank every one of you for the work that you do now and the work that you've done over the past three years to put our state into the great place that it's in today. It's awesome to see the capital back to its old self with pages running around and everybody mingling out on the great hall. But that would not be the case if not for the decisions made here and the work that you all do. So thank you for that and good luck today. I know you have a busy day. It's an honor to be your doctor. I'll be downstairs if you need me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Bushnell, we're going to have a huge, huge kickball game with a Senate pretty quickly. So we could probably have to get you back the day after. So thank you for being here and thank you for your service to Rome and to our state. Please do sit there. Members and yet another announcement that you need to be aware of represent Sharon Anderson's daughter, Angel is having surgery this morning as well.

Representative Cummins is recognized for a morning order. Greetings to my colleagues, guests, and esteemed members of Delta Sigma Theta Surority. It is my honor and pleasure to share on this 27th day of African American History Month, a true trailblazer and leader, Soror Dorothy Height. Soror Dorothy Height was born on March 24, 1912. She attended New York University and received her Master's degree at Columbia University School of Social Work. There she pledged the road chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Surority. Height became a counselor for the YWCA in New York and eventually met Mary McLeod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt at a meeting of the National Council of Negro Women. This meeting would change her life forever and further push her into a service of civil rights and advocacy. Dorothy Height continued her work with the YWCA, leading to the National Board to move from token integration to full desegregation. Height served at the National President of Delta Sigma Theta. From 1947 to 1956, she became President of the National Council of Negro Women in 1958 and served in that capacity for 40 years. During the civil rights movement, she organized Wednesdays in Mississippi which brought together white and black women from the North and South to work against desegregation, to work against segregation. She developed many international programs with the NCNW and Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America. Height wrote a weekly column for the New York Amsterdam News and published the infamous report, The Tuskegee Ciflis Study, which became an international ethical touchstone. She was the driving force behind directing the first statue to an African American person on federal land and DC and honor of Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue is significant for representing the contributions of minorities and women in the U.S. In 1990, Height became a woman that helped found the African American women for reproductive freedom. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1994 and she was the only African American woman to have a federal facility named after her and a stamp. Thank you. That completes our morning orders. We're ready to move on to the rules calendar members. Ready to move on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to HB122-122. House Bill 122 by Representative Hawkins, the 27th and others to be entitled to a man

We're supposed to provide for the governance of the Georgia Abel Program by Board of Directors of the Georgia Higher Education Savings Plan. This bill I refer to the Committee on Higher Education and Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute. Chairman Hawkins is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HB122, years ago the Georgia General Assembly passed the Abel Act a better living experience for the disabled. This allowed disabled Georgians to save an excess of $2,000 without losing their disability benefits, allowing them to save for the future and live independently. Last year the House unanimously passed this legislation you have on your desk, but unfortunately an amendment by the Senate killed the bill. For those new, let me briefly describe this legislation. The primary goal of this legislation is to create operational efficiencies for the State's 529 Abel Savings Program. By bringing the two programs under the leadership of one board which will improve outreach and support for the families of the disabled. HB122 removes the current $235,000 cat, allowing the board the flexibility set the limits in the future. This legislation will not change how participants in either the Georgia Abel Plan or the Path to College program use or manage their accounts nor does it co-mingle the fines between the two plans. This is a good bill that will allow disabled Georgians to live independently rather than becoming a ward of the State. Judiface Gerald last year noted that 70% of the people served by BHDD would qualify for the Abel Program. I would ask for your favorable consideration. If there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. The gentleman has no questions. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's Substitute? The Chair here is none. The Committee's Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the Report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The Report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. The Chair here is none. The Committee has no questions. The Chair here is none. The Committee has no questions. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 167. The nays are zero. The bill having received a record that constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to H.B.254, Mr. Clerk. House will choose the next item. The clerk will read the caption to H.B.254, Mr. Clerk. House will choose the next item. The clerk will read the caption to H.B.254, Mr. Clerk. The clerk will read the caption to H.B.254, Mr. Clerk. Chair, the procedure for the designation of the E.F.O.L.O. in this bill I would refer to the Committee on Judiciary that the committee recommends the Disp bill do pass by the Committee substitute. Chair, the clerk will recognize the representative Jenkins to present the bill. Good morning, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I rise to present House Bill 254. This bill seeks to address some recognized issues with our legal organs. It's a three-part bill. The first part gives communities more flexibility in the event they lose their legal organ. It allows them to select an interim in the event they don't have a qualifying paper to serve the community. The second section of this bill changes the ad rates to the legal organs. This hasn't been done in almost 30 years, so it was time for these to be adjusted for inflation. The third section of this bill addresses if the legal organ does not publish a notice as it is supposed to. This section, it basically allows for using other methods online methods to satisfy the notification requirements. So whatever legal process it is, it can move forward. Pending your question. Request your favorable consideration. The gentleman, you owe for our question. Gentlemen, you owe for our question? Yes, I owe. Representative Williams, to your left from House District 168 has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, the gentleman, you owe to my friend, I will. I certainly, is it not true that I certainly like the bill. I know what it intends to do. I need some clarification. We're losing in rural Georgia a lot of former legal organs and a lot of counties find themselves in the position that you're trying to correct. Is that not true? That's correct, sir. What is the long range as we lose more and more newspapers? The social media part that you mentioned, are they going to be able to step in and fill the gap because not on the rule, but newspapers are becoming a thing of the past as a rule. What's the long term help for counties that, that multiple counties that won't have legal organ? So the long term help in this bill is it gives the county officials that select the legal organ greater flexibility so they can find one that best serves their community. But this bill does not create any mechanism to not have a legal organ. That's a separate issue. Gentlemen, a further yield? I further yield. Ladies and gentlemen, the second ribs of the yellow is to your left. Extreme left has a conversation. Hey, question, excuse me. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I yield. Thank you. Is it not true that there is actually data that supports the argument that the more robust your local paper is, the lower your taxes tend to be as an individual? I'm sure you know what you speak of. Is the gentleman further yield? I do. Is it not true that while we should keep supporting them, these local newspapers, these legal organs, it is also important that the citizens be able to get this information in a way that is as accessible as possible? And that can include the internet. That certainly sounds like a reasonable statement. Thank you. Gentlemen, has a couple more questions. One more is a matter of fact. If you'll take one more. I'll take one more. The lady from the 92nd ribs of the Taylor to your left out front has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? A yield. Thank you. I think representative Nellum has just answered the question for a disc ver clarity. Like during COVID, a lot of the newspapers were doing digital print. And I don't see the word digital in here except for the county website. Does this bill also allow for the digital newsletters that are going out from these newspapers as well? So the requirement to publish it in a newspaper is unchanged. It has to, the notices have to be published in a newspaper. There is a provision in the third section of the bill if that ad fails to run as it was intended to allow electronic means to serve as the notice so that the process that that that that that was supporting continues. And it does, it is not interrupted. It doesn't have to start over. But it has to be, I'm sorry, did the gentleman further yield? I do. So if a clarity is to make sure I'm straight, it does have to be published and printed. Yes, yes, it has to be published. And if you live in an area with a robust legal organ, this that provision probably won't be really used in your area. But thank you, sir. All right, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. I see no further questions. The gentleman has yielded the will. Thank you for the presentation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote. Yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 166. The nays are one. The bill having received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to HB268268. House Bill 268, members and a quarter of the 174th and others will be titled on act to amend chapter 6A, title 35 of the official go to Georgia and intedid relating the criminal justice coordinating council. Those who are invited are the establishment of a grant program to support local law enforcement agencies and multi jurisdiction task force relative to motor vehicle related crime prevention initiatives. This bill I refer to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes chairman Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'm praying before you, House Bill 268, LC 39376 8S. Local law enforcement agencies across the state are grappling with motor vehicle crimes. These crimes range from auto theft, parts theft, especially catalytic converter thefts here lately have been on the rise insurance fraud and more. The common handicap that these law enforcement agencies have is like a bandwidth, like of equipment, like of personnel, like of technology access to data, boundary and jurisdictional restrictions. Other states across the nation have created auto theft prevention, either authorities or commissions to address these issues. We are pulled from these other states components that have proven to be effective in fighting its motor vehicle crimes and have included them in 268. So what this bill does, we are establishing a Georgia motor vehicle crime prevention advisory board. The board will be located at the criminal justice coordinator council. The council will establish a grant program and it's all dependent on funding to help assist local local law enforcement agencies in multi jurisdictional task force, relative to motor vehicle related crime prevention initiatives. The purpose of the advisory board will be to accept applications from local law enforcement and then to make recommendations to the council as to which ones to fund. The funding for these grants will be federal grants granted by Congress as well as gifts and donations from individuals, private organizations or foundations. Acceptance of these grants does not obligate the state to appropriate any funds. So this will be funded totally by federal grants or private donations. Other states have done this. Louisiana has got a really good program that is proven to work. That's what we've modeled this after and Mr. Speaker, I will take any questions at this time. And we passed this same bill last year. Gentlemen, you are for a question. Yes, sir. Representative Holly to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? I do. Just curious. I see on line 61 on the discussion of like the prevention of the criminal behavior. I know typically looking at some of the criminal justice bills that this chamber has passed. There's been an overall notion that by increasing criminal penalties that that somehow correlates to a reduction in crime. And in what way would you suggest that this will allow for the criminal justice coordinating council to provide prevention strategies that are not themselves an extension of criminal penalties? Well, this will be local law enforcement agencies applied for these grants. That's one thing they can include in that application is that we're going to use it for this particular purpose. That's what a local law enforcement does. It's not the criminal justice council. They're just actually the house administrator of these grants. They will provide that to local law enforcement to help first time offenders. I think it's what is stated in here to be able to help them prevent from reoccurring. I think it's proven if you can get training and hope to help prevent them from being a recitive of a current sin future. Is this a gentleman for the union? I do. And what types of activities I think you are for clearing that for me that it's not the justice council. It's going to be local law enforcement. What is it beyond? Because the general notion in this chamber is that if you put more time on the person and give longer sentences that that somehow a reduction of crime, if this bill seeks to prevent crimes from happening, and what ways that the local law enforcement that you know of, I'm sure you used when you drafted this bill, what local measures are actually conducted that prevent this type of crime from happening? That would be, it could be anything from training to the local being taught where to part their vehicles, where don't leave stuff laying in your seats, where people can see it to break the windows out. This is the gamut of things. That's going to be totally up to the local law enforcement as to what they want to do to implement to help prevent these first time offenders. Okay. Thank you. Gentlemen has one more question for you, you. Oh, you. Representative Collins had to your straight ahead has a question. This gentleman, you do to my friend to my friend. Thank you for bringing this piece of legislation and one of the things I wanted to ask. Is it not true that with the criminal justice coordinating council and developing a program, you know, we're talking about dealing with some stolen vehicles and stolen auto parts that educating these people that buy these parts and trade these parts, these parts on the black market that that education within itself could be seen as prevention and preventing these crimes from happening. Is that not true? That is exactly true. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, most everybody here is old enough to remember McGriff, the crime dog. Y'all vote for this and help me take a bite out of crime. You were good until then. Wow. Okay. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none? The previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The Chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. Report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 162. The nays are seven. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to hb4444444. Redsmith intend to open Hoffa's document on the table and pressured it and read in half. on the chapter 14 and to the top of 44 of the fiscal day Georgia annotated relating to Liz pendants. So as a revised one, an action may operate as a Liz pendants. This bill emits for the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Rees is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speakers, House members. I present to you House Bill 444 if this looks familiar from last year. It's because it is from last year. This came back over from the Senate with a minor change and almost made it but ran out of time. Chairman Gunter worked really hard on this bill last year. Liz pendants, that's a Latin phrase that means a lawsuit is pending. It's a real estate filing when a lawsuit pertains to a parcel of real estate. It's a common law doctrine and this bill gives some statutory criteria, ground rules and due process for Liz pendants to make sure that real estate title is not clouded unnecessarily by that real estate filing when there's litigation. Respectfully requests your approval of House Bill 444 and I yield for questions Mr. Speaker. You have no questions, good job. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Turn the town key. Turn the kicker around all members voted. Have all members voted. have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 171, the nay zero. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Excuse me, read yes. Will you read the caption to HB147, 147, Mr. Clerk? House Bill 147, my rep. Way to the ninth and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 2, title 20 that fiscal to Georgia annotated relating elementary and secondary education. So it's a provide for a school safety and anti gang endorsement for eligible certified professional personnel issued by the professional standards commission. This bill having referred to committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Wade to present the bill. Thank you speaker. Good morning colleagues. I rise to present to you House Bill 147. This is Governor Kimps safe schools act and I was honored to carry it through the process and this does come to you as a unanimous recommend a recommended bill. This bill does four things. First, it establishes a voluntary school safety and anti gang endorsement for current teachers or future teachers. It encourages colleges and universities within their teacher preparation programs to include training and best practices for promoting and preserving safe schools and identifying and deterring youth gangs. It also ensures that school safety plans that are currently submitted to their local law enforcement agencies be additionally shared with GEMA and Homeland Security. And last but not least this will require an annual intruder alert drill before October 1st and there is a provision that will allow for students and faculty to have an opt out. With that, I hope and ask for your favorable consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions. So the gentleman is here to work question that lady from the 50th representative has a question. Thank you. Does the senator yield? Sorry. Does the representative yield? Yes ma'am. I will forgive that demotion and I do yield to my friend. Sorry to insult you sir. First of all is it not true that I enjoy our friendship and enjoy working with you? I believe that to be true. All right now I have two real questions. So is it not true that there is a nationwide retrospective study that surveyed K through 12 students across 33 states that found that anxiety, stress and depression among students increased 39 to 42 percent after active shooter drills. In conjunction with the fact that there is actually scant evidence that such drills save lives. So I'm sure the general lady is quoting facts that she believes to be true. Two things. One, our bill also acknowledges that there are certain situations in which some students or some faculty might need to opt out for special needs situations or life experiences. I can tell you in my district we had a former faculty member that had lived and survived the tornado and we allowed for that person not to participate within a tornado drill in our local community. But I'd also say that incident responses beyond that of active shooters. There are lots of potential risks that school systems need to have an opportunity to prepare for and this incident response drill will encompass many of those things, especially outside of specifically the concern that you referenced. Thank you for your question. Just one other question. I just want to point out that. Gentlemen, you yield. I do appreciate and we've talked about this personally on the floor. Your focus on prevention when it comes to keeping our children safe from violence in schools. This is a yes or no question. Do you feel that gun safety legislation serves any role in creating a culture of violence prevention and protecting our children? I'm going to answer the question the way I answered it when you asked me in person. I believe that we need to seek things that prevent violence period in our schools especially to protect our students and our faculty. Thank you. Is that a yes? Violence encompasses many things beyond that which the lady is referenced. Thank you. Thank you, sir. If there are no further questions. I'll yield for two more. Two more. Okay, then we have some speakers on the bill. To your left, Representative Kenner, is recognized for our question. Mr. General, I yield to my friend. What I visit is not true that when I visit my high schools, the principals complain about the number of fire drills they're having to conduct which is like once a month. Would this drill replace some of those or are they adding to the volume of drills that they have to perform? I appreciate the question. So I am certain that sometimes drills and things that we are required to do can become frustrating. But I can assure you that if you are a school system that has faced a fire, you are very thankful that you went through those fire drills. And the determination of if the gentleman wants to address how many fire drills there are in each year, that's a separate issue. And I'm happy to discuss that with future legislation. This just requires one required incident response drill each year. Thank you. You have a couple of questions. We're going to have some further speakers. So I'm going to ask you to take one more question. That's from your left. For a left representative chairman Sains has a question. Does the gentleman yield? I yield to my friend, yes. Is it not true that this house has led an investment in public safety for our school system. This further allows those systems to test out the mechanisms that they've utilized for that investment. The gentleman knows what he speaks. We as a house have recommended $60,000 per school. This will be a coupling piece of legislation that will allow school systems to continue and prevent intruders and others from accessing those buildings. Thank you for that point. And at this time, I appreciate your consideration and I yield the well. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. We have a couple of speakers signed up. We'll start with Representative Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise because I want to be a voice for those who can't be here today. I wonder how many of you have ever actually asked the children who are subjected to these active shooter or intruder drills in our schools if they actually feel safer. Well, I did. I am the mother of an eighth grader and she has been doing these drills since she was an elementary school. Drill is pretty standard. You're supposed to run, hide, and if the person gets in, you're supposed to fight. Students are told to run into a closet or huddle in an area of the classroom where they can't be seen while the teacher locks the door and then there's to be absolutely quiet so that the intruder doesn't know what they're doing. The last time my daughter's school had a soft lockdown, not a drill, an actual lockdown.

spoke with me about it. She said, Mom, these drills do not work. Because if the shooter is another student, they aren't stupid. They know the school is not empty. They know we're in there. And also, they've done these drills. They know the protocol. They know where we are. And they are still going to kill us. The truth is, my daughter is speaking based on what she's seen in her own life. She's been doing these active shooter drills since she was in elementary school. And she has also watched and horror as students and other places have been murdered in a place that is supposed to be safe. Multiple times. When are we as a body going to stop pretending that we care and actually do something meaningful that keeps guns out of our schools in the first place? We have several bills that take common sense approaches to keeping guns out of our schools. Pediatrics, safe storage, keep the guns out of the hands of kids. No hearing. Universal background checks, keep the guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. No hearing. Requiring re-evaluation before allowing individuals who've been involuntarily committed to mental institutions. No hearing. This equates to us having fire drills, which was just mentioned, while taking absolutely no precaution to stop the fires from happening or spreading in the first place. We regulate fire extinguishers in this state more than we regulate fire arms in this state. Why? This bill will very likely pass today. And everyone who votes yes are going to go pack themselves on the back as if they actually did something. Well, I'm here to tell you right here in this well, you did nothing, but made yourself feel better, but you did nothing to make our students feel safer. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Ladies and gentlemen, remember our house rules. We have very good presentations, but no applause any other on appropriate activity. Representative Anne Allen Westbrook is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good morning, colleagues. I rise to speak in opposition to House Bill 147. The Safe Schools Act. I'm just going to note at the outset, this bill has a really nice name. We all want Safe Schools, right? Unfortunately, there is no evidence to indicate that this bill is going to make our schools safer, much less safe. In fact, there's evidence that may significantly negatively impact our students' mental health. And finally, it's just one more burden that this body is putting on teachers and students in Georgia's public schools. This bill mandates that public schools across Georgia conduct intruder alert drills. It mandates. They conduct those drills under the guidance of Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, and it mandates that they report completion of the drills back to the agency by October 1 of each year. The question we need to be asking, though, is does it work? That's already been raised today, but it can't be raised enough. Does it work? If it's not good policy, we shouldn't keep doing it just because that's how we're doing it now. School shootings are relatively rare, accounting for less than 1% of the more than 43,000 annual U.S. gun deaths, but they instill a deep sense of fear in communities, and they cause policy makers like us to want to do something, anything, fast. So in response to these rare but terrifying events, active shooter drills have been implemented in the majority of America's K-12 schools, including Georgia. This is despite a complete absence of evidence that these drills are effective at limiting deaths or injuries in a school shooting. They are reactive. They are not proactive. There's no evidence they make our schools safe as the name of this bill claims. There is evidence, however, that intruder alert drills can have a significant negative impact on students' mental health. Our friends up the road at Georgia Tech conducted their own study of the immediate and long-term impacts of active shooter drills on the health and well-being of students, teachers, and parents. The results revealed a 42% increase in anxiety and a 39% increase in depression, and this trend was sustained for the 90 days following the drills and span diverse school districts and drill tactics. High school and middle school communities had the highest increases, and elementary schools also showed increases in both anxiety depression and stress as well. So what we have here is a policy with no real demonstrable benefit at all that carries real cost for our kids. Also, this bill burdens teachers. Our schools need our support in dealing with huge challenges like making gains on reading-level proficiency and catching up COVID-19-related learning loss. Our public schools are the only schools in Georgia that are required to educate every Georgia child, including those with learning differences and those living in poverty. We do not need to give teachers more to do and more reasons to leave the profession in this state. They are already doing drills of some kind in our schools, but those drills are right now tailored to the needs of their schools, which they know best. This requires an additional layer of bureaucratic oversight and reporting that our schools frankly don't need. If we want to truly increase school safety, there are some proactive options we could consider. The U.S. Secret Service has done an analysis of targeted school violence, and it revealed that half of school shootings are carried out by current or past students, and three-quarters of those used a firearm that they accessed from their home or the home of a friend or relative. This was the case in January in Virginia when a six-year-old access to firearm at home took it to school and shot his first grade teacher. Two bills filed this session in this body would address safe storage of firearm around minors. That's HB 161, Pediatric Safe Storage Act that requires farms to be stored safely around minors. And HB 135, which provides that the failure to secure a firearm that is access by a minor and used for a threat of violence or in the commission of a crime would be a misdemeanor, just a misdemeanor. So there are actions this body could take to create policy that actually has a good chance of making schools safer. This bill is not that. So ask yourself if this is really what the educators in your district want from you as leaders in this state. I know what mine want. Mine want to be in the classroom teaching students. Our students need to be in the classroom learning, not running drills that make them simulate something horrific that we should never have allowed to become their reality. That is our failure, and we shouldn't put the responsibility for fixing it on children and their teachers. Like I said, the Safe Schools Act has a nice name. It makes us feel like we are doing something about a situation that should not be tolerable to any of us anymore. But bill names and good feelings don't make schools safer. Good policy does, and this is not that. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. We have another speaker to be recognized. Representing Stacey Evans is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It's complicated. I'm rising today in support of House Bill 147, but it's complicated. I agree with much of what my Democratic colleagues set up here today. So it's complicated. Our teachers and our kids have no choice as I see it, but to plan to try to survive the very real threat that they face every day that there could be a school shooting inside their building. That's their reality. They have no ability to change that reality. They only have the ability to decide how to plan for it and how to try to survive, and I want them to do that. So that's why I'm supporting this bill. Ladies and gentlemen, our babies, babies and their teachers have no choice than to change their reality, but we do. We have so many options at our disposal to make this not the reality for our babies and their teachers. Those that came before me talked about some of the measures that are pending in this body right now. That's it. Not even willing to talk about it. I hear a lot of folks in here talk about the dangers of cancel culture and the dangers of shutting people down and not letting them speak. What do you think this is, ladies and gentlemen? You won't even let us talk about it. The number one killer of our babies right now, gun violence. We're not even going to look at it. How did we let this happen? How did we become so afraid of the debate? I feel good in my position that I think we should have better background checks. We should have waiting periods. We should have gun storage laws. I feel confident that I'm right in that position, but I will always hear you out for you to tell me why you think I'm wrong. Why can you not do the same? What are you so afraid of? Do you know you're wrong? And you don't want to think about it? You don't want to have to respond? That's not our job. Our job is to debate and discuss the hard questions. And this is a hard one. I think most schools are doing some form of these intruder drills, but again, I'm voting for this bill because I want to make sure they all do. Because I want our babies and teachers to be as safe as they can. And I hope I know the bill has an opt out that school boards can make a provision for parents to opt their children out. And I hope that no one does that. Because if there is a school shooting and our children are able to some of them stay in a room and convince somebody that no one's in there, that's only going to work if everybody knows how to do it. Because the biggest part about these intruder drills is acting like you're not there, making it dark and being quiet. I hope that most of you in this room have not had to talk with your children or your grandchildren about what these intruder drills look like. Because it's heartbreaking the reality. My daughter started my daughter's turning 11 tomorrow. Happy early birthday, Ashley. She's in fifth grade. She's been doing these intruder drills since she was in kindergarten. And the first time she described it to me, I just had to go upstairs because I wasn't going to cry in front of her. Five year olds. Finding the deepest corner in their classroom or a little crevice behind where they hang their coats and backpacks up, getting down as close to the ground as they can and being absolutely silent. The teacher putting black construction paper over the window that are on most school classroom doors so that it looks like no one's there. And then everybody being quiet. Five years old. It gets worse though. She didn't do these intruder drills when she was in pre-k. I have another child, a son. He's going to be four in a couple of weeks. He's been doing this since he was two. Two. Church preschool. And they don't call it intruder drills for two year olds. They tell them they're playing hide and seek. And they all have a specific place within their classroom that they are designated to go. They're hiding place. And they go and they curl up there and they're told to be quiet. Two years old. Again, this is their reality. And I want them to plan because they have no choice. But we do. We have created this reality. And we are not even willing to talk about ways that we can change it. And that's unacceptable. And I couldn't not come up here and say that. So while I will be voting for this bill, it's with a heavy heart for the reality that we've created for our children and our teachers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. The lady has yielded the will. We have one more speaker. One more speaker. Representative Hagen has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends and colleagues, I will keep this very short. As a former classroom teacher, I did feel that I did wanted to come up in and speak in support of this bill. We hear so much about doing something to keep guns and violence out of our school. But the fact is our schools are already gun free zones. That doesn't seem to matter to an active shooter that wants to come in and harm our children and our teachers. There are already laws prohibiting violence on campus. It still happens. So those who don't respect laws or human life don't care about what laws we pass. They care about committing these heinous acts. And whether it's out of pure evil or some type of mental illness, it does not matter when our children are in harm's way. So I feel this bill is important because it gives our schools. It gives our children a tool so that if an unfortunate horrible act were to happen at their school, they know what to do. And of course students don't like that they have to do these drills. They shouldn't have to do these drills. They should be at our schools and they should be learning. But the sad fact is these things do happen. I remember when I was teaching fourth grade in Lawrenceville when Columbine happened. The kids came to school the next day and they were scared. And we had to talk about this. They were already scared because they already knew that these things were happening. And so to not address it, I feel like we could not address it. And I agree with those of you that don't think we should have to. But I think it's not in the best service of our children to not give them the tools and the preparation that they need should this happen. So I do ask for your favorable consideration of this bill. Not because we want it but because we need it. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. We have no more speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does the representative Chocus rise? Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. Stature inquiry. Yes sir. During the conversation and the presentation in the well there was a much talk about the mental effect of the children dealing with drills. And at this point I may be dating myself but we lived as a child I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis. And we had to practice nuclear drills very often and I realized how tragic an active shooter is but when you're looking at world destruction in the eyes of a five year old it's pretty traumatic. I'm voting for this bill I think it's a great bill and I encourage everyone to support me in this. Thank you. I'm sure the gentleman believes in what he states. What purpose does representative Lutton rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true that I have visited many principles in my district just last week and I gave them just one question. We talked about a lot of things but I gave them one question and I said if you could sit in front of the state legislature right now which is in charge of the state budget. What would you ask for and without hesitation each one of them said money. Each one of them said money. They want money for more hands in the classroom and in the school to take care of our kids. They want money to pay bus drivers competitively so that buses don't have to run double runs and kids are late to school every day. They want money for school psychiatrist and psychologist to take care of our kids and moreover to take care of our of their staff. They said please keep in mind if we get some mental health folks we can that helps the staff too. So it is true that I took stock of my. Thank you for your inquiry if the lady will complete her inquiry. Excuse me. Is it not true that I did such things? Yes it is if the lady so states I know she believes in what she so states. Thank you so much Mr. Speaker. For what purpose is representative Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true that many of the discussions regarding drills deal with unannounced versus announced drills and that a lot of the studies that discuss the traumatic effects of drills are referring to unannounced drills versus announced drills and this bill does not mandate either one and leads it up to the local school systems decide. If the gentleman so states I'm sure he's convinced of that fact. For what purpose is representative Campbell rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that this bill does not fund additional teachers? Does not fund additional mental health care workers? Does not fund gun safety education? Does not fund healthy start food? Does not fund education and literacy or other proactive measures designed to address the root causes of gun and gang or other school related violence? Sure the lady knows what she speaks and has studied the matter in depth and this body does cover a large wide range of policy implications when we look at such these matters. For what purpose does ribosity manor rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true Mr. Speaker that my daughter's school had an active threat and she told me that they did not have an active shooter drill and so when they had to actually go through this active threat they went across the street to the park they'd never done that before and she thought to herself it was chaotic but when I told her about this bill she said well maybe if we do that it won't be so chaotic the next time is that not true? If the lady so states what purpose does representative Hutchinson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true Mr. Speaker that as a mental health professional my relatives and specifically my father two of my aunts have confided in me that the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cuban Missile Crisis when they had to practice these drills they are still triggered when they enter historical buildings such as Ebenezer Baptist Church as a reminder of that time. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks we have a couple more and then we're going to vote on this bill I think most of you already voted for what purposes chair lady camp rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Isn't it true that if someone doesn't know what they're supposed to do in a crisis they won't know what to do in a crisis? Well I'm sure the lady believes that and it does make sense so thank you for your inquiry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm taking one more inquiry and that's Representative Cannon's recognized for what purpose is Representative Cannon rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Thank you is it not true as a preschool teacher currently in the state of Georgia on leave for legislative session. I'm do be concerned that this bill is coupled with anti-gain language and maybe if it was decoupled there might be different votes on this bill. I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks of and she's read the bill thoroughly. Have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill the yeas were 148 the nays 20 the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to hb 480 hb 480. House Bill 480 by Rose and Franklin in the 160th to be entitled back to a man chapter 9 and a total 34 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to workers compensation so it's to change certain provisions related to workers compensation benefits this bill haven't been referred to the committee on industry and labor that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Well you look familiar representative wasn't sure if you were first your first bill or not but it's not your first bill. I thought I remember that you did an excellent job on your first one. Chair recognizes the representative Franklin from down in Bullock County to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the assembly I rise for House Bill 480. This is an annual agency bill from the state board of workers comp. It has the support of the business community insurers, claimant lawyers, defense attorneys and all other groups within the advisory council of the state board of the workers compensation. This bill cleans up language in regards to potential dependency benefits where there has been a composatable death on the job. It also allows for the increase in max benefit risk or rates in the injury of a job whereas the maximum rate moves to $725 to $800 own a complete injury on the job and it moves from $483 to $533 on a partial injury on the job. It also raises the maximum death benefit for the so dependent spouse for $290,000 to $320,000. Again this is an agency bill that has a full support of all engaged and in the development of the bill and I ask for your favorable support and we'll take any questions at this time. Gentlemen has a couple of questions to your far left. The gentleman from the 166 chairman, Petrie has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This gentleman yield. My friend. Thank you, my friend. Listen, I think you know from being in committee, I support much of what's in this bill but is it not true that this bill is a massive expansion, a dramatic expansion, of benefits to now new, maratricious relationships, those without ceremonial marriage, which would begin at three months. Is that not true? I would not say it's a massive expansion but there is an expansion, yes. It is an expansion and a bit of a un-cermonial marriage at three months. Well, it's an expansion for the dependent. Potentially. It has really nothing to do with marriage and my point of view but it has to do with the dependency of the individual. This gentleman further yield. Is it not true the majority of Republicans in this committee voted no to this measure? If that's what you think. I don't agree with that but I don't know. It's pretty clear to the records, sir. There were four no votes out of six Republicans but thank you, sir. I just want to add that there were two of those voters in that committee that said they would have changed that vote if they had to vote again. Gentlemen, you owe for another question. I do yield. The committee from where it's, when's the legislation came? The gentleman from the 157th chairman work-izer. Thank you. Offer some clarity here. Thank you, Miss Baker. I will get them in yield. Is it not true that there are 11 Republicans on this committee and I think the board will reflect that none of them will vote yes. So that's vast majority. So often happens in committees. We heard the bill the day before and the second day came in to take a vote and by the time we finished a lot of those had moved and went to other committees. To the gentleman's point about the three months, that is a minimum number one and number two, it is not a standard. It is a minimum for consideration and we have three judges appointed by the governor to hear these cases on the case by case. To characterize this as a major expansion policy, you do realize that there's probably less than 20 deaths. Fortunately, that's a very low number in the workplace in the state of Georgia out of between two and three million workers. We have using less than 20 deaths. So to vote against the policy where you know 98% of the bill you agree on, but except for those two words, I hope that is it not true that I think I'd yes vote on this bill would be great. It is at the German speaks. He found that question right there at the end there. Representative, I was looking for it but I was having problems finding it. Whip part has a question for the gentleman in the wheel of your yield. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield. Is it not true that this bill passed with bipartisan support out of the committee with every single Democrat voting in favor of a compromise that was carefully tailored by the advisory committee that results in an increase in the weekly benefits for workers. It is a gentleman's is it not does the gentleman further yield. Yes I yield. Is it not further true that when we're talking about the 90 day time frame that that's just current law that reflects and is not changed and if that there are concerns regarding the 90 day time frame that a new piece of legislation could be introduced to perhaps address that issue that really isn't has nothing to do with this compromise piece of legislation. That is correct. Thank you. Gentlemen, you have for one more question. I yield. I think it'll clarify everything we've been talking about here. The gentleman from the 168th House District down on the coast. Representative Williams has a question. Thank you Mr. Chairman. With gentleman yield. I yield. It's been very interesting that it seems like some of your brother in a little disturbed. Is it not also true that there are many Democrats that certainly invite a friend's in family read or a new toyora after the session? I hope so.

Well maybe I was wrong on that clarity part. I thought he was going to preach when he got into brother in there but I wasn't sure what he was going to do. The gentleman has no further questions. Speaker, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose is representing Mayna rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true as a physical therapist I told the speaker last year that the state board of workers compensation does not have a physical therapist on the board. Most workers comp patience. Nine times out of ten they go see a physical therapist. Is that not true? I'm sure if the lady so states she knows that to be true. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill the yeas were 154 the nays 15. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. That was a no. The clerk will read the caption to hb 440440. House will 440 by rips and of stoner the 40th and others to be titled next to a men part three of article 16 to chapter two or title 20. The official go to Georgia annotated relating the student health and elementary and secondary education. So it's authorized public and private schools to stock a supply of undesignated ready to use glucocon. This bill ever referred to the committee on public health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Well the chair is about to recognize the representative stoner is this your first bill sir. Not quite his first bill I'll let him explain that when he comes to the well chair recognizes rips and stoner to present the bill. Thank you miss speaker. No this was not my first bill in this chamber my first bill in this chamber was in 2003. And I had the the honor of following the flag referendum debate after six hours. It was my first bill in this well. But yes this is my first bill coming back since I've returned to the chamber. Thank you miss speaker members of the house. I come to the well today talk about house bill 440 which deals with an issue that we've done for other children on other issues medical issues that they have at school. Specifically what this bill will do it will allow school systems to stock undesignated as the term that that's used which is really unprescribed. But Gleukhagon pins sometimes are called Gleukhagon kids this is actually an example of one. This is this is a training kit my wife does with children by the way is you all probably known from previous conversations I've had here in the well. You know we're advocates on diabetes issues so this is an example of what the schools with stock is something like this at school. Currently the situation the schools is simply this we have a diabetes management program that is required by the state for children who have type one diabetes those are insulin dependent. If for some reason that child is they're prescribed a Gleukhagon pen as we call it this right here that they keep on them every type one diabetic is prescribed that be that child or adult. Children have a tendency to lose things I think we all have experienced that and they do lose their medication on occasion. So what this is going to allow is a school to have the authority not not mandated but the authority to purchase these kids these pens and stock them. So if a child is at school and they have what's called a severe hypogasemic episode meaning your glucose is dropping very fast. And guess what orange juice and cookies isn't going to stop it. Okay and you're going to need to get your Gleukhagon pen out and usually someone else has to have a benefit because if you're in that state you're really not aware what's going on around you. And so if you if the child has lost their pen we have a situation even if there's another child with a Gleukhagon pen let's say it's prescribed to them. It is against the law for that school nurse or that trained personnel to take that other child's Gleukhagon pen and give it to this child hopefully prevent potentially brain damage or they're saved their life. So what this bill does it basically states now again as I said that it's going to allow schools to have the authority to acquire these and stock them. It authorizes pharmacies and doctors and those are also allowed to prescribe to also prescribe for schools. Simply put this bipartisan piece of legislation is going to save lives. We already do this for Epipens of a Bitter All and Narcon is already something and this is just one thing that for whatever reason we haven't done yet. So I misspeak of this time I'm happy to answer any questions if I have any. You have a couple of questions. The gentleman with yield? Yeah yield. Cheerleady Houston has a. I was making a page. I thought I was. Well you got to pass on that when I was worried about you. I was going to tell you now. I was wondering. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does gentleman you. Yes I yield. This is actually a serious question. Is anything in this require the schools to keep a list of students that are type one or who normally have a prescription for Gleukagon that might have just left there at home or dropped it on the bus or something. This bill doesn't specifically do that under the student diabetes management program that the schools are required to do with each student that's type one where they actually sit down with the parents with their position and basically have a plan for that particular. Student. Now as to the fact under that plan is I understand it that currently operates. There's nothing requiring the parents to to notify the school that their child is a type one diabetic you would hope that parents would do that. But this this bill has nothing to do with that we're actually putting this under the current state diabetes management plan. As we do now with with other things with a type one diabetic child. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen further yield. Yes I do. Representative Bennett right out in front of you has a question. Ladies recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker with a gentleman yield. A yield. Isn't that true that without this life saving measure that the child's life could be put in danger for threatening the life of a child? Yes it could in fact the consequences is you know is ultimately potentially death or even if it's not death brain damage. Thank you for this great bill. Thank you. Gentlemen further yield. Yes I do. To your extreme left I figured y'all could have solved this one while y'all were over there chatting. One of your seat mails made. Sherp and Stevens has a question. Gentlemen's recognized for a question. Gentlemen you. Yes. As we've talked about earlier for the rest of the body isn't it not true that we've done very similar life saving scenarios in this body for narcotic antagonists for kids that may have consumed opiates for example by placing that over the counter and more specifically for these epipans whenever they show but school and we placed them in the school so that whenever there's a bee sting or something that these kids life can be saved. Gentlemen those are what he speaks. You have one more question. You'll yield for one more. Do you recognize the referencing manner for a question? Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Stoner do you yield for a question? I yield. You mentioned that the schools will be able to stockpile the glue cook and glue cook and pans and two questions to that. Do they need a prescription? How do they get them without a prescription? And the second question is if students don't have insurance and they literally can't get the glue cook on pans does that mean the schools can now be the pharmacy? To your first question actually that's what this bill does is authorizing pharmacies and those who are also able to prescribe medication now they're allowed to prescribe medication that's not prescribed to an individual but to a school to be able to stock this type of medication. Just a note on that this medication is good for two years on the shelf at room temperature so this is not something they have to put in refrigerator or anything like that. To the second part about you know where the schools become the pharmacy in the sense I think is your point. Now that's not likely what this is going to happen. Generally speaking as dealing with this issue trying to get folks who don't have say health insurance and getting access. There's a lot of groups who are providing that to children in particular something I work on outside of this chamber. But in the sense in a emergency situation yes it's going to be the pharmacy for that type one child if they don't have a glue cook on pin with them for whatever reason we're not going to sit there and say I'm sorry you know where's your prescription if they just don't have it the priorities to save that child's life. But now this is not going to be in a sense a pharmacy for those children that sense in a normal situation. Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker I would ask for a favorable to service support of this bipartisan piece of legislation I yield the well thank you. The gentleman has done a good job and he's yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's done the report of the bill is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the years were 169 the nays or zero the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will you read the caption to hb2 to zero to 20 hb2 20 House bill 220 by rips and have levered the 123rd and others to be entitled to amend title 44 the first go to Georgia annotated relating the property. The committee will have five for a means of enforcement of condominium and property owners associations instrument rules and regulations this bill I refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends a dispel do pass by committee substitute. Representative lever it are you ready you recognize to present the bill representative lever it. Thank you miss speaker ladies and gentlemen the House is my pleasure to present you with House bill 220 today this deals with that much beloved institution in this room of HOAs and condominium owners associations. The bill addresses a court of appeals decision from about a year and a half ago that ruled that before a HOA or COA gets injunctive relief that is basically an order allowing them to cure any deficiency or defect they first have to seek their legal remedies and that is precisely correct black letter law but the result of that in this particular case would be somewhat perverse because it would require. The homeowners association to try to fix the thing itself first to go on your property and remedy whatever fact or circumstance violates covenants or some other rule. So what this bill trust to do is change that in two ways first of all it does provide that they don't have to exercise legal remedies first that is they don't have to use self help which is generally permitted by the declaration and the other condominium and homeowners association documents. So that means they don't go on your property first they first go to court and they have to get an order that serves two purposes first it gives the homeowner an opportunity to be heard by a third party by a judge as to whether the action the homeowners association or condo association is taking is reasonable in the first place. And second if the court does find their being reasonable they get an order that allows them to get a deputy sheriff to come so that everybody can stay safe because there have been instances where people have got shot in these sort of interactions. Additionally at the request of the Reuters association we have further limited the authority of the HOAs and COAs by requiring they provide you notice and a right to cure. They have to notify you of the alleged problem first and allow you a chance to fix it yourself if you want to. So if you decide maybe you don't have to live with the concrete statue hand painted of Shania Twain in your front yard you can remove it on your own if you want to or the chainsawed stump sculpture you can take it away yourself before they come and take it. So I believe this while it's it is intended to make things simpler it actually does limit the ability of HOAs and COAs to enforce their covenants without allowing homeowners an opportunity to be heard and to state their position to a third party before they take action. So that's that's the bill in essence and I would yield for any questions Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen does have a question to see yield. To your left in the bag representative Wilkerson has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I yield yes sir. Yeah I have a question I guess HOAs in my experience are very powerful entities already. So right now you're saying that I think this is a mailbox case that you said in committee that has sparked this so we're going to change state law because I guess the person didn't want to fix their mailbox. But this applies to anything this third party is that a free third party is my first question. Well if you go to court is it free? It's a judge it is free that in the sense that you don't pay extra you've already paid for that when you ride to check on April 15. Okay let me rephrase that so if the HOA does the gentleman yields further yes yes absolutely. Okay HOA decides to file this injunctive relief in the courts. They assume I'm going to hire an attorney which then you will be billed back or the HOA will be back billed back is that not true? I would assume so yes. Okay so there is a cost to either the there's a gentleman further yield. I yield. One last question so either way typically in these cases if you go to the courts you're going your HOAs going to encourage you to go to court. So your HOA is going to incur costs which means everybody in that neighborhood occurs a cause because of a bad mailbox or you get the money back from the person that you're saying that you can't get it back from. Would it not be better to just go ahead and use the to update your covenants to make it so that you don't have to provide immediate relief so you can go to the courts without speeding up the process? Well in this case the covenants already provided that the court still ruled as it's entitled to that we can't always tell the court what legal rules it does and doesn't apply. I would further submit that while I'm sympathetic to the concerns the gentleman has about HOAs and kind of minimum associates I don't live in such a community myself. When you buy a lot in that community you are subjecting yourself to that governance structure presumably for the benefit of everybody in that subdivision. So I believe it's a little I would just say this is not something that people should be surprised about after they've bought a property in a subdivision that's subject to covenants that creates an HOA or a COA. It's part of what comes with it there are certain benefits and there are certain costs associated with it. But I believe this bill actually makes sure that the HOA is allowing or that you have an opportunity as a homeowner to be heard by a judge as to whether that HOA is being reasonable or not. True it will be with some costs but I would submit that if someone owns property in a subdivision they signed up under those rules. Gentlemen, you have one more question and then we have a speaker. Yes, I will you. Representative baseball to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I just wanted to say thank you for the bill. Me I have been the president of my homeowner association for years and so I know both sides and so I appreciate the fact that you are giving individuals a voice. Thank you. Thank you ma'am. I appreciate the question. If the gentleman will take one more I did not. Yes, yes ma'am. Mononini, minority party will. Representative, pour our council questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So just for purposes of clarification this would provide homeowners more rights than under current law. That's my position I believe it does, yes, ma'am. And does the gentleman yield for a question? Yes, ma'am. So online is 84 and I think in another spot it would require H.O.A.s to provide homeowners at least 10 days notice before they provide any further action which is a right that homeowners currently do not have. That's correct. They may have it in their condominium or H.O.A. declaration but they don't have it by law and this would give it to them across the board. Thank you for the clarification. Thank you for the question. That completes any questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration. I would ask your favorable vote on H.O.A.s to 20 and I will yield the vote. The gentleman has yielded the well. We do have a speaker, Representative Davis, who has asked to speak to the bill, Representative Davis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had to stand up here because House Bill 220 gives condominium and property-only associations in junk to relieve and it says that as long as this doesn't violate reasonable rules and regulations. Right? So what is reasonable rules and regulations? Let me give you some examples of what I have and others have experienced. You have some condominium owners. Now they are late on their assessment fees according to the association and you know what the association does? They go and they get a tow truck to tow their cars out of their county into another county. And they say, well, we will give you your car back once you pay this fee. You are assessment fee. Now the average person would say, that's not reasonable. I had someone to call me and say that that is what was done to them. I said, wait a minute, get off the phone. Call the police and tell them that your car was stolen because nobody should have their property taken without due process. Would you say that this is reasonable? That association thought that it was reasonable to take somebody's property. Is it reasonable when it comes down to insurance payments? We have a law that says that you have to acquire insurance. I'm talking about the condominiums and the property association. Now we are getting ready to give more power to the property owned and the condominium associations. And of course they are going to give back to the homeowners and the condo owners two things that would help them. What I am saying to you is that the abuses that are going on right now are so profound that there is no way we should give them. There is no way we should give more power to the property owners and the condominium association. And the condominium association. Without first correcting some of these abuses that are going on. They have used insurance payments. They get the money and then they take the money instead of doing repairs. I'm talking about your elderly, your disabled, your veterans. I had a disabled veteran contact me and say that he filed an insurance claim with an association. And that association took his money. And I do the repairs. They paid the water bill. And then they turned around and repaired a totally different person's property. I'm trying to give you some examples of what a number of elderly, disabled, and veterans, property owners, homeowners are experiencing as we speak. The worst thing we can do is give more power to these associations without correcting some of these problems. Now we found House Bill 303 to address some of these abuses. I have one asked for those of you who are doing this bill. You have the votes. You have the power. Please remember those elderly citizens, those elderly and disabled and the veterans that are suffering as we speak. Because the bad actors, I'm not talking about the people who are doing right. I'm talking about those bad actors that have gone and totally violated and abused on the name of reasonable rules and regulations. Please commit to doing a law or moving forward with some of the legislation we have already submitted under House Bill 303 and correct these abuses. We don't want no more of our seniors, our elderly and our veterans to suffer. These are the American dream, just like anybody else here in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. The lady has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. The clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose is representative Ridley-Rides? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. The first speaker is not true that this bill actually does protect the home owner and not the home owner's association by actually giving rules and regulations that they have to go through before they can act. Yes, the gentleman says states. For what purpose is representative Jasmine Clark-Rides? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Seeker. State your inquiry. Is it not true that while this does allow homeowners the opportunity to go to court, they could very well be stuck with attorney's fees and other things trying to fight in that in court against a homeowners association? If the lady so states, have all members voted, have all members voted, if so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 144, the nays 22. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to hb237, hb237. House bill 237, by motion. A pagan in the 156 and others to be entitled to amend Article 3, Chapter 3, Title 50. The official quoted Georgia annotated relating to state symbols so as to designate the southeast Georgia soap box derby is the official soap box derby of the state of Georgia. Mr. Bill, I refer to the committee on special rules that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Hagen is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends and fellow members, if you are tired of hearing me talk about the southeast Georgia soap box derby, today is your lucky day. With a favorable vote on House bill 237, I commit to you that I will be speaking about the southeast Georgia soap box derby significantly less than I have been for the past few weeks. I am not going to promise that I will never bring it up again but I promise you less talk. House bill 237 was simply named the southeast Georgia soap box derby which is run out of lions as Georgia's official soap box derby. In case you are not familiar with the soap box derby racing, this is a youth program for ages 7 through 20, where they are usually meant to build their soap box derby car and then they race it down a track. Drivers actually sit in the cars and I do want to clear up some confusion that several people have asked about. This is not pinewood derby racing. The pinewood derby cars are about this big and the children make their car out of this block of wood and then they race it down the metal track. The soap box derby racing is a much larger car where the driver actually sits in the car and races it down a hill. So I just want to make sure everybody is clear on the difference. The southeast Georgia derby began in 1992 with 20 cars competing in only one age division. But 31 years later the race has grown to an average of 50 drivers competing in three different age groups, age divisions and one division that is specific specifically for drivers with intellectual and developmental disabilities called the Super Kids division. Young people from around

Georgia and several states descend on lions for about 16 races every year to qualify for the World Championship which is held every summer in Akron, Ohio. So with a state admission of building knowledge and character, creating meaningful experiences through collaboration, fair and honest competitions, and using a STEM curriculum, I feel like this bill is something that we can all feel excited about supporting. So by making the South East Georgia, Stokebox Derby, Georgia's official Derby, we highlight a program that has a long history of positive influences on the young people in our communities, and we also encourage others to participate. So Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and I'll be happy to take any questions if there are any. Well the lady, I thought she made a nice announcement when she said that this would be the last time she spoke about this, but any number of people want to discuss this issue with you. So we're going to take a couple of questions I would have to do about half the house at least to answer all the questions so y'all can meet in any room when we adjourn. So yes sir. With the lady, you owe for a question or two. I will. Chair recognizes Chairman Weedauer to your right for a question. General, let you. I do. So we're speaking about the the Southeast Georgia Stokebox. We are. Can you tell me where the world championship for Stokebox Derby is? It's held in Acronohio every July. Very good. Can you follow up questions? Sure. Give the nature of this subject. Would you consider this a cleanup bill? I'm not sure what you mean by that question. That was bad. That was bad. Last question. So. So. Okay. I'm a little slow today at this late hour, but yeah. Thank you for your question. I think that good one. The lady you owe for a real question. I would love to yield for a real question. Rivers it. Represent the buckner to your left is recognized for a question. Does the general lady yield? Yes ma'am. If the general assembly were to approve sports betting, could we bet on Stokebox Derby's? No ma'am. I do not believe you could. Thanks for the question. Well, lady you owe for a couple more. Yes sir. I will. The gentleman from the 24th representing Barrett is recognized for a question. There he's right in front of you. Does the general lady yield? Is it not true that our very own representative Devon Sebal was recognized as the Stokebox Derby director of the year by the all-american Stokebox Derby? And is it not also true that he was the director of the Marietta Stokebox Derby for 10 years, sending 30 local champions to Akron, Ohio to race against the best racers in the world? I did not know those facts about represent Osebal, but I am thrilled to know that given that he is a co-sponsor of this bill. Thank you. It's where he likes to drive those eminences so fast. Represent the park cannon is recognized at the lady we yield. Yes ma'am. Thank you and you yield. Just two questions so it looks like this is a non-profit organization. That's right. That we would be supporting officially with the state support. Is that, do we normally do that? Is there in the other so we do that? There are no preparations to be made in accordance with this bill. This is this would just encourage economic development tourism to promote the South East Georgia Stokebox Derby as a means of increasing tourism. It also would designate it as the official Stokebox Derby of the state. That's all that it does. In due yield for just one more question. What kind of minority participation is in this bill, meaning African-Americans, women, people of different generations? Anyone of any race, male, female, doesn't matter as long as they're between the proper ages, they are welcome to participate in the South Box Derby. Okay, but do you know if there's not any numbers for you there on that? Lady Eale for at least one more. Yes sir. I will. Representative Ridley Hughes from the sixth district of Georgia to your extreme right has a question. Good morning. Does General Letty yield? I do yield. Since I actually read the bill, I actually know what's in the bill, but there is one thing I don't know what's in the bill. Can you explain to me, you said, South Boxes and you drive these cars, is that correct? You do drive these cars. Well, how many South Boxes does it take to build a car like picking up for me and representing Donald Deride in? More than or currently available in the state of Georgia. The Lady of Eale for one more question, it comes from a veteran driver, a veteran driver. Reptile Seaball is recognized for a question to your left. Does the Lady of Eale? Of course. Is it not true that many NASCAR Cup champions started their career racing, so Box Derby? I'm not aware of that. Is that true? And will you yield for one more question? Absolutely. Is it not true that two of my children raised in Akron, Ohio and one of my children came in second place in the world championships in 2005? Excellent. Thank you. I can see why you're awarded all those accolades that you were that a representative card or mentioned earlier. Mr. Speaker, if those are all of the questions, I would absolutely love to yield this well and ask for your favorable consideration of this bill. Thank you. The Lady has yielded the well. She has about a dozen more, but you'll can see her after we adjourn, after we adjourn. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Those are. For what purpose does representative Al Williams rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true? Do you have an inquiry? I do. Parliamentary inquiry, please. Stature inquiry. Is it not true that I support this bill because as a youngster reading Boy's Life magazine in the late 50s, I wanted to participate and was told that I could not get an application because I was the wrong color and I want any kid who wants to run in the soapbox therapy to be able to do so. I'm sure the gentleman knows what he states and the lady answered positively about the participation in the soapbox now. Thank you for the question. For what purpose does representative Wade rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true that NASCAR Hall of Famer bill Elliott and also his son Chase Elliott from District 9 who I represent support this bill but also want to encourage folks to consider tourism about young racers and older racers in northeast Georgia as well. If the gentleman so states we know that Dawsonville is the center of the universe when it comes to winners especially the those two guys that you mentioned I've heard of them I think that's while building Chase and Chase his son so good folks. For what purpose is representative Holly rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Mr. Speaker is not true that my seatmate doing the claim just told me he was the champion of soapbox derbies but I think if he tried to restart his career he might just be all washed up. If the gentleman so states for what purpose does representative Williamson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Mr. Speaker is not true that although the representative did a fantastic job of explaining her major measure she failed to remind this House of Representatives that this is her first bill House of Representatives bill that she's cared in this chamber is that not true? If the gentleman so states you're first bill you sure have been to the well a lot over the years a couple years to be your first bill so we'll see if you get congratulated they may be changing the board they may be changing the board we have one final parliament inquiry for what purpose does representative Bentley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that I am hungry and ready to go to lunch and this bill has nothing to do with the funeral home business doesn't it? If the lady so speaks shall this bill now pass we've done that all of y'all got me mixed up now your first bill is almost mine have all members voted if so the clerk will a lot the machine on the passage of the bill the yeas were 168 the nay zero the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is thereby passed for what purpose does representative chairman Hetchet rise?
