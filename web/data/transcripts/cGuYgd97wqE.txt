----------
You
You
Do you want to point out the scoreboard here?
And I want to give the house props, y'all close the gap today, pass them, yeah, give
them a hand.
Yeah, they passed three bills today to R2 so they did close that gap 62 to 12
That's good stuff. We're proud of y'all
Proud of you guys and all the hard work you do
All right, let's get going. I know everybody's hungry
We're on this page
Let's get their preparations chairman up there first. I'm home
I don't know, use a little privilege here.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
All of your questions.
Do you want to grill me?
For the first time.
For the first time to get to present the bill.
Let me think about it.
We've been really studying those Senate bills
for a long time.
That's why it's taking us so long.
They're real difficult bills.
This is not a difficult bill.
You know St. Paddy's days tomorrow, right?
I do, but I wasn't going to be able to show you
this green jacket tomorrow, so I had to wear it.
Did you win the masters?
Well, you know, I keep waiting on my invitation,
and I will never get one.
I will never get one.
Me too.
I've got House Bill 493.
What House Bill 493 will do is it will allow
your nurses at veterans' hospitals
to be able to have the same privileges other nurses
at state licensed hospitals when it comes to their continuing
education, they will be able to use $500 worth of work
at their VA's as their continuing education.
Other nurses are able to do that and VA's are not,
the nurses at VA's are not able to do that.
It's a simple little fix and it really is a simple bill.
is a simple bill. Okay, I've heard that before. Yes, Senator Deegan.
It's number two. Mr. Chairman, you said VA's. Is that just VA's? It's not the state veteran
hospitals. It's veteran federally operated veterans and ministers and it also includes
FUHC's also. Now you've got no, you don't have another. You got any other ones on here?
I've just got a little bill that happens to be in the Senate as HB19 and hopefully y'all
might be voting on that one day next week.
Can you give us a two hour presentation on the budget, please?
It's a really good budget.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, that sounds good.
Thank you.
Any questions for the chairman of Appropriations?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Congratulations.
All right, back up to the top.
Colonel Hitchens, HB 35.
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right, Senator Watson,
you're gonna cover that for him, aren't you, right?
His wife is much more irons than anybody in the room,
so he's heading to Savannah and he asked
if I would be able to discuss the bill.
This has to do with the George Ports Authority,
expanding their ability to take care of things on port
and one mile thereof has to do.
He's presented this bill several times.
Yes, yes.
That's about it.
I'll be happy to answer any questions.
Well, now I do want to report as well that his shirt today
was much more palatable.
So I don't think he'd mind me sharing that since he
pointed out to me.
He did look good today.
All right.
Any questions for the Senate sponsor?
All right.
HP 76, representative of Powell, that is me.
What are we doing?
Oh yeah, this is our marriage license bill
and removing Gork from existence.
Any questions?
HP 76, second on your page.
Page one.
Gork.
Georgia Occupational Review, something, something, commission or councilor, it
doesn't matter. We're renaming it toast. All right. HB 80 is Senator Kennedy, but he
actually asked since he wasn't here today, you wanted us to put a hold on this.
we're just going to put a little hold on that. Hold. All right. Representative
Wade, are you with us? Hey, you are. Come on up the podium. Tell us about. You know,
HB91. Thank you, Chairman. This bill actually passed out of this body last year. We're bringing it
back this year. We just ran out of time on Sinidod. This bill does two things. It requires
Executors and executive tricks is to provide notice to beneficiaries just like
they're required to receive notice if they're an air. And the second piece is
it cleans up language so that if you have an investment account or a brokerage
account which you have a name to beneficiary that that would be treated just
like a savings account checking account within the banking world. All of the banks
and banking groups wanted this including credit unions and so I'm happy to
and answer any questions, appreciate your favorable consideration.
Committee y'all at real engaged today, are we a little tired?
Into the week.
Can I get a little...
We have been working hard this week, so...
Any questions for the author?
Thank you, Representative Wade.
Thank you, and I believe the chairman of the committee is on the leader...
Bo Hatch to carry this on the Senate, should you put it on the floor?
Thank you.
Is this a Governor's bill?
Governor's bill, but the Governor's supported me continue to finish the drill for this.
It's really important back home and I think it's going to benefit anybody that wants to
leave their assets to their church, their philanthropic group, or their family.
Thanks.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
Representative Corbett, you with us.
There you are.
Come on up, boss man.
HB120's.
Fifth on our sheet.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, when you're ready.
House Bill 120 is two Department of Driver Services Bill that was combined, 120 and 167,
so they now both are on House Bill 120.
First part of the bill has to deal with child support.
It allows a person that may have fallen behind to receive a temporary driving permit to
go back into the work.
They currently do not have that option now.
And then the state for the record, somebody that doesn't pay child support, I have them.
They'll have a whole lot of sympathy for it.
But if they can't get back into the work, they can earn living to pay that child support.
So this is a request from DDS.
The second part of the bill is some cleanup language from a bill that's passed in 2020.
There's a bill that removed the language that prohibited someone.
It was charged with a DUI drug charge from receiving early reinstatement or limited driving
permit.
But the permissive language was omitted from that bill.
So they're doing it now, they just don't feel like they want to be codified to what they're
actually doing.
So it's just some clean up language.
So that's what we're doing with this bill, sir.
Codify, love that word.
Any questions for the author?
All right.
You did such a great job.
There's no questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Representative Crowe, are you with us?
There you are.
Come on up.
What do you want to codify?
Well, I want to codify a lot of things, Mr. Chairman, but right now I want to update
the population bracket that identifies Butts County.
This bill we had last year, it couldn't quite get through at the end as well, but every
10 years we have to update the population bracket on here that identifies Butts County
to allow Georgia power, lease lot holders on Jackson Lake to file homestead exemption.
So there's something that's been done every 10 years since prior to the 80s, so just simply
what it does.
Good week to have a bracket bill.
Yes sir.
Senator Calder.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
What is the current residence of Butts County?
It is 25,400 in some change, so we're putting it between 25, 4 and 25, 5, so.
Great.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Great question.
Senator Robertson, you look like something's on your mind.
Do we have any statewide elected officials
who are from Butts County?
Yes, sir.
We have one statewide elected official who
is an office downstairs.
OK, and we have one federal elected official from there,
also, who in the 10th congressional district.
Mr. Representative, I didn't ask you about federal officials,
but are you, is it not true that you're
Lieutenant Governor's floor leader in the House.
I've not been designated now.
I believe Jason Ridley claimed that title before I got it,
sir.
What are you looking at me for?
See if you want to be saying anything else.
Any other questions?
Ah.
Sir Doza.
Be it from Butts County, Mr. Rep.
given your relationship with the Tenant Governor. I'm wondering if you have any
commentary on the utter domination that's being portrayed by the Senate in
terms of workload and the Paltry workload that's being done across the hall.
Well it does look a little bit one-sided right now but I assure you that a lot of
works being done on the other side of the hall and I feel real certain we're
going to catch up.
Oh hold on let me recognize Vice Chairman. Go ahead Vice Chairman.
I'm not real good at math or statistics, but I think there's 56 over there in 180 on
that side.
So for me, y'all got more than three to one on us on why the hell are y'all getting
to work done?
Hey, watch the language.
There are so many of us that take so long to get us all together, I reckon, so we're
together now and we've had a lot of meetings.
All right.
Well, why don't you go to a committee meeting and pass a few more?
You did a good job, President.
I will do that.
You're bracket.
I didn't pick anybody and I didn't do a bracket this year.
I went Guinness Hall State.
Yeah I went to Mercer and I think we did the best we're ever going to do a few years
going to beat Duke in the first round so I don't know.
No bad.
So I'd also asked for House Bill 139 too when I requested this one.
It didn't make it on the sheets so I didn't know if that was...
139?
Yes sir.
We'll go ahead and tell us about it.
That is a GBI bill that we also had last year.
And what it does is it adds non-sworn employees.
It gives them the same protection as sworn employees
of a law enforcement agency have,
as far as not having to give out their personal address,
phone number, as a witness on a witness list,
in prosecution.
So, and I think Senator Albers
is going to be carrying that one.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Senator, or anything else?
All right, good job.
Representative Laveritt, did you want to come up
and talk about HB80, I know Kennedy wasn't here,
but if you'd like to come discuss that,
we can do that.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that very much.
Thank you, members of the committee.
HB80 is a bill that was supported by the state bar.
It's approved by the Board of Governors.
The Genesis was the Atlanta International
arbitration society, this bill would allow an unnoterized statement that is in a proper
form to tell the person signing it that they're doing so underpindly a perjury to be admissible
in a civil case, but only if the person signing is outside the United States.
So the idea is that it's very difficult when you're outside the U.S. to get something
noterized.
You have to go to an embassy and have a consular vice consul sign it, requires an appointment.
they often can't keep the appointment, it takes months,
and this would just simplify that process,
but still achieve the same result
as the notarized statement of it being made
under penalty perjury.
Are you a lawyer?
I am, it's really exciting stuff in it, Mr. Chairman.
Very exciting, what kind of lawyer?
I do mostly whills and probate
and some real estate closings and that sort of thing.
Okay, cool.
That's good, Mr. Chairman.
Ah, question.
Senator Dolezal.
You say you're a lawyer, Secretary?
Yes, yes, Mr. Senate.
Pretty much representing a spoke of what it sounds like
just a challenge of the House to get through
and understand our sophisticated bills.
Do you think that you could help your members
work on the enemic level of work that's being done
over there and increase the output a little bit?
Senator Doesall, I'm working every day
to throw Senate bills out of committees.
I'm trying to get them on the floor as best I can.
Well, we send them out into the rules committee.
I don't have, that's above my pay grant.
I can't control it above there.
Yes, pass, I would say.
Mercedes, I can't, what's that number?
Oh well, 62 to 12.
Do you have any further comment on 62 to 12?
We can't count that high in the house center.
That may be part of the problem, so.
Oh, good answer.
I understand that it's all becoming more clear, Mr. Represented.
Thank you very much.
Well, I take my shoes off.
I can go up to 10, but otherwise.
If you all can't tell, Senator Dole's
I was a little hot about this.
I sense, Mr. Chairman.
little hot. We're trying to calm him down though. All right, well, any other questions?
Thank you, Representative Lever. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right,
Representative Daniel, Representative Reese, for Representative Daniel. Yes, Mr. Chair.
All right. I'd like you to kind of explain this situation, because we never really got into
this. Yes. So, Representative Daniels bill. Yes, sir. But you keep coming to present it. So
walked me through this.
Yes, sir.
We're trying to work together.
Are you okay?
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
My wife was docked the other day.
I was second week of, and she was presented over in the Senate.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
I'm happily married.
Dr. Chasigaro's.
Okay.
Is this her bill?
No, it's not her bill.
It's in it.
It's in it.
I'm representative Danielsville.
But we try to work together in the house.
And I did share your message yesterday, sir.
I told them everything that you said.
And that's maybe probably why we had one extra today, but we plan to do more.
do more as the days progress. We've got to work on it. Hey.
Robes and Rees, you got a call before you walk. Yes, sir.
All right. Well, now that we got all that straight. Yes,
sir. Why don't you tell us about. Absolutely. Once again,
for 175 is two main sections to a section to basically establish
revenue sharing for some existing tags. Kaffa Poseidon Alpha
Viola. But most importantly, section one established tags for our
Constitution officers, all of our Constitution officers, right now the
ad commission as well as the public service commissioners are left out and we
want them to be to be a part of and as is importantly stated each person pays
for the own tax so the state is not pan for this and the revenue share and
brings revenue to the state Mr. Chairman. Okay. Oh yeah lots of questions. Lots of
questions. Okay. Thank you representative. So yes sir. When you came for
committee and you agreed to let me amend this bill you agreed to let me amend
bill it's not even yours. Why have permission to do so? I have permission to do so.
Really? I'm an attorney as well. Yes sir. I have permission to do so. I mean in fairness
we've done that on this side. And total fairness I was going to do it anyway.
I have supported so I'm on our side. I've been done that way. So yes sir. Okay. I'm trying to
work with you, Senator. I'm not your opposition. I mean y'all got my permission to
I mean, any of these of you all, just kidding.
All right, any further questions?
For representing a breeze.
Yeah, I got to tell you, I got fired one time,
but I got named Teddy Reese, so.
But I like you better.
Yeah, it introduced me to a My Handling for you.
Now, I'm out of the record.
Thank you for having me fired, but anyway.
I just say by him one time. I didn't say I only got fired one time. All right, y'all
quit talking about old stuff. HB 183 Representative Barton, are you with us? Senator
Payne's with us, come on up. I guess Representative Barton's over here working on our
Senate bills. And I can find it shocking to believe that you could have ever
gotten fired from a job. You know I got all your bills out of here. This is
House Bill 183. This is a Department of Revenue bill passed through the Senate
last year and just makes replaces terms temporary license plate with temporary
operating permit and revise the standards for issuing temporary operating
permits from motor vehicles. It's not a real complicated bill. We passed last year
and just asked to move to this year. Okay. Any questions for the Senate sponsor? Thank
you, Senator. Great presentation. HB193 Representative Anderson. Come on up. You been here
before handy. Well not this year no sir. Okay. Thank you sir and House Bill
193 basically it raises the project cost threshold for compliance with
Georgia's local government public works law from $100,000 to $250,000. The
$100,000 was set when the public works law was initially put in place over
twenty-three years ago and has not been adjusted since okay any questions so
two thousand was last time yes sir good bill good bill all right no
questions. Great job. All right, HP 2-0-7 is represented roads. I didn't see
them out there. Senator Anderson, you want to cover that for us? I don't know.
This is another department bill. This is a department bill and this is just a
bill upgrading to the type lighting that a vessel's supposed to have at
night. It also does something with drunk, drunk boating, doesn't it?
Do you know that you cannot leave? Did you all know current law, if you, if you
crash your boat, you just have to report it within 48 hours. This is updating
that is updating this way you got to stay on the swing. Yep. I think that's good
bill. All right. Any questions? No questions. Senator
Amber Tarty, you know tomorrow is St. Patty's day, right? That's
you want to make sure you knew? Yeah, I heard you, Mr. Chair,
when you told the house appropriation. I want to make sure you
heard me. Although I wish I could get invited to Augusta.
Senator Anderson can help us with that
Maybe a roles committee
Lunch there with egg salad sandwiches and chicken salad sandwiches. It'll be great. I
Won't put you in charge of that committee
All right, let's see represent corporate. Did you you could have covered them both?
I'm sorry. I'm not hitting on all of a sudden. I've been waiting a long week sir. I understand go ahead hot house bill 340
It's came through education committee
Criteria we tried to work on this year was the literacy student achievement and school safety
We work with the superintendents association principles and all the different organizations representing teachers
We define what a planning period is we protect that planning period, but at the same time we give the
the school, the superintendents principles,
the option to use them one day a week if they need to,
or if there's an emergency, they can pull them at any time.
So working with them, it addresses what we want to work on
in education this year, and that's what the bill does.
All right, good bill, any questions?
Hearing none, thank you.
All right, HB 373, I'll cover this one.
It's simply making September 11th, first responders appreciation day.
Representative Jones has been up here multiple times, and Senator James has come up multiple times, and so I told her I'd cover that, so we could spare her the trouble.
any questions? Hearing none. All right. Representative Blackman, HB414.
Come on up. There, Mr. Chairman, how are you today? I'm good, Mr. Chairman. How about
you, sir? I'm good. How are them young, that young and... We had a great time at
T-Bull last night.
Actually.
Thank you.
How are yours?
They're alive.
How's it going to school today, so I'm a little worried.
I don't know what happened to you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the committee, before you house Bill 414, which would create a Veterans Mental
Health Service Program, which is a matching grant program, now up under the Department
of veteran services, it would match private investment in our state to help our service
members their families and veterans and their families with any mental health issues.
Happy to answer any questions? Any questions?
Senator Dulles, I'll cherry black with a cherry of a powerful committee over there in
the house. It's all relative, Mr. Chairman.
Do you serve on the rules committee as well?
Indeed, I do, yes, sir.
Can you help us understand this tremendous disparity
between the workload that's happening in the Senate
versus the poultry, anemic, almost non-existent workload,
apparently, that's happening over there in the house?
Well, hold on now, and I get 12.
I believe is that a bill and a half a day, Mr. Chairman?
I mean, that's about a bill and a half a count, besides us.
I learned new things every time I venture over into the Senate environment and so I appreciate
what I'm learning here today and we'll do all I can.
Are you learning how to get a 62-day measure?
Okay.
Oh, we got more questions.
They're doing it.
I just sent you a learning stuff.
Did you know that they're going to shut down the hospitality suite over there until y'all
get called up?
The house gets called up with the Senate.
fighting words where where is the hospital this week any of the center of
us and you like something on your mind go ahead no sir I just love sitting
back and watching my elders joust with each other you have no
elders in this room all right oh center of still I know that the the chair over
There's a really good at math.
And so if he could take back to his membership,
that we have passed out more bills
that we have members.
And if they could even do half as good as that over
in their side, I think we could probably accept that.
That's a good final next year, we're hoping.
You know, in fairness, the Ways and Means Committee
has passed out every Senate bill
that was passed over to us.
Not only that, three out to you.
You know for that might just put your bill on from Monday.
We'll see.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
All right.
Thank you.
Representative Reeves.
HB444.
First bill.
First bill.
First bill.
First down to rules.
First down to rules.
Well, well, well.
Great to be here in the Senate Rules Committee, Chairman Brass, House Bill 4404.
House bill 444 if it looks familiar it's because it is this is a bill that
passed the Senate last year regarding Liz pendants. Liz pendants means a
lawsuits pending this gives some procedures and ground rules and allows a
judge to cancel the Liz pendants at an early stage of the case if it's
inappropriate to be filed and cloud-up title would be glad to answer any
questions. Chairman Strickland's the Senate sponsor.
I recognize a lot of folks here on Rules Committee from House Judiciary and Judiciary
non-civil from bills we passed on this week.
We've been working hard for the sit down there.
We don't have a non-civil, do we?
No, we got rid of that one.
That committee's with Gork.
All right.
We're going to be.
I'll tell Chairman Smith.
Okay, any questions for the freshman representative on his first bill in rules?
Senator Albert, you were like something that's just eaten at you.
Mr. Chairman, it's an honor.
Number three.
I'm on your own.
Speaking to the mic.
I've known the good representative for some time.
In fact, he tried a couple times to make it right here into the Senate.
He did.
He did.
But I'm glad to see he made it in any way to the House.
to settle. That's okay. Great to be here at this August committee today. I do have a bill
over there and Judy and Judy non-civil. Maybe you could help me get that. Look forward to hearing it
and I appreciate you fighting gangs in Georgia. Thank you. We need to get them. We need to send them
out. Gangbuster. Thank you. They train them well over there. So there wasn't. Did you have
Okay. Nothing else for the freshman representative on his first bill.
Thanks so much. Thank you. I guess we'll just haze Senator Strickland on the floor.
All right. Representative Hatchett, where I did 493, HB 541, Representative Lomston, are you with us? Senator Robertson, can you cover that force?
Mr. Chair, remember in this bill it deals with the safe passing of
motor mail carriers and other delivery vehicles that stop on the roads almost
if you will such as a move over law to protect the individuals driving down
the road and the individuals making the deliveries. So basically they got to
get over if you can't just slow down. Yes, sir. You impressed I knew that. Yes,
sure. I'll put some press. All right. Any questions? No questions? All right.
Representative Cannon. You are with us. You're not with us. I represent
Senator Watson. Are you with us? The same Watson. Not the Ben Watson. Come on up,
Senior Wright. Sorry about my replacement not being here this afternoon. He peeled
on out of town I think with with his citrus commission bill. But this is
creating the Georgia Citrus Commission. We have 12 or 14 of these
commissions already with all the ag commodities that we grow and produce in
our state. So what's one more? So what's one more? They're voluntary, they're used
to raise funds for that specific commodity to marketing research promotion so they're
very valuable and we've also put a lot of money in the budget for the Citrus Commission
in this last cycle so this will just kind of help supplement some of those positions
going forward.
Can you name all the Citrus brews that would be included under this commission?
I cannot.
Sapsumas.
What is that?
They're like a tangerine.
Oh.
Like a kitty?
an industry in our state. That's about I can tell you. Senator Roberts. Senator I appreciate
you coming up bringing this this incredibly complicated piece of legislation. Is there
a commission for blueberries? There is. And what is it called? Blueberry commission. So that
was the answer I was looking for. So is there a strawberry commission? I don't think so. But there's
There's a Georgia-grown commission that collects a lot of the other smaller.
But there's a standalone blueberry commission.
For sure there is, yes sir.
Who's the chair of that?
We'd have to ask the senator from the eighth I believe.
Do you think there's a good chance he may be?
He might be.
Yeah.
Thank you senator.
Yep.
Thank you.
Are you on to do a floor amendment for the Strawberry Commission?
You're reading my mind Mr. Chairman.
How about pomegranates?
get a pomegranate commission. We can always
amend it on the floor, Mr. Jim.
All right. Thank you.
Is this your first time to send it rules?
It is.
Hey, what took you so long? I'm glad I wouldn't slide by.
Representative Franklin, I saw it. Yeah, there we go.
You want to come up and tell us about something?
Something on your mind?
Yes sir, I appreciate this opportunity.
I know I'm on the schedule, but I want to talk to you
about House Bill 285 and this retirement bill basically
is some to extend the employment retirement systems
for alternative investments to 5% to 10%.
It's very similar to Albert's bill that he passed,
or that helped pass to retirement.
I'm just a mere freshman in this thing, but I guarantee that when I go over to the committees, I will put a talk to everybody I can get this bill through.
What's that building ever center?
So it's one to twelve.
Well, when you pass a hundred bills out of the Senate, you got your odds are a lot better.
Where?
This is a relationship business.
You remember that young Padawan.
Patawon.
I will.
Thank you, sir.
Is this your first time rules?
It is.
Oh.
Oh.
First time.
So.
Well, so your bill did not make the yellow sheet just, I'm educating you and, um, so committee,
I want you all to review his bill over the weekend and we'll reconvene on Monday and see
what we want to do as a committee.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Work the committee.
Make them work me.
All right, anybody else out there?
Any other representatives or senators
that would like to speak on behalf of Georgia and America?
OK.
Well, let's pick a few.
Where am I?
I mean I still got you up but I feel like you're going to wave again. You can. You have
that right. But I'll remind you the ways of mains chairman, aren't you ways of mains
chairman, has moved every Senate bill. This is true. This is true. All three of them.
I was also impressed that Representative Reese mentioned that his hard work resulted in
and the net plus one.
Ah, I mean, very fair.
That bill that he's representing for somebody else.
But Mr. Chairman, I'm no dummy.
I see Chairman Hatchett on here with House Bill 493.
And I think that's the one I'm going to go with.
493 for the appropriations chairman.
Let me circle that.
All right, Senator Wett.
Thank you.
No room on the ten.
Thank you, B.C.
Thank you, Maverick.
I mean, Lieutenant.
I mean, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I ask unanimous consent that we pull...
You're a little too formal.
Just pick one.
Okay.
Hold on just a second.
just second here. I had it right here. 373. 373. Good one.
Senator James might give you a big ol' hug for that one.
All right. Dr. Watson.
House bill 35. House bill 35.
