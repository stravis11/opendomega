TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good evening. My name is Sonia Halpern. I'm a Georgia State Senator for our
State's 39th Senate District. The Atlanta District I represent is one of the
most socio-economically diverse districts in the state of Georgia and I'm so
glad we got to hear from the president tonight. It's important for Congress and
the American people to hear directly from President Trump. President Trump won
the 2024 presidential election, and many cite his campaign promise to lower costs for American
families as the reason for his victory. Fast forward to today, that campaign promise has been
broken, and unfortunately that means many of my constituents will feel or are already feeling
the economic consequences of the Trump administration's agenda. We just listen to President Trump talk
about making America great again, but great for whom, for his billionaire buddies, because
his plans so far have been disastrous for Georgians. Already 1,300 CDC employees in Georgia
have been laid off. Already, Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China will raise the
price on everyday essentials like monthly utilities, groceries, and gas. Already, Georgia
farmers are panicking as Trump is levying tariffs against any produce they export. You heard
that right? He said, and I quote, to the great farmers of the United States, get ready to
be making a lot of agricultural product to be sold inside the United States.
will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun. Have fun. There's nothing fun or
funny about penalizing Georgia peanut or peach or blueberry farmers who sell some other
produce to other countries. It's only been a month and a half and already the stock market
has plunged and the Atlanta Fed is now projecting negative GDP growth for first quarter. Enough
already. Mr. President, there is a single mom here in Georgia with two children who was
just laid off from the CDC in spite of sterling performance reviews. Without her job, how
will she make a monthly rental or mortgage payment? How will she feed her family? How will
her family's health care needs be met? Trump and Musk have stopped or slashed over $100
dollars in research funding in Georgia. This funding goes to universities, hospitals,
and nonprofits in our state. There are researchers at Emory working on a cure for Alzheimer's
disease and cures for cancer. People are studying whooping cough in children at the University
of Georgia and lung cancer at Morehouse School of Medicine. Hope for a cure has now been classified
as waste. This is bad for our country period. It makes us weak and sick and exhausted.
One would hope that the U.S. Congress would stand up for Americans and do their job to provide
a critical check-in balance on Trump and his co-president, Elon Musk, the richest man
on Earth. Instead, the U.S. House just passed a budget to gut health care and make it harder
for people to put food on the table.
Thanks to Trump and Musk's reckless agenda,
that means gutting health care for 2 million Georgians.
In Georgia, 65% of Medicaid recipients are children.
Half of all childbirths are covered by Medicaid
and three-quarters of seniors in nursing homes
rely on Medicaid enough already.
I am all for reducing wasteful spending.
But the way to do that is with a scalpel, not a machete,
or a chainsaw, as Elon must jokingly wield it on stage
recently after threatening to cut the benefits
for our farmers, our seniors, children, and veterans.
These are people's lives and livelihoods,
and the uncertainty hurts Georgia families.
America's health and well-being is in jeopardy.
We don't want planes falling out of the sky.
We don't want bird flu ravaging the country
because must took his chainsaw to the CDC.
And we certainly don't want grandma
getting kicked out of her nursing home.
Enough already.
Tonight Trump proclaimed a dawning of a golden age.
Tell that to the 21,000 Georgians
that have filed for unemployment since Trump took office.
I am calling on my party, who are my colleagues and friends
to stop being distracted by the politics of division.
Now is the time to stay focused.
Now is the time to do everything in our power
to bring down the cost for American families,
protect their jobs, and grow our economy.
As Georgians, a people would so much to offer
in a history of setting powerful examples
for the rest of the country, we deserve better.
At the state level, I will keep working hard
to pass legislation that will improve our education system,
bring down the cost of health care,
and protect livable wages.
I care deeply about making sure that working hard
can ensure a better life for Georgia families
and for families across our country.
And that hard work will be rewarded,
not discarded on the altar of Doge's destruction.
I am hopeful that amidst the chaos in Washington,
our state leaders will join me in saying enough already.
We must work together to find solutions
to the real and pressing challenges
that families face each and every day.
Thank you.
