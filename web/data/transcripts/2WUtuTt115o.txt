Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 22nd House District West Ken Trail. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Since I'm not running for re-election, this introduction will be quite brief. I'm happy to introduce you today to Pastor Jeremy Morton. He is the pastor of the first Baptist Church of Westauk, Georgia. He became our pastor about three and a half years ago, doing a tremendous job. He's a great friend to me and he's my boss. Let me tell you how great of a friend he is. I turned 60 a few months back and decided to celebrate my birthday by jumping out of an airplane with a parachute. My pastor, being the man of faith that he is, joined me on that adventure. We had a great time together in the Trekelli's District that day. So with no further ado, I introduce you to Pastor Jeremy Morton. Thank you, Wes. God bless you, ladies and gentlemen. Jesus told a story in Luke 189 to people it says that trusted in their righteousness and had a tendency to look down on others. The story basically went like this. It was Sunday morning at the first Baptist Church and a silver haired 81-year-old woman came shuffling down the center aisle. She had her cane in one hand and her Bible in the other. She took her seat in the pew where she sat every Sunday and had with perfect attendance for over 50 years. She knew every line to every stanza of every hymn. She gave her offering and she contributed to the building fund and the mission fund. She made certain that her prayer list was accurate and current. She even took notes and followed along with the sermon. But about midway through the sermon, she turned to a sister sitting on her pew and said, what's become of our church? You see that man up in the choir loft? His son just entered rehab. Look at the usher at the door where I came through. I heard he's going through a divorce. And look at that girl over there. Shame on her. She's a teenager, not even married and she's already pregnant. And if you heard about our Deacon Chairman, I heard he and his wife are having problems. And based on the way she's been dressed, I'm not surprised. But also in church that day, late and embarrassed, a young man came slinking in and he sat on the back row. He was embarrassed because he still had alcohol on his breath from the night before. He'd been in and out of gangs. He'd been in and out of prison. He had tattoos up and down both arms and on one side of his neck. He was embarrassed that he had multiple children by multiple women. And the girl he was living with, he wouldn't marry to her. But at the end of the sermon, the young man buried his head in his hands and all he could say is his head pounded that pew in front of him. Oh God, I'm sorry for my sins. Just become of me, oh God, please forgive me and you're mercy. Make me a new man. The silver haired 81 year old woman with her cane in the Bible, she left church and the young man left church. They left at the same time that day, but only one went home right with God. Jesus says this in the final statement of the story about the Pharisee and the tax collector. He said be mindful of this. Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled. But all those who humble themselves, at the proper time, God will exalt them. I don't know that any of us can fix anything in George of ourselves. But if we'll humble ourselves and tell God how much we need him and how sorry we are for all the things we've become apart from him, today might be the day that he exalts his name and gives us and blesses us with what only he can give us. God in heaven, thank you for Luke 1814. Today would you help us to humble ourselves? We have nothing that's not an extension of your gracious, merciful love toward us. Everything we have is because of you. Forgive us of our pride. Forgive us of our smug self-righteousness. Especially forgive us when down deep in our hearts, we look at other people when we don't even know a fraction of the story and we judge them. Oh God, forgive us and thank you that you don't treat us like we've often treated you and other people. Clothe us with humility and mercy and a pure heart that can only come from Christ our Savior. We commit to you this day in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's say the pledge together. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, God bless you. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Chair recognizes representatives Bentley, Chairman Chokus, Dean Smiley and Representative Al Williams on a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I ask that you please join me in a moment of silence. Join Chairman Chokus and myself for a moment of silence and memory of the life and legacy of Larry Smith, the mayor of Montezuma, Georgia, the home of the late state representative, Lynn Moore James. Mayor Smith passed away this weekend and we just want to take a moment to recognize his life and legacy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, members of the House. Chair recognizes representative Butler for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a rough week and a half in the Columbus and the Valley area. We have lost a number of leaders. We lost, as you know, Taubert County, Prebert Judge Sherrell Terry, DOT Board Member Russ Caraker, former commanding general of Fort Benning, Samuel Websel, General Samuel Websel, excellent surgeon, compassionate and kind community leader, Dr. David Varner, and a volunteer extraordinaire, fun loving, kind and generous centerian, Ms. Effie Bowers. At her 100th birthday on November the 19th, she said 99 and a half is just not good enough. Go 400th. If any of you would like to sign these resolutions, please see me. And now if we could honor all of these fine people with a moment of silence, prayer, thanking God for them being in our lives and for their families. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Sam Watson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just need to let the record show that I love my wife, Emily Watson, happy anniversary tomorrow, 16 years. Thank you, love you, love you and the girls, and thank you what you do to support our family, especially while I'm away. Love you, Bob. Thank you, Bob. Smart man. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I bring you eight-year-old Brody. Brody is a loving and energetic child who likes to run, watch Paw Patrol, and every other cartoon he can find. He enjoys playing and watching football, basketball, and soccer. At school where he gets along well with other kids, he enjoys recess and learning about math. And while I'm up here as a point of personal order, my anniversary of 25 years was in November. So since we'll never be here then, happy anniversary, happy anniversary, Eddie Hutchinson. Thank you, Bob. Chair recognizes Representative Park for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to question the integrity of the proceedings of this House per House Rule 40.3. The actions taken by the majority to usurp local control and allow politicians from around the state to draw local maps for Gunect demonstrate incredible disrespect to the nearly one million residents of Gunect County, whom I serve and fight for. It is my hope that this body upholds the principle of local control, of home rule, and trying in our state constitution during this, during the last redistricting cycle, all local redistricting was treated as local redistricting, as local legislation. What's changed? Why these targeted exceptions that undermine the integrity of this House? I urge the members of this body to do the right thing, respect the will of the people, respect local control and pass Gunect's maps. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative, I think it's possible to disagree without questioning the integrity of this body. If you feel otherwise, then we'll talk about that. I don't question the integrity of any member, regardless of party, regardless of issue. Chair, recognize this representative McClain for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, I've been in this house nine years, and I live in Gunect County for 45 years. And one of my saying is what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong. And what we did on day five was wrong as two left shoes. We had Gunect had an open and transparent and inclusive process. We had five open houses, two public hearings. We made sure Gunect voices were heard. The people who went and supported this map, the chamber supported this map. We gave the delegation three weeks to eat the coming compromise and do whatever they wanted to do with this map. There's a 1 million people that live in Gunect County. And what we've got to do is make sure those people are heard. Those voices are heard in Gunect County. The people have the power and we've got to realize that. And November is coming. And I can assure you, and I can assure you this much, I will make sure that the people of Gunect County know. To recognize this representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In this body, we work by a set of rules that are meant to maintain order and exemplify respect for each member and their respective constituencies. I know we all get a rule book at the beginning of session, but in case you haven't read it or you've forgotten what it says, I want to draw attention to rule 18. Part one compels to get delegations to submit rules about signatures required to pass local bills to the chair of intergovernmental coordination. Parts two says as long as a delegation meets those requirements, their bills will be favorably reported. Part three states that bills that have met these requirements cannot be changed. These are the rules which we all agree to. So if that is the case, then why is one of the most diverse delegations in this body representing the most diverse county in the state being subjected to a different set of rules than what we have all agreed to for local legislation? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I recognize this representative. Will Lensky for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker. One of the reasons we all serve as our families, families at top priority of Georgians, we work to support and strengthen Georgia families. But today I'm going to share that there are branches of my family tree that do not exist anymore. I gave a similar speech a couple years ago, but many are new to this body, so it's a little different. I want you to know that my great grandmother had 10 brothers and sisters. I should have had I should have 50 to 100 more cousins, but seven of those 11 siblings and 42 of my relatives were murdered in the Holocaust. 42. I was a student at Rose survived the Auschwitz death camp, so did my great Uncle Martin. I will never forget when I was about eight years old in my great Uncle Martin's apartment. I saw him go for a book and I saw the number on his arm. I was shot to see a tattoo on his arm, a tattoo that reduced him from a human to just a number. A tattoo that was imprinted on his body and soul in that concentration camp. I was a great international Holocaust remember and stay the day set aside the round the world to remember the Holocaust. It's not about the guilt or sadness or rehashing the past. It's a day to think about how and why the Holocaust happened. The story is not just about my family and the victims. We retell this story because it is an everlasting important reminder that genocides do not happen in countries that have democracies. They happen when democracies fail. It is a reminder that the Holocaust occurred because people, regular civilians and leaders made choices that allowed it to happen. They did not live up to their responsibilities to protect others, particularly those that were different than themselves. It's a reminder that as leaders as citizens, as just as humans, we have a wide circle of responsibility to others in our democracy. We must protect and nurture our democracy in each other. We must stand up for those who deserve our care and protection. The story of the Holocaust is a reminder of the six million Jewish people and millions of others because of their, who were killed because of their ethnicity, political beliefs, sexual orientation or religion. This was possible because of the silence or complicity of ordinary people. Alone, Adolf Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust. It could not have happened without the choices and silence made by individuals, organizations and government. It occurred because people did not speak out or act against prejudice and hate. It occurred because people did not protect their fellow citizens and their democracy. We must continue to teach the story of the Holocaust. We must speak out when confronted with racism, anti-Semitism and hate. We must remember that every word has consequences and just as important, every silence does as well. This session let us work in harmony to protect each other, protect our democracy, teach important historical lessons and let us fight every kind of hate and let's do it together and let's have one moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker. I yield the well. That completes our morning orders. We're now going on to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clark will read the caption to House Bill 841. House Bill 841, my resident of dollar, the 45th Cooper, the 43rd, Sustler 35th to be entitled to incorporate the city of Eastcom. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Government Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Matt dollar to present the bill. Thank you, Speaker. House Bill 841 is a simple measure that will allow for a referendum in part of unincorporated Cobb County to allow for those citizens to decide if they want to incorporate. That's it. It's a very simple proposition that we have before us. This is one of four bills that we currently have to incorporate cities in Cobb County. The other being lost mountain, Mavelton, and Vynings. I'm a proud co-sponsor of all three of those other bills and hope that they come to the floor very soon. The proposed city has met all the legal requirements as well as all the requirements set forth in the House Government, the Affairs Committee. The feasibility study was conducted by Georgia State and found it to be feasible and in fact that the city could run as surplus, all this without raising taxes. The bill you have before you is really a product of four years of community involvement, community engagement, community feedback. It's been a true community effort. The map, the governance structure, the services, everything about it really has changed significantly from when this was first introduced four years ago. That's been based 100% on community engagement and feedback that we've gotten throughout this process. The proposed city has just under 60,000 people and as you can see from the maps in front of you is very compact, very concise, and really represents a true community eventress. This is the area I've called Home My Entire Life and I can say that this is something that's really been I think lacking in the community. The services laid out in the bill are zoning code enforcement.

recent fire, Parks and Rec, and road maintenance. The governance structure, and I really want to focus on this area specifically because there's been change to this since we first passed it out of committee this being of the year. After that happened, it got kind of a bump and attention back home, and we received a lot of feedback and the organizers asked me if I could change it. And the answer was yes, we could pass it the way it was and send it over to Senate, and as we do with a lot of things and address it there. But I really wanted to try to keep this as cohesive as possible as it moved through the process. So I asked Chairman Smith to pull it out of rule senate back to committee. Chairman Taylor was very gracious to accommodate this change and the way it stands now is there are six council members in the city. The city is comprised of three districts, each with two posts. And the reason it's done this way is to ensure that there is a representation really from across the city. All members are elected city-wide, and there's four year staggered terms. The bill also calls for an elected mayor to the city. Again, four year term and also elected city-wide. The mayor would vote in case of a tie, but would not have veto power. And again, also has a limit of three years. This will be a city manager system. The bill calls for the referendum being May. And there's been, I think there's been a lot of questions about that. And the logic behind doing the May referendum, and I think that some of the other city hood initiatives share this as well. If we have it in May, then that would allow for the city to have its elections for council and mayor in November. That this avoids a special election next March, and also really gets the people who are going to be involved in running the city. It helps them get up to speed before the city even takes effect. So I feel it's a very logical and good way to do it. Now let me tell you what the bill is not. And I want to direct these comments, especially to my friends in the back of the chamber, because a lot of the misunderstandings about the bill is not just in here, but it's really running back home. And there's people actively spreading a lot of misinformation to try to confuse the issue. I know that that's hard to believe, but it's happening. So a couple of things I want to go over about what this bill is not. Is that it is not another layer of government. I think my history and my background on that is fairly well established. What this is doing is this is shifting very specific services to a level of government that is closer to the people. It will not raise taxes. In fact, the study suggests that the city could run out of surplus. So I want that to be crystal clear that this is not another layer. It does not increase the size of government. It does not affect schools. I think it's safe to claim that the majority of people that move into my community move there for the schools. I represent Walton and Pope High Schools. And this would have zero effect on schools. There are people that are saying that this would have an impact. I would not impact COP County schools at all. It will not impact where your kid goes to school. It just flatly has nothing to do with schools. Likewise, COP County seniors enjoy a property tax exemption on the school portion of their taxes. So if you're 62 and over in COP County, you can exempt that portion of your property tax. This in kind would have no effect on that as well. And I want that to be crystal clear. Really, Mr. Speaker, that is all my comments. That is the bill. I'm happy to take questions. You do have a question to yield? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Bennett to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with a gentleman yield. Yes, ma'am. Under this form of election, running, candidates running the citywide, how will this ensure representation from all the posts that are outlined within the city? I'm sorry. You're a little muffled. I'm having trouble. Can you hear me? How will the running, the elections, to be elected citywide? How will that ensure representation for each of the three posts that you've outlined? Okay, so for city council, you must reside in one of the three districts and each one has two posts. And the reason for a citywide election is we wanted to make sure that the council was accountable to the whole city because it's not a very large geographic area, but currently in the city there's a mega church and townhome development being considered. That will have an impact on the entire area. And so we wanted things like that to, just what I said, for the council's appeal accountable to the entire city. Mr. Speaker, may I follow up with just a clarification? Yes, the gentleman yields. Yes, the gentleman yields. So based on your explanation, the candidates must reside within the district that they're running for. Yes, ma'am, and each district has two posts. All right, thank you. Yes, ma'am. And I should say that I can get into the geography of the city, but basically Johnson's very road, which I'm sure many of you are familiar with, if at least heard of. It runs down the spine of the city from north to south and each district has about an equal amount of that corridor. Do you further yield? Mr. Speaker, I will yield because I think that they, and in due respect, if it's, if it's general questions, because I do want to stay and clear up any questions that there are. So I will yield for another question. You want to yield for further questions? Yes, sir. Okay. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. You mentioned when you were describing the bill that this is not another layer of government. So I'm just curious, will the people that live within the city boundaries have to pay city taxes? Yes, they will, but those are, those will be taxes. It's not like we're creating new taxes, just for those services that the city is taking over. Instead of those taxes, instead of them going to the county to provide those taxes, they will now go to the city to provide those taxes. So and likewise, they'll still be Cobb Countyans. They'll still pay Cobb County taxes as well. So does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. So to clarify, the people who live in the city will have to pay county and city taxes. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. It's as I explained, it's shifting from one to the other. I will reiterate that the feasibility study does state that taxes overall would not go up. Mr. Speaker, I think that there are a couple of other people who want to speak on the bill. And I'm happy to take questions if I come back to the well or try to address those questions if I come back to the well. Thank you. Okay, we do have members who have signed up to speak to the bill. We will have 20 minutes of debate for each side. I'm sorry, 30 minutes debate for each side. Chair recognizes Chairman Ed Setsler to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House proud today to stand in support of HB841. I wanted to kind of expand upon something that Chairman Dollar highlighted to us that what we've got here before us today is really not an issue of more government. It's really an issue of representative government. It is a citizen that lives in unincorporated Cobb County, myself, my family, my neighbors. The local elected official representation we have is a ratio of one citizen, I'm sorry, of one local county commissioner per about 200,000 people. So we think about our cities. There is one of our members of the minority party was talking in our committee meeting, extolling how strong and how well run the legacy cities in Cobb County are. In our legacy cities, Acrof, Kennesaw, Stell, Powder Springs, Marietta, Smirna, many of them have a relationship of about one elected official per about 5,000 people. Unfortunately, if you live in unincorporated Cobb, you have one elected official per about 190 to 200,000 people. So if you have needs that whether it's getting a street pave, whether it's addressing something, getting patrol, whether it's an area being patrol by police, whether it's a zoning question, you have 200,000 people per one elected official. I will tell you, it's not critiquing any particular county commissioners, but that level of representation is not what I think we would desire. So with the City of East Cobb, citizens who are now in unincorporated Cobb County would go from having 200,000 people per elected representative to having 8,000 people per elected representative. Think about that for a minute. That is a 50 times more concentration. I mean, you have 50 times the representation under East Cobb that you do today. You've got every elected official has one 50th of the number of constituents they can commit their time to, follow upon questions with, solve problems for them you can today, under a county that's nearly 800,000 people with simply four district commissioners. You know, this is something I think we can all be proud of. I think no matter what your political background is, no matter what your favorite issue is, is greater representation, I think, is something that we recognize is very important. It's something that we all as members, as representatives of our community see as being vital. And I think going from one elected official per 200,000 to one elected official per 8,000 is something we can all be very, very proud of in supporting this bill. Secondly, East Cobb will have about 55 to 56,000 people. There's folks that say, why does East Cobb need to be a city? Why doesn't it just stay as it is? Well, you talk about the size of the city, the size and the scale. Is it big enough to have any substances? Is it big enough to have a collection of people to be, to have their own community of interest that can represent itself with the resources, talent, and abilities, and focus to be a credible city? When you think about East Cobb as its proposed today in HB841, with about 55 or 56,000 people, the city of East Cobb when created, if this general assembly and the voters support that, will be larger than the city of Gainesville. Does the city of Gainesville, Georgia have the right to exist as a city outside of unincorporated Hall County? The city of East Cobb will be larger in population than the city of Valdosta. Should Valdosta just dissolve into Lowns County and be unincorporated or should Valdosta have a right to exist as a city? The city of East Cobb will be larger than Rome. Rome, Georgia, we'll have a lower population than the city of East Cobb. States, Burrow, Lagrange, I could go on. 56,000 people is a concentration of folks that have great talent, have great diversity, and great ability to represent themselves as their own entity where representative government can be real for people. Not just a phone call, one local representative represents 200,000 people. Lastly, I would tell you that as we have this debate, the committee was listened to. Chairman Dollar talked to members of the community, even those that have been in opposition to his initial proposal, so that what you see before you today is perhaps a different proposal than would have been provided four years ago. But through this rigorous process of talent all meetings, taking feedback, engaging people, I would like to lift my hat to Chairman Dollar for the work and the feedback he's taken from people and put it together with the proposal we have before us today. And lastly, I would say Mr. Speaker, this is not another layer of government. We passed this General Assembly and its wisdom back in the Roy Barnes administration, passed a bill that prohibited the duplication of services. You can't pay a fire tax to the county and fire tax to a city, you pay to one or the other. You can't pay both a police tax to the city and a police tax to the county, you pay for one or the other. So when we end to this General Assembly wisely, ended duplication of services about 20 years ago, that issue of another layer of government is simply not true. Friends, this is not only not another layer of government. This bill is fundamentally about representative government. And should 56,000 people, more people that are in Rome, Lagrange, State Spurrow, Gainesville, should they have the right to decide for themselves, should they be represented by six council members in three districts, two in each district in a mayor, or should we as a General Assembly tell them just one elected official for 200,000 people is good enough for you, even though I and us many of our cities enjoy so much more. That Mr. Speaker, I'm going to yield the well. I know there will be some other speakers on this, but I would commit to the HB841. The City of East Cubs is a great idea. Its time has come. And for that I would ask for your support. The gentleman has yielded the well. There are those who wish to be heard in opposition to the bill. Chair recognizes Chairman Don Parsons to speak to the bill. Thank you, Speaker. I've just got some notes here. I don't have a speech prepared. I think I really need to come down and talk about this because this new proposed city is directly to the east of the district that I currently represent. In fact, in earlier drawings, earlier conditions of the district I represent, it's actually going over into that area. But currently this proposed lines will be just the east of my district. And I have received a lot of correspondence, especially over the last week in opposition to the city being formed. It's an important day. It's an important day in the history of the county that I live in. I think Cobb County, I don't have the exact date, but I think it was formed around 1830 a long time ago. And there have been cities formed there over the years, but nothing like this particular thing over in east Cobb. The idea has come up before, I think, about 20 years ago. I remember some people in my, if I close to where I live now in North Central Cobb, which a lot of people there consider themselves east Cobb. The idea was out there proposed, but it never did gain any traction. And this particular movement has been in force, I guess, about the last three to four years, something like that. I remember getting a call from our local newspaper, the Marietta Daily Journal. It was three or four years ago, just out of the blue one day. I had no idea about this since that earlier movement. I want to know if I supported a city of east Cobb. And it kind of took me by surprise because nobody mentioned it, like forever, since there were. And I told them, I said, I don't know how it would have to talk to, I would have to hear from people about it, but it doesn't seem to make any sense to me. We have Cobb County government. I think that they're doing a good job. I've never had any problem with Cobb County government. I have my commissioner I can go to. And I must say too, in response to something that previously said about the number of Cobb County commissioners, there are a lot more state representatives in Cobb County and state senators than our commissioners. And we certainly get our share of calls that we have to then go talk to the county commissioner about, but they always have somebody to come to. I can assure you of that. As you all know, people always come to us if they don't know who their county commissioner is. But anyway, it's not easy to even come up here and talk about this because I have so much respect for Representative Chairman Dollar. He's my neighbor down here in the chamber. He's my neighbor in the, has been in the suite that I'm in. And legislatively, like I say, his district is just the east of my district. I have a lot of respect for Chairman Dollar. And I know he's spent a lot of time. I know he's worked on this very hard. So with that, I want to make sure that's very clear. I believe it doesn't create a new level of government. I think there's some conservative issues that one has to take into consideration with this. And I try to answer emails, corresponds that I receive very honestly. There are conservative reasons why you would support a new city like this, closer to the people. That is true. It would be close to the people. It does provide a means of self-determination for the people in that area about whether or not they want to do it. I do want to point out that since that conversation with the Marietta Daily Journal, a local paper there in Marietta, like say three to four years ago, I think about probably four years ago, I have never one time, not one time heard from that group. I think that's the greatest proposing this city of East Cobb. Even though my district is right there, comes up to the area that they have decided upon themselves, they have taken upon themselves to have this city drawn in the particular city lines that they've come up with. I don't know how they came up with those lines. Makes no sense to me. Way too big. As far as a community of interest, I don't see it. I think East Cobb for a long time throughout the county is looked at somewhat differently because of demographics and business and things of that nature. But that area, that large is driven, that is drawn into that district, is not really a community of interest. It's not like I don't go into what is called in this, drawn out in the city of East Cobb. I go there every week. There's nothing that draws it together. I can assure you of that as a city. One thing I want to mention, and I think I know it asks Chairman Dollar to think about this if it passes today and as it moves on, really need to consider this referendum date in May. Now, not only have I had correspondence from people opposing the whole project, the whole proposal, but especially about having that referendum in May because there's so much that has to be done for the elections office to be able to even do that in May. And this thing hasn't even passed. If it passes here, it still hasn't given the other side. But I would definitely ask him to consider that to move that referendum date out. You know, I guess maybe my final note on this. You know, I'm not a, well, I do. I read history a lot. And of course, as a Democrats and Republicans, especially those of us who maybe have a more conservative view of government, Thomas Jefferson is a hero. And sometimes I wonder how somebody who could have written something so flowing and so easy to read as a declaration of independence, some of his things that he'd written are so difficult to read, but I still try. But something I came across a couple of years ago, he was talking about cities. And Thomas Jefferson wrote this in so many words. He said, you know, our states, our colonies were formed by great Britain. The colonies were formed by great Britain, but the cities were formed by people. He saw cities actually more important in a way because they were formed by people. They come together, you know, they establish a, whatever, some kind of place of commerce, a bank, a store, the cities built around that. And I think that's important. I see, I do not, and I see that in cities all across the state. I see that in cities in Cobb County, it's a city that was built by the people. This is something that's been proposed by a group of people who want a city. And want to be on the city council, maybe want to be mayor or something for themselves. I want to control the, you know, all the little aspects, zoning, maybe the police chief, all that. That's what these, this is not a group of people who've come together and built a city or a town. If that were the case, it would be there. There is no town of East Cobb. There is no city of East Cobb, waiting to be incorporated. So with that, I think I will, I think I will stop there. I just think it's a proposal that needs a lot more thought, but especially, especially as far as the date for the referendum. One more thing, and that is that this group that has been behind this, they have now had three to four years organizing. They have money. They know how to run a campaign. The people who are opposed to this, they don't have any of that. With election in May, they have the resources, the proponents for this have the resources to get this thing through. The people who are opposed to have different, various problems with it. They're not organized. So how do you think that's going to go? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, Chair recognizes representative Allen to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be brief, because I know others want to speak and time is short, but the technical concerns have already been talked about, and they'll be talked about a little bit more. Cobb County as a county has four cities that are being addressed in this session. To my knowledge, there is not another situation where county has had four cityhood movements at one time. I would like, and I've asked for it to be delayed, but I would like to say again, all four of these should be put through committee and brought to a vote at the same time. It is extremely chaotic for the county to prepare for the different scenarios and do an impact study if this passes, if this doesn't, if that one, these two, these two don't. And I'm also worried about making sure that if we're going to stand by what representative Settler said about we should let people vote, we should let everybody vote. There are four movements. All of them have done a feasibility study. All of them have been introduced. One was even introduced last biennium, and is the only one not scheduled for hearing yet. If we are going to allow the residents of Cobb County to vote on building communities, everyone should have that opportunity to vote. So I ask again that we delay this vote so that the other four sponsors have an opportunity to have their bills make it all the way through committee so that if we allow one community of Cobb County to vote on their destiny, we should afford that a right to every single community that's looking for the same thing. With that, I yield the well. There are recognizes representative Anelowitz to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise before you today to speak against HB841. As most of you know, I love cities. I spent almost a decade on the Smyrna City Council. I am frequently here in this spot to herald the glories of local control. Cities, as the kids say, are my jam. So what then am I here today to speak against this nascent city of East Cobb? Cobb County is home to six cities. There what I have always referred to as legacy cities. They've been around for quite a while, and they offer a complete range of services for their residents. Smyrna, for example, celebrates its sesquicentennial this year. That means 150. Residents in Smyrna pay a little more in taxes than our neighbors in Unincorporated Cobb County. But in exchange, we have our own police, fire departments, public works, water, sewer, sanitation, recycling, parks. We even have our own city library. The city has a dedicated city administrator, seven council members who live in their districts and who are elected by their neighbors who also live in their districts. Marietta and the other four cities in Cobb are similarly structured. Not to be clear, I am not opposed to new cities. In fact, several other cities are proposed in Cobb County right now and each one merits thorough evaluation. But having witnessed the birth of cities throughout Metro Atlanta in recent years, I do think that a necessary element for any new city's success is that the citizens who vote to create that city do so with their eyes wide open. What I mean is, is the city created through a process that is utterly transparent, straight forward, has robust resident participation and doesn't reflect the findings of the requisite feasibility study. I'll elaborate. When I spoke against this bill when it was in committee week before last, one of my main problems was the governance structure. It was unlike any other city in Cobb and Metro Atlanta and I'm pretty sure the entire state and that it had six members all elected at large. Three would have to live in one of the city's three council districts. The other three were elected at large and there was absolutely the possibility that you could have the city of East Cobb represented by a super majority of four council members who all lived on the same cul-de-sac. My friends, that is not a city council. That is a glorified HOA. Since that meeting, thankfully, the governing structure of the city has changed to reflect the confusion and consternation of many in our ranks. That's good. But the fact that such a profound change to the city's structure happened so quickly and with so little input and evaluation from the public, this bill has been very difficult for the public to follow along with at home. With the numerous committee substitutes all of these changes, this leads me to my-

current concern and that is the zeal with which this bill is being rushed to a vote. By rushed, I don't just mean in this chamber. I mean rushed as in this bill would bring the matter of the city of East Cog to a vote in May. This May. Let's talk about what that means for the residents within the proposed city, those 60,000 souls. It has indeed been four years since the city had concept was first introduced. But in that time there have been two house bills, three maps, two feasibility studies, and at least that many changes to the list of city services and proposed governance models. The changes are confusing and many residents have complained about their haphazard nature. Again, the city of East Cog includes close to 60,000 people whose lives and pocketbooks will all be impacted by our vote today. They have done their level best to keep up, but if it's been a challenge to keep up here at the capital and it has, it's certainly been even more difficult for those playing along at home. And now the election data set for the May primary, not the November general election as it was originally set. The proponents have in the bill set the election for a time when in all likelihood and reality, very few people will turn out to vote to change the lives of more than 60,000 people. People need more than a couple of months of education to learn about how the city would work, whether it would work for them and how it would impact their daily lives. Another concern with this hastiness comes with the context of the Cobb Board of Elections and Elections in general. Like so many counties in Georgia and reflecting the current labor market realities, the Cobb County election office has lost a number of key personnel. They are already concerned about completing the normal reapportionment process. They cannot begin to conduct that process until all of our maps are complete. There is the addition of a new voter registration system which may come with a bit of a learning curve. And to add to this context, the districting that would be necessary to conduct the city hood referendum in May could potentially be simply too much to put on the board of elections. Holding the referendum on the November ballot is the only timing that makes sense for our election officials and for cost efficiency. I'm going to go back to these feasibility studies, both of them, even with two of them, the proposed city that we're about to vote on includes several components that aren't included in either study. Of note, it does not account for what it will cost to develop employee retirement plans. We talk a lot about these during the appropriations project. They don't process. They don't come cheap. This is in line 133. The bill does not account for the cost required to pay or the feasibility studies, excuse me, do not account for the cost required to pay for the city attorney. The municipal court judge, the associate judge, the benefits and the salaries, they would inevitably require none of that is included in the feasibility studies. Voters can't decide on whether or not they want to incorporate with their eyes wide open if many major expenditures are completely ignored in this process. Now we'll talk about public safety. Something that caught my eye early in my evaluation of HB841 was the creation of their own fire department. When I saw this, I was baffled. You see, Cobb County has an ISO-1 rated fire department. That is as good as it gets. They are the, they're one of two counties in Metro Atlanta that has an ISO rating of one. They're one of a handful in the state. I do not understand or has any supporter of the city been able to articulate why this fire department is necessary. In fact, were the city to exist with this fire department every property owner in the new city would immediately pay more for their insurance because of this lesser quality fire protection. This fire department would attempt to protect 60,000 people with only two fire stations. So if this city were to pass, not only is every resident going to have higher homeowners insurance, they're also going to probably, inevitably soon be taxed to build the third fire station that the city would require to actually protect its residents. It doesn't make sense and this is a big part of why I cannot support the creation of the city of East Cobb. I am not opposed to new cities at all, but I will emphasize again my belief that residents need to be able to enter into the creation of one with their eyes wide open. The city is being rushed in what I can only interpret as an attempt by its supporters to shield from residents the reality that this city is not ready for a vote. Certainly not as soon as May. If the city is ready, if it has indeed been created in a way that is thoughtful and thorough and with adequate time for all of the 60,000 impacted residents to truly understand exactly what it is they are creating, how they will be governed, what it will actually cost and how their new city will protect their lives and property by all means let them vote. But if the city is worthy of the vote, delaying the vote until November, it will still be worthy then in November. It will ensure that all these questions can be answered and it should pose no problem for its supporters. I yield the well. Okay, for the final few minutes, Chair recognizes a representative Wilkerson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the City of East Cobb Bill, House Bill 841, and I think everybody kind of summarized a lot of the concerns that you see, the concern about the election date, the changing governance structure. I want to first thank the author for working on this and the committee. A lot of work has been done, but unfortunately by taking that input, they kept changing the bill and there are conflicts within it which causes to not be a very complete bill and it is going to be confusing for the people that are trying to vote on this. I think we made a good faith effort in committee. We made some suggestions. Those were corrected. There were some errors in the bill. They corrected those. But I think I still, I just want to highlight one concern that has not been talked about. That is the district lines themselves. If you look at the original bill, before the feasibility study was done, it was East Cobb Plan 2021, and then if you look at the current boundaries, East Cobb 2022, I'm going to highlight the differences where I've not been able to get an answer as far as if the boundary lines have changed, which I do believe they have to be set in the first year. I'll list those out for people to look at after they leave, but Fullers Park 01 has changed. Murdock 01 has changed. Pope 01 has changed. Roswell 01 has changed. Summiel 01 has changed. So Crico 02 has changed. So just from that alone, I don't know who's voting in this city. I don't know what lines have been agreed to with the feasibility study, but I would ask that we delay this, that we push this back and consider all four cities at one time. I'm the impact in Cobb County. Cobb County, home of the Atlanta Braves, Cobb County, home of the Atlanta United, Cobb County, Home Depot, Dovins. We've done a great job in Cobb County as one United City, and I don't know if we want to change it based on what I consider a rush bill, but I want to, like I said, I want to thank everybody for working hard on this, and I ask that you vote now today. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's known the previous question is ordered. We have a minority report, and it's being waived off. We also have Chairman's time. Are you taking the Chairman's time? Chair recognizes the Chairman of the committee, Chairman Darling Taylor for the Chairman's time, 20 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. As chair of the committee that heard this bill, I would like to offer the following. The request for the City of East Cobb has been a four-year process. The state regulations and obligations have been met. The process included updating and changes as the public voiced their concerns and changes were made. It's been thoroughly vetted in both subcommittee and full committee. It has both Republican and Democrat votes to move this bill forward. It's a good bill. As members stated, it gives the citizens of the East Cobb area the right to vote and decide if they want to be a city. Mr. Speaker, I yield my time to Jan Jones. Chair recognizes the Speaker Proteam for the remainder of the Chairman's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm just going to take a few minutes. If that's all right, and then yield my time to another member. I had not planned to speak, but I heard I felt like I was going back to 2004, 2005 on the arguments. We heard all these arguments back when it pertained to Sandy Springs. I just want to point out a few things. About half of Georgians live in a city now. Over the past, I guess 15 years, we've created gosh, it's probably approaching close to 18 or 20 cities now. South Fulton, Peachtree Corners, Tucker, Stonecrest, Milton, John's Creek, Sandy Springs, and the list goes on. I just want to mention a few things. I heard like the let everyone vote argument. Everyone didn't vote in all those other cities that passed. Some of them, and at the time, Republican leaning areas and others in Democrat leaning areas, no different than with an annexation process. People don't vote outside the county when they're outside the area that's being annexed. You let those property owners make that decision as to whether they want to go into a city. That's what these people are just asking. Let us decide. They'll still be Cobb County resident. They'll still pay Cobb County taxes no different than the other cities that were mentioned in Cobb County. I also wanted to mention something about whether or not there would be representation throughout the city. I'll point out one of our, I guess it's called the Legacy City Roswell has over 100,000 people. It's in the top 10, probably 8 or 7 in terms of population, in terms of the 500 cities in Georgia, and they actually don't even have districts. It's worked beautifully, and people are happy with it. The same is true in Alpharetta. They have 70,000 residents. I represent portions of both those cities. 13th largest city in the state. They just have posts, and it works fine. They've never once in the years I've represented those cities asked to change, to go to districts. Folks work it out, and let me assure you they have much more elected influence than they were, they would if they were unincorporated. There's a little thing about being unincorporated and this is what really always kind of chapped me when I was unincorporated. I paid taxes like with sp lost and lost, and the city's got a population share, but if you're in an unincorporated area, the remainder of the funds get spread across the remainder of the county, whether you're incorporated or not. They actually get to bring some of the taxes home just no different than the cities that currently exist in Cobb County. To me, this is what America is about. Is bringing elected representation closer to the people? To reiterate what Representative Setsler said, you have much more elected influence. I've yet to hear, really from anyone, in the cities surrounding me that were incorporated that is unhappy with, that I'm sure there are some. Overwhelmingly, the polling is that they're very happy with greater elected influence on the day-to-day things that affect their lives, their quality of life. I just have to mention on retirement plans, at least for the three new cities in North Fulton, what a novel thought. They don't have pension plans. They have generous 401k plans, and I would venture to say there are very few governments that if they were being created today, would create pension plans, no different than all the corporations who've done away with a pension plan. What they do is they empower their employees with money in an account, a 401k, that they can take with them if they go to another police department, another fire department, so much more modern way of doing it. No disrespect to the way cities have done it. I realize once you have pension plans in place, you keep them in place. You have a fiduciary duty to those employees, but that's not a problem. With respect to fire departments, our insurance rates went down after we created our own fire department versus having one supplied by a county that was too big. I'll just mention a little from a historical perspective, cities used to mean urban and county used to mean country. But in four counties that represent a third of the state's population, that's no longer meaningful. People just want to have more of a sense of community. I can't imagine East Cop looking any different than for example John's Creek in North Fulton. People said, it's not a city. It doesn't look like a city. It doesn't look like what a historic city looked like. But let me assure you, they have a sense of community. They have more green space than they ever would have had. They have better fire and police than they ever would have had because they vote with their feet with people that represent them and that they know. That's the advantage of this. I would encourage you to consider, we have a long history of doing this now. I've been a reasonably long history, 15 years. There's a great degree of satisfaction, whether it's in Guanette with peach tree corners, Decap County with Brookhaven and Dunwoody, the ones in Fulton County, including down in South Fulton, the other cities in Stonecrust and Decap County. It has been a resounding success and it doesn't mean in your rural area, this is going to break out. It's in these counties that you could put 50 counties together and their population wouldn't equal cop counties. It's too big to call it local government, local influence for a lot of those people. But I did hear these arguments 15 years ago and for many of the people who voted against later, they came back and asked for their own city and their own area. I supported it. I support regardless of wherever it is in the state. But it's primarily, in fact, I think solely been in those four major counties where it's just too big to call it local government. So I encourage you to keep an open mind and let the people vote. Thank you. That completes... I'm sorry, Chairman Taylor. I have one more person that wants to speak. I recognize Ed Settzler. Ladies and gentlemen, Speaker Protein really took the point I was going to make. I'm Chairman Dollar and I were going to wrap. I just appreciate your consideration. Speaker Protein hit the nail on the head. You know, when you've got 8,000 people per representative, that's that's a better place to be than calling to fix a pothole when you have 200,000 people represented by one local representative. So if you represent in areas, or areas we represent a very diverse, I would just ask that it's Chairman Dollar closes as I'll give the people of East Cobb an opportunity to vote in May so that in November, the citizens can actually pick their elected officials. Now, the thinking behind all this was that there's focus on it now. It's on people's mind. Do I want it? Do we not want it as a city? And then in November, have the highest turnout for municipal vote perhaps it's ever been because on a November election ballot with the governor and the United States Senate's being voted on let the folks then pick their local elected officials who are going to represent them for the years to come. With that being said, much more could be said, but I will leave it to Chairman Dollar if you would. Chairman, to closes out and make the case while this matters so much to our community. Chair recognizes Chairman Dollar. Thank you, Speaker. And just just want to wrap up here. I want to thank those that have spoken support. I also want to thank Chairman Parsons for standing up and expanding on the benefits of local government, local control to really self governance. I'm sorry that he was a little upset that he wasn't more involved in this process. I take responsibility for that. But he wasn't he wasn't representing the area and I should have looped him in more and I take that. But he's also right on his point that there is no city of East Cobb. Well, there is no city of East Cobb. That's what this is reporting to do. That's what we're trying to do is create a referendum to create a city. I would tell him that there really wasn't a city of Milton before Milton was created and there wasn't a city of John's Creek. There wasn't a city that's how this works. I also want to thank Representative Nulo-Witz for standing up and talking about again this really special thing of self governance. And what I would like to ask her is why do the people of Smirna deserve that level of governance? And the people I represent not deserve the right to at least decide if they want it. You know, many of y'all represent cities and y'all love it and y'all love your cities. Why do the people of peace-free corners deserve it and not the people of East Cobb? Do the people of Decatur deserve it and not the people of East Cobb? Do the people of Smirna deserve it? Do the people of Avondale states deserve to have their city? That level of local control, self-determination and not the people of East Cobb. I'll leave that to each and I remember to decide with that Mr. Speaker how to yield them well. Thank you. There's no one else that wants to speak. I do not wish to speak. All right, the previous question has been ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Although I, those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 841, the eyes are 98. The nays are 63. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does the minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to serve notice that I'm going to ask for reconsideration on the next legislative day. You have that right and it will be on the calendar for next Tuesday. What purpose does Chairman Carson rise? Down here. Mr. Speaker, I move this House agree to the Senate substitute for House Bill 383. Chairman Carson has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to Senate Bill or House Bill 383. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 383 to be entitled and act to amend part one of Article 3, Chapter 5 and Title 50. The official go to Georgia and take the link to General Authority duties and procedure relative to state purchasing. Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to explain his motion. Members of the House, this is simply agreeing to a Senate substitute. I'm told this is on your desk. I'm looking at House Bill 33 as approved by the Senate on sunny died, just got cut off in the timing. What this bill has to do with is in regard to the state contracting with various entities. And what this is basically doing is a little bit of cleanup in regard to some technical language. The trade with Israel is a compelling state interest for the state of Georgia. I would argue in this bill preserves free speech rights for individuals and sole proprietorships. But it also says if we as a state are not going to contract and we're updating our their statute to say we are not going to contract with groups that embrace boycott divestment and sanctions against the state of Israel. The very similar bill passed this House last year, 150 to 18, passed the Senate on sunny die, 47 to 2. I just asked for your favorable consideration and I yield the well-must speaker. On the gentleman's motion that this House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 383, all those in favour of a vote aye, those opposed to vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does representative Becky Evans rise? Parliamentary inquiry? Statue inquiry. Yes, isn't it true that we are stopping business owners in Georgia from deciding who they are and who are not doing business with? I think that's a matter that addresses itself to the judgment of each and every member of this body. Have all members voted? Have all members voted?
