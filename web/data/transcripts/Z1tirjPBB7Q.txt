couple minutes before stemming
at
senator from the
Thank you, Mr. President, we're chugging along, we only got 78 more bills to go.
Ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you HB 54, simple bill.
It allows PAs, also known as physician assistance under direction of a doctor or a physician
to write home health care orders.
That is the underlying bill and it's simplest for them.
And brought amendment one, which will allow
advanced practice registered nurses to do the same,
also under the direction of a doctor or physician.
It's something we did for three years under executive order
that the governor had signed off on.
It's been done where my understanding is we are the last
state that would be allowing these APRNs to write the home health care.
We've got Amendment 1A brought by the Dr. Caucus and this simply is going to mirror federal
language or may not mirror it but it goes along with federal language that says you can't
write that home health care if you own or have any interest in a company that does home
health care. So you can't essentially, you can't refer someone to yourself. So you can
refer the home health care, the PA, the APRN, or the doctor. They can refer someone to
home health care. They just can't refer them to their own company or any company for
that matter. And then there's an amendment too. I haven't had a chance to read it, so
I can't speak to it with that all yield for questions.
Senator from the first question.
Thank you, Mr. President, to Senator Gild.
Senator I yield for the chairman of the Dr. Caucus.
Coach, chairman of the Dr. Caucus.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, rules.
We're certainly, it's one of them.
I'll reiterate, you know, a amendment one, a, or is something that I think is appropriate
nurse practitioners and PAs, it is correct with positions and PAs can't refer to something
that they own, so that's why the second amendment, and I think we're all on board with that.
And I would hope that the second amendment would be withdrawn, but I will leave that up
to the author.
Thank you very much.
I don't know if I can get that in the form of a question.
But yes, that is true.
I yield the well.
You have no more questions.
The center is yielding.
Did any of the senator wish to speak for or against it?
As soon as from the 30 second you'd like to speak to your amendment
As soon as from the 30 second your amendment
Thank you, Mr. President.
The rules chairman did a very good job of explaining Amendment 1A.
Basically, physicians are bound by federal law about self-referrals so that you don't refer
to an entity in which you have a financial interest and so the MM is just to make it clear
that the same would apply to anyone that's making that referral.
Happy to answer any questions.
You have no questions, Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're going to send it from the 41st.
Mr. President, colleagues, I rise today here with amendment number two, and I would ask
can invite you to consider this amendment.
And I want to start by telling you where it comes from.
First and foremost, I had the great privilege
of being on a study committee where we went around rural Georgia
and we talked about a rural health care shortage.
And over the course of time, that study committee
put together a committee report.
And one of the things we said that we needed to do
was to consider the people who live in our state today
who are already trained as physicians who are trained
nationally and to create a pathway for them to become licensed. And so this is
what this amendment does. It creates a pathway because we have hundreds of
doctors who live in Georgia today right now who are trained and worked as
physicians in their home countries who've now made Georgia home and right now
are not able to practice. I'm also bringing this bill to you today because I have
family who live in rural Georgia. A father-in-law with a chronic illness who
fought in Vietnam who worked and served this country and who has to travel miles and miles
because there's no doctor nearby.
And I know that this is true for many of the people in this room.
There are 143 counties in our great state in which there is a clear and true shortage
of physicians.
Every one of us sitting in this room has an obligation to our constituents to do everything
that we can possible to deliver health care to them and when you have doctors who are
already trained here in the States, but we don't create a pathway for them to be able
to work, well I think that we're filling our people.
The reality is I have worked incredibly hard and in good faith with physicians and with
a whole lot of people to create a pathway so that people who are trained, people who served
in the military and worked as physicians there, people who worked hard as physicians who
bring great expertise can be able to bring that practice here to Georgia. But I want to
be clear what I'm trying to do here is not new. This isn't something that I just made up or
came out of the air. Let me tell you the states that have already done this. Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Virginia, Florida, Utah, Illinois, Idaho, Iowa, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin
have all said, you know what, we have a shortage.
We have a physician shortage, particularly in our rural areas.
And we need to create a pathway for people who are internationally trained
to be able to practice in our states.
They are doing that, and they are doing that today
to try to begin to address the shortage.
Friends, I want to be clear.
People in rural Georgia today are not well
because they don't have access to a physician.
People in rural Georgia today are burning up gas,
spending extra time and energy having their loved ones
to other counties, because they simply
don't have access to a physician.
This bill helps to begin to fill that gap.
Now, some will say, well, are you sure
that they're going to be able to care for us well?
Well, in this amendment, we've made sure we require
that they take all of the examinations
that anyone who was trained in the US would take.
Step one, step two, step three.
We require that they would have to be supervised
by a physician in a facility where they were hired.
We have put lots of guardrails in this bill,
and I will tell you, somebody's probably
already got a text message from the composite board.
And the composite board will say,
well, we don't agree with this bill.
But I want you to just take a moment and look at line 48.
In line 48, we tell the board that any other criteria
that the board may require, they are able to come up with.
Line 65, once again, we say to the board,
any other criteria that you decide is necessary
to ensure the safety of these positions you can come up with.
And we say it again in line 73.
Any license can be granted or denied
at the discretion of the board.
We have given the composite board a significant amount
way, to make sure that they implement rules and promulgate all the things that
are necessary to protect all Georgians when it comes to being having access to a
physician who is trained in nationally. But fundamentally, this is about bringing
more doctors online. It is about making sure that wherever you are, whether it's
because you have family in rural Georgia or you yourself live in rural Georgia or
you happen to go on vacation and find yourself in need of a doctor in rural
Georgia. This is about making sure that those doctors are available. So I hear and I know
that there are some concerns because the medical composite board isn't online. Well, sometimes we
have to tell the medical composite board to figure out the rules. But we've given you some framework
and we've given the medical composite board the space to fill in any rules that they might fill
are necessary. But at the end of the day this amendment, this vehicle will make sure that we have
more doctors, doctors who are trained, who have been working as physicians in other countries,
we are making sure that they can come and serve here, just like 13 other states around
this have already done, and with that I will yield for questions.
Yeah, no questions Senator. Thank you.
We're going to ask the senator from the first.
I just speak to the manager.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I certainly agree with the senator
that there is a significant shortage of physicians,
but I must point out that we have been working with her,
and, literally, we've agreed with the composite board
of medical examiners that we will work on that issue
off-section this summer and so that everyone is in agreement
with allowing foreign medical graduates
to practice here in the state of Georgia.
They do now, they're allowed to now,
but they must complete a residency.
The issue is whether or not they've completed a residency
and approved accredited from somewhere around the world.
So all residency programs are not equal.
As a matter of fact, let me just point out
that online 40, that it says you must complete,
have completed a formal postgraduate training outside
of the United States.
Well, listen, after I finished medical school,
I could have gone to France and done a month's long
postgraduate education and come back.
I don't think that definition really fits
into a formal residency program that you have in mind.
And it goes on and on with that.
There are some minor changes that we have asked her to make,
but not the changes that everyone is comfortable with,
because the bottom line is a quality physician leading
leading the team and taking care of patients in a safe manner.
I am fully on board with having foreign medical graduates in the United States
and in Georgia, they are practicing.
I have a partner and partners who have practiced outside of the United States,
but they have met every criteria.
These that she is carving out is not appropriate right now with these rules that she has proposed.
And that's why I would say, let's give us some time,
let's get everybody on board,
let's get everybody in full agreement,
because quality and safety is important.
Mr. President, I'll be happy to answer questions,
if not, I'll yield the will.
Thank you.
We're gonna have Senator from the 22nd.
Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in support of the amendment. One of the things we have
realized is the headlines in Georgia couldn't be clearer why this amendment isn't necessary.
And although there may be some work to do, now is the time to actually pass this amendment.
The headlines say things like half of Georgia rules, hospitals, struggle financially.
health care is in crisis. 18-30 rural hospitals are in danger of closing. Local leaders highlight
Georgia rule health care crisis. And these headlines can go on and on. I can name more and more
and expand different years and also different localities. It made no mistake that Georgia really
is a rural state in the sense that but almost 120 of our hundred and 59 counties are actually
classified as rural. This amendment addresses that particular issue. And these folks are there
where there's rule or in a underserved population because remember this amendment actually affects
underserved areas but also underserved populations. These people right now need help today. They're
actually suffering. They actually need this healthcare access. And we also want to remind ourselves
that the persons that come in under this amendment, they still would have to be hired. They still
would have to be interviewed. They still are going to go through the same kind of protocols to make
sure that they're doing the right thing once they are hired. They're still going to have to satisfy
other patients, everything that any other physician would do, they will also be
subject to that. The question becomes, we realize that the need is there, now is
the time, not wait another year, and then possibly there's other restrictions
that we come up with, other things that need to be done. Now is the time to help
our citizens of Georgia and to solve this rule and underserved population
crisis for health care that we have in Georgia. Thank you and I yield well.
Thank you, Mr. President, I'll be brief.
I've had a good conversation with the author of the amendment and the author of the bill.
I have my name on this man, but I'm going to be voting against this.
I think this is a longer conversation that needs to be had in the off season and ask for you out of stick with me and yield the well.
Senator from the 30 second, do you have something you'd like to add?
Come on up.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It's absolutely true that we have been working with the Senator to try to get this right.
I don't feel we're there yet.
Line 40, for example, doesn't really define what is an acceptable postgraduate training
program outside the United States.
1662 talks about institutions that are not accredited and the person being supervised by one fully licensed physician in this state
What does that mean? I don't think we want to create a two tiered system and although we do have shortages
We want to be sure that the people that are coming in to practice are qualified. So with that I am not in support of the amendment
Number two. Thank you. All right Senators yielded right about center for the fifth
Thank you Mr. President, I was inclined to speak, but I just want to mention, my elder sister
is a doctor, she was in this country a number of years ago, and she led to take care of
my uncle, was a dentist, passed away in New York, so I have multiple folks in my family,
they are doctors.
I just want you to know, we have, you know, last number of years, I know multiple doctors
they graduated from England, from Japan, from Afghanistan, from Bangladesh and India.
A lot of them left the state.
They're United States citizens.
They came in this country with the residency, become U.S. citizen, spend all this time
over here, couldn't get a residency.
I know they went to New York, they went to Missouri, multiple other states.
So we need to do we have folks they're qualified they're not coming in on the third world country
That you think you know, so we need to do something we need to please I've been hearing this a number of years
That we will do something we can do what you know we can work
Please do something
We got to do something we can do better
We should not have
County in a state of Georgia that we don't have any doctors. We have multiple counties in the state of Georgia
doesn't have any doctors. We need to carve out or do something so people don't have to go
other state to practice or get residency. I appreciate. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield
the word.
