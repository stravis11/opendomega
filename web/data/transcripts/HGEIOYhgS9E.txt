Is there any objection to adopting the privileged resolution here in none of the resolutions are adopted?
Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 144144?
Senate Bill 1444 by Senator Watson, the 11th and others to be entitled, and act to amend Article 6 of Chapter 7 to title 2 of the Fiscal Court of Georgia and Tated Relay in the liability for use of fertilizers.
Planned growth regulators are pesticides, so it's a clarify that a manufacturer cannot be held liable for failing to warn consumers.
This bill evidence for the Committee on Agriculture Consumer Affairs, that committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, a pleasure to come to you today to bring
Senate Bill 144, LC-144, CSFA from Senator Watson, as Speaker mentioned.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will look online, two through four of the bill.
So I ask to clarify that a manufacturer cannot be held liable for failing to warn consumers of health risk above those required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Now, you've gotten thousands of emails just like I have and you've been told what this
bill does and does not do, but ladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what the bill does.
As we say in the South Georgia vernacular, it just says the law is the law and the EPA
is the law when it comes to the label.
You know, ladies and gentlemen, y'all know that agriculture is our number one industry
in the state of Georgia.
We produce the cheapest, safest, most affordable food supply of anywhere in the world.
We only have that ability to do that because of science, technology, and a comprehensive
redundant regulatory system that reviews and approves plant protection products.
You know, in 1960, one farmer only fed 25 people.
If I surveyed the producers in this room, they would also agree with me that today,
farmer feeds an average of 169.
That's not because of the weather.
It's because of science and technology
that we are able to do that.
The science behind the chemical compounds
used in agriculture and urban ag are subjected in the United
States to the most rigorous regulatory structure
of anywhere in the world.
Some of you may or may not know that chemical compounds that
used in Europe that are used here in the United States have recently been labeled in Europe.
So again, what does Senate Bill 144 do? Again, I direct your attention to lines 2 through 4 of the
bill that basically says the law is the law and the EPA is the law of the land when it comes to
the label. But why is this important? It will help keep chemistries available for Georgia farmers
and farms in rural America and urban settings that are manufactured here in the United States.
It's not a surprise to anyone that more and more of our chemical chemistries are coming from overseas.
We need to make sure that we can continue to have those manufactured domestically here in the
United States under our rules, our regulations, and under our safety protocol. So how did we get here?
Thanks to California, Proposition 65 is really kind of where it all started,
mandating that a manufacturer of a certain chemistry put on the warning label
may cause cancer. They were basing that off of one study out of France,
out of, I call it the Iraq study. It was based off a subset of data that in my
estimation and talking to those who were engaged with EPA on a daily basis, the
The study was conducted with a very small subset of data points that they chose to use.
It wasn't what the EPA uses here in America.
The EPA took a look at it.
They used a broader set of data points and came to a different conclusion.
Even the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came out and said, you know what, the state of
California cannot require that because the EPA says that it is misleading.
In that case, it is indeed misleading because there is no science to back up what California
wanted to do.
Now, I want y'all to think about this.
You're in the three months of the year that we're here in this chamber, legislating and
doing the people's work of Georgia.
It's usually the three months out of the year that we import our food, right?
Because of our climate conditions, we don't grow year-round.
Where do y'all think that comes from?
What do you think that the products that are used come from?
Products coming from Mexico, a country that has significantly more lacks regulatory
environment, and they use more harsh chemicals than what we use.
Great's coming out of Chile.
Is it the same regulatory environment?
Absolutely not.
We rely on those imports, but we don't control what they put on those.
going to see that in a few months. Actually another week or two if I had the
guess when this product start coming from Mexico and South America where
their climate is warmer. We don't control what they put on theirs. We do here.
The bigger picture is are we going to continue to feed ourselves using the
chemistry and science that is available to us or not. We're going to allow it to
be manufactured here or we're going to bring it in from overseas. I just
assume haven't here where our regulatory environment controls the outcome of
what we put on our food products. And ladies and gentlemen, it's the same food
products that I eat, that my family eats, that my child eats, many of y'all have
seen John William running around here from time to time. It's the same food
products that you eat. Georgia's farmers take great pride in the training
that comes with applying any chemistry that we apply.
The University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service has developed one of the best training
programs and every time I go to a training program somewhere, I submit this card to them with
an ID number on the back that tells them how many training credits I've had and what
I've been trained on to make sure that we are indeed using anything that we use in the
the wisest men are possible for the benefit of food production and the health of our neighbors.
Mr. Speaker, there was some question in rules, committee, in terms of the lag in time,
and when EPA does react to data that is submitted to them, and I appreciate the conversation
that I've had with the, with the general lady, I went back and made a call while I had
a few minutes to ask the question of, okay, how quickly can EPA issue a stop to a product
that is on the market, that additional harm that may be caused is being caused.
And under FIFRA, the federal insecticide, excuse me, I get this tied up from time to
time, the federal insecticide, the federal insecticide, the federal insecticide act known as FIFRA,
there are emergency orders.
Whenever data is submitted to the EPA, they can intern and then talking to even our state regulators.
What happens, data is verified.
And in this particular case, August the 6th, 2024,
Dackfall, there was an emergency order issued and the product was immediately moved from the market.
Mr. Speaker, this is not about a single product.
about all products that we use in agriculture and allowing us to continue to
produce the most abundant, safest food supply of anywhere in the world.
And ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will join me in supporting this
legislation so we can continue to do that. We are America. We are heavily
regulated when it comes to what we can and cannot spray on the food products that
that we are producing for human consumption.
I ask for your favorable consideration
to House Bill 144 and Mr. Speaker,
I'll yield for a couple of questions if there are any.
Gentlemen, let us have a couple.
Representative Carter, to your left,
way back to extreme left.
He sure makes sense.
I'll give you, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, ma'am.
So I'm asking the same question that I asked yesterday in committee yesterday because as
I read the language and I'm trying to understand not being an attorney, the language speaks
of not being able to sue because there isn't notice on the label.
However, there have been suits and these manufacturers have lost because people have been harmed, so help me understand if this measure passes, what will be the cause for someone who's been harmed to bring suit if they can't show that the issue in the product is what has caused the harm.
Yes ma'am, thank you for, thank you for the question
and we did have a great conversation yesterday
in the Agriculture Committee.
What this bill is saying based on the label
and from the data and the science
from the Environmental Protection Agency,
which does not have data to support any warning
that may be on the label.
That's all we're saying here.
If there is a different cause of action
that a individual would like to take against any product,
we don't take away that ability in this.
This is solely based on the label that's approved by EPA
and the wording that is on that.
Does the gentleman further you?
Yes, ma'am.
Would you share an example of someone who has been harmed
that can bring suit?
Well, how would they go through that process
if they're not able to show that there
is something negligent in the product,
that the manufacturer is something,
as some degree, know that there's something in the product.
But they're died on the label.
I understand the EPA side of that,
and maybe other people may need some explanation.
Because I think at the end of the day,
what we want to do is protect our constituents
and not necessarily the manufacturers.
So can you help me really and help us understand that?
Because we still have a little pause.
Well, as you know, I'm not an attorney either.
But the way that I view it and the way that I read it,
if there are some other issues that you may experience
from being around the application of this product,
then this legislation doesn't prohibit you
from taking calls for that.
Again, I mean, it could be any warning.
I mean, I was sharing with others earlier,
there are products that we plough on a daily basis
that has poison written all over.
You take additional precautions when we are utilizing those
for ourselves and for those who are applying it.
As long as we're following those rules and regulations,
that's what EPA has looked at and said this product
is deemed safe to apply.
So in my estimation, if there are other things
that, you know, other symptoms that are caused,
you may be, you would be able to take a cause
of action based on that.
This is specific to any warning that may not be on the label,
but again, EPA won't even allow you to put one
on the label unless there's data to support that.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
The property of Jasper's to your right is recognized for a question.
The gentleman, will you yield?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
We're good now.
You know, I had a long career as a county extension agent, spent 30 years training people
how to read a label.
It's not true when you look at your bill, does nothing to ease the regulations or even
or lower, especially lower the standards that a user of pesticide has to eat.
You know, the gentleman knows of what he speaks given his distinguished career and extension service.
And I think it's important to note, sir, if Jim was still yield.
Yes, sir.
That is true that the pesticide label, that can be one page or 30 pages long,
gives the producer the user all the information they need to use that product safely
and to protect their food supply.
The gentleman knows of what he speaks, but thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you, sir
Gentlemen you to a question of the representative or now on your left
Out in front of you to your left
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's gentleman you. Yes, ma'am. I appreciate you telling us all about
the EPA and
How much our country protects us and that the other countries? We don't know what comes from them
However our current federal government has just fired 400 people so what
happens when EPA goes away? Who's going to protect us? Well I do believe that
that's a conversation we're going to have to make sure we're on top of.
Thank you. Mr. Speaker with a one more question from
Representative Corbett, gentlemen, we're yield to you.
You're right. Thank you Mr. Speaker, because gentlemen you. Yes sir.
Is it not true that providing a clear and consistent regulatory framework?
This bill fosters a stable business environment that attracts investment into Georgia's agriculture sector.
Gentlemen, those are what he speaks.
Thank you for the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen.
As we continue to feed Georgians in the world, I hope that you will stand with agriculture on this important measure.
And ask for your favorable consideration to House Bill 144.
Without Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will.
The gentleman has yielded the well, you had other questions, maybe they'll be answered
because we have a number of folks signed up to speak to Senate Bill 144.
I'm going to allow up to 25 minutes for those opposed and those in favor.
Up to 25 minutes, I'm sure you don't have to take up to 25 minutes.
We'll begin with those who are opposed.
Representative Drenner is recognized to speak to Senate Bill 144.
Where's that Carla Drenner?
Ladies recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I was headed to get my coat because it is so cold in here.
So if you-
You ought to borrow mine.
I'll bring it down there.
do you mind? My hands are shaken. So I rise today to voice my strong opposition to Senate
Bill 144, which seeks to amend Article 6 of Chapter 7 of Title 2 of the Official Code
of Georgia annotated regarding the liability for the use of fertilizers, plant growth,
regulators. Oh, thank you. You look better than in the not
day. My goodness. Yeah. Thank you. Chivalry is not dead. I
appreciate this. It makes great picture too. While the intent of
this legislation may be to support agricultural growth and ensure the availability of crop
protection products, the implications of this bill raise serious concerns, particularly
when it comes to the health and safety of Georgian citizens and the environment.
I have five key objections.
Number one, potential health risk to consumers.
Senate Bill 144 would limit the liability of pesticide
manufacturers by stating that they cannot be held responsible
for failing to warn consumers of health risk
that go beyond the warnings required by the USAP EPA.
While the EPA does regulate pesticides,
it is essential to recognize that their assessments
may not always reflect new or emerging scientific data
about health risk.
By restricting the duty to warn only to EPA-approved labels,
this bill effectively undermines the responsibility
of manufacturers to alert consumers to potential risk
that may not have been fully assessed by the EPA
or that may become clearer over time.
This could place Georgia citizens,
especially farm workers and rural communities
at greater risk.
Objection number two,
ignoring local public health concerns.
While the agricultural industry is vital to Georgia's economy,
This bill fails to account for this specific public health
concerns that may arise in local communities.
Local health departments, health care providers,
and researchers often identify risk
that national agencies like the EPA may overlook.
This bill would restrict the ability of state-level health
authorities to act in the best interest of Georgia's people by weakening the liability
for pesticide manufacturers.
Objection number three.
The ministering consumer protection.
Senate Bill 144 sets a dangerous precedent where corporations are not held fully accountable
for their products.
protection laws exist to ensure that people are adequately informed about the risk associated
with products they use. By removing the possibility for additional warning labels or safety information,
this legislation weakens protections that could potentially save lives and prevent long-term
health effects. Objection number four, risk of environmental damage. We cannot overlook
the environmental consequences of pesticide use. While agriculture is indeed crucial to Georgia's
economy, our land, water, and biodiversity must also be safeguarded. Limiting accountability
for pesticide manufacturers could result in more hazardous chemicals being released
into our environment with long-term irreversible consequences for Georgia's natural resources.
My last objection is public distrust of regulatory oversight.
This bill suggests a heavy reliance on the federal EPA, which though an important body
does not always align with the public health priorities
of Georgia's citizens.
Relying exclusively on federal regulations
and stripping away state-level responsibilities
creates a public perception of insufficient oversight.
Further eroding trust in government and regulatory systems.
In conclusion, while we all recognize the importance of supporting Georgia's agricultural economy,
it is equally important to ensure that our citizens and the environment are protected.
Senate Bill 144 undermines the safety of our communities by shielding pesticide manufacturers
from accountability for potential health risk
that may go unaddressed by the federal EPA.
This is not an issue of economic growth
versus public health.
It is about striking a balance that protects the health
and well-being of every Georgian.
I urge you to vote no.
It is our responsibility to create a system
that holds corporations accountable for their actions
and ensures the safety of all who live and work in our state.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the will, and I'm going to bring you your coat back.
Hi, thank you.
The lady as you were the will.
Representative Ramon is recognized to speak to the bill,
representing Ramon.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
colleagues today I rise in strong and vehement opposition to Senate Bill 144 and I really hope
you will take a moment to allow me to lay out for you how this is part of something way bigger
that is going to make our constituents and our families less safe and that is not an exaggeration.
The corporations behind these bills have been working around the country to limit their liability.
They are trying to shield themselves from the consequences of their products and the way they are harming consumers.
In fact, they have now been before the Supreme Court twice and failed both times, including as recently as February of last year.
So what did they do? They decided to go to legislatures, much like ours, and they went to several of them.
And do you know where they most recently failed in Idaho, not some progressive bastion,
but a place that is actually more to the right than Georgia?
And it's because people are refusing to allow these corporations to be shielded by our votes.
In fact, Idaho overwhelmingly killed their efforts.
Because the reality is, a lot of people around the country and particularly lawmakers are
recognizing this for what it is, an attempt to shield themselves from responsibility.
I refuse to be used by a corporation as a shield for the consequences of their actions.
In fact, just yesterday, in the past 24 hours, because the point of this bill is it says,
you know what, the standard that we are going to go by is the federal one, and what this
This body is trying to use federal government inefficiencies to say we've done our due diligence.
But no, we haven't.
The EPA within the past 24 hours not only has announced almost 1,300 layoffs, but in addition
has announced multiple deregulations related to our air, to our water, to the things that
we need every single day.
And then to have the audacity, for some of these companies to say, poor us, we need your
help. We are in such dire straits. One, in fact, they've now tried the judicial branch,
now they're coming to the legislative branch, and also are already gutting the executive
branch part of this, both on a federal and state level. And we're being told, no, we
are actually just trying to improve standards. We're actually trying to make sure standards
are equal across the board. No, they are literally gaming the board. No matter which way you
are moving these pieces, they are changing the actual board they are working on.
We cannot be pawns in this game.
We cannot allow ourselves to make the world more dangerous for consumers and for Georgians.
And I want to be clear, at the heart of this bill, at its most basic fundamental level,
what this bill is saying is it is saying that a corporation can bring a product to market,
is on the consumers and the rest of us to prove that market is dangerous. I firmly believe that you
need to prove your product is safe before you bring it to the market. It shouldn't be, let's try it
out and then see what happens. This is not, this to be clear, this door has already been opened. We
cannot further open it. We cannot further hurt more people because the reality is, yes, we do get
updated science. Yes, we do get updated regulations. But let's be honest, and I'll be so honest
with you, I don't know what's going to be left of the EPA to actually deal with these corporations.
And if the only entity that we are going to be listening to on these labels in court,
everywhere else is going to be the EPA, is anybody going to be able to successfully
get the justice that they deserve for the harm that's been caused to them? And lastly,
I truly believe in procedure to hold this bill knowing that some of our members had flights,
that some of our members had work commitments and bring it at the last moment to me that
is not okay.
It tells me there's something wrong with this bill and that we needed to shove it through
as quickly as possible.
I firmly believe that Georgians deserve better than this and I sincerely hope you join me
and opposition to this bill, even if it means you got to leave early.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
I'll just remind the lady that this is not an attempt to ram anything through.
This body meets on the days we scheduled to meet, and we're here to be here to finish
our legislation, whether we're doing it one o'clock, two o'clock, or ten o'clock.
Representative Willis is recognized to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon, colleagues.
Arise today in opposition to SB 144 for a variety of reasons.
This bill came through committee, the committee that I sit on.
The committee is called agriculture and consumer affairs.
So I speak to you today from a position of the protection
of the consumer.
First, to define an acronym that you'll
hear a bit more of today, FIFRA, F-I-F-R-A.
Federal insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act,
assuming you didn't know that, that is what FIFRA stands for.
The EPA does not have any authority to determine
what a manufacturer knowingly withheld,
concealed, misrepresented, or whether or not they
destroyed material information.
The EPA can only enforce FIFRA, the federal insecticide,
fungicide, and rodenticide act.
Meaning, at most, they could bring an enforcement action
against a company for misbranding a pesticide.
Both of my parents led distinguished careers
in federal government, my mother retired from the EPA.
as an investigator.
Here's what I know for sure.
When something comes to the EPA to make a change in labeling,
there's a process and a procedure.
That process and procedure takes time.
That process and procedure could take six months.
That process and procedure could take a year.
So my immediate question in committee
was what happens to the consumer in that gap?
While we wait for a label to be changed
or something to be stated as unhealthy for a consumer.
There was no answer, therefore, my concern remains.
Only a judge or jury could determine if a violation occurred.
If the EPA went through all of the steps,
and took a company to court to hold them accountable
for knowingly concealing material information regarding
human health risks, a jury would then be tasked with determining
whether or not they made their case,
it is up to a jury to determine
that a manufacturer violates FIFRA.
Again, it is up to a jury to determine
whether or not a manufacturer has violated FIFRA.
If the EPA tried to determine this without due process,
they would rightfully be sued by the manufacturer
and then lose.
I hope that I'm exemplifying the dangerous loop
that this place is us in.
Regardless of what's happening at a national level,
this is still America where every person deserves due process,
especially those accused of a crime.
This puts inappropriate pressure on the EPA,
which we already don't know where they stand right now
today or tomorrow with all that's going on.
This puts undue pressure on the EPA to vindicate individual rights rather than protect public
health.
The EPA's mandate is to protect public health rather than purse claims to the end in order
to make a determination that would revive civil lawsuits.
This exception only applies to human health claims and does not protect property rights
claims.
quickly I want you to know that Monsanto knowingly concealed the risks that
dichambous braid over the top would drift and harm neighboring farms. What I'm
speaking of is even if I choose to use a pesticide and my neighbor does not,
there's something called drift. For once it gets in the air it can then travel
and it can travel to your organic farm and it can hang out over your organic
crops and then it can infect or weaken what is happening to what you're growing that you're
selling is organic. We can't overlook that. So the ultimate question is why would we ever
stand here today to weaken consumer protections when the committee is called agriculture which
we love and support and consumer affairs which we stand here today to weaken protections for.
In conclusion, for those of us who have survived inexplicable cancers, for those of us who have received diagnosis and had to fight for our lives, and one without explanation as to where our sicknesses have come from.
When we don't have the cancer gene, when we still receive a diagnosis that's life threatening, like I did, and there's no way for the doctor to tell you where it came from.
your mind begins to spend. Is it environmental? Is it dietary? Is it pesticides? Is it the food
that I'm eating? In the absence of a clear answer, we must protect consumer affairs. And not just
for those of us who have fought for our lives in one with inexplicable illnesses, but for those that
we have lost. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you, Representative.
the lady as you are the well, that concludes those speaking that are opposed to the bill.
We now have up to 25 minutes for those in favor.
Representative Osteen is recognized to speak to the bill.
The lady is recognized.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, good afternoon colleagues.
day I rise in support of Senate Bill 144.
Like most of you, I've learned over the course of this session
that Senate Bill 144 is certainly an emotional topic
to several Georgians.
In fact, my inbox probably like yours
has been inundated with countless copy and paste emails,
but I haven't opened the first personal email
with a real-life story to tell.
However, I'll share my personal story with you in a moment.
But let's look first at why this bill is vital to the success of agriculture, our state's
number one industry.
The Environmental Protection Agency, aka the EPA, serves as the federal agency charged
with protecting the environment and human health in the United States.
In other words, they are the sole authority for determining what is and what is not deemed
factual and necessary information that is to be printed on product labels.
Senate Bill 144 will clarify who makes the play, sorry, will clarify who makes the rules
to play by regarding pesticide labels.
Again, that is the EPA period.
This bill does not absolve companies of any wrongdoing.
Rather, this is a bill to keep all pesticides available in our toolbox.
And this issue is not about one pesticide nor one company.
The future of ag profitability depends on a full complement of safe, effective chemicals
to address problems in production agriculture by using the best practices and modes of action.
As I mentioned earlier, I do have a story to tell.
We're a multi-generational family of production
row crop farmers that take immense pride
in helping produce the safest, most abundant,
and most affordable food supply on planet Earth.
Our peanuts are grown sustainably and responsibly
on our farm in which we live in South Georgia.
In fact, we eat them ourselves.
Our cotton becomes the shirts and the jeans most of us enjoy wearing and our pine trees eventually become the wood for building materials.
We take very seriously our role in meeting the basic needs of life by producing safe food, clothing and shelter.
We would never consider compromising our integrity by cutting corners or safety measures in order to meet the needs of us all.
My husband and son are responsible for everything applied to our crops.
As required by the George Department of Agriculture to keep their pesticide credentials, they
are continually trained, licensed, and informed ag professionals who are on the front line of
agriculture, making certain everything is stored, mixed, and applied according to these labels.
As a matter of fact, one of the USDA inspectors just showed up at our farm, completely
announced last month to inspect our chemical storage, safety equipment and application records.
My husband and I would never, ever, ever allow our son to be put in harm's way, especially
since he is the loving father to our only grandchild.
Additionally, I would never stand in this well and ask my fellow legislators and friends
to essentially tie my family's hands and all the hands of the farmers,
pesticide applicators, and workers in the chemical business in the state,
great state of Georgia, from being able to seek damages from bad actors.
I would never do that. My knowledge does it come from magazine articles or
opposed on social media regarding this topic.
My family is ground zero for handling and applying pesticides.
We apply these products daily throughout the growing season.
This critical piece of legislation will ensure
that Georgia farmers keep available
the essential chemistries needed to produce a safe,
affordable, sustainable, and responsible crop
that solidifies continued food security
For our state, country, and world, as President Dwight Eisenhower so thoughtfully pinned
many decades ago, farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and your a thousand
miles from a cornfield.
Friends, I ask for your favorable consideration of Senate Bill 144.
Our farmers are depending on your affirmative vote to protect the future of Georgia agriculture.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Thank you.
The lady as you were the well,
that completes our conversation on Senate Bill 144,
those that are opposed and those are in favor.
Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here you know, the previous question is ordered.
We do have a minority report,
and then we do have Chairman's time,
20 minutes will be allotted for each.
The minority report would be brought to us by Representative Stacey Evans who
representative Evans is recognized to speak to Senate Bill 144, the lady has the
well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon colleagues. I rise in opposition to
Senate Bill 144. I want to touch on what this bill is about to begin with. We've
been told here today that this is not about a single product, but it is. You can just
Google it. This bill that we're considering here today is not unlike a bill that sets
on legislative desks in states all across this country. It is a nationwide effort. It's
passed in a lot of places. It's been stopped in a couple of places. Midwestern states to
be exact, stopped by who in those states? Farmers. Farmers stopped this bill in Midwestern
states. This bill is not about farmers. This bill is about bear, B-A-Y-E-R, the company.
Bear bought Monsanto. Monsanto made Roundup. Roundup causes cancer. That is not a debate
anymore. Roundup causes cancer. A lot of people got hurt. A lot of people got sick.
Monsanto got sued. Monsanto got liability. Monsanto so to bear. Bear bought that
liability and now bear wants to ask us to take it away. They made the deal. We
don't need to help them. They have plenty of lawyers to help them. I'm sure it's
not about farmers. Here's the reality of life, ladies and gentlemen. Industry is always
ahead of government. It's not meant to be an insult to us. It's just reality. They've
got more money. They've got more people. They've got more researchers. They can go faster.
While we appreciate the EPA, and I really love and all the love for the EPA regulators
today in this body, but industry is always ahead.
So under this bill, if industry finds a problem through their own research and development,
for example, that a product causes cancer, may damage land, may cause asthma, who knows,
it could be anything.
They have to report to the EPA through the FIFRA process, and that's fine, that's the
law now. And I'm aware that perhaps industry wanted to make sure through this
legislation that they only have to do one avenue of reporting just to the EPA
not also to the EPD not also to any other regulators out there. That's fine. I
don't have any problem with that. But the bill does more than that. It says that
when industry reports to EPA what they've discovered that's it. I told
them. They didn't tell you. It's not public. I guess if if you happen to know
somebody who knew somebody who knew that industry just found something and they
reported it to fifth grade you could do a freedom of information act request
and maybe in six months you might get the answer and find out what they said
but otherwise we don't know. So industry tells government. Government looks at it.
I heard the author and I appreciate that, yes, there are times when someone can sound
the alarm and there can be an emergency action to take a product off a shelf.
But that's not what normally happens.
And proponents of this bill have said and is true and I don't think anybody is going
to find this to be revolutionary.
Usually, it's slow.
EPA gets the information through FIFRA.
they look at it, it sets on the shelf,
maybe there's a change of administration, who knows?
Doesn't have to be nefarious, it just takes a minute.
Six months, eight months, nine months, a year.
So in this interim period of time, under this bill,
we've told industry, you told the EPA,
if the EPA doesn't tell consumers, you're good.
So in the meantime, six months, nine months,
a year, two years, who knows?
Consumers keep buying the product.
Industry knows there's a problem.
Big little small, it doesn't matter.
We the consumers should be able to have
and form consent about what we buy.
If industry knows there's a problem, why not tell us?
Why not let the consumers know so they can decide
if they want to buy it?
So passing this bill means if industry tells government that's fine, they can keep selling
the product, they can keep knowing that there's a problem and they will not be on the hook
for a failure to warn claim to consumers.
That's essentially it.
We're giving that up.
Right now consumers would have that right under this law they wouldn't.
Now I have heard my colleagues who I respect greatly say,
but this doesn't take away a,
let's say you, the information got shared with the EPA,
it didn't get shared with the consumer,
the consumer bought the product, the consumer gets sick,
even worse the consumer dies.
My colleagues say, you can still sue for wrongful death.
You can still sue for personal injury.
You can still sue for all the medical costs
for your kids asthma or whatever happened.
Thank you.
But how about just tell me in the first place,
so maybe I don't buy it, my kid doesn't die.
Maybe let's do that.
But thank you for not killing my claim
to recover for my dead child.
Consumer information.
Yes, it kills a failure to warn claim.
So yes, it cuts off that litigation claim,
but most importantly, it cuts off incentives for industry
to tell the consumers what they know.
That's what we're doing because we're telling them
they don't have to.
Now here's something funny.
It's been Democrats up here speaking against this,
but those emails that are coming around
to all of our inboxes, most of those are not from Democrats.
Those are from Republicans and how do I know that?
I had a general election this last go around
like many of you did in my opponent
who's a lovely woman that lives in the neighborhood
next to mine who comes down here to lobby
on various issues from time to time.
She's very much against this bill
and she's been emailing me and you and others.
This is a bipartisan thing.
This is about, this isn't about litigation,
this isn't about farmers, this is about bears liability
and interference and litigation
and it's about consumer information.
That is what it's about.
We're cutting that off.
Now, I drip an amendment and it's on your desk
and we're not gonna vote on it
because it wasn't approved by the rules committee
but I wanna talk about it for a second.
I've been peddling this amendment.
There was a bill just like this that was originally a house bill,
and I was trying to get it changed, but then they moved the Senate bill.
And then this came up fast, and so I took my amendment to rules.
And all my amendment does is just clarify what I just told you.
It makes sure that we keep incentives in place for industry to still tell consumers.
That's all it would do.
It wouldn't interfere with the regulatory simplification that the proponents of this bill
have said they want, which I have no problem with.
If you just want to report to one regulator, that's fine.
My amendment doesn't touch that.
And if that was the purpose of the bill and not to provide some later protection, not
to take away incentives for consumer information, there should have been no problem with my
amendment.
But I just want to use this as a moment to talk about why are we so afraid of considering
amendments, ladies and gentlemen, this is a modified structured bill so I can't propose
an amendment to you unless the Rules Committee approves it.
I didn't ask the rules committee to approve the amendment
to change the bill before it got to you.
I simply asked the rules committee to allow me
to put it on your desk and let us vote on it.
Essentially, ladies and gentlemen,
even though we are a co-equal branch of government,
even though we are a deliberative body,
even though our friends across the hall debate amendments
all day every day, we effectively cannot.
They won't even let me put it on your desk to be considered.
So I put it on your desk so you can read it.
I put it on your desk because I think it's sad.
I think it's sad that we cannot be trusted and empowered to debate and make changes to legislation in this body.
And I wish that we could because I think we could have made this bill better.
And that's unfortunate.
So because we can't do that, all I can do is ask you to please join me in voting no to Senate bill 144.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
The lady as you to the well, that concludes our minority report.
Now we'll have the chairman's time, chairman of the committee from which this came.
Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, chairman Robert Dickie is recognized to speak to the bill.
Mr. Chairman, you have up to 20 minutes and however you would like to allocate that time.
Thank you, Mr. Baker colleagues.
I don't come up here often.
I don't come up here often to have to defend bills, but I'm mad as I can be right now.
So folks are coming after agriculture, coming after your food supply.
They've sued everybody else in this state, these attorneys, and big from out of state,
around the country, and then they see an opportunity to go after agriculture, go after our food
supply and I'm not going to stand here and let it happen. I'm tired of hearing
mistruse from emails and mistruse and wrong statements in this chamber. I'm a
farmer and I know what it takes to farm and it takes these plant protection
products that I depend on to be able to be successful to be able to grow crops.
house. I'm going home hopefully sometime this afternoon. To put plant protection products
on our peaches, I can't weed a thousand acres of peaches. I'm going to put plant protection
products on my strawberries. I can't sell them with mold and middle of them. This bill
is critical for agriculture and for this nation's food supply.
We have the number one industry in this state is agriculture.
And we have to have, I can fight, I can fight the weather, I can fight bad markets, I can
fight disease, but I can't fight the courts with taking away our plant protection products
in this state.
You know, I don't think we'll start the death in this country, but if you want every
better your food imported from Mexico, from South America, go down this road without
planning protection products, and that's what will happen.
We are the bread basket of the world.
I'm wearing a corn tie right here.
You know what, 100 years ago, in the 1950s, corn production was 100 bushels per acre.
You know what it is today, 400 bushels per acre.
You know what all those chickens you eat, they eat corn.
We have to have food in this country, it's a national security.
You think egg prices went up, you wait till we can't get food in this country.
When our production starts going down, the world population is going up.
You better hold on to your wallet, nobody can afford the food prices.
You know, we're in a world market, all my plant protection, a lot of my plant protection
products come from overseas.
And if that's disruptions, if I can't put the right fertilizer, the right pesticide,
the right fungicide, we'll lose our crop in a week's time.
Contproducers have to have products, or weeds would absolutely consume the fields just
in a matter of months or weeks.
We have to have consistency in agriculture.
We can't be relying on foreign products and foreign food in this country.
And this legislation is a small avenue to guarantee that companies build a confidence to sell
these products in our country and our state.
We have the most affordable, abundant, safest food supply of any country.
You know what our life expectancy has done in the last 100 years?
And our food production increased our life expectancy has increased.
I just, I just so frustrated here, listen to some things I've heard and get away from what we need to do in this state.
We're talking about economic development.
We're talking about being the number one state to do business.
We've got to have a legal environment in this state that encourages it and encourages
agriculture.
We've got great strengths in this state in our agricultural industry.
It's not just the growing, it's the ag businesses, the producers and the processors and the
transportation and all that we do in this state, environmental.
We've got to make sure that stays strong in this state, do not let the courts pull down
our great economy in this state, our great ag economy.
We had Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins here yesterday.
We met with her and asked her for a lot of things.
We talked about trade, we talked about research, we talked about farm income and the farm
bill.
y'all this is what we can do in our state pass this bill we can't depend on
watching them for everything this is something we can do right here in this
state to strengthen our ag economy and I and I food economy you know I know many
of you ready to go home I am too and I said I'm going home and look at those
peace blossoms but they're very vulnerable and I've got to help a
technology, energy supply, labor, good weather, the Lord bringing sending rain and the good
dirt in the sunshine. But we've got to have these products. I've got to have a supply
of them. I can't, I can't just wait weeks to get something from somewhere else. I hope
the weather will, we're under attack.
You see it, this, this the litigation is coming after agriculture.
And this is the first blow in my mind that I've seen it
witness his firsthand.
We got to fight back folks.
You got to stand up for your food supply for the cost
that we don't depend on foreign food.
You know, a lot of you are wearing green today.
all the wearing the lucky charms and all that.
You know why we were celebrating St. Patrick's Day?
Because all the Irish moved to this country in 1850s.
A million of them started to death in Ireland.
And another million got on boats and came to this country
to be able to find food.
And I don't want my children and my grandchildren
having a word about food.
That's why we need this bill.
I hope you'll vote for it and support your food supply
and my food supply.
Thank you, Mr. Baker.
Mr. Chairman, you're going to yield some time.
Is that remained of the, Mr. Chairman,
you're going to yield the remained of your time?
I'll yield the remaining of my time.
Chairman Leveritt, I think the chairman
had designated you to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Dickey has you were the well representative
of the liberty is recognized to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to just very briefly address a few issues
that have been discussed at great length
with regard to this bill.
I obviously cannot talk to the need for the availability
of these sorts of products.
I think not the previous speakers have addressed that
very passionately and eloquently, they live it every day and so they know those issues better
than I do. What I want to just simply was to address is what I view to be the legal scope
of the bill. So I do not view this as an immunity bill. I do not view this as a bill that
really limits many of the kinds of claims you would have as a user of a product. Products
liability claims. The only claim that I, in my view, this bill adversely would impact
is the failure to warn.
And that space, to some extent, is already regulated
and controlled by the federal government
through that FIFRA, the federal insecticide,
fungicide, and rodenticide act.
That already provides that manufacturers
have to register these products.
They have to disclose information to the EPA about them.
And then they have to use on that product
a specifically approved label.
And as some of the other speakers addressed,
Some of this came because other states have been trying
to require them to use different or additional labels,
which puts the manufacturer in sort of a catch 22.
They have to use the federal label, nothing more,
nothing less if they put something else on it there
in violation of federal law and subject penalty.
So that's part of the issue we're addressing here.
And as part of that, we're saying that as long as you're
using the federal label, you can't be found liable
under a failure to warn theory.
That's the only theory that this bill impacts.
And if it's later determined that the company didn't disclose
all the information that it had about the product,
even that protection goes away.
So it doesn't prevent you from suing in negligence.
It doesn't prevent you from suing in strict liability
and other kinds of claims that you could assert.
And so admittedly, this does impact claims you could file.
it does. But I believe you heard from the other speakers how on balance that is needed
and I think given the limited scope of that impact, there are still other claims that
are available, it's not like companies will never have to answer if they have put a dangerous
product out into the use of the general public. So I would encourage you to vote for this
bill because I believe it is a reasonable response to a problem that is being encountered in
an agricultural business to preserve the use of these products because you've heard people
testify who know, who live it every day, how useful they are and how needed they are.
And they're still as a source of recovery if people feel like they have been harmed
by them.
So I would encourage you to vote for this bill and to the extent I have any additional
time left, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield it to Chairman Minks who sponsored similar
legislation in the house like this one the gentleman is you the well there is
time left on the chairman's time representative meeks is recognized to come
back to the well thank you mr. Speaker
you know we've heard a lot of debate today about what this bill doesn't
doesn't do who it might or might not protect and ladies and gentlemen I
standing in this well, and when I speak to each of you, I look you out of eye. I'm not
willing to look you out of eye until you something that I don't believe. And then for one
minute, I thought that this bill would weaken you, the one setting by you, the one in front
of you, the one behind me or our families. I wouldn't be standing here. If it would
take away any right of you to take any calls of action, if it would lessen the
company's ability to provide you information that you're supposed to get, so
that you can make an educated decision on whether or not to use a product. I
wouldn't be standing here.
Comment was made earlier about products coming to the market, whether you know
it or not is $350 million to put a product on the market and 12 to 14 years of
research and I've spoken to our wheat scientists at University of Georgia who
makes the recommendations on the mixtures that we spray and that's not just
coming from the companies that's coming from EPA that's coming from researchers
at research institutions that we value in our state such as University of
Georgia College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences.
I want to reiterate that if a company willingly withholds any information, ladies and gentlemen,
it's federal law.
You've heard that.
It is the case.
They will, they will never again be able to register a product because they lied to the consumers.
They lied to you.
They lied to me.
That was made earlier about Dachamba drift.
Yes, that's right.
It happened.
It got pulled from the market.
You know why?
Because people in one state, not in Georgia, was not using the product as it was labeled.
And because it was not labeled correctly, we have lost that as a tool in our toolbox
to effectively manage weeds at others' walls.
So guess where we are now with the exception of one product is hand, we pull them by hand.
Two additional things and I'll close, Mr. Speaker.
The EPA regulates the label states regulate use of the product.
A few moments ago when swapping with some text with one of the authorities in our state,
I want each of you to know that in the state of Georgia,
under the pesticide control act,
each of these products are registered annually
in the state of Georgia.
That means our commissioner of agriculture, who you know,
if he sees a problem with it, he can pull that product.
He can pull that label.
But ladies and gentlemen,
I stand here to say that we're removing
the responsibility of a company to be forthright
with consumers, I couldn't stand here and look you
in the eye if I thought that was the case.
I would ask you to support House Senate Bill 144
and continue to support our agriculture industry
that will continue to support and provide
the safest, most affordable, most abundant food supply
of anywhere in the world.
And without Mr. Speaker, I'd urge favorable consideration
just set up bill 144 and ask for your green vote.
With that, Ms. Speaker, you're the well.
Gentlemen, as you were the well,
that completes Chairman's time.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the pastor of the bill?
Here in the other report, the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill?
Will vote yes, all those opposed?
We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
have all members voted. All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you
lock the machine? On the passage of Senate Bill 144, 144, the A's are 101, the A's are 58.
Bill Hammers see the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed.
That completes our rules calendar we're moving on to afternoon orders.
members I won't give you a heads up on who has an afternoon order. I'm going to ask you
to hold your afternoon orders to one minute. If humanly possible, humanly possible. I think
You can do it.
Chairman Ballinger, you're going to be recognized first.
Chairman Ballinger, it was not feeling well.
And she's not here.
So I'll make that announcement after an order in just a moment.
Before you all leave, I'll go ahead and do it right now.
Members, we have several announcements. I want to make this one before I do one that we
also need to hear. But tomorrow, the 14th of this month would have been Speaker David
Rolston's birthday. And it is his birthday. His family will celebrate it. This
house will celebrate the passing and the service of a good good man. So I
want to remind all of us, let's I'm think of the speaker Rolston on tomorrow as
we think about him. Remember him and think about his birthday and all the
contributions he made to this great state. I'm going to ask some of you
I'm going to ask you to remain standing.
Representative Park Cannon.
Representative Park Cannon's recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you members.
Today I come to recognize Black Midwives Day in the state of Georgia,
which is typically celebrated once a year in every state
and to specifically talk about the eradication of black midwives and the good
work that we're doing in Georgia to bring attention to them. We do have a
number of black midwives at the Capitol today and they are specifically here
wearing white in honor of two midwives who passed away. One is known as
Mama Nazra. She was well known to this house and visited many times. She was
the best friend of former representative Abel Mabel Thomas and so you might
remember seeing her with her best friend so we do miss Mama Nazra and those are
the members there who are here to be honored at the door Mr. Mr. Speaker so
that they can hear that we are speaking about them Mr. Speaker I think
that okay don't keep you can open the door but they're holding them there
because we're having this announcement.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that.
And so in honor of Mama Nasra,
and then also Ms. Titi, who unfortunately has passed away
as well, these black midwives are here.
And I just thank you members for taking the time,
would ask for a moment of silence
for these two amazing black midwives
who serve Georgia families.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Representative Cannon.
Representative Mathis has recognized for an afternoon order.
Then we'll have Representative Wade,

Thank you, Mr. Chair.

She turns 100 tomorrow.
And she says I'm her best son-in-law because I'm the only one, but my wife, Ellen and her
brother are the only two children, Mrs. Lutley.
Mrs. Lutley was married to Mr. Billy F. Persher for 72 years, and he died back in 2015.
So I'm so proud of her.
She's doing well, she broke her hip a few weeks ago, but she came through it fine, we're
just trying to get her back to where she was at that home.
So if y'all are pray for, I appreciate it, but she's been an inspiration to all of us
in our community.
And I'm going to keep this short, Miss Speaker, but I do appreciate it.
And I'm glad to hear that Speaker Rofton's birthday is on the 14th, too.
So thank you very much for y'all's attention and support, and God bless y'all.
I yield away.
I think you can go home now to talk about my own law.
Sounds like she's a good one.
Happy birthday.
Representative Wade, recognize for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'd like to want to rise this to school board appreciation
week across Georgia.

And one other member is at 16 years, and then the other two
in their fifth year but my special shout out is also that Dawson County School Board
made the decision to accept what the voters voted on on House Bill 581 and they opted
in along with our county and our city to recognize that they still have milled rate that they
can use to just five increased revenues when needed but they are going to cap the rising
cost of home ownership and keeping that cap based on what this legislature has passed
in the citizens voted for. So shout out to Dawson Kenny School Board and go Tigers, thank you.
Thank you. Go Tigers, Representative Owl. We're giving blood again, Doc.
