>> Good morning.
Greetings to President Bert Jones, to
all present senators, especially to
Senator Davenport for sponsoring
Spellman Day today. I am Reverend Dr.
Michelle Gidri where and I bring you
greetings from Spellelman College where
I serve as the dean of the chapel and
I'm so grateful to bring today's devote
devotion which reads as follows.
On a Judean mountain side, the one who
was the living word momentarily paused
his ministry of healing to teach a
swarming crowd who were desperate to
understand the kingdom he came
proclaiming, the kingdom he embodied and
the kingdom he lived and practiced even
in that moment. For in sitting with the
people that day rather than sending them
away, in teaching them rather than
leaving them in their spiritual
darkness, and in healing them rather
than than leaving them to languish in
their sickness. The one whose name was
Jesus signified the coming of a new
community that was inclusive,
compassionate, and that sought to make
the wounded whole. This was his sermon
on the mount recorded in the Gospel of
Matthew chapters 5-7. And some of
Jesus's most compelling, timeless, and
also some of his least popular teachings
can be found here in this gathering that
preceded his church as we know it. That
was simply too good to be confound by
walls and antiquated norms of who
belonged and didn't. These were hungry
and tired people. And in seeing their
inherent value, Jesus taught them not to
just follow him, but how to be like him.
Blessed are the merciful, he taught
them, for they will receive mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, he taught
them, for they will see God. Blessed are
the peacemakers, he taught them, for
they will be called God's children.
And when you give charity, he taught
them. And when you pray, don't be
hypocritical and do it for attention and
acclaim. Do it in secret. And God who
sees in secret will reward you openly.
He begs of us today, even from that very
mountain side. Please do not be people
who are more concerned with your walls
than you are with extending welcome, who
are more committed to your categories
than extending care, and who are more
concerned with exclusivity rather than
access. Please don't be so committed to
your own convenience that you can't stop
to pour a little bit of what you have
into someone who is in dire need. And
when you pray, he taught them, don't
throw up empty words to God. You don't
need to be loud. You don't need to be
loquacious for God already knows what
you need before you even ask. And then
Jesus prayed for those people. The very
prayer that I pray for you today. Let us
pray.
Dear God in heaven, hallowed be your
name. Your kingdom come. Your will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread. And
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory forever and
ever. Amen.
>> Amen.
Thank you.
if I can have everyone's attention. Uh
it's always nice to have our elected
officials, our congressional leaders
from around the state. And uh if I can
get everybody's attention,
everybody's attention.
We'd like to give all our congressmen
and women the opportunity to address
this body and something we always take a
lot of pride in and very happy and proud
to have uh Congressman Rich McCormack
here today. He is in his second term as
uh our congressman. hails from
Alpharetta, Roswell area and uh he
represents a a good portion of uh this
this fine state. He's done an
outstanding job while serving in
Congress. He he is a a medical doctor by
trade, proud graduate of Morehouse
School of Medicine and former military
um military uh seal, right? Navy Seal.
>> Marine pilot
>> Marine Marine. I'm sorry. I'm gonna get
hit now. I'm sorry. All right. A former
Marine, just like the dean of uh of our
fine chamber here, but uh Congressman
McCorm has is, like I said, has done a
great job. He represents our state very
well. We're happy to have him here
today, and y'all please give him a warm
Senate welcome. Thank
it. Is an honor to be here with you
today. Thanks for uh participating. Uh,
one of the few things that I have hope
in right now and and I guess there's a
lot of things I could have hope in and
there are still commonalities amongst
us. Sometimes it's the Marine Corps and
that transcends politics. I promise you.
You just want to know somebody's on your
side, which is the bigger part of
politics in my opinion. We have plenty
that divides us right now. But if you
look at a guy like myself and you may
judge me just by what I look like, and I
get that. We do that to each other all
the time. But you probably didn't know I
was an associate professor at Morehouse
Spellelman Clark Atlanta and Morris
Brown at one time went to Morehouse
School of Medicine and after four years
was elected student body president by my
peers
and my peers were about 60% female, 80%
black and about 95% liberal.
So how does a white male conservative
get elected at that kind of school?
because of our commonalities.
When I give the uh commencement keynote
speech this year, you won't hear a
political thing that comes out of my
mouth because politics
doesn't really solve problems. Now, we
the people can solve a lot of problems,
but when you make any item political, it
becomes unsolvable.
What do I mean by that? Tell me how
politicians have been the great solution
to racism.
You can't because we're not going to
solve that. We're also not going to
solve education.
We cannot replace communities, churches,
parents, families, and relationships.
You can't break down the barriers by
making a law.
You break down barriers by having meals
together, by praying together, by
getting to know each other. Because
usually when you vilify somebody, it's
cuz you don't know them very well. And
quite frankly, the things that divide
you, whether it's inside your party or
collectively between two parties, those
things will never be passed into law.
Only those things that we agree on will
be passed. And that's the magic of our
government, that limited government that
we're supposed to have. Sometimes it's
best when you don't pass laws because
some of the worst things we have that
have affected our communities have been
the laws we passed with the unintended
consequences.
I think the best thing we can do is get
the government out of the way of
progress.
Depoliticize our problems so we can
actually deal with them because it's not
us against them.
It's us against evil, against prejudice,
against the common foes that have been
set before us by the great foe. And so I
hope when you guys legislate and you
debate, realize that you can grandstand,
you can get a lot of publicity, you
could raise a lot of money, but only the
things that unite us are going to get
passed.
Now, you can really try to change
people's mind, and there's some people
that are swayable. A lot of people are
on the extremes. But can I give a piece
of advice to anybody who maybe hasn't
made up their mind in life, who's still
swayable or young enough that they
haven't made up their mind on what they
believe is true. If you want to have
influence
instead of trying to win an argument,
win a friend.
Anybody who gets on on the internet
knows that you don't see minds changed
because of somebody's great and eloquent
argument on the internet. It doesn't
happen. The more I try to convince you
you're wrong, the less you'll believe
me. But if I can convince you that I
love you, which isn't a one-time
investment, it's a multiple endeavor.
If I can convince you that I love you,
you might just believe what I have to
say next. And that's real influence. And
with that, that's not just advice.
That's just my experience.
I love you. I want you guys to keep on
representing us the way you do because
this is where the real politics is. The
most representative government we have
and anything I can do to push power down
to you guys is going to be better off
for our state and for our great nation.
God bless you and seidelis.
>> All right.
It is always nice to have uh the our
physicians that come down here and
volunteer their time
and uh to the capital and all the people
here. And I u am glad to have uh the
orthopedic orth orthopedic we're here
today. Uh and to introduce our wonderful
guest I will call on the senator from
the 38th to introduce.
>> Thank you Mr. President. Good morning
colleagues. I am honored to welcome back
to the chamber Dr. John Gleason who is
an orthopedic surgeon with Resurgence
Orthopedics.
and he told me to keep this short and
sweet. So, I'm just going to share that
he has 30 years of experience and 25 of
those 30 years he served with the gentle
lady from the 32nd. So, I think we
should all hold that against him uh
rather uh outside of anything. So, very
honored to welcome Dr. John Gleason back
to the chamber.
>> All right.
All right.
>> Thank y'all. It's good to look out there
and see a lot of friends uh and no
adversaries. So, it's it's fun to be
here. Uh thank y'all for the work you do
for the citizens of Georgia and for
their health. And good luck. You have 31
more days to do it.
>> All right. Good job. Good job.
All right, if we could have everyone's
attention, we have some very special
guests here today. Every year we always
is very proud and honored to have the
ladies of Spellelman College come and
and be recognized for all the wonderful
work that they do that that historic
that they do at that historical
institution. And u we once again have a
good group here behind us. Young lady
getting ready to graduate from theater.
I'm I'm I got a good feeling we're
probably going to hear from her uh in a
second here. But uh Secretary read the
resolution then we'll ask Senator from
the 17th to introduce
>> Senate Resolution 591 by Senator
Davenport of the 17th. A resolution
recognizing Spellman Day at the Georgia
State Capital and for other purposes.
Whereas Spellelman College founded in
1881 in Atlanta, Georgia is a nationally
acclaimed private liberal arts college
for women and the oldest historically
black college for women in the United
States. And whereas Spellelman College
enrolls approximately 2500 students,
offers 34 academic majors and 39 minors,
and reports that 86% of full-time
faculty hold doctoral degrees or the
terminal degree in their field. And
whereas Spellelman College reports a 76%
six-year graduation rate, significantly
exceeding the national average, whereas
Spellelman College has produced a global
network of more than 20,000 alumni
worldwide. Now therefore, be it resolved
by the Senate that the members of this
body recognize Spellelman Day at the
Georgia State Capital and commend
Spellelman College for its enduring
legacy of academic excellence,
leadership, development, and service to
the state of Georgia, the nation, and

and since that time has become a global
leader in the education of women of
African descent and is the oldest

the United States. Spellelman is

>> Good morning and thank you Senator
Davenport for that wonderful
introduction to Lieutenant Governor
Jones President Promp Walker and
distinguished members of the Georgia
State Senate. Thank you for the
opportunity to be here with you today.
We are grateful for your leadership and
for the Senate's continued support of
higher education across the state of
Georgia.
I am delighted to share Spellelman Day
at the Capitol with members of the
National Alumni Association of
Spellelman College Incorporated, the
Georgia chapters along with our
students, our faculty, and our staff.
Thank you for recognizing Spellelman
College today. Spellelman College plays
a critical role in Georgia's economic
vitality, workforce development, and
leadership pipeline. Our graduates live,
work, and lead across the state,
particularly in metro Atlanta,
contributing to key sectors including
health care, education, public service,
technology, and entrepreneurship.
Spellelman's mission is especially
relevant today in its rapidly changing
economy. We prepare students to think
critically, work across disciplines,
adapt to change, and lead with purpose
and those qualities that serve Georgia's
employers, communities, and public
institutions so well. We are proud of
Spellelman's continued academic
excellence. Spellelman is ranked number
one H.B.CU CU for 19 consecutive years.
Ranked number two nationally for social
mobility, number seven for learning
communities, and number 37 among all
national liberal arts colleges by US
News and World Report. But most
recently, Newsweek named Spellelman the
number one best college for women in the
nation.
>> These outcomes are made possible in part
through Georgia's commitment to student
access and affordability. We are deeply
grateful for HOPE and other state
financial aid programs, including those
that support students attending private
colleges. This support is critical for
Spellelman students and their families
and helps ensure talented Georgians can
pursue higher education here at home.
We are also grateful for recent
philanthropic investments, including a
$16.5 million gift from the Arthur Blank
Family Foundation here in Atlanta, and a
38 million unrestricted gift from the
Mackenzie Scott family, which directly
supports student completion, academic
excellence, and campus modernization,
advancing Spellelman's strategic
priorities, and strengthening our
long-term impact. Our students continue
to excel, earning nationally competitive
scholarships, engaging in meaningful
civil service, expanding literacy
through programs like Spell Reads, and
strengthening local economies through
initiatives such as the Center for Black
Entrepreneurship. I am proud to lead
Spellman during this important moment
for higher education. The world is
changing, but the need for
well-prepared, thoughtful, and capable
leaders has never been greater. Thank
you for celebrating Spellelman College
Day at the Capitol and thank you for
your continued partnership and support
for Spellelman College and the students
we so humbly serve. Thank you.
Good job. Good job.
>> So nice to have the leadership here with
at Spellelman and all the fine ladies
there in the in the gallery. Uh we do
have one of our local celebrities with
the AJC is a proud graduate of uh of
Spellelman College. Maya Rabu, give her
a round of applause here.
Now, I did that for myself cuz she never
she never writes anything good about me.
So, I'm hoping maybe she'll give me a
pass this time. But, uh I'm kidding.
Maya knows I love her. And one
correction here, the senator from the 26
is not a graduate of a Spellelman
College, right? He would like to have
been he would like to have been
kicked out before
>> but he he he assured me he went to he's
a proud graduate of Tuskegee and he
assured me he made plenty of trips from
South Alabama up here. So all right
thank you ladies with ladies with
spelling. Let's give them a round of
applause again.
We're going to move on to points of
personal privilege
just because we got started a little
late and things have run a little late.
So, we're going to go ahead and go right
to it. I recognize senator from the 47th
for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like for
my uh friends from from Jackson County.
I've got a great group of uh Jackson
County Youth Leadership Group to all
stand up for me. We want to honor your
visit to the capitol. Said the the uh
Jackson County is a little unique in
that there are th three school
districts, but we quickly added the
fourth one last year. So there actually
four school districts in Jackson County.
Three of them are represented here with
the Jackson County youth leaders. My
colleague from the 50th and I want to
welcome you to the Senate and we'd like
to give you a big round of applause. So
great to have you all here this morning.
recognize the senator from the fourth.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
Many of y'all know the term rolling
thunder, right? Oh yeah, we all know
that term. But today at the capitol is
called strolling thunder thunder, excuse
me, strolling thunder. So let me tell
you a little bit about that. Um, you may
have noticed a buzz of activity around
the capital today of the gold dome
today. Our friends at the Georgia Early
Education Alliance for Ready Students,
commonly referred to as Gears, are
having their annual event, Strolling
Thunder, where young children, birth to
five, and their families join us at the
capital. I've already seen many children
out there already this morning. Early
childhood is an incredible window of
opportunity where brains are developing
more rapidly than at any other point.
Our youngest children are our future,
and we know that. Please say hello to
any t any of our tiny constituents if
you see them in the halls and join gears
and their families across the street
later on today at the freight depot for
lunch. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield
well.
Recognize senator from the 41st.
Good morning, colleagues. This is really
for my son who has gone back to the
office to watch on TV because this place
was a little more hectic than a
5-year-old could handle. But I want to
wish Reese a happy fifth birthday,
so honored.
I thank you all to this body. You all
have welcomed him with such
graciousness. But I'm deeply honored to
be able to be his mom. So many of you
all know he came into our lives when he
was just two years old um in a really
sudden moment and we have gotten to love
him and care for him with so much
passion. So um happy birthday Ree. We
love you and I'll see you soon.
>> Thank you, Senator. And wish your son a
very happy birthday. It's hard to
believe he's already five.
All right. We're going to center from
33rd.
>> Thank you, Mr. President, my fellow
senators, colleagues, friends, and
y'all.
Uh, I am pleased to share with you that
the senator from the 48th and I will be
serving as the bipartisan co-chairs of
the newly created Senate India Caucus.
The Senate India Caucus is a bipartisan
coalition that promotes a relationship
between India and the state of Georgia
based on mutual trust and respect to
increase close collaboration across a
broad spectrum of strategic interest
such as promoting democracy, economic
development, and cultural partnership
along with friendship. You will today
receive an email inviting you to join
our caucus. We hope you will reciprocate
by answering yes. Thank you very much.
And Mr. President, I yield. Well,
thank you, Senator. Recognize Senator
from the third.
Thank you, Mr. President. colleagues. Um
you'll notice on your desk you have an
invitation from the Brunswick Golden
Isles Chamber of Commerce for their
state leadership appreciation dinner.
It's on February the 17th about 3 weeks
away. The reason I'm giving you this as
early as I am is to give you a chance to
RSVP so that we can figure out how much
shrimp we need to bring. And I will
remind you of this a little closer to
the date, but put it on your calendars.
February 17th at the depot 5:00
uh tons of wild Georgia shrimp. Thank
you.
All right, Senator, we'll have to mark
our calendars. Always a good day.
Recognize the senator from the 28th.
Senator, you want to speak from there?
The floor is yours.
I think so. Thank you.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very
much.
Yesterday
I was driving home from here
and heard on the radio about what was
happening in my neighborhood
just a few blocks from my house.
We witnessed another instance
of Donald Trump's egregious attempts to
control the narrative on that 2020
election by sending the FBI
to God's country to forcibly take
evidence from the Fulton County Election
Office. He once again proved
that he will stop at nothing to get what
he wants. No matter how shocking, no
matter how dangerous, no matter how
unlawful.
Everybody knows this is nonsense.
We are four years past the 2020
election. That election was counted,
recounted,
audited, reviewed by the courts, and the
list goes on.
There was no rigging. There were no fake
votes. There was no secret stash hiding
in a the county office.
Is there even one person in the capital
today who still believes that the 2020
election was rigged?
So, let's not be let's be honest about
what's going on and what we're watching
and what we're hearing on the radio.
When state officials follow the law and
refuse to hand over protected voter
data, suddenly we see the federal
government intervening. When they don't
get what they want, they come and they
take it. That should worry everybody in
this building. The FBI exists to keep
people safe, to stop violent crime, to
stop terrorism, to protect the public.
It is not supposed to be the president's
personal play thing, using federal law
enforcement to chase political
grievances of 2020.
This is wrong. It tells voters that the
rules only matter when they're
convenient.
If the federal government wants
something, there's a process.
They should think they're entitled to
it, the real process, and not what they
come up with. There's a court.
What there should be
should not be is intimidation
dressed up as enforcement.
Actions like this undermine trust,
intimidate election workers, and pull
Georgia backwards. We should be
governing in 2026, not replaying 2020
like it never ended. This body should
reject chaos, reject political theater,
and reject using our law enforcement
as a personal tool, as a weapon.
Georgia has been a national model for
election integrity.
We do not need federal
raids to protect our democracy. We need
leaders with a moral clarity to defend
it. History teaches us that democracy
does not vanish overnight.
It is not dismantled slowly, legally,
and often with
applause from their those who believe
that it will benefit them.
Uh ladies and gentlemen, we must not
become
that casualty.
It is too late to reverse democracy.
It's time to move forward. So, Georgia,
let's move forward and not backwards.
Thank you.
I
recognize Senator from the 38th for a
point of personal privilege.
The man in the brand new three-piece
suit. Senator, that didn't that suit
didn't come off the rack now. I know
that. You had to get measured for that.
Huh?
Thank you, Mr. President. We're going to
get you one. Uh colleagues, uh
yesterday, Senate District 38, my
district, became ground zero for the
latest assault on American democracy. An
assault that did not begin yesterday,
but one that began to unfold in 2020.
Colleagues, no matter what you saw on
the news, I want to share something with
you. I was there. And here's what I know
to be true. The federal government
seized 2020 Fulton County election
ballots, not 2024,
because that was an election that Donald
Trump already won in Georgia.
They weren't securing an election. They
were revisiting the past to control the
future. We still don't know where these
ballots were taken.
And even more disturbing, we don't know
how this information will be used. What
we do know without dispute is that this
action was taken without the consent or
knowledge of Georgia election officials.
Secrecy is not law enforcement. Secrecy
is intimidation.
I have deep respect for the debates in
this chamber, but yesterday we were
reminded to remember that we are Georgia
state senators.
And I must share that this is exactly
why we speak about what happens across
this nation. This is why this chamber
and our voices matter because yesterday
is what happens when power goes
unchecked and silence becomes
permission. This is not abstract. This
is not theoretical. This happened in my
district, seven minutes from my home, in
your backyard, in the state of Georgia.
These are my constituents. These are
Georgia voters, and they are the ones
that are being targeted.
Yesterday, I heard claims that the
minority caucus does not respect due
process. Well, there is nothing more
disrespectful to due process than
seasoned ballots in the dark. Let me be
clear. Yesterday was not about a sore
loser. This isn't about 2020. It's about
controlling 2026.
This is about a president who knows that
his grip on power is slipping and who is
willing to weaponize the federal
government to hold on to it. We have
watched this unfold across the country.
And now it is here in the state of
Georgia.
This should concern every Georgian, not
just those here in metro Atlanta, white,
black, Democrat, Republican,
independent, urban, and rural alike. I
am sounding the alarm because democracy
does not collapse all at once. It
erodess when good people are told to
look away. If ballots can be seized
without transparency, if election
workers can be sidelined without
consent, if fear replaces trust, then
the question is no longer who wins
elections, but whether elections still
belong to the people. This chamber must
choose, our state must choose, this
country must choose. Silence or the
constitution, fear or freedom, power or
principle?
History is watching what we do next. I
for one refuse to be silent while
democracy is dragged away from the
people it belongs to. And with that, Mr.
President, I yield the well.
Recognize the senator from the fifth for
point of personal privilege.
Yesterday, the FBI raided the Fulton
County Election Board. There were once
again searching for materials related to
2020 presidential election. An election
that has been audited, litigated,
reviewed, reaffirmed, and yet years
later fairy tales and conspiracy
theories refused to loosen their grips.
These fantasies have already done real
damage.
They have poisoned trust,
fractured communities, and now they
threaten something even bigger.
Confidence in 2026 election and in our
ability to govern ourself.
Our people deserve more and they and
they deserve better.
This year mark the 250th anniversary
of American
founding.
I wasn't born into it like so many here.
And choosing America mean choosing the
ideas it was built on. A government of
the people by the people
providing that free citizen can govern
themsel.
We do not need a king who treat law
enforcement like personal errand boys
chasing imaginary nightmares dreamed up
to clinch to power.
Today we must condemn this. We must
stand up clearly and courageously
for the values America was founded upon.
Thank you. I
recognize center from the seventh.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise to talk about what happened
yesterday. Federal agents executed a
search warrant at Fulton County's
election facility and took records and
ballots from the 2020 election. And I
want to begin with what should be
obvious, but apparently still needs to
be said out loud in 2026.
This is not about 2020. This is about
2026. This is about who controls what
comes next. Because nearly six years
after Georgia voters made their choice,
some people are still trying to keep the
state trapped in a permanent argument
about the last election so they can
justify rewriting the rules for the next
one. This is not random. This is not
isolated. This is not just one more
headline. It is part of a larger scheme,
an intentional campaign to manufacture
doubt, flood the zone, and then claim
that the only solution is takeover. They
want Georgians exhausted. They want
voters confused, and they want the
public so overwhelmed that people stop
asking the most important question of
all. Who benefits from keeping Georgia
in chaos? Because when you can't win an
election fair and square, you try to
control who runs it. When you can't
persuade voters, you try to control the
process. And when you can't accept the
truth, you try to bury it under noise.
And that noise has a purpose. It's the
same play every time. Step one, call it
an emergency. Step two, say the locals
can't be trusted. Step three, replace
local control with political control.
And if that sounds familiar, it's
because we've watched versions of it
unfold across this country where the
goal isn't security. The goal is power.
The goal is power. Now, let's talk about
something that should alarm every
Georgian, no matter what party you
belong to. The US Department of Justice
has been suing for access to Georgia's
unredacted statewide voter registration
data. Data that includes sensitive
personal information, including your
driver's license numbers, impartial
social security numbers. This is not a
small request. This is not routine. It
is not normal, and it is not harmless.
That is a demand for an enormous amount
of personal data. Information that could
expose Georgians to risk if misused or
mishandled and information Georgia law
is designed to protect. So pair that
with what happened in Fulton County and
the picture becomes clear. This is about
information. It is about leverage. It's
about control. Because once you convince
people the system can't be trusted, you
can justify almost every anything.
taking authority away from local
communities, centralizing control,
changing rules in the name of
confidence, and setting the stage to
interfere with elections that haven't
even happened yet. And let me say this
part in plain English. Georgia is a
swing state. Georgia is ground zero and
Georgia will be targeted. We're not
guessing anymore. We're watching it
happen in real time. And the question is
whether we are going to pretend it's
normal or whether we are going to name
it for what it is. This is the politics
of pretext. the politics of manufactured
doubt. The politics will accept
elections only when we win them. And
while they are trying to keep Georgia
locked in a never- ending fight about
2020, real people are living in 2026.
Families are paying more and getting
less. Hospitals are closing. Rent is
rising. Insurance premiums are rising.
Wages are not. And that contrast matters
because it tells you what this is really
about. When leaders have nothing to
offer on affordability, nothing to offer
on healthcare, nothing to offer on
stability, they reach for the oldest
trick in politics, keep people afraid,
keep people angry, and keep the
spotlight on anything except the bills
piling up on the kitchen table. So
here's my message today. We will not let
the future of Georgia elections be
decided by people who are still trying
to relitigate the last one. We will not
let Fulton County be turned into a
permanent scapegoat so as so someone
else can justify a takeover. We will not
let confidence become a code word for
control. And we will say clearly over
and over until nobody can pretend they
do not understand this is not about
2020. This is about 2026.
Thank you.
>> Recognize the senator from the 29th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Um, after our conversation yesterday,
I went back and and looked at some of
the comments that were made.
And the one that struck me the most was
was made by my fellow Police Academy
grad
who said that rhetoric
and the misidentification of the men and
women that wear the badge is dangerous
because they become targets.
And I guess a recent example would be
9:30 this morning when a Warner Robbins
police officer responded to a 911 call
of domestic violence.
And as he was exiting his vehicle, he
was shot five times.
Other officers responded.
The bleeding was stopped. Some of the
rounds went under his vest, nicked some
vital organs,
got him stabilized. He's been
transferred to Mon
for for greater attention and care.
The suspect
barricaded himself in his house.
Once other law enforcement resources
were brought to bear, he surrendered.
He'll be taken to the Warren Robbins
Police Department.
He will be mirandized.
And if you don't know what that means,
he'll be read his rights under the
Miranda decision to make sure he doesn't
incriminate himself. He'll be made aware
of all of his constitutional rights. If
he's hungry, he'll be fed. If he's
thirsty, he'll be given something to
drink. He'll be provided with legal
counsel, and the wills of due process
will start.
Now, that officer had no due process
this morning.
He responded to help somebody
and somebody saw him as a threat,
as a threat to what they wanted to do.
And this is why the words we speak in
this chamber are important.
And this is why
the late great comedian George Carlin
said, "When your ideology becomes your
identity,
then you no longer matter.
This officer mattered. What we say in
this chamber matters. And Mr. President,
I would ask for a moment of silent
silence as we think about this officer,
his family, his loved ones, and his
fellow officers
as he's as he fights for his life.
>> The senator has requested a moment of
silence. Let's please stand and give him
that moment. And all our prayers go out
to that family there in Hson County.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
well. Thank you, Senator. Bringing on a
senator from the 44th for a point of
personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. Today,
Georgians woke up to a stunning and
disturbing headline. The FBI rating of
Fulton County Elections Facility seeking
ballots from the 2020 election. An
election that was decided, audited,
recounted, litigated, and certified more
than five years ago.
This is not normal.
This is a man and a political party
trapped in a fever dream.
This is a political party terrified of
telling one man the truth. I really
should not have to repeat this truth,
but for the sake of history,
Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Donald
Trump lost. Here in Georgia, we counted
the ballots three times. We conducted a
full hand recount. Courts at every level
here and around the country rejected
claims of fraud. Republican- elected
officials, including our Governor Kemp
and Secretary Raffensburgger, certified
the results, and that should have been
the end of it. But here we are again
with new chapters to this tired, old,
desperate story.
It disturbed me that
Republicans in this chamber could not
summon the courage to stand up to Donald
Trump after the murder of Alex Prey.
But now,
can we not bring ourselves to say aloud
what every American already knows? That
Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.
But of course, it's more than that. He
may have lost his mind.
This endless indulgence of Trump's
fantasy is tearing our country apart and
our democracy apart.
It fments violence against election
workers and politicians with all too
real consequences. I know I was not the
only elected official in Georgia who had
to have security after Rudy Giuliani's
traveling circus was given a hearing by
this body.
As Donald Trump tried to overturn the
2020 election, Ruby Freeman, Sheay Moss,
Governor Kemp, Secretary Raffensburgger,
former Lieutenant Governor Duncan, they
all had it far worse.
And I am astonished
that we are reliving that sorry episode,
that stain on this body, on this state
senate, that that was permitted here in
this capital.
The message that we're sending voters
is that truth is optional, facts are
partisan, and elections are only
legitimate when Republicans win.
The people of Georgia were ready to move
on from 2020 in January of 2021. They
want better schools, affordable health
care and housing, safe communities, and
economic opportunity.
Instead, they're watching as their state
government is dragged backwards into
conspiracy theories and grievance
politics.
The number of swing voters in Georgia
that care about Fulton County ballots
from 2020 is zero.
What they care about is whether their
leaders can govern responsibly in 2026
and 2027.
And I'm sorry to repeat what many people
are thinking, but the answer from
today's Republican party to that
question increasingly appears to be no.
Because a party that cannot front
reality cannot govern.
Republicans should really be ashamed
that Georgia has become ground zero for
this national spectacle of denial.
Once upon a time, not so long ago, in
fact, when I was first elected in 2010,
the parties differed over taxes,
the and the size and scope of
government,
abortion maybe, and those were serious
consequential debates among people who
loved their country.
But what we're witnessing right now,
this is not the country or the
government that I grew up with.
Today, federal law enforcement resources
are being consumed to chase down
conspiracies that were debunked years
ago. The Secretary of State is being
pressured to violate the law.
Republicans should be ashamed, and I am
sure that many are, that our democracy
is being treated like a toy to soothe
one man's wounded pride.
Colleagues, we make progress for
Georgians
and this great state when we work
together on things that actually affect
their lives. Let's quit the repetitive
nonsense on 2020 and get to work.
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
well.
We're going to have a senator from the
ninth.
>> Okay. First, uh, thank you, Mr.
President. First, I want to recognize
before I get off on another topic, uh,
they were just in the chamber. It was
Building Babies Gwynette. They are here
to visit us today. And Gwynette Building
Babies is a community that collaborates
to focus on ensuring that our children
enter kindergarten ready to learn and
thrive. They're a group of businesses,
volunteers, and community nonprofits.
Um, and they are asking for our support
and asking for our support in the
legislature so they can continue their
program. So, I'm going to pivot from
there um because I did want to recognize
them because they were guests here. And
first of all, I want to say that I am
truly sorry, Senator from the 29th,
about the officer that lost his life. I
mourn the death of any of our highly
trained local law enforcement.
And I want you all to know that
Democrats stand behind our highly
trained, highly vetted local law
enforcement not wearing masks. And
that's who we're talking about.
So I I came up here so we can make that
distinction
because I'm unhappy with that narrative.
And we've been very clear about who
we're talking about.
We're talking about
mass
poorly trained because they were trained
to cut corners so they could get through
the process and get a get a badge to be
ICE.
They're the ones terrorizing our
communities. That's what we're talking
about. Our local law enforcement and
they are servants and we understand
fully that they are working to protect
us and make our communities feel safe.
ICE is not making our communities feel
safe. So please, if you're going to
quote us, I'm making sure today on the
record you quote us properly. We're
talking about Trump administration,
ICE
running around with badges and names and
masks and we don't even know who they
are and they're not being held
accountable for murder.
That is not what our local law
enforcement does.
I know personally our Gwynette County
police go through rigorous months of
training about how to dis deescalate
situations.
Situations that if they have to be in
front of a car,
how to deescalate that.
None of you have made the distinction
that maybe we've cut corners on how ICE
is being trained and maybe some proper
procedures have not been fulfilled.
So, I'm going to say it again. I and my
party, I fully respect
and thank
our trained law enforcement
that give their lives every day to
protect our community. And with that,
Mr. President, I yield. Well,
>> senators yielded. Recognize a senator
from the 27th.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
I want to remind everyone what happened
yesterday as it relates to the actual
fact pattern of law.
And a warrant was issued
by a magistrate judge
based on probable cause after evidence
was submitted.
Not a Trump appointed judge, a
magistrate judge. That is the way that
the law enforcement process works in
America. But we have heard repeatedly
that everything was perfect with 2020.
In fact, I think we probably at this
point could trademark the most secure
election in American history. What
qualifications we use to measure that, I
have no idea. But let's go back to what
actually happened in 2020 if we're going
to have the conversation. Dropboxes
invented out of thin air, nowhere in
Georgia law. Mobile voting units moving
through Fulton County to 80% Democrat
precincts. 81% Democrat precincts to be
precise. Nowhere envisioned in Georgia
law.
6.8 million absentee ballot request
forms with a first class stamp sent to
every registered voter in the state of
Georgia. Nowhere envisioned in Georgia
law.
If you count the same ballots three
times, in theory you should get numbers
that match. But that didn't happen
either. Let's talk about the recount
that happened.
3,930
double scan ballots in Fulton County
alone.
Thousands of those have been confirmed
by the state election board. Governor
Kemp actually raised the concerns of the
Mona Mona report and we now know that
there were double scanned ballots. But
even after the ballots were double
scanned at Fulton County, did the
numbers match on the second recount?
Nope. They were still off by 850
ballots,
not one person here can answer the
question of how that happened. And that
is a legitimate question. We know that
ballot images were deleted. We know that
test ballots were included in the
recount process and we have that
confirmed. But I want to take just a
minute and talk about what the Democrats
did in response to legitimate questions
over the 2020 election. A former
constituent of mine, Derek Somerville,
former FBI agent, ran data analysis
along with another gentleman named Mark
Davis. And remember the 6.8 million
absentee ballot request forms that were
sent out? They had a first class stamp.
So that means if you filed the national
change of address form, that was
automatically forwarded to your new
address. And they identified reasonable
cause to question the validity of 39,141
of those ballots that were cast.
They knew that 160 people had been
registered to vote from a single UPS
store. 2,138
people had been registered to vote from
one church in Fulton County. 1,391
had been registered to vote from a
shuttered 1,000qt building in Fulton
County. Unless you lest you think Fulton
County has cleaned up their voter roles,
today thousands of people are registered
to vote in Fulton County at UPS stores,
storage units, pack mails, homeless
shelters that haven't been open for over
5 years. The Fulton County voter roles
have been and continue to be a mess. But
when Derek Somerville and Mark Davis
followed the law and filed objections to
those voters, what did the Democrats do?
Well, Stacy Abrams sued him in federal
court
and they won. Not Stacy Abrams, but
Somerville and Davis won. Judge Jones,
not a Republican judge, ruled in their
favor. What have we learned since then
about those 39,000 voters? 12,000 of
them have been removed from the voter
roles because Somerville and Davis were
correct that they no were no longer
eligible to vote. 9,500
have updated their address to a new
address outside of Fulton County,
proving once again that Somerville and
Davis were correct and those people were
ineligible to vote. Ultimately, 84%
of the votes that of the eligibility
that Somerville and Davis challenged
were proven to have been invalid voters
in the 2020 election. So, let's stop
this charade of the most perfect, most
secure election in history. But more
importantly, and I would agree with my
colleagues on this, let's look forward
to the future elections, and it's darn
near past time for Fulton County to
clean up their voter roles.
Senator's yielded recognized Senator
from the 35th. You wish to speak at the
well.
>> Yes.
>> Got to go around. Senator,
>> I would pick at you, but you got a
serious look on your face. So, you might
be you might have a serious conversation
right now.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Trust in our government is at an
all-time low.
Trust in our institutions at an all-time
low.
The cost of everything is all all-time
high.
King Jesus is still on the throne.
release the Epstein files. I yield the
well.
Recognize Senator from the 37th
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the
Senate, I rise today in a spirit of
somber
hopefulness.
I'm somber today for a different topic
than has been talked about, but one that
has been plaguing us for decades and
ones that we can no longer ignore.
The epidemic I'm talking about is the
epidemic of fatherlessness in our
culture. The condition in which either
fathers or in many cases mothers are not
in the lives of their kids because our
current laws in Georgia give no
direction to the judiciary
for shared parenting.
I bring this before you today,
colleagues, because Senate Bill 404,
which is not before you today as a
proposition, but it will be before the
Senate uh shortly, raises this question
of the powerful data we've seen from
other states, we've seen from other
nations of the power of shared
parenting.
There's a recognition that in Georgia
last year, 46%
of all children born across all
socioeconomic categories, 46%
were born out of wedlock.
And with a divorce rate that approaches
50%.
I suggest to you friends,
the most important decision in the lives
of many of our Georgia's children is the
decision of
who gets custody and how much custody
does mom have and dad have. How much
time is mom and dad going to spend in
the lives of their children?
I say this because the stakes are high.
On your desk, senators, is a is a chart
that I brought for you today that shows
the amount of time that children spend
with their non-custodial parent.
In fact, Georgia as a state among our 50
states is in the bottom five of the
amount of time children spend with their
non-custodial parents. The bottom five.
This affects moms as non-custodial
parents and dads as non-custodial
parents. But when you look at the
statistics here, you see states that
have gotten this right, that share as
the default condition 50/50 between mom
and dad include Florida,
Kentucky,
Massachusetts,
Mouri,
Arkansas, and others. In fact, what
we've seen in those states is is in
passing shared parenting where the
default condition in our courts is that
there's a 50/50 sharing between mom and
dad in a custody hearing. And if judges
in the best interest of the child decide
by simple proponents of the evidence
that it ought to be something other than
that, they can certainly order that and
they will. This is not going to create a
circumstance where a bad parent is going
to have an undue influence in a child's
life. But what shared parenting, Senate
Bill 404 does is it says for good
parents, the default will be a 50/50
share.
The data is clear, friends. You look at
the research on this, 30% involvement in
a child's life for a non-custodial
father is defined as fatherlessness.
If so, that means if 30% of the time a
kid spends with a parent is with dad, if
if it's 30% or less, that's considered a
fatherless child for academic research.
We recognize when that's the case, the
the the circumstances of crime and and
all kinds of problems spike in the lives
of kids.
Our prison system is filled
with fatherless men and women, people
who weren't raised with dad in their
home. And again, equal parenting that
supports non-custodial moms and dads. We
recognize the impact of this. And I will
tell you we are the bottom five states
amongst the bottom five states in the
nation in terms of the times
non-custodial parents have with their
kids and that is contributing to our
epidemic. Friends, Senate Bill 404 uh
which will be before this body shortly
is supported by data. We saw the divorce
rate in Kentucky decrease by 18% in the
years after passing their bill. We've
seen domestic violence go down by 20%
across the states. In fact, even in
Spain that they some of the provinces in
Spain implemented this. Those that
implemented shared parenting, they saw
domestic violence go down 20% compared
to those that did not. It's true in Ohio
versus Kentucky. It's true across our
states. And friends, I would propose to
you today that if we care about our kids
and we're trying to solve systemic
problems that have been plaguing our
culture for decades,
shared parenting is a critical part of
that solution. And that's why I raise to
you today these somber statistics,
but I raise them with hope that we, the
general assembly, can do something about
this and do something about this. We
shall. With that, Mr. President, I yield
the well.
>> Senator's yielded. Recognize the senator
from the 34th for appointed personal
privilege.
>> Of course not.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
Yesterday's raid on Fortune County's
elections headquarters
was not an isolated incident.
It was the latest conspiracy
theory surrounding the 2020 elections.
It was a theory continued to roll the
foundation of our democracy.
Every time we indulge of the fantasy
that the elections were stolen,
every time we repeat this excuse, we
chip away at the very system of
generations of Americans that defend our
very lives.
I've served this country until
retirement.
I wore the uniform.
I stood watch.
I defended the principle of government
for the people,
by the people, for the people.
I did not defend a king.
I did not swear to an oath of a strong
man who treated the law enforcement like
a personal play thing.
sent chasing conspiracies better than
suit the oppressive state than the free
society.
Democracy is not a suitable for loyalty
to one man.
It is suitable by truth,
resistance, and the respect of the rule
law.
We could do better.
We must do better. I yield the well.
>> All right. Senators yielded.
Uh I'd also like to
There was a uh someone senator asked
that uh unanimous consent be given to
Senator from the 55th to be excused. And
without objection, Senator from the 55th
be excused.
>> Oh, he's back. All right.
Well, it's wonderful to have you,
Senator. I don't know how I missed your
65 self walking in here. So,
>> you have before you a consent calendar,
a privilege resolution. Does any senator
wish to remove a resolution from the
consent calendar? Is there objection to
the adoption resolution on the consent
calendar? Chair hears none. And the
resolution on the consent calendars are
adopted.
Secretary, read the resolutions.
Senate resolution number 645 by Senators
Walker
Walker the third of the 20th and others.
A resolution calling a joint session of
the House of Representatives and the
Senate for the purpose of hearing a

other purposes.
Mr. President,

Secretary of the Senate. Mr. President
that completes the order.
>> Recognize the prom speaks of the
resolution.
>> Thank you, M. Thank you, Mr. President.
Uh, Senate resolution 645 is a just a
traditional thing we do every year about
the joint session. There was a scribers
era saying the clerk of the house on
line 15 and it needs to say secretary of
the senate. So I would ask for unanimous
consent on the adopting the amendment so
we can correct the scrier's error. Thank
you.
>> Senator yielded.
>> Is there objection to the adoption of
the resolution?
The question on the adoption of
amendment one by the senator from the
20th. Is there objection to adoption of
the of that amendment? Hearing none,
amendment one is adopted.

Without objection, the resolution is
amended and the resolution is adopted.
