Bearing the bell. May 35th, which day is it? Day 37, we're getting close. Good morning, all members, please come to the floor and take your seats. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? We're in here. We're going to need them in a big few ways. All members vote it in. All members. The doorkeepers, will you please close the doors? I think all members have voted now, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Again, doorkeepers, will you close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 111th House District, representative Rae Martinez. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm here to introduce to you Pastor Jonas J. Chambliss Senior from Living Word Baptist Church here in Loganville. He is married to Victoria Vett, Chambliss, and they have four daughters, Evett, Shardee Ariel, Janay, and son, Jonas Jamar Chambliss. In the presence also, he's got his sister, Tais. Mr. Pastor Jonas grew up in New Orleans, and in 2005, because of Hurricane Katrina, he moved to Gwyneth County. At the age of 10, he accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior, and was baptized in July 31st of 1991. In 2007, God revealed to him the calling into ministry to preach and to teach the gospel. In 2007, Pastor Jonas was ordained as a minister for over 13 years. Pastor Jonas has served with this heart of God in our community and the Loganville community. God continues to bless Living Word Baptist Church as he shares the role of pastoring with Pastor Jeffrey Thread. He also serves in many roles in Loganville, with Loganville United, NG3, and many other ministries in the community. Colleagues, a nine-chord issue, Pastor Jonas Chambliss Jr. Thank you. Thank you again for the opportunity. Thank you for all who are here on today. Thank you for my family. God is so good. I thank him for this opportunity to minister here. I stand before you representing the Living Word Baptist Church. First and foremost, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and thank God for this opportunity to lift him up, give him the praise, the honor, and the glory. Will you all please stand? Before we pray, I just want to briefly share with you, John 1232. It says, and if I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all men unto me. The Lord Jesus Christ, He represents liberty, He represents justice, He represents us making the call to stand for what is right. And there are people who serve here today. You have been called to stand for what is right. God has appointed you and anointed you with such a time as this to make decisions that not only affect today, but tomorrow. So let me pray with you every head bow. Every eye closed. Lord, we love you. We say thank you for your many blessings. Thank you for this opportunity. Thank you for your time. Lord, to lift your name up, Lord. We thank you for Jesus Christ. Our Lord and Savior, the one who died for us. We thank you for this opportunity. Lord, to again bless your holy name for there is none like you. You are the creator of all the heavens and the earth. Again, we say thank you for those who serve here. Lord, thank you for speaking, John, Lord, and all who are here serving Lord. Today may our military remove us for you spirits and continue by. And always guide us on the hymn of our Lord has the trophy of all those who've given us rights. For you, Pete, Psalm 60, Within you. And you will be prided to appear in our sanctuary. you heal their bodies. Lord, bless our brother Terry Lord. In the name of Jesus, Lord, we just pray for him that you heal his body. Thank you for allowing him to be here on yesterday. Lord, again, be with all who are serving and representing every county, every town, Lord, every person, Lord. Again, that we give you all the praise, honor and the glory. We love you, Lord. And we say thank you. This is the day you've made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. And everybody who loved the Lord, shout it, Amen. And Amen. If you love the Lord, clap your hands. Bless his name. Now, would you follow me as I do my best to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Our Pledge of Allegiance is flagged in the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice. Thank you.

But I'll let somebody else tell that whole story but I want to say now thank you council general for that support.

Speaker today on behalf of representative Cox in the Georgia Israel caucus we gather with hearts both hopeful and selfishly heavy. And not your journey among us has been more than a chapter in our community story. It's been a beacon of light illuminating our shared traditions values and connections. From the moment you arrived you brought us not just your leadership but your entire self. You've been a bridge between our local community and the broader Jewish world particularly our beloved Israel. Your unwavering dedication to strengthening communal bonds have left an indelible mark on all of us. As you prepare to return to Israel know that you carry with you not just memories but the deep respect and love of the Jewish community and the non Jewish community. While geographical distance may separate us the bonds of Mishpah family transcend any miles between us. Let me draw out Hava Rasha Lano until we made again my friend our friend may your path be blessed may our new chapter be filled with joy and may you continue to be a source of inspiration wherever you go from strength to strength Shalom and safe travels. Thank you. Speaker Burns members of the Georgia House of Representatives Shalom and good morning. It is an incredible honor to stand before you today in this chamber a place where Israel, the Jewish people and I personally have been blessed with so many friends. Six years ago when I received my appointment to this role I learned that Georgia is known as the Peach State. An interesting fact but not what first comes to mind when I think of Georgia today. Having lived here over these years I've learned that Georgia is in so many ways America at its best. The growing number of people who choose to make Georgia their home have apparently come to the same conclusion. And as for being in Israel in Georgia I cannot count the number of times when I've been asked where I'm from and upon saying Israel I've been met with a huge smile and a warm embrace. That warm welcome that I received in Georgia is true for this house as well. Thank you, John Burns. Thank you. Thank you for your leadership, for your friendship and for your support. And I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the late speaker David Relston of Blessed Memory, a true friend of Israel who support and friendship will not be forgotten. Representatives Esther Panich and Brent Cox, my dear friends and co-chairs of the Georgia Israel Legislative Caucus. Thank you for your friendship, for your commitment and dedication to ensuring that the bond between Georgia and Israel remains strong, vibrant and bipartisan. The bilateral relations between Georgia and Israel span across many areas, trade, academia, technology, and innovation, culture, and more. These ties continue to strengthen and grow because they are built on a partnership that benefits both our peoples, grounded in our shared values of democracy, freedom, and humanity. Over the years this house has passed numerous resolutions in support of Israel and our bilateral relations, as well as bills aimed at addressing and combating anti-Semitism and discrimination against Israel. Through all the sponsors and supporters of these measures, especially those passed in the wake of October 7th, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude. These expressions of solidarity and moral clarity have been a source of strength and a reminder that we are not alone. This chamber has also extended its southern hospitality to many Israeli guests and speakers, including hosting hostage family members and survivors of October 7th, as was just done yesterday. Thank you for opening your hearts and minds to their accounts. There are still 59 hostages languishing in Gaza and we cannot rest until every single hostage is home and reunited with our loved ones. Thank you. Thank you. Alongside the hardship, there is also room for hope, for better days ahead, for Israel, and for all of us, because we share not only pain and concern, we also share a spirit of resilience and a commitment not just to hope for better days, but to work together to make them a reality. As I prepare to conclude my tenure in this role, I do so with immense pride in all that we have accomplished together and with deep appreciation for the friendships that I will carry with me always. To the many friends that I will leave here in Georgia, I look forward to seeing you in Israel. Thank you for the honor of working with you. May God bless you. May God bless the great state of Georgia. May God bless the state of Israel. Thank you. Thank you. You will be missed. Thank you. Thank you members. General, you have enriched our lives and our relationship in the union that exists between the United States of America, the state of Georgia, and Israel, most important to the people. Therefore, we respect you. We will miss you. You become a part of our family. Thanks to the members of this body for supporting you and supporting Israel. Does it go in notice? It's not about the three of us that are part of this body here, but it's about all of these members, it's about you, the values you bring, and your unrelenting support for Georgia and the values you stand for, what Israel stands for, and what we stand for as Georgia's. Thank you. Safe travels to you. May God continue to bless you, and we just want to welcome you back to Georgia anytime, so we're going to miss you. Thank you for your service. Thank you. The Council General will be with us for a few more moments. She's joined to be in the south any room if you would like to join her for a conversation in the photo. That would be the proper place and the proper time. So thank you, Council General. Thanks for the resolution, members, and thank you, members, for your attention. We have some morning orders now, members. We have about a third of what we had yesterday. We only have 50 or 60. We don't have 201, so it's not quite that many. We have some great folks that are here with us that we need to recognize in the gallery. We're going to get started with that. I'm going to ask you to probably take a minute to two minutes maximum, if you will, members to share your thoughts and encouragement with us here with us. They will begin with Representative David Huddleston and some friends who are going to be here to recognize some folks from West Georgia. If you're a fan of the West Georgia cheer team, I would hope you would join Representative David Huddleston. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, thank you all for allowing us to be here today. Today, we want to congratulate and recognize the University of West Georgia cheerleading program for its continued reputation and of excellence and global recognition as a dynasty with 35 total national championships for all girl and co-ed squads from 2001 to 2025.

Mr. Speaker, I move to agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 428. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 428? House Bill 428, folks. And Franklin in the 160th to be titled back to men chapter 1, a title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia and untated relating the general business regarding health. So it's the codify the right to in vitro fertilization for individuals. Representative Franklin is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I think fundamentally there's been very minor changes to this bill, but I want to go over it to you with you. There's been two slight changes and basically it's just to change the words or legally is on it. The first one is moving from embryos to embryo to embryos, which I'm told legally doesn't have any effect, but that it does just clear up some of the language there. The next is on line 26 where they've taken out the right to and instead replaced it to not to prohibit or prevent an individual from obtaining vitro fertilization. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'll take your questions and need it. Jim, will you or for question, Representative Park, cannon to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker, do you yield? I do. Can you explain why we have to keep writing the word female in this bill when we're discussing genitalia? I don't know if I can explain that or not. I just asked the way it was written, but you know there's a male and a female and a female has the ovaries, so I guess that's why I just put that in there. And further inquiry. Do you need to stand for a question? Must I? Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. So would you agree that it's redundant? I don't think it's redundant. I think it needs to be put in there. It's my bill. I put it in there. Gentlemen ask no further questions. Okay, with that Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 428, 428, all those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? Yes, sir. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 160, the nays are zero. This House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 428. Congratulations to the Franklin's and to this House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 180, 180? Senate Bill 180 by Senator Dixon, the 45th and others to be entitled to amend Article 7 of Chapter 4 titled 20, the official go to Georgia and it's said to relate in high demand apprenticeship program, since there are five opportunities for apprenticeship sponsors to enter into a apprenticeship program contracts with a state board of the Technical College System of Georgia. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Higher Education, that Committee recommends the disbill due pass. Representative Mad Dubnick is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Dubnick. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the High Demand Apprenticeship program was initially created by Senate Bill 379 three years ago and the purpose was to incentivize apprenticeship sponsors to establish new or grow existing apprenticeship programs in Georgia. Last year under Chairman Hickman's leadership, the program was amended to make some improvements. Currently, only businesses are allowed to apply for this. We're simply adding apprenticeship sponsors to this because given the demand, like many of our industries, including construction have seen in their growth around the state, we just want to support more apprenticeship spots. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. Gentlemen, has a question, you yield for a question? Yes, sir. Minority Leader Hewglie, I recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman heal? Yes, ma'am, for sure. Does this allow for unions to take on these apprenticeship programs? Is that something that we've been asked about in the past? Will this do that? So we're looking for trade associations and things of that, excuse me, and organizations of that nature, when you start to think about some of the contracting associations that are out there, yes, we absolutely want to include them and empower them with the ability to foster apprentices. Gentlemen, you yield for another question? Yes, sir, one more. Representative Gullet, Councillor Sunderhal, does recognize for a question? Is Jim Maniel? Yes. In the truth of this, we'll enhance the effectiveness and responsiveness of the apprenticeship program, and meet the evolving needs of Georgia citizens. Absolutely. Couldn't have said it better myself. Mr. Speaker with that, I'll ask for this body's favourable consideration. I'll yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The gentleman's yielded the well. Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of passage to the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate bill 180, the yeas are 158, the nays are zero. This bill, Henry C. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 245? Senate bill 245 by Senator Hodges of the third and others to be entitled. Not to amend code section 19-7-3. The fiscal to Georgia and Attetta relating to actions by grandparents or other family members for visitation rights or intervention. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Clerk, for representing Townsend. He has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the Grandparents Bill. I appreciate it, it's your work and heart on this. It is a substitute to the original bill. This basically will allow grandparents who already have visitation rights for the grandchildren to ask for revision at the maximum of once every two years. This is based on whether there was incarceration, a death of one of the parents or disability, basically in compensation. So that's the gist of the bill. It was revised. I appreciate the hard work judiciary looking into this. And this is basically the bill. And I will yield any questions, Mr. Speaker. Representative Jones to your left. Representative Jones has a question. Ladies, Dr. O'Connor. Okay. Thank you, thank you, Speaker. That's a gentleman yield. Yes. Is it not true that this bill provides grandparents with illegal avenue to seek visitation or modify existing visitation orders, especially under challenging family circumstances, like death in capacity or in incarcerated parent, and that it further clears and it, excuse me, and it further requires grandparents to present clearing, convincing evidence that visitation is in the child's best interest. Yes. From what I can tell, yes, that's actually true. Yes, to your left, I'm sorry, a little bit to the back. I'm right here. Thank you, I'm sorry. There you are. I want to thank you for this.

needed bill because it will immediately impact a situation that my mother is having right now with seeing the children of my late sister who now resides with their father's mother. Thank you. I appreciate you supporting, appreciate that inside as well. Representative Glaes is recognized for a question. Representative Glaes pardon me, to increase. There would be a question to your left. Is it not true that I lost my son five years ago at 41 and he left a daughter at 12 years old. And this bill will continue to help us as her grandparents to continue to support her as she continues to grow. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. Thank you, Representative.

Have all members voted? All members voted. So Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 245 the yeas are 160 the nays one this bill Henry C the requisite cost of constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 4444 Senate bill 44 by Senator Watson the 11th and others being titled an act to men code section 22 165 the fiscal to George annotated relating the equalization grants annual calculations and allocation this bill have referred to the committee on education that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Chaz Cannon is recognized to present the bill representative cannon. I think it is your speaker House or Senate bill 44 my apologies we put a lot of work in this bill over the last two years it passed this house near unanimously last year got through committee this year unanimously passed the city unanimously as a quick refresher what the bill does is simply lower the threshold for equalization eligibility from 14 down to 10 mills it doesn't change the form of equalization it doesn't change the form of a QBE it doesn't change the local five mill share it would allow but not require very permissive it would allow not require a local system that receives equalization to roll back their milled rate over time to a new minimum threshold of 10 if they so choose to do so but this is also a new provision we added in this year after working with the pro-tum the bill includes a penalty for those school systems who sometime in the future might roll back their millage under the new proposed threshold of 10 so there is no penalty in the code today so if the school system goes below 10 they get a 25 percent penalty on their equalization that's a pretty big stick so that's basically the bill appreciate the help of the education chairman pro-tum and I'll take any questions Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen has a couple of questions Chairman Corbett to your right is recognize for a question thank you Mr. Bigger is gentleman you are you with my friend you mentioned we passed this bill last year in this house is that correct that's correct man gentleman knows what he speaks it's great great bill is not further proof that the Senate has trouble coming up with individual ideals on their own that is correct thank you thank you easy on the Senate we got a couple bills over there we need passing right now we'll talk about them in private just saying everything Irwin is recognized for a bill to you excuse me for a question to your right thank you Mr. Speaker and does the gentleman yield I yield my seatmate does this bill continue to set allow Board of Education's to continue to set appropriate rates in a time when our taxes property taxes are increasing it does thank you for this bill gentleman has no further questions you speak out you'll the will gentlemen you're the well representative Martin would like to let us know about his opposition to the bill chairman Martin gentlemen is recognized thank you Mr. Speaker members no one ever opposes the opportunity for people to play pay less for the on their tax bill I stand here today each and every one of us represent our own area and our own constituency 180 counties over 400 cities and I respect the representative for his opinion and I'll respect everybody but it's for this bill I want to tell you why I have paws with the bill the QBE formula even for somebody that did math pretty well in high school it is a far pal it's very complicated and it stands on many pillars for its calculation and what I stand before you today and and what all for is this is one of the pillars on which it stands I stand today and tell you that I think we need to look at the QBE formula in total in overall and I fear that if we allow some counties to go for their maintenance of effort from 14 down to 10 mills when we start having that discussion about QBE counties with larger populations such as my county that has a 17 over 17 no rate and contributes to the QBE formula may be in a position that they would have to contribute more so I want us to work together as a state I'm fortunate enough to serve at the speakers pleasure and with my members in this body and post-secondary education to work with TCSG in the university system and we work hand in glove with our K-12 system so it's not in opposition to people like paying lower taxes that I stand today but instead to work us toward a review and a reworking of a very complicated QBE formula that stands on multiple pillars rather than to just adjust one which when that time comes to adjust that in the future may cause a bit of inequity relative to the tax base and the tax contributions of all of our Georgia so with that I just want to explain my polls with the bill and and again I'll respect each and every member of this body as I always have for voting your conscious in your district with that Mr. Speaker I yield the well thank you Mr. Chairman he's yielded the well you have an important question I said if I get him back General's yielded the well always respect your insight and opinion Mr. Chairman that concludes our comments on SB 44 is any objection to the previous question being ordered hearing none the previous questions ordered is

departments department of community health department of behavioral health and developmental disabilities we're moving some regulated facilities that are routinely under dbh dd from regulation by dch over to dbh dd that would include facilities like community living arrangements for individuals with intellectual disabilities and as you'll see in the bill kind of itemized also facilities that deal with substance abuse and so forth the changes that were made in the in the senate are very simple they are all in section three we caught this after it left the house the departments realized that we had not moved some mandatory reporting provisions from dch to dbh dd as well that's very simply what this does it ensures that abuse exploitation and neglect are moved and those reporting requirements which are mandatory are moved from dch to dbh dd since they will be dealing with these facilities mr. speaker those are all the meaningful changes glad to answer any questions gentlemen has no

manufacturing this bill ember for the committee on judo sharing non-similar committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute representative james burchette is recognized to present senate bill 79 representative burchette thank you mr. speaker and colleagues I rise today to give you my full support and ask for your full support of senate bill 79 if you recall this body last session passed unanimously senate bill 465 which is austin's law and if you recall the story about austin austin was a yet another victim that fell to this deadly drug of fentanyl today we have with us in the chamber austin's parents who have become zealous advocates on behalf of the life of austin so that none of our kids are our grand kids or any of us in here can fall victim to this very terrible and deadly drug and fentanyl and so thank you for being here again the Walters I very much appreciate both I can't tell you how much I feel for you and you guys just advocating on behalf of your son that's what many of us in this chamber would do if we were in the same position so thank you very much for your advocacy what senate bill 79 does is it strengthens the trafficking penalties for fentanyl currently you're going to need to get it to get a trafficking charge you're going to need to have four grams of fentanyl and I've got four you here an approved prop by the speaker four grams just to show you how much four grams is and if this was fentanyl folks this is not fentanyl by the way I put it on the leader madam leaders desk she said oh I don't know anything this is not fentanyl but this amount this amount right here would kill everybody in this chamber and in that chamber everybody in the hall about 2000 Georgians could die with this amount of fentanyl right here just that that tells you how strong this drug is this drug you know has medicinal value but the problem is that it is being illegally imported and it is being utilized by our youth and by people all over the state of Jordan all of the country and we have a silent epidemic here and what we're trying to do is persuade folks not to traffic in this deadly drug earlier this week in sandy springs there was the the largest bus or one a very large bus in our state's history I think it was 21 grams is what they found and that's enough to kill out of our districts which we represent roughly 60,000 folks it would kill 40 whole districts in this chamber all the people in the district and so that is a testament to how big the problem we have right here in sandy springs you have such a large bus we know that is coming in folks and to the specifics of the bill currently it is crime already to have to traffic in four grams or more what we have done is increase the penalty as the weight is increased so the the more weight you have the penalty is much more increased 10 years 15 years 25 years and there are mandatory minimums and I know that my colleagues share concern with mandatory minimums that I have but this is this is aimed at trying to curb or curtail a very serious problem in our state there is a provision within this bill that allows for a departure from the mandatory minimums there are some elements that need to be met spoke with one of my colleagues about those elements and they can depart from those mandatory minimums but I ask you and and I'm pleased with you please please please continue to stand together on this issue I think this is a not a it's not a partisan issue I think this is just a problem that you me for our kids and our grandkids are we need to we need to take a a strong stand against this deadly drug and mr. Speaker with that I will yield for questions gentlemen has a couple of questions feel you yield I do representative panich is recognize to your left in the back does the gentleman yield to my friend I do thank you is it not true that after amendments and deliberate deliberation that addicts will not be facing increased sentences for mere possession of a drug that they likely don't know contains fentanyl very very good point yes ma'am the lady knows of what she speaks and we've been trying even in Austin's law to assure that someone that is so an innocent I wouldn't I don't want to say innocent user but someone that doesn't know that it is is in the drug does not face these type of enhanced penalties thank you for the question thank you representative gamble down the Suner aisle is recognize for a question thank you mr. Speaker there's a gentleman yield to my friend I do isn't it true that senate bill 79 addresses the reality of fentanyl being a scientific altering reality as we address the addition addiction epidemic in our state and this bill strikes bipartisan response that our working group on addiction recovery has been very interested in an active in and the Georgia council on substance abuse the gentleman does what she speaks thank you couple more questions do one more mr. Speaker hour is late representative reeds to your right is recognize for a question thank you speaker burns with the majority well you'll for a question yes i do is it not true that over a quarter of a million americans have died from fentanyl since night it's not 2018 and that that's like five times a number of people who died in the Vietnam war it is thank you for the question mr. Speaker how you'll do well i think we have more speakers on the bill i do not want to hold you up any longer than i need to but this is a very important measure i hope that i can count on your support for this bedroom thank you gentlemen yielded well we have a couple of speakers signed up here's how we're going to handle this we have one to suppose i'm going to give him up to up to ten minutes and i'm going to allow the two that are in favor of five minutes each to speak to the bill representative hokam is recognized to speak to the bill rift n scott hokam thank you mr. Speaker i'll start by saying that i agree with everything that the whip said in terms of the problem fentanyl is a scourge on our country and it is caused heartbreaking loss um it's a countless families and certainly my heart goes out to the family that's here today on this issue but the reason why i posed this bill is because of the mandatory minimums we need to have a paradigm shift in sentencing and we need to move away from mandatory minimums this is not an issue of leniency versus excessive punishment this is an issue of doing what works versus what does not work and mandatory minimums do not work why it's very simple the first time that most criminal defendants learn what the mandatory minimums are are when they're talking to their lawyer after they've been arrested they don't deter the conduct on the front end which is purportedly what we're trying to do and this is not new the first mandatory minimum for drugs in the united states was passed in 1914 by the u.s congress and its purpose was to address at that time opium throughout our history we've had a swinging of the pendulum where we've reduced sentences and then we've gone back to mandatory minimums but we've looked at this over and over and over again and the research is very very clear which is that mandatory minimum sentences do not deter crime what does deter crime is the probability of getting caught so that's where I would prefer that we focus our energy and I would support this bill if we took out the mandatory minimums because certainly I think that traffickers should be penalized should be convicted and should be sent to jail but I disagree with the mandatory minimum portion of it of note with respect to the system our system right now is struggling we have law enforcement agencies that are understaffed underfunded that goes for the law enforcement agencies themselves the prosecutors the judges and our jails and our prisons our prisons we have put in millions of dollars even approaching billions of dollars to try to have enough resources to keep those safe and with mandatory minimums there is no discretion in terms of what can happen of having those sentences be adjusted and one point that I'll note out with respect to it is true that this bill provides some potential reduced sentencing but I would highlight line 70 and 70 and 71 which talks about the criminal conduct did not result in a death or serious bodily injury to a person other than to a person who is a party to the crime if we're dealing with fentanyl we're almost always going to have deaths which means that all of the exceptions that start at 113 practically aren't actually going to happen so you're just looking at locking up people for a very very long time a references made to what we did last year in 2024 and that law is called Austin's Law that crime that we implemented also to address this this scourge is titled the aggravated involuntary manslaughter for fentanyl overdose death that bill does not include mandatory minimums so I would support what we're doing if we move away from having mandatory minimums because they do not work they are poor public policy and we just need to really have this shift away from them and then with that in terms of prevention on July 1st of 2022 the state legalized the ability to test drugs to find out whether or not fentanyl was in there this took effect a couple of years ago and there was a recent study performed by the University of Georgia to discern whether or not our pharmacists were aware that they could sell fentanyl testing strips so people could test and see if the drug existed to prevent accidental overdoses and consumption and they found most pharmacists didn't know about this most pharmacists didn't offer it and

If we're going to really try to work on the system to prevent deaths, there are better ways to do it. So I'll close by saying I agree with you on the objective. I disagree with you on the means and I'm voting against it. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, the chair recognizes representative Tran to speak to the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. esteemed members of this House and my fellow Georgians, I ask that we become united today to take our first step in battling the scourge of Fennel. And we have to understand that Fennel is not just simply a powdery substance brought illegally across our borders from other nations. Fennel is actually a legally prescribed prescription drug here in the US. It's known under many names, Acthique, Dorisic, Sublamines and Phantora. And one of the problems we have is say one of your elders passes away. What happens to all of their prescription? Do the kids get it accidentally or do your own kids because you've broken a leg. You've injured yourself on your dealing with pain. Are your children taking your drugs out of your cabinet to use it for themselves or to sell it? And so we have to recognize what fentanyl is in our community and start taking the steps to battle against it. Here in Georgia, the statistics are chilling. In 2023, Fennel was involved in over a thousand overdoses in our state. A 35 increase from the year before. Among teens, the numbers are even more alarming. Between 2022 and 2023, there was a 40% increase. A fentanyl related deaths among teens for between the ages of 15 and 19. It's not just a national crisis. It's one within our community. I'll talk about my community, the city of Dunwoody. In the last six years, Dunwoody police officers have responded to over 156 overdose incidents. 35 of those resulted in death. The life-saving drug, Narcan, was administered by Dunwoody police over 79 times. And that's Dunwoody. We have rural cities who struggle to keep a constant supply of Narcan. Fennel hit the city of Dunwoody hard about a year ago. We had a death at Dunwoody High School due to an overdose. Mia Diggas, she was 17 and she tragically lost her life to fentanyl overdose due to the pressure of her peers, her friends. And we need to start to address this. And we need to follow the lead of the teenagers and students. And one of the students at Dunwoody High, Madi Cohen, has started to run a program to get Narcan in every classroom. Now we've gone Narcan into every high school, but we still, for the betterment of these children, need to get Narcan into every classroom. For 20% of adults and 20% of teens suffer from mental health challenges, whether it's anxiety or depression. Access is easier. Understand this. It is easier to get a counterfeit bill or a gummy laced with fentanyl than it is to go get mental health services from a professional. This is where we are broken. This should not be easier for students and veterans to turn to criminals for counterfeit drugs that will ultimately kill them. Over 1.2 million Georgians remain uninsured. That's nearly 12% of our population. It is far easier for the most vulnerable in our rural communities to turn to the drug dealers that pass through their city than it is to find healthcare, find a hospital, find mental health services within their communities. This bill is the first step. We have many steps to take to make sure that we defeat this fentanyl crisis. When we take a look at our homeless population, 13% of them are veterans. Only 2.3% have a history with drug and alcohol abuse. We are seeing what is happening at the federal level. Their jobs are being cut. Services at the VA are being cut. This problem for our veterans are going to continue to grow. And so while I am concerned about the mandatory minimums of this bill, we must take this head on because more and more veterans are going to have to turn to counterfeit pills to alleviate the pain that they have from the injuries they took in combat. So I urge you all to vote in favor of this bill and thank you Madam Speaker. I yield the well. General, I yielded the well. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know it's Friday and everybody is wanting to get home. But Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate Bill 79. About 10 years ago, I was working as I yield here in this house. And at the same time, I was fortunate to speak to actually also work during that same semester with the District Attorney's Office of the Talpistage Judicial Circuit. It was case that the then-DA Browning told me to go and look through first down the job and it was related to fentanyl. And the first thing I see when I open up this case file are autopsy photos of what we believe according to my DA who's 88th time I was assigned to was the first fentanyl related death of a child in the whole state of Georgia. All types of photos of that eight-month-year-old baby girl. I have not spoken about that to anyone other than my father who's actually a Bayroot Marine who's seen death firsthand. But I can tell you, those autopsy photos until God either calls me home or I lose my mind down here before He does one will be ever burned in my head. Generally I would agree that men and women for certain crimes might not be the best solution. However with this one. I thought about this in committee the other day. I about that little baby girl. If I could convey to you the evil that was done to that little baby girl, crime, crime, all night with some experience of that myself now. That little baby girl was given a fentanyl sucker so she'd stop crime. She never cried again. This substance has been killing children of all ages, people of all ages. That I'll say in about the graveyard you can go out there and you can find people of all ages. I think this is hopefully a step in the right direction so having for bed those that are the youngest above us will even have to worry about that person. That child has no discernment just being given something by parent. This deranged as it was. I really want to thank the family. I don't want to thank Senator Goodman and Whitford Chet for y'all's hard work on this. I really do believe that with this step in this direction the penalties becoming more severe for trafficking this pure evil poison to our population. Hopefully we can finally get a hold on it. Miss Speaker, it's tough to share those kind of stories but I know some of you may be surprised that me and what I do for a living would be up here supporting it but I am all for public safety. I'm all for not allowing this deadly poison to our citizens in this state or this country. This is a measure that I think on certain days of this session or any session that this house has ever been in. We'll look back on and we can be proud of it. We talk about saving lives and different bills saving lives. You want to put something on the table that saves lives. You want to pass something that saves lives. This bill right here Senate Bill 79 accomplishes that. I believe that in the deepest part of my heart and the deepest part of my mind. With that Mr. Speaker I know I generally leave that to leave discussions to technical matters but I felt like that story for those of you that might be on the fence on this one. I just hope that you'll know where my heart is on this and that it is my sincere belief. Well this coming out of the committee that I believe had accomplished the aims and then tent that it started out with. Well that Mr. Speaker I'll yield well and ask this body's favorite book consideration. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for sharing with us on your heart filled experience and your belief. Majority of lead illustration is recognized as speak to Senate Bill 79 leader of illustration. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Well it's difficult for me to add more than the very heartfelt impressive speeches that we've heard today in favor of SB 79 but I did want to just give a few thoughts particularly with respect to the policy around mandatory minimums. So as we've heard today fentanyl is a unique type of controlled substance that has come on since say my time as an assistant district attorney in 2013 when I left the DA's office I was not familiar with fentanyl I had a prosecuted an offense for that. And then with the statistics we've seen this dangerous poison as has been said killing residents of our communities our neighbors friends family members the importance of taking strong action to address the danger to each of our communities has come into full view. And we've reflected that in action that we've taken here in this general assembly. How trafficking offenses carry mandatory minimum sentences they do we have those in code I've prosecuted those offenses where if you have a certain quantity and for certain substances it's the purity of the substance trafficking is an available offense and the public policy around that I believe is well founded talk about that in a minute but more broadly you know we have mandatory minimum sentencing in all kinds of laws already just take murder just often murder in Georgia carries a mandatory life sentence it does it's in the code there I could go on and on all down the line of different criminal offenses where trial courts have to impose a certain sentence because the general assembly often many years or many decades ago made that policy decision and it seems that only recently there has been and while I have tremendous respect for my colleague who spoke earlier I think that seems that there has been a real king in on this issue at least that I've received recently but that's inconsistent I believe with the history that we have in our state of taking action to deter criminal conduct that's dangerous to Georgians and secondly to put individuals who are hurting or killing citizens of our state in prison whether or not it deters them now let me break each each of those down first of all sentencing as a deterrent I believe that it is I have found as a prosecutor previously that criminal organizations are very smart they often know the sentence ranges that can be imposed by a by a trial court they're strategic and where they operate they're for profit inter criminal interprises and when knowing that deaths result from the sale of your product that's incredibly evil industry to be in but that is the reality of certain criminal organizations cartel organizations organize crime that that is their effort they will know what sentences are available in the respective states and how they contrast with federal law this measure in my view does a tremendous amount to deter fentanyl operations from operating in our state but even if you discount that argument distancing dangerous sales of drugs distancing the sellers or distributors of dangerous drugs in our state from the people of our state by synancing them to the Department of Corrections is a way to protect more Georgians in other words criminals who are operating to pedal this poison putting them in prison for the sentence ranges we're talking about here will protect the people of our state and as we just heard from the from the chairman of the committee some of the youngest Georgians who made no decision whatsoever to be around or exposed I I'm plurio to support senate bill 79 of you that fentanyl being an extraordinarily potent synthetic opioid with potency up to 100 times that of morphine we're talking about a completely different classification level of potency here and the need to pass Senate bill 79 is clear Georgia we can set we can say here today with a strong vote on this Georgia will not tolerate distribution of this dangerous drug and that were committed to providing law enforcement and the judiciary the necessary tools to impose sentences in court see that through now is there the possibility of a situation where a mandatory minimum would not be appropriate well you know Senate bill 79 actually contemplates that in the bill it provides that under certain if certain parameters are met that the trial court would have authorization to not impose to divert from the mandatory minimum so this issue that has been raised even if you hold it as your concern ladies and gentlemen I submit to you that Senate bill 79 is still worthy of your vote because it will allow for those exception situations to be taken into consideration by the prosecutor and the judge and for justice to be done ladies and gentlemen I ask for your favorable consideration and Mr. Speaker I yield the well gentlemen a geol of the well we have no more speakers that want to make their points on SB 79 so we'll put it to a vote is there an objection to the previous question being ordered here in none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute here in none the committee's substitute is adopted is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill here in none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the past to the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine have all members voted for what purpose is representative rice rise parliamentary inquiry state inquiry mr. Speaker is it not true that Senate bill 79 reflects our commitment to combating the opioid crisis by ensuring our legal system can effectively address the unique dangers posed by fentanyl trafficking that's what I've been reading and that's what I've just heard the ladies inquiry is on point for what purpose is representative hegan rise parliamentary inquiry station choir mr. Speaker isn't it true that last year a 25 year old young man in my community was lost his life after being exposed to a deadly amount of fentanyl and as the representative in this room for his family who was left to grieve him I feel very strongly that these mandatory minimums will save lives by keeping the people who have no disregard for other humans lives from practicing their particular form of evil sure the lady knows of the her experience in her community and certainly believes in what she speaks for what purpose is representative millerise parliamentary inquiry station choir mr. Speaker is it not true that decades of research have demonstrated that mandatory minimums and sentencing in particular does not in fact deter crime I'm sure the lady believes in what she speaks further inquiry I'll take one more inquiry would it not be a better exercise of our time here to honor these victims and our communities by doing things that will actually deter crime as opposed to doing symbolic performative gestures that will not stop the deaths that are occurring in our community is that not true mr. Speaker I agree with the lady we can do all we can in our communities to stop these discouraging these days I'll take one more inquiry from the gentleman who was in the bill for what purpose is representative burchett rise parliamentary inquiry statue more is it not true mr. Speaker that we are aiming this legislation at those sophisticated parties and networks that are bringing in large amounts of fintonon not aiming it at those folks that are actually possessing and using those is that not true mr. Speaker I'm sure the gentleman understands every bit of the bill and I appreciate his insight of all members now voted all members voted if so mr. Clerk will you lock the machine on the past just sent bill 79 the yeas are one hundred thirty one the nays are thirty one this bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is there for past for what purpose does whip burchett rise make a motion state your motion make a motion that we immediately transmit this to the senate there's objection to gentleman move uh gentlemen moves all right we'll vote this one right now whether it's immediately transmitted or not all of those in favor of immediate transmittal will vote yes those opposed we'll vote no and mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine you have all members voted all members voted yes so mr.

Ladies and gentlemen, I move that the House disagree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 86. I believe that's the proper, that we disagree to the Senate amendment. House Bill 86, that's thank you. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 86? House Bill 86, by the way, representative Lever to the 123rd, another is being tied up in act to amend code section 4574 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated related annual salaries of certain state officials and cost of living adjustments. Chairman Lever is recognized to explain his disagree. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 86 is part of the judicial pay reform legislation that this House is championed and has, that advanced out of this House sometime ago this session. House Bill 86 is the bill that deals with statewide judicial pay, that is the pay of our statewide judges, Georgia Supreme Court, Georgia Court of Appeals, Statewide Business Court, and the tax court. The bill was amended in the Senate. You may have seen a little something about the amendment in the news over the last 24 hours. And we are asking, or I'm asking, that you disagree to that amendment. I think that is the discussion. We as a body need to have at some point, but we shouldn't have it as an amendment to a bill in the last two or three days of session. I believe it needs to be thought through a little more and it needs a little more study. I would like to pass our bill, my bill, House Bill 86, and let's deal with reforming judicial pay first before we move on to anything else. I just believe that's the good policy and I would ask that you support us in that endeavor. And I'm glad to answer any questions you may have about this motion. General, you owe for a question? Yes, sir. Representative Allen Powell, and you're right in the back. You recognize the question? Well, the gentleman, you owe? You owe, yes, sir. To my good friend, is it not true that sometimes there's always consequences to legislation that we pass whether we accept or dismiss? Yes, that is decidedly true. Further yield? Yeah, yield. Is it maybe not possible by agreeing to the Senate and raising all of these constitutional officers' salary that we might have a positive effect that we can probably clear the Senate out of about 75% of their members have run for higher off? Is that not true? Mr. Chairman, I still have bills over there, so I will not say nothing about that. You have another question, Provost. Representative Billy Mitchell, to your left, has recognized for a question. Mr. Chairman, if we yield, yes, sir. You know, with the Chairman and yield, Mr. Chairman, if I had to understand the original proposal, which would prevail if we disagree. This would lower the legislative salaries to $60,200 annually. That's incorrect. That's existing code that is not changing our salary. The House Bill 86 does not touch any salary except for, well, I would argue it doesn't even touch judicial salaries. It just changes the way they're treated in code from a numeric number to a cap. This will not change legislative pay in any way, shape, or form. As you recall, there was an effort last year to add that to the bill and we rejected that. And I'm not proposing to do that again this year. Mr. Chairman, would you accept the proposal to amend legislative salary to the median individual income in Georgia, which would be $32,000 a year? I would accept that amendment for just me. No, I would decline that amendment. We have not talked about legislative pay in this process. We've not discussed it in a committee on either side that I'm aware of. I do not believe that is, well, I think it's good policy. I do not believe it's a proper time to do that. And what would ask that we not do that with House Bill 86, with all due respect to the gentleman. Yeah. I would just suggest to you, Mr. Chairman, if I may, we're contemplating raising the salaries of every other elected official in the state. What is a more appropriate time? We are not. The Senate contemplated that with this amendment. I see. I believe we in the House are contemplating taking that. I mean, look, I don't believe. The motion is to remove the Senate amendment so that we would only be addressing the issue of judicial pay with House Bill 86. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for the question. Thank you for your explanation. The gentleman yield. How are you, Mr. Chair? Representative Westbrook to your right is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Maniolde. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Chairman. Could you just specifically speak to the pay for superior court judges in Georgia because we've got judges who are watching that as she closely and the Council of Superior Court judges, how this has worked closely on that. So I would appreciate if you just quickly clarify for us how this amendment addresses if it does at all, Superior Court judge pay. My understanding, and thank you for the question. My understanding is the proposed amendment did not touch the issue of Superior Court pay at all. It's simply dealt with pay of a number of state law officials in the executive branch. House Bill 85, which is, I believe, being discussed on the floor of the Senate if not right now.

now at least today it's on their calendar deals with superior court pay and it imposes a consistent set of reforms so that superior court pay has also changed in the code to a cap based on a percentage of US district court pay so that we sort of bring make judicial pay for all state pay judges. These are judges who are state employees sort of harmonized into one uniform system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you so much for the question. I appreciate you. The gentleman here for one more question. I will be glad to. Oh, I'll be glad to. Leader here, Glee is recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman here? Yes, ma'am. Just for clarification purposes, isn't it true that when this House votes yes to disagree, your bill is going to go back to the Senate in the way that we sent it over there? That's precisely right and that is the goal and thank you, dear lady, for summarizing the goal here. The gentleman has no further questions. Mr. President, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I would ask your favorable consideration of the motion and I will yield the well. All the gentleman's motion to the House disagree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 86 is the objection. Hearing none, the House has disagreed to the Senate amendment to HB 86. For what purpose does the representative's leverage rise? Make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker, I'll move that we immediately transmit House Bill 86 back to the Senate. Is the objection? Hearing none, it is so ordered. For what purpose does RIPP's representative Darlene Taylor rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move that the rules be temporarily suspended for bill to be read for the first time and assigned to a committee. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? A number of House resolutions by RIPP's and Taylor, the hundred and seventy-third, and others of resolution creating a House study committee on evaluating funding for public health. On the ladies' motion, that the rules of this House be temporarily suspended so bill can be read for the first time and assigned to a committee. Is there objection? Public and community health. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Honoring the life and memory of Reverend Dr. Robert C. White Jr. Recognizing commending trooper first class and MAPES. Recognizing commending Linn Reilly on the occasion of a retirement. Commending and congratulating James L. Davis. Recognizing commending Dr. Ernest, a foray sarpawn. Commending the building owners and manage association of Georgia and recognize in February 4, 2025 as the building owner and managers association day at the state capitol. Recognizing commending.

And for other purposes, that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions. Is there objection to adopting the privileged resolution here in the resolutions are adopted? That completes our rules calendar for today. We do have some afternoon orders before we complete our work. We'll begin with Representative Ramon. Members as several of you I'm going to give if you can do it in about three minutes that would be appreciated. Representative Ramon, wait a minute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I am ecstatic to share that we are almost run by done. Ramadan ends this week, so Muslims will be celebrating either Sunday or Monday depending on the lunar calendar. So this is like the equivalent of Christmas for us. So if it's going to be on Monday, feel free to give me gifts or anything else. But seriously, your constituents will be celebrating either on Sunday or Monday. So if you've got any masks or Muslim constituents that you know of, please do reach out to them and to my Muslim community. Ramadan, Abadak and eventually Aidem Abadak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Representative Ballard in the Houston County delegation, Representative Ballard, House and County. I think they may be in Houston County. Though there they come. Thank you, Mr. Moore. Oh, there's some more of them. Wait a minute, you're getting more all the time. Oh, there they come. They all traveled afar. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're up here today to honor and commend Mrs. J. Thomas. She is a House and County teacher at Lake Joy Elementary and she is one of the finalists for Teacher of the Year this year. And we are so excited for her and we wish her the very best. Good luck to our post you pools through there. Representative Sharper, give the gentleman your attention. Please got something that find very meaningful. He wants to talk to us about Representative Dexter Sharper. Give your attention, please. Thank you, Speaker. A lot of you guys been asking me and you're hearing about on social media as well as Amazon and other places about the books. The memoir that I came out with lately about a week ago. So it's true. And the first one is called From the Poor House to the State House is Beating the Outs where someone like me came from the rough side of the tracks but continued to move on and push and be a part of the process. And I think Larry Hanson 25 years ago when I was City Council Mayor Pearl Timman about Oster, he encouraged me to just keep on going and that one day I could be a state representative. And it came through and I mentioned a few people in the book. My publisher said you got to cut out the acknowledgements. You got like a thousand people. Nick and Rondo if you're looking at this, when I came in as a freshman 13 years ago, she kind of embraced me. Others did too, but I know she's not in the room. But if you're out there, I appreciate that. And we do have it available for you. Now this other book I wasn't going to say a word about. Because a lot of you were here when my dad passed away in 2018. And a lot of you guys were here when my mom died in 2020. And some of you guys were here when I almost died. And y'all remember I was up at the area with Oxygen on 24 hours a day. And a lot of you guys encouraged me. You were there, you prayed for me. And about 96% of the people that got as bad as I did, they died. But each day a lot of you guys encouraged me. You pushed me. You helped me sometime up the stairs, the doorkeepers, everybody I kept pushing day in and day out. And this is the one called Breaking Free. Depression to success. And I want to say this. I was nobody knew it, but I was actually from the time my dad passed and my mom passed. And she was everything to me. And then me getting sick. I didn't know that I was depressed for three years, 10 months, and 17 days. And nobody else around me knew. Because I always chill, relax, my business is kind of run by themselves. So I didn't have to leave home. I didn't have to do a lot of things because everything was automatic. Nobody knew. So I just want to encourage everybody. This tells my story. And if there's anybody looking at this or anybody in this room, if you're feeling some type of way, whether it's coming from passing up from a loved one because there's a thin line between grief and depression. So I'm going to encourage you to please talk to somebody. So notice the people around you. Because you never know what they're going through. Sometimes all they need is a listening ear. So speaker, I thank you so much. I thank everybody in this room. But one thing it is is when you don't know that you're depressed, that's even worse sometimes. But I thank you guys. And I ask you for your support that these, some of the portions of all these books will be having one for financial literacy for young people. And this is going to be having the movement and mental health awareness that we can be okay, not to be okay. So I thank you all so much. God bless you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Representative Sharper. We appreciate you. You always have care about your neighbor. Thank you, sir. I'm going to recognize Chairman Crowe. There's a situation that he needs to inform you on. And I know that you will give him your full and undivided attention. Chairman Crowe, and you may ask him to stand at the appropriate time if you would like to. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yeah, I would appreciate if you all would stand if you wouldn't mind, please. I learned earlier this morning that a member of our George St. Patrol family, Sergeant Royce Zah, out of the Marietta of Post, his five year old daughter, Navy, is at the Arthur Blank Children's Hospital in ICU. She's been diagnosed with sepsis and from what I understand she's not doing very well at the moment. She had a seizure this morning and had done CT scans and they are not looking very good. So she's undergoing some plasma exchange and other tests today. And I just wanted to come and as a family ask us to in a moment, have a moment of silence for them. But to keep Navy and her family and our thoughts and prayers, especially over the weekend, they're going through a tough time right now. And I would ask that we continually pray for them and her health and her recovery. So if you join me in a moment of silence, I would appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. And I think we witnessed yesterday how powerful prayer is with Chairman England. The Representative of the Holly is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Holly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for members who were able to join us yesterday, Black men and boys day. Unfortunately, one of my locals, Andrea Mallard, was unable to come. But I wanted to highlight him for the good of stepping up. His young son, Aiden, was unfortunately with his mother and South Georgia. When a tree during storm came crashing through the house and to kill this mother. And Andrea was fortunately able to take his son, bring him home to Henry County, and to be able to raise him. And the son is adjusted well enough. He has been excelling in school. And we wanted to honor him yesterday because Andrea chose in that moment, knowing that Aiden's mother would never come back again, but brought him into his life by giving him his last name. So if you're watching at home, Andrea Mallard, Aiden Mallard, we thank you for reminding us that we being made endure through the night. But joy come in the morning. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. That completes our afternoon orders. We have more announcement. Maybe a couple of announcements. Representative Aidenia has recognized for an announcement. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm sure all of us are famished by now and ready to go home. But the Haitian American Chamber of Commerce is hosting a lunch downstairs in Room 230.
