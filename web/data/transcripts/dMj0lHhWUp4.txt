good morning
Hope everybody's ready to go to work today.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer
by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced
by the gentleman from the 119th House District
Representative Marcus Weedower, representative Weedower.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It's my honor this morning to introduce
to you my friend and lead pastor, Sean C. Sean grew up in Metro Atlanta, graduated from
Ticoa Falls College with a degree in Christian counseling. Then went on to earn his master's
in theology from the Dallas theological seminary. He has served on staff at
first Baptist Church of Atlanta, Northwest Bible Church in Dallas, Texas, and
North Point Community Church in Alpharetta. In 1999, Sean was working at North
Point when he felt a calling to find a city that did not have a church quite
like North Point. After years of prayer and planning, he and his wife Bonnie moved
their family. Now includes three children, Boone, Bryson, and Lola who's with us
today as well. To Athens and started Athens Church, where he's now been the
lead pastor for 16 years. First time I walked into Athens Church, so a man
frantically putting out chairs because clearly more people had shown up than
he had anticipated. Looked up me with a joyful smile, energetically said good
morning and scurried off to fetch more chairs. And minutes later, same man was
stand on stage, welcome in the crowd to Athens Church as their lead pastor.
I was, it's always stuck with me when I think about Sean, because I literally can feel
a joy in his heart, that his faithfulness to God, calling on him, to lead people into
a growing relationship with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, had resulted in thousands of
people in the greater Athens area, calling Athens Church home.
This same faithless led Sean his amazing team to make a rather unorthodox real estate decision.
After acquiring the entire commercial development where the church was located,
they decided to tear down an anchor space to the development and replace it with an outdoor
green space for fellowship and worship. They broke ground on that green space project, August of 2019.
How would anyone have known that a few months later that decision would provide Athens Church
a setting to allow people to safely gather to hear God's word at a time when many of us
needed it most?
Last July on a Monday morning in that same green space, I sat there with my oldest daughter
when it became obvious that I was gravely ill and I was admitted into a hospital.
I don't believe it was a coincidence that led me to seek peace that morning in that space
that was created from Athens Church's overall mission of leading people into a growing relationship
with Jesus Christ.
By the grace of God, I made it out of that hospital, and I'm standing before you today.
And I credit Sean with having a vision for a church that has shepherded my faith which
saw me through one of the darkest times of my life.
And for that, I will forever be grateful.
Please welcome my pastor and friend, Sean C.
Well good morning.
It is an incredible honor for me to join you today.
I can only imagine the only thing on your mind and your agendas, what I have to say in
these few minutes, but chances are you have a couple of other things that are on your
mind as well.
But I want to tell you, I'm going to be brief, but I believe what I have to share with you
is very, very important, not only for you,
but for the people of our state and even the next generation.
As Mr. Wiedauer just mentioned,
this is my daughter, Lola.
You can't all see this picture obviously
from where you are, but she's just in the speaker's office
there.
And I wanted you to see her because I wanted her to see you.
I brought her here on purpose.
I brought her here because this is an honor for her
to see our state's capital and to see
the elected officials that lead her and lead the state
that she has enjoyed to call home.
You know this, but historically,
my position as a minister and your position
as a public servant has been a very highly regarded
opportunity, very highly guarded position.
Unfortunately, as I stand before you in February of 2021,
preachers and politicians are not necessarily
as highly regarded as they have always been.
And I believe that it is quite possible
that two of the reasons that that is the case
is because some of us
haven't lived lives of integrity
that leaders are supposed to live.
But specifically what I wanna focus on
in our few minutes together this morning is
the way that we have used our words in our leadership.
You see, our world has never been more full of words.
24 hours a day, seven days a week, the four-profit media organizations have filled our airwaves
and our lives with more words than we could ever imagine.
And I understand the media is a four-profit business.
It is their job to tell us what to fear and who to blame, and they are doing a phenomenal
job at what they have set out to do. But it is my observation that their words and their
influence are impacting our leadership too much today. So much so that I believe that
many of us in the roles that I'm in and the roles that you're in are not using our leadership
influence by the way we use our words very effectively and I will realize I'm going
straight to the point as a matter of time today but I believe this is something that's very
very important. Political leaders have taken people that sit across the aisle from them and
people that have different views from them and they have not only said that they're wrong,
they've gone to the extent of saying that they're a bad person. They've gone to the extent of saying
they're an evil person that many times gone get the extent of demonizing those people and I want
you to remember something today, please. Wars begin with words. Wars begin with words and that's
an important idea and here's something I can't quite understand. Why is it we don't understand it
is human to disagree. I don't know if any of you are married but it is human to
disagree. I don't know if you grew up in a home with a family, it is human to
disagree, right? That is normal but somehow we have developed the idea that
people who disagree with us are not just wrong but they're terrible people. Now
I want to pause here just for a moment. I understand many of you come from very
different political perspectives. Some of you look at the political perspective
opposite of yours, and you not only think it's wrong, you think it's going to lead to
a bad Georgia and a bad America. I understand that. And that's not unfair to disagree with
those ideas. But what we are modeling for this generation is that when you disagree with
someone, you demonize them. That's bad leadership. That's what many of us have done. And I'm
I'm here today to ask you as a father, as a man, and as a pastor to please not use your
leadership influence in that way.
I get political flyers sent to my house.
There's political ads on all day every day, it seems.
And most of them are demonizing people on the other side.
And we've somehow developed the idea that the ends justify the means.
But that's poor modeling for the next generation.
That's poor modeling for my daughter who I brought down here to meet you today and to honor
you today and to be thankful for you as her leaders.
So there's a very simple Hebrew proverb that I want to share with you today that is in
the Jewish scriptures and it's in the Christian scriptures and it's Proverbs 12-18.
is a proverb that has impacted my life,
it's a proverb that's impacted my family's life.
It very simply says this, proverb 12, 18.
It says reckless words, pierce like a sword.
Reckless words, pierce like a sword,
but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
The tongue of the wise brings healing.
And I think that passage is uniquely specific
because I want you to remember this today, please.
You are our elected officials.
We praise God for you.
We are thankful for you.
I pray for you and we'll continue to do so.
But you don't ever get to wars without starting with words.
In reckless words, they pierce like a sword.
But the tongue of the wise,
they don't use their words that way.
They bring healing.
And so what I'm simply asking of you today
is even when you vehemently disagree with the perspective of the person across the aisle from you
or across the house from you or across the bed from you or across the car from you
that you would please use your leadership that we would use our leadership influence
in a way that honors the people we disagree with. Now the last thing I'll say is this
I have no stones to throw. I've been married for 28 years. I have three children. I've said more
things in my home that I regret that I wish that I had. But those have been followed many, many times
with a humble apology and a recognition that what I said and how I said it was wrong. And I would
ask that you would please lead in that same way. Wars begin with words, reckless words pierce like
a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. And my prayer is that as you go about serving our
our state in a complex time that you would do it in a way that honors the people around you
in the way you use your words even when you disagree. Thank you so much for your time. If you
would please stand so I can pray. Heavenly Father, we come to you in the name of Jesus who allows us
to approach the throne of grace with boldness and confidence. We don't come to you with a righteousness
of our own. We come to you with humility that you would even hear our prayers. And I thank you
so much for these men and women who faithfully serve our citizens, serve our state. God, I believe
with all my heart that their motives are good. They're here because they want to serve. But
God, these are complex times. These are times in which our spiritual enemy wants us to turn each
other into enemies. And Father, I pray over protection over this room and these
conversations and everything that happens here. I pray, Father, that you would
help us no matter what the situation to use our words in a way that brings
honor to you and to one another. Please bless this group of people as they go
about doing what they do. Ask an amazing name of Jesus. Amen. That's
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands one nation under God, univable with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

of Medicine, they make convenient at-home testing for reproductive care screening cancer genetic
testing. Reproductive carry screening is recommended for any one thing you've
starting a family and provides information that can help prevent life-threatening
genetic diseases. There's also cancer genetic testing as well. Raising awareness

ultimately save lives. This year more than ever we must focus on protecting our
own health as well as the health of our loved ones. Genetic testing is a
powerful tool that can safeguard our families health for generations to come.
This week, we urge you to take action, take control and get screened.

In the first half of the fiscal year 2020 Georgia announced the creation of more than 16,000 jobs and nearly
$6 billion in new investment. Over half those jobs, by the way, are going to communities outside the Metro Atlanta.
Thanks to conservative physical management and our measured reopening, our rainy day fund is remains intact.
The governor's budget includes no new cuts to state agencies. Our budget includes no new tax cuts to state agencies,
No furloughs, no layoffs, fully funds, K-12 education, and includes significant funds for
rural broadband expansion and health care reform.
All of this, Mr. Speaker, with no new taxes to pay for it all.
Throughout this pandemic, we've been able to maintain our AAA bond rating.
We've also been named again for the eighth year in a row, the number one state for doing
business.
Unemployment consistently below the national average.
And Mr. Speaker, while other states are looking at massive budget deficits, planning furloughs
and layoffs of state employees, and are forced to look to a gridlock Washington D.C. for
a bailout, I for one in glad to raise my family in the greatest state in America, the state
of Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.

In this chamber, we have an eyewitness to our past,
our present, and our future.
Who am I speaking about?
The shy, reserved, and modest representative, Al Williams.
In 1963, did you know that in 1963,
as a high school student, Al attended a training session
with Dr. King and then participated
in the March on Washington Wednesday, August 28th in 1963.
Did you know that on March 25th, 1965,
he walked the 54 miles from Selma, Alabama
to Montgomery, Alabama with John Lewis, Dr. King,
and several other civil rights leaders
in the civil rights movement?
Did you know that he worked for the student
nonviolent coordinating committee, SNCC,
and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC,
where he would eventually go to jail 17 times
in the quest for human rights and human dignity for everyone.
Representative Williams said these were exciting times
and times he would never forget,
but we know now that these were profound times.
Also in 1972, he sued the state of Georgia
to become a delegate for the Democratic National Convention.
And in 1975, Representative Williams
became the first African-American to serve as an aide
to the lieutenant governor.
In 1977, he became the first African-American
to the American of the member of the electoral college
for then president Jimmy Carter.
I just want you to know that you serve with black excellence

are black history in here in this house.
