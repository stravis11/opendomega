This may not be the appropriate time but
I want to thank everyone in here for the
work we put in on this budget. the
committees,
Chairman Hatchet and chairman of the
committees and subcommittees. And

they do. As we pray, let's let's pray

a very expedient time frame. And I want
to thank all of y'all for participating.
I know you have. I've seen you doing
that. And I just want to thank you. And
that I'm going to turn it over to our
secretary, Matt Barton.
All right. Chairman Hatchet. We are
ready for you. Present your bill.
Is the mic on? Is the mic on? Just
making sure it's not off.
Anyway,
>> all right.
Thought I'd kick off a little, lighten
it up a little bit for the media. Uh,
good morning. House Bill 973, the
amended fiscal year 2026 budget is set
by revised revenue estimate of 42.3
billion.
In addition to revenue growth, the
governor's revenue estimate for the
amended FY26 budget includes $3.3
billion in undesated surplus funds for a
total revenue adjustment of 4.5 billion
or 11.9% over the original FY26 budget.
We are responsible stewards of taxpayer
dollars.
And unlike some other states that you
may read about, we do not spend
needlessly or wastefully.
Our per capita state spending is the
ninth lowest in the nation. And we don't
consider revenue growth to be a blank
check for more spending. Since 2021,
we've given back $9.7
billion dollar to our taxpayers through
rebates, tax cuts, and other measures.
We'll continue that tradition by giving
back even more money through this
budget.
While the governor's budget
recommendation recognized funds to
provide income tax rebates, our amended
fiscal year 26 budget reallocates
these funds to provide property tax
relief for Georgia's homeowners, funding
$850 million for the homeowner tax
relief grant program. This grant will
mean that this year's property tax bills
will be just a little bit easier to
swallow. As we continue our work to
eliminate property taxes on your home,
we'll have the opportunity to address
income tax burdens for our citizens
later this session through HB 101, which
will bring our tax rate to 4.9%,
keeping Georgia one of the most
affordable states to live and raise a
family in.
On the spending side, the House amended
FY26 budget responsibly appropriates our
42.3 billion in revenue. Allow me to
highlight some of these key investments
we're making.
Our budget has two statewide items that
you will see over and over in nearly
every program. The first recurring item
is a one-time salary supplement of
$2,000 to full-time regular state
employees and school personnel.
Of this $624 million of total funds,
$384 million is designated for preK
through 12 teachers, school nurses,
nutrition workers, bus drivers, and
custodians.
The governor's 2027 budget
recommendation does not include
payraises.
So, these supplements will help us
retain essential staff and teachers.
While not directly related to these pay
supplements, I will also mention that
we're also taking care of our retirees.
We've included $50 million for the
Employees Retirement System of Georgia
to strategically invest in increasing
the funding ratio to improve long-term
financial viability to the pension
system and support state retirees.
The second recurring item is related to
the state health benefit plan.
SHBP currently has a healthy reserve
fund balance which the governor
recognized in FY27 by reducing how much
state agencies pay per employee per
month for health coverage starting in
July.
Our amended FY26 budget passes these
savings on to the state agencies a month
earlier. Starting in June, saving $21.5
million.
Running a growing state is not cheap.
And this budget spends over $300 million
in workload adjustments, including K
through2, Medicaid, corrections, health
contracts, and DHS out of home care.
These additions are largely associated
with our growing population and an
all-around increased cost of doing
business in most sectors.
Since 2024, we've used $4.1 billion in
surplus revenues to fund capital
projects with cash, saving taxpayers
over $3 billion in debt payments.
The House amended fiscal year 26 budget
also makes a significant $82 million
cash investment in new capital projects.
In addition to funding most of the
governor's recommended projects, the
House budget also funds a few noteworthy
additional projects. We provided $220
million for a private prison expansion.
While the new Washington County facility
will bring much needed safety upgrades
to the correctional system, it does not
add additional bed space.
This private prison expansion will
provide an additional 480 beds for a
system that's rapidly approaching
capacity.
Our budget also provides $27 million to
begin design and construction of a new
Georgia regional hospital to address
mental health and forensic bed capacity
in our state. We're projected to have
zero forensic beds empty by 2034.
And this funding is a down payment on a
hospital that will help address this
need by adding 200 forensic and 100
mental health beds.
The House budget also provides $29.8
million to design, construct, and equip
equip a building that will house the
brand new college of optometry at
Georgia Southern University. Filling a
tremendous need for our state, Georgia
has long sent has for long since sent
aspiring optometrists to study in
Alabama and Tennessee. And with this new
school, hopefully the best and brightest
will see fit to stay right here in
Georgia.
These examples represent just a few of
our priorities. You've likely already
read the budget in its entirety, so I'm
not going to rehash every line, but I do
want to give you a few more highlights
from each of our major policy areas.
To help keep Georgia mobile, our budget
makes several investments in
transportation.
In addition to the big ticket items of
1.7 billion for the I75 South express
lane expansion and $200 million for the
State Road 316 interchange conversions.
We also provide additional funds for
airport aid, rural rural bridge rehab,
local road projects, shortline rail
improvements, and various local
resurfacing projects
to help keep Georgia educated. This
budget contain continues to meet our
obligations in K through 12 and higher
ed fully funding our formulas and
projections for QBE charter systems
promise scholar and special needs
scholarships AP exams dual enrollment
completion schools hope scholarships and
grants provide $88 million for major
repairs and rehab projects at USG and
TCSG.
And finally, we include $300 million to
provide state matching funds for an
endowment to provide needs-based
scholarships
to help keep Georgia healthy. We provide
funds for new rural medical and dental
clinics, nursing home quality incentive
payments, and GME expansion.
We also provide funds for rural
colarctyl screenings and we direct the
department of public health to develop a
strategy to promote awareness and
prevention measures for colarctyl and
prostate cancer.
Our
budget adds additional funds to out
ofome care to fully fund the deficit at
defects and reinstate foster care
supportive services contracts that we
know make a difference. We also provide
$15 million for a new integrated child
welfare reporting system to help enable
early detection, speed up service, and
increase accountability.
To help keep Georgia safe, this budget
makes several investments in the
Department of Corrections. We allocate
more than $185 million for capital
projects to make needed safety,
security, and technology upgrades to the
GDC infrastructure.
We also provide additional funds for new
correctional officer positions to help
us get nearer to our goal of 1 to 11
officers to inmate ratio.
and we add significant funds for rising
health and food and farm costs.
We've also included some one-time funds
for domestic violence shelters and
sexual assault centers for operational
and facility needs
to help keep Georgia growing. This
budget provides $35 million to the
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority
to establish a state financing and
assistance program for natural gas
infrastructure improvements and $50
million for rural infrastructure
projects. We also support the governor's
recommendation of $50 million for the
state housing trust fund. These funds
will help address homelessness through
matching reimburseable grants to local
governments and nonprofits and they
bring with them up to a 4 to1 federal
match maximizing the impact of our state
dollars.
These items are just some of the
highlights of the 42.3 billion budget.
This budget lives within our means and
will help ensure Georgia remains the
greatest state to live and raise a
family.
I'd like to close by saying thank you
for all of your hard work to our
dedicated subcommittee chairs
and Christine Kaki and Dave Lackley
leading the charge of the incredible
staff of the House Budget and Research
Office.
Friends, we're voting on a budget a mere
3 weeks after it was initially
introduced by the governor. It's no easy
feat to turn around a budget this
quickly, especially with much mother
nature throwing two icy snow events at
us. We've been able to stick
to an aggressive timeline in order to
quickly get this budget across the
finish line. I thank all of you for your
work and commitment to the task and I
ask for your favorable consideration of
HB973
and I will attempt to answer any
questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate all
your hard work, too. Are there any
questions?
Come on.
Wow.
>> Wow.
>> Oh, hey,
Leia.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Um, am I hearing you correctly
that we are fully funding the deficit uh
in DHS?
>> Yes. 82 plus million dollars.
>> Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, I see no more questions
at this time. Do I hear a motion?
>> Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I move that
House Bill 973 do pass by committee
substitute.
>> All those in favor?
>> I Any against?
And it passes. You're good to go. We're
adjourned. Thank you'all very much.
