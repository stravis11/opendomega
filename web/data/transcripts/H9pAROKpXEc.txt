Before we begin this morning, I think it's proper that we pause and reflect on the horrific event that occurred yesterday. Just outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a little town called Waka Shaw, home to about 70,000 people. Families were there for a tradition in that town, a tradition of great joy and celebration, a hometown Christmas parade. In the aftermath of an unspeakable tragedy, five people have been killed and more than 40 injured. There are a lot of questions and no answers. We don't know yet why someone showed such a reckless disregard for human life. But just as the sun rose today, as it has every day, we pray that we may follow the example of our Lord and Savior and be of comfort to those who are suffering today. Second Corinthians teaches us that blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforted us in all our tribulation. That we may be able to comfort them, which are in trouble. So our prayers today are with our brothers and sisters in Wisconsin. And so with that, I would ask that you all please join with me in a moment of silence for the victims of this tragedy and their families. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the ninth house representative, Will Wade, representative Wade. Good morning, colleagues, and thankful to be here with you in this Thanksgiving week. And I do have the honor to introduce today a friend, a former opponent, we met 30 years ago on the opposite sides of the basketball court. And while we were fierce enemies, me being a Dawson County Tiger, and he being a Lumpkin County Indian, we fought for victory, and sometimes we won, and sometimes they won. But today we're friends and we're brothers in Christ, and it's my honor to introduce you, my friend, Reverend Chris Gilbert. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate this opportunity to be here with you today, what a specific privilege. The honor that this is, thank you, Mr. Speaker for allowing us this time and representative Wade for the opportunity to come and speak to all of you this morning. But we are, we come this way this morning with thankful hearts as we've come to celebrate the week of Thanksgiving, the most precious thing that we should be thankful for is, morning in believers in Jesus Christ as we have an incarnate Emmanuel Savior in his name is Jesus. And he came to bleed and die for all, and we are thankful for that. This morning we'll get into the text of the scripture here in just a few seconds and we do want to be respectful of time this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to be here, but five minutes for a Baptist preacher is like Bridal and the Horse. So we'll try our best to be as quick as possible this morning. But I thought about this. I wanted to tell this story just briefly. There was a man who bought a horse from a pastor and the pastor told him he said, the only way that you make the horse go is to say, thank you Lord. And the only way to stop it is to say amen. The man settled the horse. He said, thank you Lord and all the horse went, shout out like a jet. And as he was riding rembunctiously and fearing for his life, he began to become acclimated to the situation and begin to enjoy himself until he came to a bluff. And in the distance, he could see a cliff and all of his apprehension and anxiety he could not remember how to stop the horse. And he tried to say everything that he possibly could in the very last second. He screamed up to top of his lungs, amen. And the horse stopped and he looked and peered over the edge of the bluff and he said, thank you Lord. I appreciate a good laugh among friends. And we thank you this morning for representing the constituents of the state of Georgia. I thank you for your service and for your time and we'll get it into the scripture reading right here. It's a very familiar passage of scripture. We want to read from you the gospel according to St. John this morning. The Bible tells us in St. John chapter 1 verse number 1. The beginning was the word, the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of man. And the light, shine, and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not, skipping down to verse 14. The scripture says in the word was made flesh and dwell among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth. John by our witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I speak. He that comeeth after me is preferred before me, for he was before me. And of his fullness have always received and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten son which is in the bosom of the Father. He that hath declared him. And I'm thankful this morning as we stand before you and as you stand as representatives for the state of Georgia. I stand as a representative for my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I'm glad as I stated in the earlier previous comment that he is our Emmanuel, the second person in the Trinity. The eternal begotten son of God in in which we have everlasting eternal life. And I'm glad here this morning that we can have this privilege and we are thankful for this opportunity that we can present our Savior Jesus Christ and most fortunately that we can be thankful as we enter this thanks given season that we have a hope and we have trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. First Peter chapter 1 verse number 3, the Scripture tells us blessed be the God and fall of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to his abundant mercy have begotten us again and to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fate of not away reserved in heaven who are kept by the power of God. Friends this morning I'm thankful for you most certainly that I am thankful for my Savior Jesus Christ. I have a quote written down right here by the late and great AW Tozer and he writes this he said if a man had his way the plan of redemption would be an endless and bloody conflict in reality salvation was brought not by Jesus fist but by his nail pierced hands not by muscle but by love not by vengeance but by forgiveness not by force but by sacrifice. Jesus Christ our Lord surrendered in order that he might win. He destroyed his enemies by dying for them and conquered death by allowing death to conquer him. John the gospel of John in the 10th chapter and 18 verse Jesus made this comment he said no man take of my life from me he said but I lay it down and I want to remind you just in closing here briefly as we get to the 19th chapter in the 30th verse we see at the crucifixion of our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ they were seven utterances declared from Calvary of which the last was this. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed up his head and gave up the ghost it is finished is a Greek term the Greek term that is used is total S.I. which means paid in full I'm glad that we have a savior that is paid every single day that we owe I'm glad that we are free this morning in the Lord Jesus Christ I want to if time will allow close with this story. There was a man who had a son and he and his son had a master wonderful art collection they had gathered a bango and Picasso and listen it was an exquisite art gallery that was worth millions and millions of dollars his son was drafted to go serve in the war and was killed in the war. There was a man that served in the war with him that came and showed up at his father's house listen and he was an artist and he gave his father a picture of his son that he had hand painted. And as time grew the art collection the pinnacle of the art collection began to be the photo and the portrait of his son time had come and the old man died in his wheel all of his art collection was to be auctioned off and art collectors from all around the world had amassed and gathered themselves in to get their hands on these accessories. I can see that the portrait of his son was a very different portrait and the auctioneer stood to the front and he began to auction off the portrait of his son was placed in front of this incredible people that had gathered themselves in. And as they gathered themselves in the auctioneer uncovered the first photo which was the portrait of his son and he said, we'll begin opening bids and they begin to become chatter from the crowd. And said, listen, we didn't come here to see this. Where's the good stuff? And there was a friend of the man in the back. He said, I'll give you $10 for the photo of his son. He said, I knew him and he was a good boy. As he called for more, the auctioneer closed the sale at $10 and he stood and declared the auctioneer is over. In chaotic disarray, they began to look around at each other and auctioneer declared this. He said the father left this in his wheel. He who buys the son buys it all. He who buys the son buys it all. My friends today, I'm glad that we have one hope in the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas. If you would stand with us this morning as we go to the Lord in prayer. Our Father is we are bowed in our presence. God, we thank you, Lord, for this day. We thank you for this wonderful privilege and honor that you have afforded us to stand in front of this great people. We pray, Heavenly Father, that you would guide their hearts, guide their minds, touch them, lead them, guide them and direct them. I pray that they may serve each other and serve this great state and this great nation as we have already said in our thoughts and devoting this morning. We thank you most of all for your precious son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Go with us now. Keep us in care for us. We thank you and praise you for what you do. We ask it in the strong, the mighty, sweet and precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the Father of the United States of America and to the Republic of Israel. We wish the same. On one night should the under God, indiscible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorcappers will unlock the doors.

I mean what can be better than thanking people and eating great food But today I'm thankful for an organization in the state of Georgia that does amazing work and a friend who helped them in a roundabout way Each year the friends of the Georgia archives sell Christmas ornaments to raise funds for their organization and each ornament usually Pick some architectural detail or something historical about the capital to highlight Well this year's ornament Features the regulator clock that's down in the governor's office in the lobby and That clock Was built about eight was made about 1870 and it's one of the very best time keepers at the time And it was used for the Western Atlantic Railroad and then it was used for another railroad Anyway, it's been in the state of Georgia and it's been at the intersection of financial and Industrial development and the expansion of the railroad for many years Well, it was returned to the state of Georgia and they put it outside the governor's office when it first came back to the capital and At some point some people said well, it's just an old clock. It's not running anymore. Why do we need it? Well, this is the rest of the story and this is what I'm thankful for We have a colleague that retired former house member that was the chair of education, but he was also a clock keeper a clock Repairman and a clock restore extraordinaire and his name is Brooks Coleman and Brooks set in to save the clock and he pulled together the National Association of watch and clock collectors at Atlanta chapter 24 and The clock was repaired returned to the governor's office and it keeps amazing time Even though it's over a hundred years old and this year's ornament features the clock He is so excited and he would like for all of us to buy an ornament to help the Friends of the archives So if you don't know about these ornaments and make wonderful gifts and if you don't know about Brooks Coleman you missed a tree

But the two of those together, I hope that you will choose to purchase one for someone you know that likes trains or clocks and I hope you all have a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Liberty County, Representative Al Williams, for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman English Representative Buckner and I have agreed that just because it's old does not mean it can't function. I'll know how you want to take that. As I get ready to present my morning order, I did not mention this part but about 30 seconds off the five minutes I've been allowed. I just wanted to mention very briefly, all of us know it but I don't remember it being said from the well. You know, every once in a while you meet someone that has a terrific impression on your life. And if the Senate has any sense at all, it will confirm this friend of mine who I've probably known longer than most of you since 1975 when he raised his hand in this house. I was here working for Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller. I want you to know Calvin Smire, you've been a personal inspiration to me. And even though I know you're going to do hard duties, you'll get combat pay for being in Dominican Republic. But we're going to miss you and that seat will never be the same. I just wanted to take a minute for us to thank you for your service and your friendship. All right. Now each of you all get over the Calvin piece by the end of the day because it'll be missed in bastard next year. Listen, I rise to just give you something to think about over Thanksgiving and over Christmas. What I want to talk about is kind of like a favorite person that you really had deep feelings for but you were afraid to tell anybody about your feelings. That's how it is for pay raise in this house. Most of you know I'm right but you're terrified to see it in your district and it's only because you're more afraid of your district than your district is thinking about. If you think you're in trouble, you ought to talk to some of your city council and mayors that make so much more money than you do and they're being reelected here after year. While you sit around 23 years terrified freshman don't get caught up in this 23 year hiatus do something about it. Let me tell you something this is one of the most distinguished houses in America. It is one of the most distinguished and the Bible says the workman is worthy of his higher. And you get exactly what you paid for. So some folk I know you're going to leave but ain't going to have nothing to do with the pay raise because if that makes your constituents toss you out of office you were hanging on by three or eight anyhow. All I ask you to do is man up and woman up and deal with it. We are going to chase this house into the position when I got to be 90 and still sitting in that seat. I will be surrounded by people who are either super rich, dirt poor or just ain't got nothing else to do because they're retired. You will leave some of the great minds at home because they can't afford to come up here and serve. And if you call 17 three pot time pay I don't know what you used to do that ain't pot time paying anymore. And I don't know about you but every time I go to Walmart I just want to move my office there because I'm entertaining. This is an around the clock job. Just had a lady call me and wanted to get her son a pot hole fixed in front of a sun's house. I got nothing to do with me but what did I have to say? I'll get right on it. You can do better than this if you think you're worth 17 through your net saw give the rest of your family charity and leave it on the table. You've got nothing you hadn't got to take it and I know some of your churches will accept it because some of your hadn't tied this so long they'll be glad you give them something. I'm just trying to help some preachers out and say what they couldn't tell you. They scared you to lose you. Folk and I'm almost finished but just like the preachers this morning I'm a Baptist Deacon and one I'm almost finished don't mean nothing. Let me tell you this right now. We have an opportunity. We make gutsy decisions here. We make decisions that requires a lot of guts and then when it comes to yourself what happened to the guts? Come on now because if you don't think enough of yourself then think of the person who terrifies going to feature because if you that scared of them they're going to beat you anyhow. At least give them a raise. That's a long time to go without a period. Count the times that Congress has gotten a raise since you got one and people at home think you already get $170,000 a year and unlimited franking privileges. Show for it all this other stuff get the ride in the black Tahoe. Hey you just as well get paid a decent wage and decent is I'm embarrassed when I go out of this state and folk ask me what you make. I'm not embarrassed in Georgia because they already know I'm poor but when I leave here at least let me fool somebody. It's awful. I ask you to do one thing. Get up the courage. Get up the courage to make sure that we put a pay raise somewhere on the dark. And some of you that boldly walk up here and talk about how much you love the people boldly walk up here so I'm not afraid to give a raise after I go to one more election cycle. Come on it's easy and if you want me to I'll come up here and hold your hand if you need a little holding up. This is obvious you're terrified come by my desk and I'm a bar of some all from representative Mike Jackson where I can and know it some of you to give you some courage and when we get back in hand know that ain't funny to you. But courage is what statesmen have. People who run away are just everyday politicians. Statesmen face the issue and they face it above themselves they do it for future generations and for the good of everybody around let's do a good thing and for some of us and I'm not pointing it either side of the hour because it applies equally I guess. But for some of us a little dose of courage would make you feel better it's about like cast or you don't like it while it's going down but boy it'll do you good. Please let's stand in January and raise the pathetic rates that we paid we're paid less than part time or full time part time bus boys and bus girls. I'm going to sign me more money than that when I was busting tables I'm going to have to leave here and find a job because I would have spent all the little money I had just serving up here. Listen my mayor one of my mayors in a very small community of less than a thousand makes thirty thousand dollars a year plus a car. If I had any sense and one won't out from this house I'd go home and run for that mayor's office but I don't do it for the money and you don't do it for the money either but you're all at least do it for the pride of being and serving in the greatest house in these United States thank you Mr. Speaker thank you. Any objection if the chair calls the question. Call the question. But I'm gone. Yes. I call the question. I move but to speak it every time I'm a pay raise rise shining be counted. I'll run above because we won't tell on you you'll have to tell it come on. Alan Powell a good see man scared to raise your home my goodness. I broke your blood. We're going on now to the rules calendar. We're going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill two EX Senate bill two EX by Senate in kind of the 18th cows are the forty six do you know the 30th Gouge the 51st Berk of the 11th and others to provide for the composition and number of congressional districts. I'm not sure if the committee on legislative congressional re-apportionment that committee recommends this bill do pass chair recognizes the chair of the legislative and congressional re-apportionment committee chairman Bonnie rich to present the bill. I'm going to go ahead and say, Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen of the house that is a very tough act to follow. I'm going to try not to bore you too much. I bring to you today Senate bill two EX which is the Georgia Congressional redistricting act of twenty twenty one. I'm going four months the process that you heard me describe with respect to the state and the Senate House is the same process that we've been using for these congressional maps. We have had opportunities for public comment in person virtually and online. In addition, the Senate majority released a congressional draft district draft on September the 27th of this year to allow for public comment. And that is actually largely the map that you see before you today on your desks. The Democratic caucus also released their plan on October the 21st of this year. So we in the house took the Democratic proposed map the Senate majority proposed map. And then we also took into account public comments meetings with you all. And we talked with the chairman of the state Senate in order to reach this final map that you see on the screen and that is on your desks as well. You can see similarities to these maps that have been public for months. You'll notice that the ninth and the 14th are similar to what was originally proposed by the Senate majority. Districts two and three are largely what the Democratic caucus proposed in their maps. Districts two eight and one which are in the southern part of our state were down in population significantly. 92,045,000 and 10,000 respectively. Contrast that with the very large population gains that we had in the Atlanta area, the seventh alone had over 94,000 people too many in that district. So you see a lot of the same pushing north that you had seen with the house maps as well. The seventh, what's it the sixth congressional district is and continues to be a north metro suburban district. So much of the population from the seventh actually moved into the sixth. We prioritized maintaining the core of that district. So district seven shrunk in and much of what was on the periphery moved over to the sixth. So it's where minority voters have the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. Our districts two four five and 13 and now the seventh is a new minority opportunity district under these maps that we drew. This map is at absolute zero deviation. That means that the districts are plus or minus one person as required by the Constitution. So that is a little bit more of a strict deviation than we are required to do in the house. But that is something that is a feat that our Gina Wright and her reapportionment office managed very well. This map also complies with the Voting Rights Act with several majority minority and minority opportunity districts that I just discussed. It also complies with our guidelines that were adopted by the committee. It respects county boundaries. The current plan that we're operating under splits 16 counties. And once again, we were able to do even better with the new plan. Our new plan splits 15 counties. In contrast, the Democratic proposed plan split 18. Some precinct splitting is inevitable in order to reach zero deviation. There's simply no other way to get there. But we did split as few precincts as possible while reaching that goal. And we tried to find logical places to divide the counties. This map respects communities of interests recognizing that these are very large districts. 765,000 people. They very often have to take in a lot of territory. While incumbents are not required to live in their districts in Congress, every incumbent member of Congress does have a district to run in. So you have a map before you that complies with the law, the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and it also represents the guidelines that our committee adopted. For this reason, I ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill 2EX. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Lady, as yielded the well, the rules committee limited debate on this measure this morning to a total of one hour. The chair is going to allocate that 30 minutes to each side. And amongst those who are speaking in favor and opposed, I'm going to let you allocate that in 30 minutes will just turn the microphone off. That does not include the minority report nor does it include the chairman's time. Chair recognizes to speak to the bill representative Paris. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise in opposition of Senate Bill 2EX. I'd like to preface my speech today with the fact that redistricting is some of the most important work that we do in this legislature. Every decade we take on the task of redistricting. The redistricting process has a direct impact on women representation for Georgians in the United States House of Representatives, the Georgia State Senate, and the Georgia State House of Representatives. According to the Center for American and Women and Politics, women hold 30.47% of the seats in U.S. Congress, and women of color hold only 9.2% of those seats. Of the state legislative seats nationally, women hold 28.4% of state Senate seats, and 32.1% of state House seats nationally, women of color hold only 8.3% of the state legislative seats nationally. These numbers woefully under represent the true demographics, gender wise, as well as racially, of not only our state but our country as well. At a time when women are already underrepresented, particularly women of color, we should not be drawing maps that target women in comets to make it harder for them to run and win in new districts. But the map before us today does just exactly that. With this congressional map, the majority party is targeting 50% of the women in Georgia's congressional delegation. With this congressional map, the majority party targets a black woman, one of only two in the delegation, in order to redraw her district to make it safely Republican. A woman of color that has been elected twice by the voters of the competitive district of congressional district six. With this congressional map, the majority party draws the congresswoman of the seventh congressional district out of the district. We cannot say to the people of Georgia, we see you, we hear you, we are drawing fair maps, we want to be represented. While at the same time drawing lines that erased the extremely hard fought gains of women, particularly minority women in this state. As I said before, redistricting is some of the most important work that we do in this legislature and on this particular map we have failed. I will be voting no on Senate Bill 2EX. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield well. Chair recognizes representative Bodie to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today I rise in complete opposition to the Republican congressional map. This map does not take in consideration adequately. Communities of interests, it splits multiple metro counties and it violates the Voting Rights Act. The population growth in Georgia over the last decade has been fueled by people of color in the metro areas across the state. The growth of communities of color has been seen mostly in their land time metro area over the last decade. While the white, non-Hispanic population of the state has decreased by 4%, the African-American population has increased by 22%. The Hispanic-American population has increased by 31% and the Asian-American population of Metro Atlanta area has increased by 45% over the last decade. However, the Republican congressional map does not reflect this minority growth. Based on how the map is drawn. Last week during the Florida Bay on the Republican Senate map, I sat in my chair and I listed as a member of the majority party stated that their map and their well-speed, and I quote, anyone who votes no on the Republican Senate map is exercising a dishonest stand based on partisan politics and buzzwords. Mr. Minority Leader, I don't agree with that statement at all. I voted no on the Republican Senate map and I will be voting no again today on the Republican congressional map. Now, House Democrats are only asking that the new congressional map be drawn with a seven-seven split, seven Democrat leading district, seven Republican leading districts. The Democratic congressional map is actually reflective of Georgia's current population makeup and has a seven-seven fair split. So I ask you members of this body, is this dishonest for House Democrats to fight for a fair seven-seven map when the Republican congressional map fails to take an account, Georgia's 1 million new minority residents? Is Shatters Communion of Interest? Is it dishonest for House Democrats to want to fight for a seven-seven fair map when Georgia is losing a Democratic leaning congressional district that covers Cobb County, Decap County, and Fulton counties? When based on the population growth and census data, Georgia should actually be gaining a new Democratic congressional district in Cobb County? Is it dishonest for House Democrats to want to fight for a fair map when Republican maps split four Metro counties, four to Cobb? When that hairy counts, enter three or four congressional districts. Not one rule county, it split that many times. And is it dishonest for House Democrats to want to fight for a fair seven-seven map when Georgia has a Republican governor and two Democratic members of the United States Senate? Would that Mr. Speaker out a year well with no questions? Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Wilson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, as we've been down here for this special session, we've talked a lot about the process of this endeavor and whether or not it's been conducted in a transparent and open manner. And I've been struck not just during this session, but throughout the past year, about how far the majority has gone to create the appearance of fairness. And I say appearance because now we have the map and we can juxtapose the end result with the words we heard all summer and into the fall. And the truth now is quite clear. You've been saying one thing, but doing another. You said we'd have an open and transparent process that would allow for actual citizen input. But what you did was hold a series of town halls months before any maps actually existed to discuss. And there were no town halls held in Cobb, DeCab, Henry Fayette, Clayton, Gwyneth Newton, or Douglas counties. Although each of those are disproportionately affected by this map. Of course, this map was only made public a few days ago. You said you didn't endeavor to preserve communities of interest and keep them together. But what you did was intentionally split counties with large minority populations. The same counties where no town halls were held, by the way. What you did was intentionally draw the black voters of Southwest Cobb County in with the overwhelmingly white population of Northeast Georgia. Deliberately drowning out these black votes and these black voices. You said this map would be fair and honest. But what you did was intentionally target incumbent women and voters of color to dilute their power and silence their voices. All of the sound and fury around making this a fair and transparent process is tantamount to lipstick on a pig. What you did was completely redraw the two congressional districts that flip from Republican to Democratic the last four years, the six and the seventh districts. And I want to focus on the six district because that's where nearly all of my constituents live. Out of all 14 of the current congressional districts, the six was the closest to ideal population size following the most recent census. That means it should have required the least amount of redrawing. In fact, all that it required was to shrink by 657 voters. But what you did was target 355,000 people in the six district. Mostly people of color, pack them into nearby Democratic districts and then replace them with 355,000 mostly white votes. The result is that this district that voted for President Joe Biden by 12 points in 2020 has become a district that voted for Donald Trump by 15 points. The six congressional district was the most competitive in this state and the map offered by the Democratic caucus would have kept it that way. But this map makes your intent obvious to legislatively draw in quarter Congresswoman Lucy McBath and scatter to the four wins all the black and brown voters that put her in office. A yes vote for this map amounts to race-based sorting pure and simple, all for political power. You wanted more seats in Congress and with this map you'll have them. It's no wonder folks find it hard to trust anyone who wears this pen. The truth is these maps are continuing the same experiment Georgia has been on for most of its history. The one that we continued in March by passing Senate Bill 202, dilute and suppress the voices of black and brown Georgians to keep white people in power. It's egregious and it's shameful and we all know it. The difference between the majority and minority positions here today is that we're willing to call this for what it is. The majority has the numbers. They have the votes this map will pass. But this is why people have so little trust.

for us. This is why they use the word politician as a slur. This is the continuation of the unabashed self-dealing we've seen so much of lately. It's a continuation of the big lie calling something fake, radical, or even un-American until the words have no meaning anymore. The Georgians who send us here deserve better. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Eric Atomis to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this bill. When asked how do I feel about this bill, I think of the words of the late Congressman John Lewis. It's not right. It's not fair. And it's not just. This bill will affect, of course, the lives of all Georgians. But I am here to talk about Cobb County. When we talk about hearing the voices of the people, when we talk about how we went all over Georgia to talk to people that may be affected by this bill, did we come to Austin and to Powder Springs and talk to the demographic that's going to be affected by this bill? Did we come to Cobb County and talk to the people that are going to be affected by this bill with all the meetings that we did across the state? And I'll let you answer that question. And people ask, why are we so passionately speaking against this bill because we are representatives of our people. And there are demographics of people that will not have a voice because of this bill. When we heard about the meeting that was had last week, and we didn't have as much notice. But we got it out to the people. We sent out text messages, letting them know within hours, come to the meetings at 12 o'clock, come to the meeting at 9.30, get here. And did people show up? Yes. I had people in my district that dropped their kids off the school and they were on their way here to the Capitol to speak because they wanted their voices to be heard. And they believed that their voices mattered when it came to these maps. And they spoke out. I had people in my district come and speak out how terrified they were to be in congressional district 14. How they believed that their voices were not going to be heard if they were in a district that did not look like them, did not represent the values that they represented and did not believe in the issues that they believed were true and just. And they spoke out one after another, believing that maybe their voices might change the minds of the committee members or even soften them a little bit just to give them a voice. Did that happen? Did anything happen after the people came and spoke up against the bill? No. The same map that was proposed before and after comment is the same map that you are voting on here today. So you tell me that you represent people and that their voices matter and that on your badge it says representative. I cannot stand and say that I can truly speak out for the voices of my people if my voice is not being heard and their voices are not being heard with this map. When you look at this map and you look at the top of this map that is a pinkish orange and you see rural Georgia. The Congress person that will be fighting for the issues of agriculture is not the same person that will be fighting for the issues of transportation and urban and things that we see in Metro Atlanta. So how dare we give the people of Austin and Powder Springs no voice. The question still lingers. Why was Cobb County split to add a large population of people of color to Congress district 14? What is the redistricting criteria that justifies that sort of split? Because if the answer is the principle of one person, one vote, then why not draw from counties that are more demographically similar and would lead to a more compact district such as Fannon, Glimmer, Pickens, Bartow counties? Why split and dilute the voting power of people in color in West Cobb and put them in a district that is so clearly where they do not belong? These are the questions when we leave here today that we have to talk to our constituency about. And this is the reason why I will be voting no and I encourage you to vote no to SB2EX. I yield the well. Chair recognizes the whip of the minority caucus representative Wilterson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Not long after I was elected, I would like to thank the mayor for the opportunity to talk to the mayor about the honor of joining a group of legislators to hear from Supreme Court justice, Robert Benham. Many of you know Robert Benham, he was the first African American in the Supreme Court in the first service of chief justice. Justice Benham said something that stuck with me throughout all of these years. He said the law, the law is the minimum standard by which we should conduct ourselves. I'm paraphrasing here, but that's the law is the minimum standard by which we should conduct ourselves. We can do better. We can do better for the people that send us here. So when I hear these maps complies with the Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which many of us disagree is the case. Is this chamber barely trying to comply with their interpretation of the law? Or can we do better? Are we keeping communities together? Ensuring that Georgians are fairly represented. These congressional maps do not reflect the Jordan that we know exists today. That is why I'm here to speak against Senate Bill 2EX. The 14th District leaves Katusa, travels to Chateuga and comes around the Westside and the Cobb County into South Cobb, my area. You want to talk about communities interest? The only thing that ties those communities together is the sea that starts their county. The 2020 census shows that the All-Stale is 60% black, 79% minority. Powder Springs is 55% black and 73% minority. However, the 14th District in total in SB2EX is 13.5%. You don't have to be a CPA, no, that's a huge difference. As my senator from the 33rd Senate on Friday during the debate in their chamber, Powder Springs and All-Stale are very diverse communities. The residents of the community have shown that when given the opportunity, they can elect a candidate of their choice. In 2015, Outthurmond was elected Mayor of Powder Springs after serving on the City Council. He was the first African-American mayor in Cobb County. In 2019, Olly Clemens in African-American was elected as Mayor of All-Stale. Last week, community members heard from the community members heard from the community the voice of concern of South Cobb. Members like Valerie Tessman who came to the Capitol. A mother, she came to the Capitol as soon as she heard what we were doing to her community. Ms. Tessman, who was an African-American, came because her community is being placed in a district in which she does not share very many similarities. The difference between Metro Atlanta and the North Georgia Mountains is quite significant. You may ask why people like Ms. Tessman never came to speak. I think previous people have mentioned that before. We never had an opportunity to have an equal voice. There were no hearings in Cobb. There were no hearings in Gwyneth. There were no hearings in the cab. Though I'm not on the re-apportionment committee, I did have the opportunities attend several of these hearings throughout the state. I heard citizens say they wanted the communities to be representative of what their beliefs were. At the Dalton hearing, I listened to how voters loved their current Congressperson and wanted them to reflect their values. Don't the families in South Cobb deserve the same thing? I looked through the pages of testimony that we talk about and I don't find one person that says a South Cobb should be part of the 14th. I didn't hear the testimony. I don't hear in the community. While I'm focusing on the 14th, many of you may say, look at the map in totality. I agree. We got to look at the map in totality. However, as any map draw or nose changes in one place ripple across all districts across all of Georgia. So if the 14th is tainted, that poison runs throughout the state. Cobb County is now split between four congressional districts. What is even more amazing is that the South Cobb area is split between three. South Cobb has three congressional districts now. That continues a long history of targeting the South Cobb area and reduces minority voting strength. Now let's talk about 2000. I know a lot of folks have wanted to talk about 2000. I'm ready to talk about it because I'll tell you what happened in 2000 when I was sitting in Cobb County. This chamber Republican, this chamber drew a Cobb County commission that would have prevented minority voters from joining with the majority population to elect their candidate choice in the district four. Republicans were sued in court and they lost. How do I know? Because I was one of the interveners that sued in that case that we defeated that map. We rose together just like we will continue to rise together to stop the maps that we see today. The first African-American commissioner was elected in that district. Now we have a county chairwoman in African-American, the first in Cobb County that came from that district. What we do here in this chamber matters. I'll let the lawyer slide it out over this proposal. Does it comply with the law? I don't think it does. But I'll leave that to the advocates on one side. The high price lowers and the other and the judges sit behind making that decision. And despite what people may think, this is not about Marjorie Taylor Greene. Or whoever the representative may be for that district. This is about fair representation. Fair representation not only for Coutusa County or Chitugac County, but representation for South Cobb County. This map does not provide that fair representation to the families in South Cobb. So again, I ask, are we here to comply with the minimum standards of our interpretation of the law? Or are we trying to do us right? I ask you to join me in voting against Senate Bill 2EX. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. We're going on now to the minority report. And by rule of the House, 20 minutes allocated for that, that chair recognizes to afford the minority report, the minority leader, leader Beverly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Arise an opposition to Senate Bill 2EX. The Republican map for redistricting, Georgia's 14 congressional districts. Because in my opinion, this map puts power over principles. Partitionship over people. In Georgia, deserves our best efforts in Senate Bill 2EX is not it. The people of Georgia ask for and deserve a fair and transparent redistricting process. We are fully aware that the process was rushed and secretive. With the congressional map released just three hours before public comment was scheduled to begin last week. However, let me also tell you what I saw from my vantage point as a leader of the minority party during the entire special session of this legislative process. Before the census data was released, members of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus spent months becoming more knowledgeable about the redistricting process. Once the data was released, hours upon hours upon hours were spent carefully looking at the nuances of Georgia's districts. We play close attention to communities of interest. Listening to what fellow Georgia's told us about their communities, including our Congress people. In public comments, every apportionment committee meetings, town halls, and the statewide listening tour, we listen. Now let me talk about the state house process for just a moment because it was instructive on how the rest of the process would unfold. Once the data came out that Georgia House Democratic Caucus worked to adhere to the Voting Rights Act. To the US Constitution, to the Constitution of this great state, and to the committee guidelines. We listened to what our fellow Georgia's told us about their communities. In public comments, every apportionment, town halls, at the statewide tour. After doing their homework, our members then sought to share what we thought districts should look like with the committee chair. But we were told, well, I can't meet with you right now because I'm busy drawing maps. Busy drawing maps. When the Republican House map was drawn and finally released, our members attempted to meet with the re-apportionment office to look more closely at the Republican map. But we were met with a closed door. A lock gate with a D-tor sign that said, go see the chair first. Why does a member of this body need permission from another party to meet with a non-partisan office in the general assembly? But Georgia House Democratic Caucus members asked for was an opportunity to do their job. To represent the constituents that elected them to do so, to tweak a road, to river, a highway, a chance perhaps to keep a divided community whole. That's what we asked for. But instead, we were met with another closed door, another lock gate, and this time a sign that read, no, I'm too busy drawing the maps. The re-apportionment committee, Mr. Speaker, has most certainly changed colleagues. There's no longer a joint process, a bipartisan process. It's the Republican way or the highway. And getting back to these congressional maps. As leader of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus, my responsibility is to help to ensure equity for all Georgians. To do what's right by our fellow Georgians, including Republicans in Caluita County, Democrats in Albany, and Republicans in Gwinnett, the Georgia House Democratic Caucus House map tried to do that. In the joint House and Senate Congressional map does that as well. The joint House and Senate Democratic Caucus Congressional map is a luscious of equity and fairness that Georgians asked for. However, that map before a Senate bill 2EX is not. Senate bill 2EX is a direct result of a logistic process that has not been fair to close doors, lock gates, and the implemented process to discourage participation in the democratic process of redistricting. It is both flagrant and it's disrespectful. Since this redistricting process was flawed and unfair at the onset, there can be no other result than what we see today. A flawed and unfair map. However, I believe ultimately that this unfair and flawed map will fail. Because whenever you put power over principles, given time, it will fail. Whenever partisanship supersedes the will of the people, failure will always be the result in the long run no matter what. Now, I deeply believe in the strength of our democracy and my faith in our democracy will not waver. My friends, our democracy will continue. We will make the necessary adjustments and we will thrive. Why? Because the people of Georgia are relying us to do that. You know, I was once told by a member not of our party, the Democratic party, that is. From what I've come to actually like and trust, the back of the day, when Elvis was jivrating his hips, dancing and carrying on, many people thought that the world at that moment was going to come to an end. Today, those moves wouldn't warrant a PG rating. So it may take a while for change to happen. It is sometimes slow and it can be incremental at best. Sometimes change even takes a generation to happen. Yet in this case, it might not be so long. The principles of fairness and equity will always prevail over power, principles over power, always prevails. And what principles am I talking about? We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men and women are created equal. That they are endowed by that creator with certain and ill-eulimable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That the securities rights governments are instituted among the people, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed little paraphrased. But let it be known that the people of Georgia do not. We do not consent to the majority's redistricting process. And therefore, we do not consent to these maps. Not just Democrats, but I believe George's of Goodwill on both sides of political divide. The majority party had an opportunity indeed an obligation to implement a fair and transparent redistricting process. To work across party lines from maps that are equitable for all Georgians. Instead, they chose a process of closed doors, lock gates, and impose processes to deter participation in the democratic process of redistricting. The result of flawed, unfair map sent a bill to EX. Like tyrants of oil, they changed roles at the last minute, simply because they could power over principle, partisanship over people. Georgians simply deserve better. Mr. Speaker, I yield a well. We're moving on now to the Chairman's time. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich for the Chairman's time. 20 minutes of our house rule. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a portion of my time to the Speaker of Pro Tem and followed by that a portion of my time to Representative Rob Lebrate. Thank you, Madam Chair. As a member of the majority party, I'm willing to call it for what it is. What the map before you is a fair legal map and one that clearly reflects changes in population. I'm also willing to call it out as it is on the minority party for plucking out one congressional district, whether it's the sixth, the seventh, the 14th would have you, as though it represents a complete puzzle. It's misleading and disingenuous. The sixth congressional district, for example, the one that I currently live in and will after this map is approved, is a piece of a large complicated and changed population puzzle. That puzzle, the state of Georgia, has seen shifts in population growth that drove changes in congressional maps, rippling east, west, north, and south. And yes, the sixth was short by a mere 657 persons, but the district's touching it and those not touching it required movements that the sixth and all other 13 congressional districts could not escape. For example, the first had to add 9,200 persons. The second had to add 9,200 persons. The third had to grow by 2,000. The fourth had to shed 8,600. The fifth had to shed 23,000. The fourth and the fifth, by the way, touched the sixth. The seventh had to shed 94,000 touching the sixth district. The eighth had to add 45,000. The ninth had to shed 10,000. The tenth shed, 9,800. The eleventh shed, 37,000. The twelfth had to add 26,000. The thirteenth had to shed 28,000. The thirteenth had to add 36,000. All of these changes required shifts in population, and so therefore the districts were drawn to reflect those population changes. I'm definitely willing to call it for what it is as a member of the majority party in the map before you, and the process that was engaged in was fair. It's legal. It complies with the Voting Rights Act, and I ask that you vote in favor of this map today. Thank you. Chair recognizes for a portion of the chairman's time the chief deputy whip of the majority caucus representative, Leveritt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Lays and gentlemen of the House, I'll rise to ask that you support and vote for Senate Bill 2EX to propose redistricting plan currently before you for U.S. congressional districts. And I ask your affirmative vote, even though I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the new lines it draws through my area of the state. Nevertheless, I support this bill for two reasons. First, I believe it to be the result of a fair and legal process in second. I believe that the resulting map involves a correct application of the legal principles that govern the redistricting process. As you all know, I'm new to the House and certainly new to redistricting. I was warned earlier this year that redistricting was not going to be enjoyable. As I heard it described in various ways, I concluded that it's somewhat like a colonoscopy. It's not particularly fun. You don't want to do it, but you have to do it every so often. Of course, there's one significant distinction in a colonoscopy that gives you something for the pain. To my knowledge, no such relief is afforded in the redistricting process, and if it is, I'm upset that nobody told me about it. You have to go through all this fully conscious and awake. But we don't have a choice. We have a constitutional and legal duty to perform this task. All this process is somewhat trying. I'm reminded of Winston Churchill's great comment about democracy. He said it's been said that democracy is the worst form of government, except all those others that have been tried from time to time. And so it can be said of redistricting. Not, of course, that it makes it any easier. My entire county, including me, is getting moved out of the ninth district and into the tenth. And keep in mind, I'm an age of my life where I don't particularly enjoy change. So as my congressman, he's getting moved out, and so as another county in my house district, one county, producing the tenth, will be split between the tenth and the twelfth. Another will be moved entirely out of the tenth and into the twelfth, and now the other county, which is now split between the tenth and the twelfth, will be entirely in the twelfth. This reminds me of the words in Ray Charles's song, A Fool for You, Where He sings, and then you put on your crying, like you never cried before. You even cross so loud, you give the blues to your neighbor next door. That's about the way I feel. But as other speakers have said, this is not about any one district or one or two districts. It's about an entire state of them. I prefer that things not change, but that's not an option available to me or really to any of us. As we've heard repeatedly, because of population changes, all the lines had to move north. That's not a partisan scheme. That's a demographic and legal reality. These counties that I've mentioned in my area were near the boundaries between districts, so in retrospect, it was somewhat inevitable, given the legal requirements, that those lines would move north as they did, and that some counties might thus move into other districts. So I urge you to vote for this map, not necessarily because I like the result, because I believe that it complies with the law, it complies with the Constitution, and I would much rather we not abdicate our legal responsibility, but instead decide on these congressional districts and not shift the burden to a court as in years long past. So I urge you to vote in favor of this plan contemplated by Senate Bill 2EX, because I believe that while it is not particularly satisfying to me personally, it is substantively valid and will satisfy the legal duty that we all share as a button. But I also urge your favor of consideration this bill, because I believe the process by which it was achieved has been fair. Of course, we've heard many criticisms of that process today, and at other times during this special session, concerning the procedure and process of redistricting. And I don't mean to dismiss concerns raised by my colleagues, but I'm reminded of the story about the guy trying to cost the street. After waiting some time, he sees an opportunity to make it across safely, and he steps off the curb and starts making his way across the road, across the lanes of traffic to the other side of the street. No sooner had he stepped from the curb, however, then a car suddenly came around the corner and rapidly approached. The man heard his step, but the car seemed to be changing its bearing and almost following him. He realized he was going to have difficulty making it across the side of the street, so he doubled back to go back where he left from. But the car again seemed to change course and veritorded. He then thought he could turn back toward the other side and make it across the street and avoid the car, but again the car seemed to change its heading. He realized it was headed straight for me. He couldn't get out of the way.

So finally he dropped to the ground and closed his eyes, anticipating the fatal impact of the car. And as he made peace with his maker, he heard the terrible sound of the screeching tires as they grow ever closer, and then it suddenly stopped. Although he thought he had perished, he then realized he was still alive. They opened his eyes and saw the car, just a foot or two from him with the engine still running. He stood up and walked around the driver's side door where he found the window open. First, he didn't see one of the driver's seat, but then he looked closer and realized that there was a squirrel standing in the driver's seat with his paws on the steering wheel. Squirrel stared at him for a second or two, and then said, AIN is easy as it looks, is it? So we would all do well to heed the squirrel's admonition. I ask your favorable consideration of Senate Bill 2X. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich for the final 11 minutes of the chairman's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I feel the need to come up for just a few more minutes. I doubt that I will take my entire time, but I just want to clarify the record on a couple of things. As a mother and a law professor, it is in me to want to teach and to explain things. I have been told by legislators much more seasoned that that skill, that desire, can be wasted here, can be wasted here, because many people don't really want to understand, they just want to tow their party line. But just in case there's anybody listening who really is interested, I want to try to explain something. I heard members standing up here saying that we targeted a woman of color, that we targeted a, this is a new phrase here, minority candidate of their choice, meaning the sixth district. Well, it doesn't work like that. The law requires that we draw maps that equally apportion the population among the districts, and that we give minority communities an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. It does not mean that a majority white district like the sixth that elects a minority candidate, all of the sudden gets a lifelong protection under the Voting Rights Act for that incumbent. It doesn't work like that. We don't draw maps to protect incumbents, an individual who happens to be sitting in the seat. We draw maps for the people, for the voters, for the districts. Something else I heard commentary from this well earlier that we split multiple metropolitan counties. Let me remind you of the size of a congressional district. It's approximately 765,000 people. Let me remind you that the major metropolitan counties have more population than that. I also find that it is a bit hypocritical that members of the caucus that drew a 10th district that basically eliminated it on the Eastern suburban rural side of our state, and then moved it all the way across the metropolitan Atlanta area to the western side of our state, not just the western side of our state, but into a more urban environment. I find it very interesting that members of that caucus who drew that map are finding fault with the map that we have drawn here, that respects district cores for all districts, not just the ones that are held by the Republican Party, that are Republican leaning, that respects the district cores for all districts. I also heard speech regarding a 2000 lawsuit that was referenced, and I believe that unintentionally, it may have been misstated. That was actually a Cobb County commission lawsuit that were involved with redistricting of Cobb County, and that particular map, I think, was approved by the Democratic majority here in 2000 as part of local legislation. So I just want to clarify that the Republicans in this body have not drawn a map that has been struck down or found illegal. I have to also address the reference to my canceling meetings. As many of you know, I had a personal tragedy, and I was not able to actually work on drawing the maps when I ideally would have. I also struggled with the fact that the majority of the Democrats had not met with me. So I did open up in addition to the 88 and a half hours that I had made available. I opened up another day of meetings to hopefully meet with some of those Democrat members, and I was told that there was not time then. So I apologized. I offered to meet with members multiple times, and for anybody who waited until the very last day, which actually was an extra day that had gotten added, I apologize, but I also stand here and say that you chose partisan politics over representing your district, because the 11 Democrats who did meet with me were able to inform me and educate me about their districts. They represented their constituents well. Those of you who didn't, I'll say it again, because I seem to be criticized for it. You chose partisan politics over representing your constituents. I also want to address the transparency issue. Congressional map, this entire redistricting process, has had more transparency than I believe any redistricting probably has in history, and it certainly has more transparency and public input than any other legislation that comes through this body. For this map alone, this map was largely published, there were changes, but this map was largely published over a month ago. So for someone to stand here and say that we had a committee meeting hours after it was first published, that's not very honest. We also, in my committee alone, had three days of hearings where we heard from the public, including a virtual hearing on Saturday, where we heard from every single person who wanted to speak. It's telling that of the 29 people who signed up to speak on Saturday, only 13 of them cared enough to actually show up. It is also telling that the majority of people who did come to speak at our committee meetings and at our public town halls were paid lobbyists for non-partisan public interest groups where they said the same thing at every meeting day after day. We have heard through this process that our state has a history of gerrymandering to suppress the black vote. Let me just make this very clear. For the 100 plus years that the Democrats controlled the process, yes, yes, that was true. But for the two cycles, that the Republicans have controlled the process, that is not true. And guess what? The courts have said just as much. There is a reason that we don't have a pre-clearance requirement now. This congressional map is fair. It complies with the law, the Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act, regardless of what activists and candidates for statewide office say. And I am confident that when truly non-partisan public interest and candidate, that when truly non-partisan legal scholars evaluate our work, they will affirm it. For that reason, I'm proud of this map. And I ask for your yes vote to Senate Bill 2EX. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection, Mr. Clerk, you want to ring the bill? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of Senate Bill 2EX will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 2EX. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 2EX. The eyes are 96, the nays are 68. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.
