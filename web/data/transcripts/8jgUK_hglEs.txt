TRANSCRIPT
----------
good morning everybody good morning come on in and have a seat and we'll get
started we're running a few minutes late this morning on purpose are several
things going on and I think some were still stuck in the snow or something so
we've given a few minutes to get here but good to have you all with us this
morning we'll go ahead and open up our meeting and ask Sherman Jasper's if he
would to open us with a word of prayer. Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It's all good with a Lord of Prayer. Heavenly Father, thank you for letting us
be together today and hopefully it'd be very hard to do your will, your guidance
every day, or please put your arms around the family in Glenette County, the
loss of this law enforcement officer over the weekend. The tragedy that's for
that community, please just guard them with your care. Please look after us and
keep us safe and our first responders and EMCs and a great job they did this
weekend, but thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Okay, we're going to go ahead and hear from
our folks that want to present a bill to us today. So, just come on up and talk to us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great to be here. This bill is the very last one on your sheet,
it bill 195. It's kept over from last year. Some people liked it so much. They
attached a bunch of other stuff to it and it didn't ever make it through the
process. So this brings it back with a chairman's position permission to the
original bill. It deals with pre and post medication for HIV. We have one of
the highest rates of that, particularly in the metro area here in Georgia. It
It limits it per the chairman's suggestion
to pharmacist protocol with only 10 pharmacists
with a physician so that it doesn't bring it out of state
people, they have to be a in-state physician and everything.
Bottom line is it will improve the quality of health
and from what we've seen with other states
it will save us tens of millions of dollars.
The medicines about $26 the cost of treating HIV
is about $420,000 into a million dollars.
And seeing my chairman come in from ways and means,
I do want to mention too, that I passed out 31 house ways
and means bills last year the most of any chairman.
I'm apparently way too easy in that committee
from what I hear.
Anyway, entertaining questions, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
We do have a question.
Secretary, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Hussler, thank you for being here with us.
You mentioned that last year we had needed
to put a few bills on this legislation
that they're off now?
They're off now.
I'm assuming all of them made it out of the Senate last year.
I don't think they made it out of the house,
but I'm not sure that the one in particular
never got out of the house committee to my understanding.
And I didn't add to that the department,
since we didn't get it out last year,
the Department of Public Health did do an emergency order
for the post-medicine to go ahead
and let that be available.
And there was some urgency to it at that time.
Chairman, a ways of means has a question for you.
I was just going to thank him for all those bills.
I know they, Mr. Chairman, we worked very well together.
I just wondered how many of those passed out in the form in which they left the house.
Probably about as many as ours past year committee in the same form,
but I think some of them were substantially the same.
Thank you, Senator.
Any other questions?
Thank you, sir.
Chairman Gallagher.
Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.
Bring forth two bills.
First one is House Bill 140.
It's the second one on the sheet.
This bill addresses a practice referred to as taxation by citation by placing reasonable
limits on percentage local government's general fund may be derived from ticket fines and
fees.
At the request of GMA, this bill was amended to provide a four-year implementation runway, allowing governments time to plan and adjust the revenue structures.
And additionally, as part of that compromise, the cap in this version is set to 15% rather than 10%, which was in last year's bill.
This approach balances transparency and fairness for citizens with practical flexibility for local governments and reflects collaborative work with our stakeholders.
Okay. Don't see any questions on that. What's your other one?
The second one is House Bill 522. This is a bill that addresses a narrow, very important
issue access to life-saving organ transplants. It provides that the COVID-19 vaccination status
may not be used as a sole determining factor to deny a patient placement on an organ transplant
list. If this bill becomes law of medical professionals, we'll still retain full authority
to evaluate overall suitability, risk, and clinical outcomes, and I think it's important
to call out this past in 2024, past out of the house in 2024, and ask for your favourable
consideration.
Okay.
Mr. Evans, you have a question for us, okay, go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Gullett, thank you for both of your bills, but with respect to HB522, are there
any medical organizations that have come out in support of HB522?
I don't know, not that I'm aware of.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have another question, Mr. McMillan.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
To kind of piggyback on what my colleague just asked you, is there some specific medical
or scientific data that you are relying on that will contradict what medical professionals
think are suitable, unsuitable as it relates to organ transplants?
So a number of vaccinations, we have a number of vaccinations.
A number of vaccinations aren't always included in this.
This is something as COVID has evolved, COVID continues.
Just because you get the vaccination doesn't mean
you're not susceptible to COVID similar to the flu now.
And this is not all medical professionals require this,
but some do and is solely determining,
like that's the sole determining factor.
You be every other criteria of expected good outcome
but because maybe you have a religious reason
for not getting the COVID vaccination,
you can't get the vaccine in some facilities.
And this just makes it to where that's not the sole
determining factor.
Just a follow-up question.
So I guess what I'm trying to understand is,
why are we trying to supplant the well-educated,
well-researched positions of medical professionals
about who should receive an organ transplant
and who shouldn't and what those requirements should be?
If this is, if no medical organizations have asked the state
to enact this kind of legislation,
what is the basis for it?
I think the basis is that COVID,
the COVID vaccination became a political thing.
People didn't get that vaccination.
A lady came and testified in my committee,
or in Chairman Hawkins' committee.
She was 41 years old, had a renal kidney failure,
met every other criteria.
And there's a hospital here in Georgia
that wouldn't put her on the list.
The next hospital down the street did,
but it caused a lot of strife.
She had seven kids, one was three months old at the time.
This just balances that for COVID vaccination
isn't the sole determining factor.
And I think that's, it's not really a true value
in determining whether someone's gonna be successful
by your vaccination status of getting a transplant.
But is there any other qualification other than COVID
Or, you know, I guess what I'm trying to understand
is if medical professionals make determinations
and draw lines in the sand about who is appropriate
for a transplant and who is not in your right,
this has become political and I think that's why
I'm questioning you here.
Is this, this does not appear to be based in medicine,
it does not appear to be supported by medical experts
or research.
And so this body has in the past attempted to interfere
with the decisions that trained medical professionals make.
And I guess my question is to you,
why isn't this political?
Well, I think that trained medical professionals
are called practice medicine,
just like you practice law, not all of them agree.
Not all of them agree that that's the best practice.
Some of them hold to it, some of them don't.
So this just levels the playing field for people
who've decided not to get the COVID vaccination for
whatever their reasons are and allows them to get a kidney transplant if they're
suitable in every other way. Okay, you've got a couple other questions.
Chair Cooper has a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question. It
really gets down to it. It's not the sole factor. There are many, many factors that
determine whether a patient can have a transplant or not. Whether they drink, how
long they drink, whether they smoke on the second transfer. It just says this
cannot be the sole determined because there were some places across the country that had
a knee jerk response to COVID and just gave a blanket thing if you didn't have the vaccine
you couldn't work the hospital or you couldn't do this and it prevents it when people need
a life-stating treatment like a transplant.
Thank you for that.
Okay.
Chair Martin, is that your button?
Yes, sir.
I think the chair lady covered my thing, but I'm just a regular guy here, and I'm trying to follow that last line of questioning.
Does this do anything to supplant any the Hartzscher's judgment? I don't read it, it does.
Not at all.
Is it not, in fact, just as the gentleman stated,
you cannot use this as the sole practice
if you meet all the other criteria.
That's correct.
But you can still consider it in combination
with other comorbidities or co-health issues.
Exactly, yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, no other questions.
Thank you so much.
Jim Bonner.
A good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
I've got two veteran-related bills to present.
This morning, the first is House Bill 110.
It's at the very top of your sheet.
This is a piece of legislation we worked on for the last couple of years.
It provides a state-level civil penalty for members of the title-pont industry that do,
that would do business with service members.
Currently, that protection is offered under federal law and the Military Lending Act,
but this simply adds a state-level protection
for our service members.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
What's the other one?
The next one is House Bill 985
that's towards the bottom of your sheet.
This is a piece of legislation brought
to us by the Department of Veteran Services.
This does two things.
It provides a little clarity to a bill
that we passed last year that related
to our state veteran cemeteries.
And it also adds one additional category
of folks that are eligible to be buried in those cemeteries.
And this is a, members of the lay ocean community,
the mung community, specifically those fighters
that fought alongside U.S. personnel and Vietnam.
Okay, no questions.
Thanks, sorry.
Thank you.
We have to end you.
Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you, members.
If you would look on the back of your blue sheet
second from the top House Resolution 251. It proposes an amendment to change the Constitution
that would ensure all probate judges are elected in nonpartisan elections. It also includes
a plan for this change to be approved or rejected by the citizens of Georgia. This resolution
was brought to us and supported by the Council of probate court judges, the Council of Magistrate
Court Judges, the Judicial Court of Georgia, and former Georgia Governor's Nathan Dill and Roy
barns who have co-authored a letter of support and I've attached it for your review.
Thank you.
Okay.
I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
I have two bills in front of the committee today.
I'll start with HB676.
This bill provides a fine for leans that are placed on properties frivolously.
This bill provides a fine for leans that are placed on properties frivolously because it's very specific on what it requires you to file a lean on a property and if doing so.
And without those rules in place, there would be a penalty.
Okay, go up to any questions, what's your next one?
Thanks, sir.
Next is HB-946.
This bill allows opens up options in order to hunt feral hogs, including locating them
with a drone.
This bill came from a constituent that reached out to me, had a feral hog problem on their
property.
That's becoming worse and worse in the state of Georgia.
I reached out to DNR for clarification on if they could use drones at which point we
were told they were not, and DNR asked and supported me right in this bill and carrying
it with the hopes of diminishing the pharaoh hog population.
You got a question for me.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Clifton, is this being done in other states?
That's a great question.
I'm not sure.
This was all on my help with DNRs reaching out.
I didn't look to any other states to determine how they do and don't do things.
I know there are other states that allow other ways of killing hogs, and based on the
quick conversation with DR, that's not something they were ready to do, move forward with.
So I'm not aware of what other states have done here.
If you could find out, I'd like to see a video of this.
Now, just to be clear, we're not killing hogs with drones.
We're just using them to fly around, see where they are, come back.
These drones will not be armed, they will have no way of killing hogs.
I'll be honest with you, since we're joking, I did ask DNR to consider a limited amount
of permits with this, that was denied and so we're going to stick with this right now
and maybe in the future we'll look at that.
You got a drone expert behind you, he's making it a lot in you.
Okay, speaking of experts, we got another question from Chairman Powell.
Thank you.
Sorry, you tell them, are you telling us that DNR says that you can't use a drone to locate
a pack of ferrule hogs?
That's correct. Currently, you cannot use a drone to locate any wildlife with the intentions
of hunting them. This relinquishes that to feral hogs only so that you will be able to
use Fire Emblem to look at your property. I also want to add this is just private property.
This would not be state property or a federal property. This is under private use for private
property.
And I guess if that's so, then they probably wouldn't allow us to use others to get rid of some
of these new research near populations if we've got certain courses.
As of right now, that is not in this bill to work on any deer.
This is specifically to Farrahawks.
Okay, thank you.
Chairman Martin.
When you all speak, use your mic,
hold it up close, everybody here, please.
Chairman Martin.
I just want to be clear.
So what you're saying is there are no Farrahawks hurt
during the filming of these videos.
That is correct, sir.
No ferrohoves will be hurt in the location of these.
I can't say what will happen afterwards.
Okay, yeah, I think they exhausted all the questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Now we have a drone expert, Chairman.
Todd Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Sir, I have two bills.
The first one is House Bill 987,
the fourth from the bottom on the first page.
And we've seen a transition of our workforce 15 years ago, one in six Georgians were independent contractors in some way,
not necessarily full-time, but also as side hustles.
Today, that number has increased to one in four are doing it primarily as gig or as side hustles.
This bill allows for effectively voluntary benefits to follow them and
them to be able to voluntarily take money out of the pay that they're due to go into a dedicated account that would allow them to pay for health,
on employment insurance, 401K, et cetera.
It's a great way to support the more modern workforce.
Okay, don't see any question.
What you had another one.
Thank you, sir.
The next bill is House Bill 991.
That's the third from the bottom of the first page.
This is essentially a allowing for healthcare gig workers
to be able to participate vis-a-vis a platform
where they can pick up one or two shifts a month.
And this would allow them to maintain their classification
As 1099s typically these are nurses PT's OTs. They already are W2s at another hospital
But they're picking up a shift or two during the month and this would allow them to maintain the classification as a 1099
Okay, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir
Thank you, miss chairman. I have house bill 295 three down from the top
This allows property owners to seek relief in counties or cities where the local government
doesn't enforce local ordinances in state law.
Okay, good job, no questions, thank you.
I'm sorry, excuse me, there is a question, I didn't see, excuse me, 38, represent Evans
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Gaines, I'm looking online, 94.
And it says the owner, right before that line, 93.
In an action brought pursuant to this paragraph, the owner shall not be liable to the local government for attorney's fees or costs.
And then it goes on to say that a prevailing owner shall be awarded attorney's fees and costs.
any other place in state law where we forbid a judge from exercising
discretion to root out frivolous lawsuits that may be brought by homeowners
against our cities.
Sure. So in on lines 118 through line 122, it does say if an owner files one
time and is unsuccessful and they file again, so therefore, you know, possibly a
frivolous situation. Then in that case, the property owners actually responsible
for the attorney's fees, and that's something we work with ACCG and GMA, and that was actually
added in committee last week.
But you acknowledge that a frivolous lawsuit can be the first in time as well.
Why would we forbid a judge from exercising discretion?
This body spent a lot of time trying to root out frivolous lawsuits.
Why would we tie a judge's hands in line, 93 and 94, when we acknowledge on the next
page that could very well happen, if it can happen the second time, it can happen the
first time. I'm just wondering the policy consideration behind time is
hand sure when someone first files a complain it goes through the local
government and so the local government if they award you know if they say they
have failed to hold the law then you know that's a process that's set out by
accounting commissioner city council it is a process that's already in place
now at least if the local government says no we you know we're doing things the
right way then it would go to a judge and hopefully make the decision in that
case but it's my belief that you're not going to see frivolous lawsuits what's
actually happened in places across the country Arizona past something very
similar where local governments as soon as this past began to try to clean up
some of the inaction they've seen from local governments so they don't get hit
in the pocketbook which is what we're trying to do here and make sure local
governments enforce the law. Could I have one other question Mr. Chairman
Representative Gaines, it seems that we've picked and chose, we're picking and choosing,
not sure the right grammar there, some English teacher will correct me, but we're going
to provide this right of action for owners in certain situations for homelessness and
a few other things that we've cherry-picked.
How did we determine which things we were so concerned that cities were enforcing and
which things they weren't, because certainly there's many crimes, there's many violations
of code that can happen on any given day, and it's usually an issue of resources as to
how a local government spends their time.
So number one, how did we pick and choose which things we were going to second-guess them
on?
And then my second question is, why do we think that we know best what a city and county
should be spending their limited resources on, especially when this body has put forth
legislation, I guess we're going to debate pretty soon, that risks even more of
of those limited funds that some of our cities and counties have.
So the way we came up with the issues in Blond's 42 through 48 or through 53.
One is issues related to homelessness and I think you've seen in places across the
state, you know, I live in Athens, you've certainly seen Atlanta, we've seen local governments
that have frankly not addressed the issue which is inhumane to the individuals who are
homeless.
It's also a major problem for business owners and property owners in those communities
out here at all the time, and Athens of whether it's, you know, they come to their business
and downtown Athens and someone is defecated on their right in front of their business
or whether, you know, their business is obstructed.
And so those are the, that's how we came up with those list of issues.
Another recent example was right before COVID-APD said they simply weren't going to respond
to a certain level of shoplifting in Atlanta.
And so those are some of the examples there and then certainly legal immigration is something that we want to make sure we continue
To put a strong stand in Georgia that we're not going to allow local governments to flaunt the law and not enforce
What we pass with House bill 1105 two years ago into the second question?
What was the second question?
Why are we going to
Second guess the cities and counties when they are deciding how to allocate
limited resources especially when this body has put forth measures that are
going to even further strap those cities and counties so we're essentially
saying how much money we think they should have or not have because we're
proposing legislation to change that but then at the same time telling them how
we think they should spend the limited resources that they already have and
then I guess your answer there spurred me to ask how are we going to know when
the city and county is not enforcing a policy versus when there are repeat
defenders. So on the first question is it's my belief that it is a state
government our job is if local governments are not doing their job and
not enforcing the law that we do have a responsibility to play to make
sure local governments enforce the law. So that's my belief on that issue you
may have a difference of opinion. On the second issue what was your question?
You mentioned the example of homelessness and business owners complaining
that people are luttering or they may defecate in front of a business and
things like that.
Certainly we're all aware of situations where that happens
and authorities come out and they make an arrest
or they otherwise clear the area
and there are offenders that come back.
And so how do you propose that this legislation
would help in this process to decide
when a city and county is not enforcing
versus when there are repeat offenders?
It's certainly we wouldn't want to strip,
stake in local government of funding
because there are repeat offenders.
I just want to make sure we've got something that we worked through over the last couple
of years as we worked on this bill.
And lines 30 through 32 define, you know, this is not just one one off incident or repeat
offender.
This is where there's a systematic or organized operation with local government saying
we're simply not going to enforce the law.
It also has exclusions at the end of the legislation that if it's, you know, discretion
like on a case by case basis for, you know,
and then also decisions of other elected individuals
in the county that are not,
that the County Commissioner of City Council
don't have, you know, control over.
So I think we've done a good job
of making sure this only applies in situations
where local government truly is saying
they're just not gonna enforce the law.
So there has to be a state of policy.
There has to be a state of policy
or a repeated practice or pattern of not following the law.
What determines a repeated pattern
or practice of not following the law?
When that's, again, Lawns, Lawns 30 through 32,
that's what we work through legislative council
and through GMA and ACCG and others
to try to really ensure that we specifically got
to the point because of what the issue is,
if you just said a written policy,
some local governments are putting this in written form,
but they're very actively not enforcing the law.
And so that's my belief is we've got that written
in a way that ensures that if a local government
is saying we're just not going to enforce it.
That captures that.
And again, in these situations,
if a property owner files a complaint,
and the local government says,
no, we're doing things the right way it goes to a judge,
and ultimately the judge would make that decision.
For me, if it's a broad term,
and I'm really afraid that it gobbles up repeat offenders
and not just non-enforcement,
but I appreciate the answer, thank you.
Thank you.
Senator Miller, head to the question point.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your bill.
I do have a question.
In your research that seems like it might have been years long,
did you encounter the phenomenon or the problem
where municipalities will bus or ship homeless individuals
in large scale from their jurisdiction
into jurisdictions like Atlanta?
That's my first question.
And does your bill anticipate a jurisdiction like Atlanta
being able to sue any jurisdiction
that buses their homeless up here.
So yes, that's actually something that we have seen.
And Athens, that's something I've certainly seen.
And we actually passed a bill a couple of years ago
that makes that illegal for a local government to do that.
And it also does provide relief for local governments.
And so my hope is that local governments
will actually enforce the law.
We passed a couple of years ago there as well.
And hold others accountable
that buss their homeless folks to other communities.
My second question, this is,
I just have one more, Mr. Chairman.
My second question is, how much does the state allocate
in its budget for resources to cities like Atlanta
to combat homelessness?
As you know, homelessness is not just a criminal issue,
it's an issue of jobs, it's an issue of veterans,
it's an issue of mental health, it's an issue
of overburdened social services.
So how much has the state committed
She's helping local jurisdictions combat homelessness specifically.
No, I agree with you.
It's very complicated issue.
And certainly, middle health is a big part of that,
which is we passed landmark mental health legislation a couple of years ago.
I know in the budget this year, specifically, the governor's put $50 million
specific for this purpose.
And certainly that's something that I look forward to helping implement across the state.
Combating homelessness?
That's in the governor's budget proposal is $50 million.
OK, we've got some questions going on.
I'd be encouraging you to speak with the author offline,
so we can go ahead and get some of the others to.
That's all the questions we have for you.
Thank you.
There's a camera.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
My bill is HB 350, which is number four on page one.
This bill allows for the placement of newborn safety
devices, it places like police departments and fire departments, the bill also has language
in it that provides for alarms that will sound, that will alert the fire department and police
department that a newborn is in it. There's also another system where people twice a day
have to inspect the birth, the newborn safety devices. Once a child is placed in one of
So they are taken by emulates to a medical facility.
Once they're checked out, they are within six hours required, the hospital is required
to do a surrender to the child to human services replacement.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Do you have any more, Roger?
Thank you, Chairman and committees, on the top of your blue sheet on the back page,
House Bill 1015, the state oversees a self-insurance guarantee workers comp fund for those who choose to self-insure and this is the backup system so that-
Wait a minute, what number is that?
House Bill 1015?
1010.
1010.
1015.
That's what I said.
Yeah, I was having trouble finding that one.
So the state has a self-insurance guarantee trust fund and this is a backup to make sure
that if a business becomes bankrupt, that there are funds available, no taxpayers' money,
it's those same companies fund that trust fund and we're just raising a limit that hadn't
been raised in decades so that it's adequately funded.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you.
Senator Clark.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I am presenting House Bill 960, which is number six from the bottom.
and this bill would bring a 12th Superior Court judge
to the Winnett Judicial Circuit.
Currently we have 11, we have a need for 14.2,
and we are asking for one additional,
and so that is the bill.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you, ma'am.
I don't see any questions.
Senator Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
I have Senate Bill 29, which is on the back page.
Suck it up.
This has to do with DNA collections.
Just on the front page of today's AJC,
a lumpkin county murder has been solved after 24 years
because of DNA.
This is another tool in the toolbox for law enforcement,
prosecution and defense.
not only can it prove innocence, it can prove guilt.
And this is done with just a simple swab
in the inside of the cheek.
Okay.
No seeing any questions, thank you.
Thank you very much.
A favorable consideration.
Thank you.
Last year, I mean, the living has a request.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have House Bill 999,
which passed favorably out of the Judiciary Committee,
it would allow magistrate courts to assess
or collect other fees if authorized
by a local act of the General Assembly.
It also corrects some repeal or language
in House Bill 426 from last year,
which dealt with both nonpartisan elections
and both probate magistrate court,
probate court, the conversion of the courts.
You
That is a bill that would remove a sunset on the Universal Access Fund, which is crucial
the provision of telecommunications, telephone service in rural Georgia.
It would also allow tier two telephone companies, that's basically much smaller telephone
companies that haven't opted into the fund to opt in if they do so by August, I think
it was August 1st, August 31st of this year.
a very, very crucial bill that is vital to the continued accessibility and affordability
of telephone service in rural Georgia.
Okay.
Any questions on that?
Chairman Green.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 659, which is number seven on your sheet there.
Adresse is the critical workforce in access to care needs related to optometry in our state.
The bill expands eligibility or loan repayment and financial assistant programs to include
optometrist placing them alongside our other health care professionals who serve Georgia
communities and they often carry educational debt.
We found that we stated this in the House Rural Development Committee, which it came out
of the idea that the rural areas are suffering greatly from the lack of optometrist.
We just do not have that.
And we send our optometrist in the state of Georgia to Memphis Tennessee and Birmingham,
Alabama.

there's a code section that deals with the process so if a department passes a rule
or a reg they process it would submit it then to the Secretary of State. They
the cabinet said the leg council, leg council then recommends which committees
both in the House and the Senate needs to go to those chairman look at it
