TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
You
So I'm going to ask Senator Williams, where do you go?
Oh, there you go.
Senator Williams, if you would please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I did a lot of thank you so much for many opportunities and blessings that you have bestowed upon
each and every one of us.
Please bless us all as we go forward trying to do
the work for the state of Georgia.
Please bless our men and women in harm's way
and give each of us safe travels as we go back home
and our name we pray, amen.
Amen.
We waited on one of our members come back.
So, Representative, you can come on up here
and set out if you want to.
That's why we didn't want it.
We waited on where?
Here's one and we got one coming out of this door, too.
and we're letting you go out of order because we love you.
Okay?
So remember that when we go over on that side of the bill,
okay?
So tell us the bill number and the LC number
and then you can start.
Yes, sir.
Okay?
You ready?
Can you hear me okay?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah, there you go.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
So HB607, it is an honor to be here before you today.
And thank you.
It's LC-50-0554S.
That is LC-50-0554S.
How did you turn to that?
So this is, and so virtually every house member
comes before this all-guess body. We'll say this is just a simple bill. And it is. This
is an apples-to-apples bill. So currently in the code regarding the zeal miller scholarship.
One of the requirements in addition to the GPA of 3.7, a cumulative score of 1,200 on
SAT or a 26 on the ACT. These are composite scores. So the problem is occasionally the
college board who administers SAT will change the SAT format and it no longer becomes
equivalent to the ACT. So so for the past several years the students that have taken the
ACT exclusively are at a somewhat of a competitive disadvantage. So the way the SAT is escorted
right now, the 1200 is in the 75th percentile, whereas the 26 that is in code for the Zellmiller
is now equivalent to the 82nd percentile.
So all this bill does is it allows for our student finance
to adjust the ACT to match the 1200 score on the SAT.
So it just makes it apples to apples equivalent.
I think in your packet you'll have the document that shows
what the percentiles are for the ACT, SAT.
But this is something that is independently analyzed
that our student finance president will have access to
in order to make the equivalencies.
So that's the bill.
Pretty simple.
Kind of a couple of questions.
Number 12 is.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you to the author. This is an alignment bill. Is that correct?
Yes, sir. Yes. We're aligning ACT scores to the newly
oriented SAT so that our Jordan students are not at a disadvantage. That's correct.
That is correct. Right. And the best thing about it is the student could take either
one of these and still qualify for this pro. That is correct. I think the bad news is the way
it's currently scored, they'd have to take both of them in order to be on par. So I don't
want to have to go that far, is that true?
Well, so right now, so in a baseball analogy, right now, if you take the SAT, you're basically
watching the pitcher who is giving you a hint about what he's going to pitch. So if
If you're taking the ACT, you're at a slight disadvantage.
And all this does is a line that's under the air equivalent.
You're exactly correct.
All right.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Do all schools, I know some schools look at the ACT's, some schools look at the SAT's.
What about in Georgia's different, different schools, look at different ways?
That may be something for Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I would.
If I may, Chairman.
Please.
Admissions will look at either of those scores, all right, and so admissions decisions
are partially weighted on those scores, and along with their high school academic record
and a number of other factors, but this is a qualifying for more demanding entry universities
and colleges, and certainly it will be appropriate for hope to use this as a measure to determine
eligibility.
Thank you.
Sort of more.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative, I know the intent is alignment.
But when I read the bill, I didn't really
get alignment out of it.
What I'm worried about, and if you can address my concern,
is that when we give it all to the Student Finance Commission,
that they could ultimately lower the standard
for the zeal miller scholarship.
And I want to make sure we don't do that.
No, sir. I don't think that that is not neither neither the intent nor the language as I read in the bill
The SAT is fixed so it's it is aligning the ACT with the SAT. Yes, okay. I got you all right
You do that is that is still a case. Yes, sir
You ready to go home?
Yeah, 14.
Yes sir, please.
This may be the first time I've agreed with a house member that it is a simple bill.
And I would make a motion to do pass.
And second was Senator Burns.
Okay, any discussion?
Seeing none, all in favor?
Raise your hand.
Okay.
Pass 100%.
Thank you sir.
So very kind.
You very welcome.
Sponsored.
Oh, yeah.
Who's sponsor?
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Burns.
He explained it better than I did anyway.
So thank you, Senator.
Thank you.
There was an opportunity to say something there,
and I passed it up.
Thank you, Senator.
I'll stay here, you can do it.
No.
Come on up.
OK.
Let's see, we're going to go to House Bill 228,
Representative Dipsy, who is always smiling.
I don't ever see her, she's not smiling.
We appreciate that.
Thank you.
And I think we may have a, just, yeah,
I think we may have a substitute.
I mean, let's see, let me check.
and y'all have guys in your polls.
So it should be LC 491442S.
Okay.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
You speak closer to the microphone please.
Glad to scoot this chair up.
Nice.
Aggravated.
So this measure, some of you that have been
on the committee for a while,
you've seen it several times, the underlying bill actually.
It did pass out of both the House and Senate rules last year and did not make it out on
the very last night.
The intent of this is to deal with one of the challenges that we're facing right now
in our state, comes from the final recommendations of the Healthcare Workforce Commission, December
of 22, and dealing with particularly Georgia's Healthcare Education Pipeline, the obstruction
that is there for students, the financial aid,
and the completion challenges should try.
This is the underlying bill where we started.
There have been some changes in this substitute
and I'll let each and every person speak to that
as we go forward.
But dealing with just that little bit of help
that can come when you're in a private college
or a university can make the biggest difference.
This is a school where particularly students go
for their second or third career.
They're mostly adults.
It's very diverse.
It's very fluid in how they can do it.
It is a brick and mortar institution right here
in Sandy Springs with the effort to expand
to another one in Stockbridge because they have the unique
ability actually to meet the demands of how many apply,
how many students apply.
There is not an athletic program.
There are no other courses other than to graduate
very qualified nurses so they can adapt
in a way that most schools cannot.
And the 2011 session, HB326, changed the eligibility
for private colleges and universities to qualify
for the tuition equalization grant.
The 33 schools, universities and colleges
that existed at that time, all were grandfathered in.
many are in all of the places where we live.
I know where I am, there's Barry and Shorter, both.
They teach all kinds of things,
but this focus that I'm drawing you to today
in the underlying bill is simply to expand a nursing school
and address the huge challenges we are having
in the nursing workforce.
So if you will look at the bill
and turn with me first to page four,
Section 1-4, this is the narrowly targeted amendment to the Georgia
Tuition Equalization Grant. As you look at it, you'll see that it's very
specific. It is for a qualified institution of higher education only with the
baccalaureate degree granting institution of higher education only offering
that baccalaureate program in nursing. It is accredited by the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools, or by the Higher Learning Commission, accredited
by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, with a National Council Licensure Examination
for your average passage rate at at least 85%. We've made the bar very high.
It will admit persons who have a high school diploma state approved high school equivalency
Diploma degree from an accredited post-secondary institution.
Students are eligible to participate in the Federal Pell Grant Program.
They've been reviewed and approved for operation for receipt from the funds for the Georgia
Non-Public Post-Secondary Education Commission.
They must be in Georgia.
They must have a bricks and mortar building here.
their existence in the state for at least five years.
And only institutions, baccalaureate degree program or programs in nursing,
shall be deemed to be approved in this subpart of this bill.
The school that is specifically designed for was established in February 2012.
It has been here not for five years, but for 11.
And it's very proven with a high rate of nurses, not only who graduate.
but who then sit for the nursing exam, pass it, and go straight into our hospitals and other health care facilities.
I am open, Mr. Chairman, to either take in questions about this now or if you want to go through the entire bill and let each of the other members that are bringing theirs to us.
We got one quick question from Senator Harold.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So the accreditation language on lines 49 to 53,
does that not apply to your section that you're dealing with,
but with somebody else's section?
It refers to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
That is another portion that was added here the underlying bill is what I just went over in that that section is from representative Bentley
Section ask one-ass to so Bentley about that would be better for her to explain that and other just so just for y'all's awareness of Senator Burns
has a portion at one dash three and then Senator Anivatar today
At section part two section two point one
I'll save the question for representative Bentley then thank you
Okay, is can represent Bentley come explain? That'd be great. Thank you. Please do
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee as
cheerleaded Dempsey mention house bill
bill 228, the changes, the addition to the bill from lines 48 down to 53 is what I'm proposing.
This portion of the bill will allow for institution which was previously accredited by the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools, better known as SEX, and that is now accredited
by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools tracks to be considered
and approved school for purposes of tuition, equalization grants, and this will only
impact two schools in the state of Georgia, which are Morris Brown College and Pain College
in Augusta.
And they are both HBCUs and it will allow their students to utilize the Hope Scholarship.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Bentley, I'm very familiar with the Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools, but I've never heard of the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges
in Schools.
Can you fill us in a little bit with that accreditation agency?
Well, from my understanding, Senator, and thank you for that question.
Association basically just credits those institutions like Mars Brown and
Payne College that are Christian institutions and so that's why this bill
only referenced those two institutions Mars Brown and Payne College and they
are part of the AME religious background so AME and CME yes okay if I may
further ask do you have any idea like how long this accrediting agency has
been around. I do not but I may be our about 20 years about 20 years I've been
just told. Okay says covers 90 schools in 21 states and six overseas. Apparently so
yes ma'am. Okay thank you. Thank you for the question. Senator Williams. Thank
you representative Bentley. Well let's affect the funeral business. It will
We'll help educate some people to become funeral license, funeral directors, because we know we do have a shortage in the state for licensed funeral directors and licensed in bomber, so this was certainly helping that regard.
Yes, thank you for that question.
I think I know what you're doing now for a little bit.
Thank you.
Senator, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
I have a question for Representative Dempsey.
On line is 125 through 1, really 32.
It talks about assessments.
And it talks about the local school superintendent
working in conjunction with the Department of Juvenile Justice.
And I'm all for getting these kids out of the juvenile justice system
and getting them educated and getting them employed
and getting them on the right track.
But how does a local superintendent like in Cherokee County do?
They work with the juvenile, I didn't know they had
relationships there and how that worked.
Can you explain how that works a little bit?
So this portion there is from Senator Anavatarta.
It's Senate Bill 123.
I think that you all have passed, I believe.
I'm not 100% sure if it passed out and education and youth.
And I believe he is going to be here to speak to that measure.
It is not a part of the original bill.
This became very popular today, and there are others.
And listen, I want to reiterate, I want to get these kids
out of the juvenile justice system.
I want to get them educated, I want to get them working,
and being productive citizens in our state.
I just didn't know how it's going to be coordinated.
My local superintendent's working as hard as he can
to run his schools, and I just didn't know how he was going
to be able to meet with the juvenile justice folks
and how that was going to work.
Absolutely, I believe he is stepped in the room if the chairman is Senator Annabata, I believe just stepped in the room if y'all would like for him to address it.
If we could, could we, could we finish this section before we go to, oh yeah, I'm sorry.
question. Thank you. I appreciate the author of bringing this legislation and the concept
I support it. I've been around higher ed 30 years and I'm not familiar with the trans
national association Christian College University. Is that correct? We're specifically
you're suggesting we're specifically looking at pain and mars brown are there
other colleges in Georgia that are a part of this accrediting group mr.
senator those of the only two that I'm aware of pain and if I look at their
member institution role and if I've got the right website for Georgia for Georgia
I see the Atlanta University of Health science and swanney Georgia just on the
first page. I see Bula Heights University in Atlanta, Georgia. I see the College of Athens,
formerly Athens College of Ministry in Watkinsville, Georgia. And that's just on page 104. So my
question is, would this legislation open all of those schools up for access to TG and hope?
Well, my portion of the bill, thank you for that question, only reference Mars Brown and
Payne College because they are the two HBCUs.
Could you point that out, please, where is that referenced in your legislation?
It is not actually referenced in the lines on the bill, but just in from my knowledge of
the two institutions.
The trick is they were previously accredited by SACS.
That's right.
That's the limiting factor.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
They were previously accredited by SACS.
If I could.
And Mars Brown, both of them have been now.
Previously.
Right.
And can you explain the accreditation issue with why they are no longer in SACS or choose
not to participate in SACS?
SACS is the normal accrediting for higher education.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, sure if the chairman will allow. Yes, yes, yes, please
Good afternoon members of the committee. My name is Andrew Long. I am the consultant for
Morse Brown College here in Atlanta, Georgia and for Pain College in Augusta, Georgia.
and there are nine schools I believe in Georgia
that are accredited by tracks.
The only reason why it would only apply to these schools
is because these two schools are the only schools
that were formally accredited by SACS
and now accredited by tracks.
It will not apply to EG will not be opened up
to any of the other schools that tracks represents
just Morse Brown College and Pain College
in Augusta, Georgia.
Now, the reason, well, specifically for Moore's
Brown College, poor management, poor leadership,
mismanagement of funds, they were down for 18, I think,
20 years.
But on April 26th of last year, they regained their accreditation
and they are back.
And for children, for students who are trying to attend
Moore's Brown College, which has one of the lowest tuition
rates of any of the HBCUs in Georgia,
getting that T-U-G funding would mean everything for them and their majority first-time college students,
and the generation students.
And on the new leadership as well.
And I appreciate that and let me say I'm very familiar with paying college and the challenges
they've overcome.
Yes.
And I'm very proud of them and I'm very supportive of paying.
I'm very supportive Marsh Brown.
I just wanted to clarify that we're not expanding that beyond with tracks of accreditation
because.
Right.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
And if we want to make sure we ran a right that they are both under new leadership, better
leadership now.
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks so much, better now.
Yes, ma'am.
I think we've read that several places.
Thank you.
Can I bring Senator Antibiotari up?
He'd come out behind the wall.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see you over the man.
Oh, you're good.
Yeah.
I was worried about you.
I'm going to let Michael and also Joe Ferrero, who's the deputy edge in the general talk about
this so Senator Beech's question this does touch on juvenile justice and
expanding the opportunities but also to the ASFAB piece which I know General
Cardin supports as requested for us to try and get that piece done around that
so I'm gonna let Michael come up and then last I'm gonna let Joe come up and then
Michael. Military always first. Yes or please tell us your name and what you
did. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I'm Joe Ferrero. I'm the deputy
adjunct general for the Georgia National Guard. Thank you for giving the
opportunity to be here to speak today on behalf of that portion of the bill
that affects testing for a military aptitude. So nationally 4% of service
This age youth get the ASVAB test at school, 96% then obviously don't.
This bill would allow the military entrance processing system to have access to the schools
on a broader basis to test high school students 11th and 12th graders so we can assess their
abilities and their recruitability into the military.
Another part of this that I think is important for you to know is nationally again only 23%
of recruiting age youth 18 to 24 years old in this country, only 23% are eligible to
join the military because of educational deficiencies, physical issues, and criminal involvement.
So we're down to recruiting out of a population base of 23% and if only 4% are getting tested
in high school, it really puts some roadblocks in our ability to recruit soldiers, airmen,
sailors, Marines, and now space force personnel to defend our country.
So this bill would allow the schools or would actually, the schools would give the test
for students who want to take it.
It doesn't force every kid to take it, but it makes it available for those who want
to take it.
And that helps us identify the kids that we can talk to and recruit them for a possible
future with the military.
Active duty, guard reserves.
Senator Payton has an question.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
How are you doing, my friend?
I'm doing very well.
Thank you, Senator.
Good to have you here with us.
My question was I'm looking at this and I'm having work with the Department of General
Justice for 30 years.
something's been worked out with DJJ that they're open to because this puts a lot of burden on them too.
So the DJJ part is a different section. Our section is just dealing with the military testing,
the one that I'm speaking to. So I'm sorry, so Mike here, Mike can speak to me.
Yeah, thank you.
So Senate Bill 123 and its introduced form
was an emphasis to provide students
with guidance for, you know, career college pathways
and help them be better informed
to make the best right decision for them.
The section here that we have,
spoken out in favor of, section 2-2,
deals with being able to and encouraging districts
to administer a college readiness
apt to test ACT or SAT during school time,
during school hours, at least once for juniors and seniors.
That is a policy that more than half the states
in the nation do offer, most provide that some states
have it as a requirement.
This is not a requirement.
This is optional for all students who want to take it.
The section here is just about coordinating with the superintendents and DJJ to give those
students the same opportunities to take the test, put department of education in charge
of how that coordination looks like.
I have not heard anything from DJJ in the two years that we've pursued this at any point,
raising any sort of concern about how this would operate.
The reason I ask that question is because, you know, the kids with DJJ are reserved confidentiality
for one, and so for kid in our lot, they see, I mean, that confidentiality, how do we
get past that barrier that, you know, the military or
hervers coming into assess these kids, I mean, it's not
imputing that that ability for those kids to.
Yeah, so again, this is providing those students
with the opportunity to participate in a test taking.
And again, what I should have mentioned is that
I know the ACT and I believe the SAT do offer on site testing to take place, which could
be an available option.
It doesn't necessitate DJJ to coordinate in any way that would break confidentiality.
They've got some flexibility in how they do it.
In the end, it's just a matter of making sure that that is an available course if a student
chooses to take the test.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Senator Beech.
I was told that section 2.1 and 2.2 could cost the state $5 million.
Is that accurate?
And if it is accurate, who's going to fund that $5 million?
So that's not entirely accurate.
So the 2.1 is entirely paid for by Department of Defense and there is no cost involved.
2.2 is, if you are to make it a statewide, however, as you see in section 3.1, there is
a mechanism for section 2.2 and 2.2 only that does not put an unfunded mandate on the
program and instead makes it so that it is, that this section is not in effect.
Okay.
Okay.
What's the will committee?
Oh, we've got one more question.
We've got some things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please.
Here.
I'm trying to understand who would administer the assessment?
for the military testing?
I'm good with the military.
I think you're, I think I can turn to section 22.
Yes, sir.
So 2.2, it would be administered by the school much
in the same way.
So if you think about how students, the state pays
for the PSAT, for 10th grade students, all students
and all 10th graders in the state take the PSAT.
That is administered by the school during school hours.
And this is just mimicking that for the purpose of the SAT itself rather than that.
And who developed the assessment and what is the cost of the assessment?
I can go back to Senator Beech's question online, 118, with state funding.
Yeah, so where's this, who created the assessment?
Yeah, so that is the ACT or SAT.
So you're going to administer the ACT, now again there's a big difference between a PSAT
and an SAT and a PSAT is administered in schools, SATs do not administer, they administering
colleges, universities on central sites.
I'm not aware, unless there are some large environments where an SAT would be administered
in a local school setting.
So my concern is what is the cost of an SAT?
So what you've seen, again, in most states, more than half states in the country do provide
this program, just like this, and in many cases what they would do is they would be able
to negotiate a lower price than what your sticker cost is, but the estimate is, the estimate
It is about $5 million is what I've been told.
$5 million, and what is the cost per student assessment?
And how many students are you going to assess?
So there are 150,000 roughly 11th and say-
So you're going to administer this test to every student in Georgia who chooses to participate?
They could all choose because they get a free SAT.
they could, I would hope so, that is the goal.
So in Atlanta, in APS, through a private foundation,
Achieve Atlanta, they have been doing this for,
I want to say four years now.
Why would they continue to do that if it was State Fund?
APS is only one school district out of many.
Why would any school district choose to do it?
It is in the best interest of children
to be able to take this test early.
The research shows, and that's the reason why we've been
supportive, the research shows this is a proven mechanism
to increase college going rates, to increase college
application rates, to increase college going rates
among low income and minority students,
and increases individual SAT or ACT scores
by moving it up.
So, excuse me, one more question.
Was that not the intent of the pre-SAT
to indicate the capability of a student
to pursue additional education?
That is one of the reasons, yes sir.
And so we offer, as a state,
we offer that assessment for all 10th graders.
And, but we don't offer the same opportunity for the actual test, the SAT or AC.
We got one more speaker.
Sure.
If you will, please.
Yeah.
All right.
Help me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
So, my name is Emilyona and I actually represent ACT in the state.
And so, what we can kind of speak to is, you know, as Michael has said, and he's been working
on this for a long time on the advocacy side, but from our perspective, he mentioned
over half the US is already doing this.
Really, what the goal is and what our mission is,
is ACT actually is a nonprofit and focuses on those kids
that are underserved, you know,
don't have as much access as other kids.
So what ACT does is they actually offer
for free fee waivers just to all kids
that want them that qualify.
The problem they're having is they,
the kids in rural districts, particularly not APS.
Like you said, APS is already doing this,
that's not the issue.
It's kids in rural districts, kids that are underserved
that are having to drive an hour or two hours
to go take a test.
So really the point of this bill is to allow
the school districts to offer that during school hours.
There is a funding piece that we hope, you know,
at some point could be where school districts apply
for that.
However, that's the goal right now for the bill
is to allow schools, encourage schools
and really with those local school districts
to offer it during school hours in the districts.
So that way, they're getting the same access that APS is.
You know, we can still go after funding,
but the thing about this build, too,
is until there's funding,
we will not be requiring any local school district to do it.
You know, that's only so thumb them.
There are a lot of advocacy organizations
that already do that, which is how APS does this.
Does that?
And then this would allow those, like I said,
rural districts to kind of offer that there.
And that's from our research.
You know my, Mr. Chair, I represent
a lot of rural school districts.
And I have school districts that have less than 200, 300
students in the entire high school.
They would have less than 100 students in a 11th grade
or a 12th grade.
So you've got a pool of very limited.
And that's why they tend to go to more consolidated testing.
And I am concerned about administration
in an environment where they're very low numbers.
Yeah, I can only speak for ACT's perspective here,
obviously on behalf of them,
but for my understanding, they do this, like I said,
they're doing this in many states that are very rural
and for them to provide those opportunities for kids
on the college admissions, they're kind of fine with that.
I will say that in most school districts,
it's actually administered by teachers
and we have talked to a lot of the districts
if this would be a burden on them as well,
just to be clear and we have not.
And to them, they don't see it as a burden
because it's providing that opportunity.
The other piece I just want to mention too is,
is I know we also know every kid's not going to go to college
and that's why we wanted to make sure
there was a workforce credential
that offers those opportunities for as well
for other students as well.
Yeah, my apologize Ms. Chairman,
but my experience with administering these tests
on a college campus is the ability to validate the student
I'll validate the student and proctor the exam
in an environment where there's assurance
that that student's evaluation is valid.
I would say that that's gonna be a difficult challenge
if you ask a classroom teacher to evaluate
her students or his students and I have just concerns.
And if my math's right, we're looking at about $30, $35
per student, is that about right?
Yeah, it really said that this would go
a disc from like I said again from ACT's perspective this it depends on how so
this would still be like a local control situation in most states so the
district would contract with college board or ACT or for workforce credential
whatever that is and you know I think that that's probably on average but I
think that price depends on what that contract looks like just to be clear
but to your to your numbers that seems right I would say the average like I said
test for an ACT is around that. 35 to 40. 35 to 40 dollars and 150,000.
So yes, but like I said, they do offer those free fee waivers for kids that qualify, which
that's really important, and then to understand. And then like I said, there's the idea that
it is we want to make sure this is opt-in, not so that way, you know, we're assuming
not every kid's going to take one of these tests. But that is maximum number, yes, sir.
Sir, the bill. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. So when I graduated high school in 2012, so I guess
10 years ago now, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disrupt the committee. I even sold now, sir.
And I went to a very rural school. I think there were like 140 people in my class.
I'm not as real as some, but I remember taking this test in the cafeteria we were all brought
in and someone from the Air Force was there administering it. I'm not sure what capacity
that person was in. But if we're going to spend $5 million, where does that $5 million
go? Is someone profiting from this? I mean, that would be for the, that is if you do
for the college admissions test or the career readiness assessment and that's just like
because that's a rough number,
but that would actually go for whoever's gonna admit,
like who's providing the test.
And then there's gonna be a voucher for people
to take the ACT or SAT, is that part of it?
So all that would be decided out at a district level.
So a local school district essentially would purchase
a contract, they would do an RFP process
for with who's gonna provide that test,
as my understanding.
I think for what you're talking about
when the military testing and I let Joe speak to that,
that's a little different than the college admissions
and career readiness, but thank you, Senator Moore.
So about the ASVAB testing, we'll call it,
but it's not called out specifically
as ASVAB testing in the bill,
but it's military vocational testing.
That is provided by the military.
That is no cost to the school, no cost to the student.
That is handled through the military entrance processing
system, MEPs, and they're the ones who send out
the Air Force sergeant or an Army sergeant
or whatever to proctor and to give the test.
So that is no additional cost to the state,
the school, anybody.
That's just giving the MEPs personnel more access
to the school and the students to test them
because I had the same thing.
We got sent to the gym and the sergeant gave us the test
and they went away with the results.
And then if you wanted to, you could mark
that the recruiter could call you.
And then if you mark that, then they would call you up
and see what they could do to work with you.
So I'm further confused now.
So what exactly is this section of the bill doing?
So two dash one just gives, right?
As I mentioned earlier, only 4% of high school students
now get the test at school.
Most of the kids, we recognize that the military
going into other schools.
Because they're not allowing us in.
So this bill would allow us ready or access
to go in and test them.
It's changed a little bit since you and I took that test
or the schools open the doors, it just hasn't happened.
And so this would open the doors for these
meps personnel to go in and give the test
only to the kids who wanted to take the test.
So this section is mandating the schools
allow the men?
It allows the meps personnel in.
Yes, okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Very good.
Turn it back.
We got some other presentation.
What the world could be on this?
I'm not ready to make a motion table.
Okay, about that.
Second.
All in paper.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, hold on, okay, we got speakers.
Okay, Senator Harrell.
No, shouldn't, right?
At the proper time, I'd like to make an alternate motion.
All right.
Can I get a clarification?
Yeah, of course.
There's a point of clarification.
So we have a multi-section bill.
If I understand correctly, section 1.1-2,
House Bill, House Bill, what is the House Bill number one?
228, 228, did that bill go through the house and was it adopted?
1.2 was not part of 228.
641.
641.
And did that bill go through House Committee and was it acted on by the House?
This year it did not last year
if identical linguists passed a house in that room.
Got you, thank you.
All right, thank you.
And then I know that section one-dash three
is Senate Bill 137.
It passed this committee.
It was adopted by the House,
and it was in the House higher ed recently.
So we know that's been vetted.
Section one-dash four, what is the house bill?
It has passed.
It has passed.
It is the original underlying bill
that was sent over here.
And it's the number is what we're working on.
228, yes sir.
Okay, and as section 2-1 is
Senate bill 123 is that correct and I'm sorry all section 2-1 and 2-2 or just to or just
1 and 2 and
House bill 123 Senate bill 123 could make me right sorry jace and and did it go through committee has been to the floor
It was ready for a full vote.
All right, and then section 3-1 is just, thank you.
Thank you for clarification.
Thank you, Senator.
Let's hear from you.
Well, prior to making an alternative motion,
it seems like there are a couple options
besides tabling the entire bill we could strike part two or we could in a couple
of places change shall to may in part two. Is there any discussion about those
two ideas? Well we will have at least one meeting next week and we'll probably
have to. So I think you still have some clarity to this that we need to have. I'd rather
force the period over, we apologize, but I'd rather force the period over to clear up some
things. And I think we got a motion and a motion and a second table to write. Okay, so
is that okay? Yes, ma'am.
So you're proposing we table it now, but take it off the table at another meeting in a few days.
We'll definitely have it at least.
We'll have it at least one meeting next week and we'll try, we're going to try to have two.
So we'll definitely bring it back at one of those.
It will be the number one on list.
Is that okay?
Thank you.
All in favor of that?
Raise your hand.
100%.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank y'all for your time.
We're now, I don't see a representative guest here.
Yeah, I see Kim.
I was Senator Jackson.
Okay.
We're going to go on and start with Senator Jackson.
And she has...
Okay.
I didn't know who to go.
They went out of order.
If he shows up, he died of heat.
Thank you, Stucky.
Yes.
I think we could be amenable to coming to some compromise around that chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and we are working off of Senate Bill 264, which is LC-5-0-0-5-1-0.
All right, thank you, and I want to begin by thanking the Chairman for allowing us to have
this hearing.
This is such an important conversation for us to begin, and so as you can see from the
sign up list there are many people who are very much interested and invested in this issue.
So very briefly what this bill does is that it allows people who are resettled here in
Georgia via a special immigration status.
So what we're talking about specifically are people who served and helped our military
in Afghanistan.
who have been clearly on our side
when it's come to those wars.
They've come here with special immigrant status.
And this bill will allow them to receive in-state tuition
upon being resettled here.
I think it's important to note that none of those folks
that have come here have come from another state.
They don't have another state
where they could get in-state tuition, right?
Oftentimes, this is what we're thinking about.
We're like, oh, we don't want somebody who lives
in South Carolina say where they could good in-state South Carolina tuition, we don't want them
coming to Georgia and getting our in-state tuition.
For people who come here who are resettled by our federal government, folks who have been
our friends, who have gone through extreme amounts of trauma and yet still been dedicated
to this country, people who are resettled here, this is their home state.
This is in-state for them.
And so this bill would allow those who have a humanitarian parole status, a special
immigrant status, to be able to continue their education and to do that in a way that's
affordable by receiving in state tuition.
If, with that, there are a lot of people who signed up and so I'm happy to yield as much
time to them if that would be helpful, Mr. Chairman.
Can I ask a quick question?
please. I think maybe Senator DePain and I had a conversation about
Dalton, Georgia, and the Hispanic population of Dalton and so forth and
the parents of refugees but children. I guess the children are also refugees in
the school system up there and costume when they graduate from school system.
They don't qualify for any state tuition. Is that a part of all this? So actually
So that's a separate bill and so in one certainly that I hope that many of us would support
in the future.
So the children that you're referring to often have DACA status so they are children who
came with parents of their known, no of court of their own, right?
These children are, these young adults, these are young adults or children, they are coming
here with legal status from day one.
They, on day one, not only did they come here with legal status on day one, they were picked
out, right, from Afghanistan, from the countries that they were, and recognizing knowledge
as having either assisted the U.S. military, as interpreters, or being people who are
extremely in danger of being harmed because of their support to the U.S. military.
So these folks arrived on day one with legal status in our state as a special immigrant.
Whereas the folks that you're talking about don't have legal status.
So this bill would be very clear and very specific to folks with legal status to be here in this state.
And this is their home.
Sir, a pint.
What does apply to my question is because I'm in my military, I remember we had a gentleman
that was actually from Nicaragua and he was serving in next to us in the first 5th, 4th,
5th, 8th, 2nd Airborne Division and I come to realize since then that we have a lot
of non-citizens that are serving in our military and for those who are living here this would
allowed them if they were living in Georgia and stationed at Fort Benning and that would
have been allowed those to access.
I'm going to bring in my specialists here.
I don't think that's accurate.
I have a different bill to allow those folks to become peace officers in our state.
But this is Darlene Lynch.
She really is my expert who can answer that question definitively.
So again, tell us who you are and who you represent.
I'm Darlene Lynch and I'm a lawyer here in Georgia and I represent the business and
immigration for Georgia partnership.
It's a partnership of refugee and immigrant serving agencies in the business community.
And so to answer your question, as Senator Jackson said, it's not possible to become eligible
after you're here.
You have to be admitted to the United States as a special immigrant visa holder.
So an interpreter from the Garagua would not have that ability.
They have to be from Afghanistan or Iraq.
However, if they were a humanitarian parolee approved before coming to Georgia, yes.
Okay.
So this is specifically for those in Afghanistan or Iraq.
And for others who have humanitarian parolee or other special immigrant status, it's not
something you can do.
The reason I identified that because this was the ladies in the town, Nicaragua was alright.
And that was always one of those questions.
He fled Nicaragua in a very tough time to enjoy the military, to serve our country.
There's a mole.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, so I'm just trying to understand what a special immigration status
is.
And if I read it off the U.S. citizenship and immigration services, Homeland Security
website, it says special immigrant is a non-citizen who qualifies for a green card after meeting
certain criteria.
So it doesn't say anything about assisting the U.S. or the state of Georgia for that
matter.
Do you want to say something?
So this bill addresses three categories of people.
Refugees, I think most folks are familiar with the U.S. refugee program that dates back
from the Vietnam War and Georgia's program dates back four decades.
Special immigrant visa holders are there's three programs that the U.S. government have
set up.
The oldest program they're all referenced in the bill would apply to interpreters from
Iraq and from Afghanistan who served as interpreters or translators for a certain period of time
and applied for an SIV and then came here.
The more recent programs, there's another one for Iraqis and the most recent one for Afghans
who had supported or acted in a trusted role with the U.S. government.
They have to get approved by the head of mission and then they apply for an SIV permit.
They wait many, many years up to three years now to get that and then they come.
So all three of those SIV programs are for people who supported the U.S. military or
the U.S. mission in those countries.
And then the last program is for humanitarian parolees.
And just to hopefully alleviate some of your concerns, we do spell out the exact code
section in the federal law if you look in lines 19, starting line 18 through 22.
So we're not talking about just special immigrants, but we do specify the exact
types of special immigrants that mislead just a attorney council and it's just for
to burn to. Okay yeah I certainly have to go read those. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you to the author and to those who support the
legislation. I certainly support the concept I think it's it's a worthy for us to
acknowledge the service of those who helped our country. A few quick questions.
Are other states offering similar benefits could you could you could you share that and kind of give me an idea of what other states might have
Chosen to do. Yeah, so there are other states and your Tennessee specifically
Consulents might be able to add some more
So some of this is about clarifying the law if you if you look there there is a sentence
I'll see if I can refer to the line where the Board of Regents is given some
Opportunity to determine so if you look it on
I think line, starting line 12, 12 through 14, the Board of Regents has some leeway already
written into the law.
And so in other states like Tennessee, they've actually chosen to interpret that those
who come as humanitarian parolees, who come with these S.R.V.s, the fair that they qualify,
they didn't necessarily, they've interpret that and decided to have that kind of generous
read already.
So I know that's one example, if Councillor Litch can offer more.
Right, and so different states are doing it different ways, but right now there are 10 states
who pass similar legislations, and some of them include Colorado, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin,
Vermont, both Democrat, Republican states, and right now there are five pending, including
in Utah as the most recent one, similar legislation to this bill.
Thank you another follow-up Mr. Chairman, how many students do you feel would be a part of this qualifying group?
Yeah, thank you so much for that question and that's something we were trying to kind of get a hand handle on them
We're not 100% sure where we believe there'll be somewhere in the hundreds so
We're not talking we're not talking thousands at all. We're talking somewhere in the hundreds
And then one more I apologize, Mr. Chairman
But have you had these discussions with us G and TCSG?
Absolutely, and those are they, they're response, how do they feel about it?
We're continuing in those conversations, so those discussions have been ongoing.
This legislation, I think the fact that we're having this conversation, this is a bipartisan
piece of legislation that many of you on the majority side have signed on, I think will
help us in that conversation.
It would impact their tuition, but I recognize that
They just need to be a part of the conversation. That's all right, and they are they absolutely are would you like to add to that?
Okay, thank you. This chair. Okay. What one would bring up a couple of speakers. Let them let them have about a minute and a half each
And so I'll let you choose
Do you have the lists? I do actually. I've got another one
I think if we'll have Jonas come first yeah we'll begin with darling and then we'll
have you know where do you want them to testify for Mr. Chairman yeah where would
you like do you want them to do it from here oh sir Roger yeah yeah okay thank you all
and for the opportunity to share our support for this bill.
And thank you for the sponsors of this bill on this committee.
Again, my name's Darlene Lynch, chair of the Business and Immigration for Georgia Partnership.
I want to start by saying this bill arose out of months of work on the house side of a bipartisan study committee on how to maximize Georgia's global talent.
And what we recognized is that one in ten Georgians is foreign born today, one tenth of
our population, one seventh of our workforce is foreign born.
And yet we have so much talent that we have yet to tap.
And so the Global Talent Study Committee looked at what are the barriers, how can we remove
those barriers.
And the number one recommendation was to address the barriers to admission to Georgia
public colleges.
That was the number one recommendation for really strengthening our workforce.
And every member of that committee, both Republicans and Democrats, sponsored the bill, the
version of the bill you have before you today in the House last year.
And that was HB932.
So today we continue the work.
And we have a companion bipartisan bill in the House as well.
And that bill sponsored by Representative Holcomb and Hitchens, both U.S. veterans.
So there's a lot of support for this bill.
We've been doing a lot of education around this bill.
And as I said, it's part of a national effort to recognize the support that people from
other countries have given to our country overseas.
I just want to clarify a little bit about Georgia's history in this regard.
Georgia has a-
Thirty seconds.
proud history dating back four decades of welcoming refugees.
They're vetted screened and approved by the U.S.
and then resettled with the state of Georgia's help.
We have a state refugee program.
And so we resettle a few thousand people every year,
including many children and youth
who had their education disrupted.
The bill makes a very small change, as we said,
to ensure that they are treated as in-state students
as soon as they are resettled here,
because they have no other state to go.
I'll end by saying this bill addresses several challenges
at once.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, that's it.
I'm sorry.
Okay, thank you.
All right.
Kim, what would you?
Yeah.
You know, next up you.
Thank you, ma'am.
I appreciate that.
Give us your name and what you do.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Kim.
Senators, thank you. My name is Jonas Abraha. I am the co-chair for CRSA, which is a coalition of
refugee resettlement services agencies. So CRSA helps the refugee when they arrive here,
and the coalition has about 23 different organizations. And before that, if you allow me,
I would just sit in here thinking, if this would be an opportunity where I come from,
I would not have been refugee.
So thank you for that.
Because most of us in that refugees live in our school,
our family, everything behind,
because of this opportunity democracy that offers.
So for that, thank you.
So our organization, our coalition supports this bill.
The reason we support this bill is,
as soon as some of the agencies receive,
they welcome the refugee when they arrive here
at the Alana airport.
This is the first airport that they come.
Once they come to the airport, the first thing they ask is,
if they left their school, I want to continue my education.
I want to continue my education.
Because by doing that is the way for them
to give back to the country that has given them opportunity.
And for us to tell them, you can't afford it
because you are considered out of state.
It's very difficult to explain that
because this is the only state that they have.
And a lot of them, they have, especially like the Afghans,
and now the Ukrainians.
They have left, like they have certification
that they need in order to continue with their career.
So for all that reasons, we say, this is a fair bill.
This is a necessary bill that we needed.
Because Georgia is one of the best state.
I came as a refugee.
I'm an Air China refugee.
I came here, went to Kroski High School.
I went to Australia.
I went under my undergrad.
I like it so much there.
I got my master's from West Georgia.
I was even thinking about becoming a professional student,
which was not possible, but I like Hamilton.
So for that, most of Georgia's, you know, they help us.
For me, for example, my school, for my teachers,
all those things I would not have gotten.
So we, as the coalition, we are asking for this bill
as soon as possible if it's possible.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Senator Jackson, one more person.
Just one?
We're right now.
It's great presentation.
We appreciate it.
I'm sure this guy's fixed here.
He didn't miss it up now.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
It's honor to be here and talk about the positive impact.
Tell us your name and the specificity of this bill.
I'm Hacena Lekuzai, one of the new
to the Afghan refugee in Georgia.
I've been here for one year and my family
relocated here after the Taliban takeover the country.
Most of my family members are here
and we are all excited and motivated
to track our career back here.
And also we are excited that what the youth provide for us,
especially for me as a woman from Afghanistan.
Before the Taliban sees in Afghanistan,
the number of children out of school were 3.7.
When the Taliban sees in Afghanistan,
the Taliban ban women from education,
so the number moved to 6.2 million people for children.
Today, Afghanistan is the only country
that for better than it is half of its population
from education, which are girls and women.
So the new residual Afghan in the USA
are the only hope of my country.
I'm optimistic that one day delayed the country,
the break the chain of human right violation
and this inequality in my country.
However, beginning a new life in USA is not easy.
We face many challenges.
Since coming to USA or to Georgia,
I have been looking for opportunities
to obtain my master degree in public health in Georgia
and also to support my family financially at the same time,
But I couldn't make this in Georgia.
So I didn't give up.
And I have been, I began looking for opportunities
and other state.
Happily, I made it.
And now I'm awarded the prestigious scholarship
of Pedro Salama with the School of Johns Hopkins School
of Public Health.
So I'm leaving Georgia.
But I'm optimistic one day I can be productive
to the economy of this country,
or my second homeland.
Thank you, ma'am.
Great, thank you.
Thank you so very much for being here.
Senator Burm.
Just a quick question, please.
First, thank you.
Thank you for coming, and thank you, Sharon.
Where did you, what is your undergraduate work in?
So I did my undergraduate in Kabul Medical University,
BSPH was the Bachelor of Public Health.
And then I start working with Ministry of Public Health
of Afghanistan, and then I continue my career
with UNICEF for United Nations Children
and Emergency Fund as a Nutrition Officer.
And I work with the Nutrition Emergency
and the Olimin Programme for around five years.
Thank you.
And currently, are you employed?
Do you have the opportunity to work?
Yes, I'm working as an interpreter
with the Department of Public Health of Georgia,
with the Department, yes, thank you so much.
Thank you.
We did the Cove County Board of Health Refugee Program.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you, thank you for the time.
Thank you, Senator Burns, for your question.
Just to one moment.
We have one moment.
One more please.
One more speaker or may I close?
No, one more speaker.
Yeah, I will, great.
I wish we had more time.
It's a very interesting, but we don't.
No, that's okay.
David?
David?
If David Garcia from Galleria?
Tell us your name and tell us where you come from
and tell us what you're doing now.
Sure.
Thank you for having me.
I'm David Garcia.
I work for an organization named Galileo Impact Fund,
and we advocate for the Latino Hispanic community
throughout Georgia.
I'm also a first-generation US citizen.
Georgia resident, college graduate, and military veteran.
I graduated from Mary at a high school,
enjoying the Marine Corps shortly after.
I served as a US embassy guard in Peru, China, and Serbia.
And I also worked as a contractor for the U.S. Department of State
in Mexico, Bosnia, and Iraq.
And throughout my time in service,
I had the privilege of working closely alongside many
host country nationals who were vital to advancing
U.S. interests worldwide.
During my time in Iraq, I routinely worked with many young
Iraqis who had committed most of their lives
to supporting our efforts there.
And their support, warmth, and commitment to our mission
was vital to our success.
And the same can be said for the thousands of Afghan citizens
who supported our efforts out there as well.
I currently live in Decatur, Georgia,
which is very close to Clarkston,
where I volunteer with many refugee serving agencies,
including Clarkson Community Center,
Refuge Coffee, Friends of Refugees,
and Clarkson United Methodist Church.
I've met many refugees and special immigrant visa holders
in Clarkston who served alongside US forces in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
And according to the US, according to the Atlanta History
Center, more than 1,500 Afghans have resettled in Georgia
over the past two years.
To me, this bill is about supporting
a group of people undergoing major life transitions.
And I can relate to many of the challenges that they face.
Adjusting to life after living abroad
is very difficult.
My first year back in the US, after serving abroad,
was very challenging.
And having structure is key and transitioning
successfully, higher education and the opportunities that come with being a student on college
campus can help immensely in easing one transition. And I think that making higher education
more accessible for a group of people who have supported our country and our foreign
policies is the least that we can do. And I ask for your support in this bill.
Time and it was just right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your service. I'm
appreciate it. Thank you. Yes, sir. We have sort of hostile. I could do this later, but I guess
I want to make one point. Obviously, it's financed your working incentives and trying to get people
trying to make the state better. The biggest problem we have in the state right now is workers.
The limiting factor on our economy in Georgia is workers and these people are here legally.
So I'll stop there.
Thank you.
Senator Orton.
Thank you.
I certainly was going to start with Mr. Chairman with the point of our work for shortage.
But number two, we've heard from the chancellor of our great university system about the decline
in enrollment and the need he speaks urgently in our budget hearings of the need to step
up enrollment figures in our university system.
And so we certainly have the slots there, and I think the case has been strongly made,
a meritorious case for moving ahead with this initiative.
And let's catch up with Tennessee.
Thank you.
I think Senator Williams has a statement.
No, that's what you've been on.
Yeah, I was pretty.
What number are you?
Let me just get Senator Jackson, thank you so much.
I wish I could listen to this for a good long time.
I appreciate your passion.
I know the committee appreciates your passion, isn't it?
Thank y'all for being here.
You know, let's move it forward
not next week but next session, okay?
Man make one closing statement.
Yes ma'am.
So I do want to thank you so much for having this hearing.
I want to acknowledge that there's a family that's come here
that's from Ukraine.
They came to witness our democracy
be a part of this conversation and so I understand we're on a time limit but I
want to at least acknowledge their presence and and I do hope that we can
continue this conversation thank you so much thank you thank you all very
much 13 yes sir I'd like to make a motion we take 228 off the table and we go

I revised it and in the motion that he recognized I'll start with section 2.2
too. Alright line 1 0 15 starting with land 1 14.
Three 1 3 we got around
into the 1 35 1516.
One 36 Yeah.
Okay yo y'all yo yo hold on
please hold on very please.
Okay, so we'll go all the way through 147, okay, because part three only applies to section 2.2.
Oh, thank you for the definition.
Okay, let's regroup, but I don't know everybody.
All right.
Thank you.
You want me to restate the motion?
Everything.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We'll go on to talk real slow.
Exactly.
Talk, talk, talk, talk like you're talking to a family about what you're going to do.
Okay.
Like you're explaining the bill to us.
Senate bill, bill 228, LC 491442S, I would like to amend that by striking lines
one-fourteen through one forty-seven. Okay. And I'll second that. Okay, hold on just
say it. Is everybody okay now? I'd like to make another name. Yeah. Hold on just say it.
Yeah, we got to do it. Oh, so does everybody know what he's talking about now?
I'm sorry.
Senator Bates, do you follow me?
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir.
So do we take, do you have an amendment?
You have another amendment?
Well, I'm sorry.
To my understanding, Mr. Chairman, I mean there's the issue with 97 through 113 is just another additional mandate to my understanding.
So, I mean, I understand your amendment, but what is the purpose?
What are you trying to accomplish with that amendment?
Well, I'm going back to the original bill, and I'm just taking out this other part from
this section one, lie on one fourth thing, getting rid of the juvenile justice part that
will just have to be cleared up.
So I'm just going back to the original bill.
We have a shortage of nursing and nurses, and that's what this bill was originally for.
And the military part.
You leaving it in?
And the military part.
Yeah, help you.
It does.
Okay.
Okay.
So you want to keep your memory, you want to strike your memory.
I don't think he had on the memory. He was just out of issue with my memory.
Yeah, I'd like to add lines 97 through 113 as well.
So that would be a second proposal, remember? Okay. Any discussion?
I have a question.
I could ask John.
Please.
Point of order.
I don't think you have to.
At least first I didn't.
We can make.
Is there right?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What is the thing?
This is a symbol for the moment.
First time.
And then I think it was originally a second.
Before I said it, I was in the middle.
I will be fine.
Okay.
So we do.
I'm sorry.
Wait for first.
Okay.
You will vote on the center of Williams amendment first and that is to again
House bill 228 LC 491442S and your amendment would be to strike lines 114 team
three one forty seven that's correct okay everybody everybody know what
that is okay so that's your motion have a second and Senator
Haas set a second all in favor raise your hand
All but Senator, Senator Harold, you vote, vote against it.

Okay.
Okay.
All in favor.
I just want to clear it up.

Senator Moore.
Okay.

He made a second.
Second.
What is his amendment?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to amend LC 491442S by removing sections or lines 97 through 113.
I'm sorry, 95 through 113.
Second.
We have a second.
Senator Boerner.
Just a question for the senator. Is your concern on lines 101-104-106 and 108? The word shall
Do you see this as a mandate?
That's correct, Senator. So again, wouldn't it not be beneficial to allow this to happen?
Well, you're mandating it to happen. I understand that but the question is would it be beneficial to allow this to happen?
I'm not so sure it would I think it would be yeah I would ask it instead of striking these terms that you consider an option
Well, I think the only other option name would be may and if it's just may what's the purpose and having it in the legislation
They can't if they want to now they can't if they want to now
So that's that was my question center. That's unnecessary ink and paper. Thank you very much
Okay, so we got a motion in a second to strike lines 95
through one-thirteen, correct? We all together on that, okay? All in favor? Raise your hand.
One, two, three, four, five. Okay, all opposed. One, two, three, four. It's like your motion
Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, um, doing also that we also carried so we're so in essence what this means we have now helped me out.
We've now voted and approved the strike lines 95 through 114 and then 114 through 136. Is that correct? 147. 147. 147. Yeah. Is that correct?
Yeah, so all in favor of all that raised in, okay, that's a man, that's a man, that's
a man.
No discussion.
