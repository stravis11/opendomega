by the lady from the 93rd House District Representative Darshan Kendrick. Representative
Kendrick.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues. It is my pleasure to introduce my friend
and constituent and passed their pastor, Lee May.
But first, I would like to introduce my first lady,
who could not be with us today, Robin May.
And she is a friend and constituent as well.
Pastor Lee May, the second, is a former elected official
in Decalc County, Georgia.
Many of you know, he served as the chief executive officer.
He was first elected as commissioner in 2006.
He served in that role until he was appointed
interim chief executive officer of DeCab County by then governor Nathan Deal in 2013.
He is a graduate from Emory University's counter school of theology, holding a master's
a divinity degree, and of the historic Clark Atlanta University with a degree in business.
He is a former small business owner having owned an independent movie theater located
in Lithemia Georgia, he is also the author of My God, My Politics, a discussion on faith
and politics.
He answered the call in 2017 with his wife, Robin, to start transforming faith church,
a wish I am a member, and it was launched in the heart of the Cap County Georgia.
He spends most of his time with his college sweetheart, Robin, and their three children,
Ryan, Reagan, and Riley.
And before I bring him to the podium, I do have a small confession for the pastor.
So when we got sworn in a couple of weeks ago, I forgot my Bible and I have a very nice
Bible that was signed by the speaker and it was monogrammed and everything.
So I had to get sworn in on the Bible app and I'm hoping that that, I'm hoping that
that counted Mr. Speaker.
So that is my confession publicly to all of you.
but y'all continue to pray for me.
So without further ado,
I would like to bring my pastor, pastor, Lee May.
Only because it's you.
You know they say confession is good for the soul.
It's such an honor to be here with you all on this morning,
hadn't been in this room in quite a while
and I do count it an honor and a privilege
To be able to say just a few words to you of inspiration, of devotion, and hopefully clarity
as you continue to do the work of the people.
And as my State Representative, Darshan Kendrick mentioned, as you swore, many of you with
your hand on the Bible, that you would do the business of the people with integrity as
well.
I want to thank my State Representative, Darshan Kendrick.
She is my state representative, so I have to take a little personal privilege.
I believe I have the best state representative in a nation.
And hopefully your constituents say the same thing about you.
No I love our representative and she is a member of Transforming Faith Church, a church
we started, my wife and I approximately three and a half years ago in the heart of
Decatur where it is greater and and such it is an honor to be here to our speaker David
Ralston. Thank you for your your leadership and your friendship over the years and
Minority Leader James Beverly congratulations and thank you for your leadership as
Well to the decap delegation. Thank you all many of you all for your friendship
and for your leadership for our wonderful county. I see so many of you all here on
this morning, I'm so pleased to be able to stand before you. I have just a few words
for you this morning that I will hopefully help you today and throughout the remainder
of your time in session. You know, there's two scriptures I really want to highlight here
this morning. Two scriptures that have brought clarity for me in my role when I was in public
service for almost 12 years and still continues to drive me now as we do the work of leading
a congregation in Decap County. Two scriptures, scripture number one, Matthew 6 and 21. Many
of us know this scripture and we repeat it. Even if we're not people of faith, even
if we're not professing Christians, many of us know this scripture because it really
is telling and it's really apropos to us all in our daily life. And it says this,
So where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
You know, as my understanding that the governor has delivered his budget to you all, and
as you begin to deliberate over the resources, the money of the people, and how they will
be allocated, my prayer is that you will keep this Scripture and the heart of your bosom
that you will continue to repeat this scripture
and that you will keep atop of mine
as you try to determine how you will use these scarce resources
to deliver resources to people that are desperately in need.
You know this concept of heart and treasure is very similar
to another concept in the New Testament in the book of James
that says faith without works is dead.
faith without works is dead. They go together. And what are those two concepts really saying?
They're really saying this, that your words really must match your actions, heart, treasure.
If you say this is what is important to you, then it ought to be a reflection in how you vote,
how you deliberate over the budget, what you are fighting for each and every day. Your heart ought
to be a reflection of your treasure, your faith ought to be a reflection of your works.
And so as so many people are tugging on you, as constituents are tugging on you, as paid
lobbyists, and unpaid lobbyists are tugging on you, as your local city and county officials
are tugging on you, asking for money for their needs, I want you to continue to think
Think about your heart, your treasure, your faith, your work.
Scripture number two is this.
It comes from the book of Proverbs and my prayers that this will be wisdom that you will
continue to take with you.
It is in Proverbs chapter 31, last chapter of Proverbs, this book of wisdom.
And it is words of wisdom from a mother to her son.
Some call it mother wit, a mother giving wisdom to her son.
Now her son happened to be a king, king Lemuel, and in verses 8 and 9 it says,
is speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
for the rights of all who are destitute.
Speak up and judge fairly.
Defend the rights of the poor and needy.
My prayers that you will think about those
who may not look like you, may not talk like you,
may not have the same background
as you may not share the same party affiliation
as you may not share the same skin tone
as you my prayers that you will think about those
who look like you and those who don't look like you as you are doing the people's business,
that you're speaking up for those who are in need.
We all ought to listen to the wisdom of our mothers.
We all ought to work on behalf of the people that are put us in this position all throughout
this great state of Georgia.
And I'm so thankful that I live in Georgia with a great leadership, a body of leaders that
are walking in this scripture that are concerned about the issues and the concerns of peoples
all throughout this state and my prayers that as you continue to deliberate over the budget,
over the policies and laws that you will pass during your time here, that you will do it in unity.
I believe that Georgia can and will continue to be a picture of what this nation ought to look like.
Can you believe that with me this morning that you will be a picture of
working together, a picture of unity, a picture of us coming together, the
people that don't look alike, that don't talk alike, that don't sound alike, that
don't have the shared experiences that we would be people that will walk in
unity. And as you do that, I will continue to cheer you on and thank God for your
leadership, can we pray together? God, we are so thankful that you have thought so much
of us to walk in seats of authority, of power. God, I want to speak on behalf of all who
are standing here. God, they don't, we don't take this lightly. God bless us this morning.
Not just for today, but throughout our time here, God, bless your leader's God.
Let them walk in faith and works, God.
Let their hearts be connected to their treasure, God.
Give them supernatural wisdom, God.
Wisdom that surpasses all understanding this morning.
Give them what they lack, God.
Give them more than enough to work on behalf of the people of this great state of Georgia.
God bless us during our time bless them as they continue to do your work and in
the Christian faith perspective that I speak from in your son Jesus' name we pray
can we all say amen together amen amen amen God bless you all
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
for which stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

This house will come to order.
Chair is going to ask all members to please take your seats immediately.
Please take your seats immediately.
very distinguished guest, the only guest that we will have this session. We have
re-instituted a tradition that I'm value very highly and today we're going to
welcome one of the great leaders in this state.
I have a great honor today of introducing, as I said, one of the great leaders in our
state, a real visionary individual, and someone I consider a friend, and with whom we've
had many discussions about issues and policy, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is the 60th mayor
of the city of Atlanta, a daughter of Atlanta, Mayor Bottoms is a lifelong public servant.
She happens also to be the daughter of one of the state's greatest entertainers, Major
Lentz.
And the last time I said that, I got a CD of his greatest hits, thank you mayor.
She is the only mayor in Atlanta's history to have served in all three branches of government,
serving as a judge and city council member before being sworn in as mayor.
She was recognized by Georgia Trend as the 2020
Georgian of the year among many other honors
and accolades that have been bestowed on her.
A product of Atlanta Public Schools,
Mayor Bottoms graduated from Frederick Douglass High School
and received her undergraduate degree
from Florida A&M University.
She earned her law degree from Georgia State University
College of Law.
She and her husband Derek Liv in Atlanta
with their four children, Lance Langston, Linux, and Lincoln.
And as I said, we may have differing views on policy.
I can tell you that Mayor Bottoms shares my desire, our desire to see this city and this
state move forward together.
I'm proud to welcome her to our Chamber today and present to you the 60th Mayor of the City
of Atlanta, Mayor Keshe and Lance Bottoms.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, and I am always honored when I invite it to share with you,
I am doubly honored today to hear that I am the only guest this session, so I greatly
appreciate that to speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones, Majority Leader John Burns, Minority Leader
James Beverly and to my friend and my mentor, the Dean of the Georgia House, my dear friend
Calvin Smirey.
Each time I have the opportunity to come into this building, I am reminded of my family's
history. And the oral history of my family is that my grandmother's grandfather, a
once enslaved man from Crawfordville, Georgia, served in the legislature during reconstruction.
Now, I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what the generations have passed
down in my family. I've seen a document signed by Shepherd Peek, a big ex. So I
I am going to assume that he could not read or write.
But I stand here as 60th Mayor of Atlanta.
And I am reminded of the grace of God.
And that I stand here on the prayers of generations
and the hopes and dreams of those who came before me.
And so it is our responsibility today
for us to hope and dream for generations to come.
As we have mourned the loss this week of our great hero,
Hank Aaron, I'm reminded of a quote where he said,
in playing ball and in life, a person occasionally
gets the opportunity to do something great.
When that time comes, only two things
matter, being prepared to seize the moment
and having the courage to take the best swing.
Well, today and this session will be full of moments
and opportunities for us to do something great
for the people of Atlanta and the people of Georgia.
So it has been my honor and indeed a pleasure
to call speaker Rossin a friend
and to work alongside each of you
to do what we have to do to make sure
that the generations that come after us
will be better.
Thank you, and may God bless you,
and I pray that you hope that,
I hope, hope, I pray and hope
that you have a safe and healthy session.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Give attention to the members in the well as you would expect that attention to be given
to you.
All right, we're going on now to morning orders. The chair is going to limit members
to two minutes each. Chair recognizes representative Maynard for a morning
order. Thank you speaker Austin for the honor to speak to you today. Yesterday we
spoke about Hank here and at length and I'd like to come to you today on behalf of
of the Friendship Baptist Church family,
where he will be late to rest today.
I am a church member at Friendship Baptist Church.
And I'm grateful that you have granted his family, friends,
and the entire Friendship Baptist Church membership
to lift his name in high regard under this gold dome.
Mr. Aaron will be late to rest at 1 p.m.
It is not often that an icon is also a neighbor.
Hammer and Hank is known by many as a legend in baseball,
but those close to him know him as a man of God first.
It delights my soul to see the outpouring of love
across our nation and the world for him.
His legacy is a testament that love truly does conquer all.
I offer to Georgia and my colleagues a divine opportunity that sits before us, love.
It is my opinion that Hank Aaron is the greatest baseball player of all time.
It is the love of baseball, our love for the Atlanta Braves, and the love of this father
and husband that we pause to honor him today.
His death reminds us we are more the same than we are different.
soon, but his warm smile will be remembered forever. Thank you, Speaker
Austin. Chair recognizes representative or I'm sorry, Chairman James
Bershitt for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't often read prepared
words, but in this occasion I'm going to have to and hope just pray that I
get through it. Today I've got some more solemn news. My good friend Matt Campbell,
many of you know he works out in the hall, experienced a tragic loss in his
family. Matt's a friend of mine, he's been a friend of mine since 5th grade.
Matt and his wife Chrissy are not just friends, they're my family. Now I don't
often address his body with personal issues. However, my friend and his family
experience the tragic loss. Matt and Chrissy are feeling the pain that no parent
should have to feel. The camels have unexpectedly lost their 18-year-old son.
Although there are no words to ease the anguish accompanied with the loss of a
child. I ask this body to pray that peace will find its way into their hearts. The
hearts of Matt and Chrissy and Michael, Michael's younger sister, Mary
Catherine and older brother, Tristan. Please take a moment to say a prayer for this
family, say a prayer for the camels and for Michael. Appreciate it. Thank you Miss
speaker. Chair recognizes chairman David Knight for a morning order. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Again, sad news. I appreciate I want to get up and thank
everyone for your thoughts and prayers last week is we lost my father-in-law last
week. It was sort of a double pain too because my brother-in-law, his wife, they
lost her dad also within two days. But I think as is mentioned before, the prayers
and the support from this general assembly, from this family are so important.
And it was part of what had lifted us and kept us up through this time.
And again, I think our faith will help us deal with this and have peace as we lost these
family members.
And again, the others that were mentioned before.
So again, thank you for your support.
One more thing, is this state goes through a lot of issues health care wise.
families, both families experienced something that I think was notable. We think of health
care. We think of a hospital or insurance or whatever. And I want to tell you the personal
experience from our families, both families of these men that we lost this week. It was
the physicians and the nurses. They not only treated and helped our loved ones physically,
but I won't tell you what was so uplifting. They helped treat them in a
personal and a spiritual way. Please pray for them. They've had a tough job and
we were so uplifted by how much they met to our families. Again, thank you so
much to my general assembly family.
Chair recognizes representative Scott for a morning order.
Good morning and thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Teachers are parents, too. We want to open
up schools, but our state courts, cities, counties and federal offices are closed. Teachers
our parents too. Open up all of our state, local, and federal offices, and then ex-teachers
to go back to school. Open the DOL so they can pay out claims. Teachers are parents
and have families that love them too. Remember, the teachers that have fallen to COVID,
They had childrens and families that loved them.
Let's value a teacher's life and remember,
they have childrens and families that loved them too.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I rise to give a short but very important history lesson.
Today I rise to speak about the original 33.
33 black or mixed race legislators duly elected after the Civil War in 1868
that were expelled from the Georgia General Assembly
because they were black.
Their white colleagues did not believe
they had the right to serve in this body.
They had to fight for their right to serve in their own black
skin.
In the years following the Supreme Court
would uphold their right to be legislators,
but that did not stop them from being killed, beaten,
or jailed because of their willingness to serve.
So let's be crystal clear this rainy morning,
the original 33 were not expelled
because of some self-serving, attention-seeking,
personal protest about following safety protocols.
They were expelled because they were black.
Period.
And it is never acceptable for anyone to co-op
or misappropriate the pain, suffering, or oppression
of black people to score political points.
Black people fighting to be treated like human beings
is not the equivalent to your fight to not spit
in a cup to protect your colleagues.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Mitchell for a morning order.
Good morning and thank you Mr. Speaker I would like to bring you another science morning
order because I think this is science, we see a lot in the media right now and this is
a science behind recommending people upgrade their masks.
So we did not know a lot about how well mask prevented exposure to COVID in the spring.
We do now.
Recent science has shown two things.
There are two things that make your mask better.
is that it stops virus from going out or going in through the fabric of the
mask. The second is that you're stopping virus from going around the sides of
the mask. This is science from one group that looked at different mask
materials and ask the first question. What materials actually work to stop
virus from going in and out of your mask through the material? And this group
We've also then looked at if we put different masks on faces, which ones stop material from
going around the sides of the mask.
So the end result ends up pretty simple.
If you have an N95 or an equivalent mask, those serve both properties very well.
However, if you have a simple cloth mask and you want to increase the efficacy of that
mask, you can put a surgical mask behind it and wear them both at the same time and you
will be safer.
you have a cloth mask that you want to add that has three layers in it and one of them
is not fabric or it has a filter in it that will make you safer. There are ways we can
message using science to make sure that our constituents have this information to know
when they go about their business how to do it in the best way possible. Thank you very
much Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson for a morning
order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning ladies and gentlemen everybody can
be great because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You
don't have to make your subject and verbs agree to serve. You only need a heart full of
grace, a soul generated by love. That is a quote by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Yesterday
my good friend, Representative Walisky, recognized John Assoff.
Today I stand before you to recognize the other junior senator, the Reverend Dr. Rafael
Warnock.
It's amazing when you have the opportunity, when government doesn't get in this way, when
And there's no voter suppression.
And we live to the creed of the Constitution to allow our citizens to decide who they
desire to represent them.
And so Georgia had the opportunity to send this young man, he's younger than me, this
young man at the tender age of 51, that is the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church
to represent in the United States Senate on behalf of Georgia the first time ever.
So I conclude, Mr. Speaker, that in 2021, because those who look like me did not have the
opportunity to serve regardless of their capabilities and capacity, we are in 2021 still
accomplishing first. I yield the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes

Is there any objection to adopting the privilege resolutions?
The chair here is none and the resolutions are adopted.
Let's have order just a moment.
We're about to go on to announcements.
We still seem to have a little bit of confusion about the frequency and method of testing.
And I want to try to clear that up.
This is not a blanket objection to testing, but this is about how we're actually doing
it.
Here's the policy.
Here's the policy.
I'm going to do a test on this when we get through.
Each member must test twice a week with Georgia Tech.
Only under pre-approved limited circumstances can other testing be substituted.
You've got to get prior approval.
We have set up the testing with Georgia Tech and the scheduling to optimize the safety of
each member.
And they're good about reporting back to us the number that have tested and the number
of results without names.
But I want to repeat that.
Please hear me.
Each member must test twice a week with Georgia Tech.
They will be testing tomorrow from 7 a.m. until 11 a.m.
They will be testing Monday from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.
And then every Monday that we're in session, and every Thursday that we're in session,
and if we get off, we'll let you know.
And in the normal course of things, it will be Monday and Thursday.
So I hope that clears up the testing policy.
What purpose does the minority leader rise?
Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
State your inquiry.
Is it not true that if you're not tested on the days that Georgia Tech tests that you
You have to get a pre-approval for a test to make sure that you can come in the next legislative day.
That's correct.
Thank you.
Okay, we're going on now to announcements.
