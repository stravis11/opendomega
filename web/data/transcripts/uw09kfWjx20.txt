The chair here is none in the resolutions are adopted.
We are going back to the rules calendar, going back to the rules calendar, or a read
Decaption to House Bill 275.
House Bill 275, Representative Connell, the 26th and others.
We can title an act to amend.
Chapter 4, title 25, an Article 3 of Chapter 11,
and Title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia.
And Tate relaying the general provisions,
relative to fire, fire, fire, standards, and training,
and to emergency medical services personnel,
that's bill ever referred to the Committee of Public Safety
and Homeland Security.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Yeah, we met.
We have, okay.
The word has it you're a member
of the funeral home caucus.
You know, they used to say
lawyers are in this place.
Now it's under takers.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, with this great house, arise before you ask your
a favorable consideration on House Bill 275, LC392928S.
House Bill 275 is a clear bill that dates back to the mid-70s,
which its tenured version allows for inmates
in our Georgia Correctional Institutional Program
to go through a firefighter 101 program
and to be a certified firefighter under these statues placed
on our Georgia Firefighter Standards and Training Council.
These inmates are hence selected by the chief
the Georgia correctional firefighters system and the wardens of their state prisons.
House Bill 275 is a jobs creation bill.
It's an education bill.
It's a reform bill and a bill that can help rule Georgia and bill hope that will give
these inmates an opportunity better themselves when they return to our streets of Georgia.
This bill does not change that the exendmates described in the legislation cannot after being
released get a job as a firefighter.
What this bill does is gives them an opportunity to get their EMT and paramedic training while
they're incarcerated and after they have completed their basic firefighter 101.
There's a part of this bill that mandates that new civilian firefighters that had had
had formerly been incarcerated shall be drug tested twice in a two year period.
sunsets after two years. This bill does not affect firemen, EMT, and paramedics that have
not been incarcerated. Mr. Speaker, Dean of the House, Mrs. Smirre,
Jardel-Eater, Minority Leader, they'll have a great freshman class. I want to thank
my 26-signees on to this bill and the support of my freshman class to present this today.
I want to use a little Shakespearean passion and wisdom
in my closing.
Quoting one of these smart people
worked for my freshman colleague, Mr. Leveritt,
as he used to escape this well.
He used someone that I think lawyers like to quote.
I'm going to use someone that funeral directors like to quote.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
Whether it is nobler in the mind of a freshman legislator
to suffer from these yields I'm about to face,
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes
of these microphones in this room
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
which lies upon these boards with all these names.
And by posing into them to die,
to sleep, or to quickly yield this well.
This is a little Shakespearean McDonald's blend used in Hamlet.
You got that from representative Levart?
Well, he used something to get him out of the well.
Well, I thought he only knew Porter Wagner.
Oh, he does.
Do you, uh, have you finished?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
I didn't know I was, I was pretty enthralled with Shakespeare
there, and your version of him, but I think people heard that and they didn't get their
questions answered. You've got several questions, Dee, and I'm sure you don't want to yield.
I'll try it, yes, sir.
Okay. Well, let's start with one of your colleagues, not a freshman, but a funeral home owner.
Chair recognizes Representative Bentley to the left, to your left.
That's a gentleman's yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
That's a gentleman's yield.
I sure do.
Yes, ma'am.
It's not true that you did not recognize me
as the funeral home caucus queen in your speech this now.
I was getting to that, but I had to stop,
because I could feel what was going on behind me.
OK.
Is it not further true, Mr. Representative,
that the real question in the funeral business is,
can you pay for this bill or not?
Can you pay for this funeral home bill?
Always ahead of time, yes ma'am.
And the last question is, and not further true
that if I support your bill, that you will help me
draft a bill to ensure that Walmart cannot sail cascus
in the state of Georgia.
Norcasco.
Thank you.
I will support your bill.
You got some more questions?
Is it like a Christmas tree back there?
Excuse me?
We like a Christmas tree.
I think a forest might be their accurate.
Let's see.
Chair recognizes representative Ridley to your right.
Does my fluffy friend, Yoldo Wilman?
Yes, sir.
All right, so you said in this bill here
that it provides education and role modeling?
Is that what you said?
I said reform.
Reform?
Yes, sir.
education. Yes sir. All right. So up there in 612 you've been getting an
education and have you been getting any reform up there? Not in the
frat house. No sir. No. How about role models? Have you found any up there?
You are my role model every day. Because you waking me up at 4 o'clock in the
morning. Lord have mercy. I wouldn't be telling everybody that way what time
we get up in the morning. Chair recognizes Chairman Collins to your left
The funeral caucus is just not satisfied right now.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It is a gentleman.
What yield?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that this bill is going to bring much needed help to fire service in
Georgia?
Yes, sir.
Rule Georgia and throughout other areas where the NTs and Paramex were tired during the
COVID.
A lot of job changing, yes, sir.
and one more question, is it further not true
that when you came to my office asking to have this hearing
that you did say that I had the best tear I've been wanting
the funeral home caucus and not the queen, is that right?
No, sure, that is not correct, sir.
Thank you for this, Bill.
Do you further you?
Yes, sir.
Tear recognizes representative Al Williams
to your left for a question.
Well, gentlemen, you always for you, yes, sir.
You look very familiar.
Another guy I know that's about 60-shorting you,
but is it not so?
That like the speaker, I was so moved.
I'd never heard a freshman present
a bill with so many pluses for the consumer.
I was taken by your concern for the living.
And so, is it not so that you want to take care of us on this side of the river and get
paid to go to the other side?
That is true, sir.
Thank you for the bill, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being
Any order to the chair, here's none, the previous question is ordered, is there any objection
to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair, here's none, the committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair, here's none, the report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill.
Now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
Members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk
will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 275. The eyes are 132. The
nasal zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 409. House Bill 409
Number nine, members and I'm gunner of the eighth to be entitled next to amend Article 4, Chapter 15 and Title 45.
The official go to George Antetti, relating to council for public officials and agencies.
So as a survivor, a process for state funded representation of certain judges and legal actions,
resulting for performance or non-performance of their official duties.
This bill I've referred to the Committee on Judiciary.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Gunter
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the
Judicial Legal Defense Fund Bill.
Generally speaking, when lawsuits are found
against judges, the Attorney General's Office
will represent them as a courtesy.
But if the lawsuit happens to include the governor
or any other member of the executive branch,
they are conflicted out.
and that leaves the judges without representation.
This bill is designed to take care of that.
There's a commission that will be formed in this bill.
Five members appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, the Speaker, the President of the Senate,
the Governor, and the Council Spirit Court judges.
They'll serve for two years and they will make a recommendation
to the governor after following the procedure
that's also set up in this bill.
When you get sued, you have 30 days to file an answer
and this sets out the timeframes for the judge
to notify the commission and for them
to go through their process and make the recommendation
to the governor.
Hopefully there should be a few days left at the end
of that that would allow for an attorney
that's appointed in the case to file an answer.
The governor controls this.
The commission only makes recommendations to the governor and the fund that this comes
out of is the governor's emergency fund.
So I yield for any questions.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is none.
Committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye?
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
have all members voted.
Have all members voted.
If so, the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of House
Bill 409.
The eyes are 134.
The nays are zero.
This bill having received the
Constitutional majority is there for past.
Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 509.
House Bill 509, I represent a gains none of 17 to be
taught on the act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 30,
a ton of 33.
The fish go to Georgia annotated relating to general
provisions relative to group or blanket accident and
sickness insurance.
This bill I refer to the committee on insurance that
committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes representative Gaines to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
House bill 509 is a measure that will ensure that surgeons are pre-existing conditions
or continue to be protective for Georgians.
If the Affordable Care Act is found to be unconstitutional in the Supreme Court or Congress or to repeal
portions of the Affordable Care Act that protect pre-existing conditions, this will ensure
that we continue to do so here in Georgia.
Happy to answer any questions.
Do you do you for a question?
I will.
Chair recognizes representative Davis
in the gallery for a question.
Does the gentleman yield?
I will.
Is it not true that on lines 32-33,
it is stated that insurance policies
in this state shall make at least one reasonable price comprehensive major medical health insurance
policy available to residents. Is that not true? It is true. Does the gentleman better yield?
Sure. When it comes to reasonable price, would you not say that a $400,000 home is a reasonable price
for a millionaire, but unattainable for someone working on a living rage.
So the question is, what would you consider reasonable?
So what we did in this legislation is the Department of Insurance has to approve insurance,
would have to approve the rates and the plans offered by insurance companies and that
gives legislative intent to the rates that they would approve and so that's why we include
that language in the bill do you
further yield I will chair
recognizes representative park in
the gallery for a question thank
you mr. Speaker does the gentleman
yield I will is it not true Republicans
have led at least 70 attempts to
repeal the affordable care act and
failed if that's the number is it not
that's true. Thank you. Do you further yield? Oh, yield for one more. Chair
recognizes representative McLeod in the gallery to your left for a question.
Is it not true? Does the gentleman yield? I will. Is it not true that Georgia has
has never expanded the Affordable Care Act on the expansion of Medicaid?
That is true.
Okay.
Thank you.
Ultimately what this measure is about, that it's protecting pre-existing conditions,
and that's what this bill will do, and I'm going to speak, I'm happy to yield for one more question if there is one.
There recognizes the majority caucus who are representative Kelly to your right for a question.
Thank you Mr. Speaker for the gentleman yield.
Will.
Representative Gaines, isn't it true that this body in the last term, a worker that
a governor to pass a Medicaid waiver opportunity said that more Georgians would be covered?
That is true, and I believe that measure is going to, as we've discussed in the last term,
is going to increase access and lower costs for Georgians across this state.
Any way you yield for one more question?
I will.
Isn't it true that we here in this body don't have any control of what they're doing in Washington
mail or at the Supreme Court. That is true. And will you further yield? I will. Isn't it true that
that what we're doing today is giving us an opportunity should the Affordable Care Act ever be
struck down that makes sure that George has continued to be protected for the preexisting conditions?
That's right and that's what this measure is all about is protecting preexisting conditions for
Georgia families. May I ask for your favor for the body's favorable consideration and we yield the
will? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The
The previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.

have all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines
on the passage of House Bill 509, the eyes are 121. The days are 11. This bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
The House Resolution 77, a resolution supporting the creation of a state veteran cemetery in Augusta Richmond County, Georgia and further purposes.
It's brought by Representative Prince of 127th to refer to the Committee on Defense and Veteran Affairs and that Committee recommends that this resolution be adopted.
Chair recognizes Representative Brian Prince to present the bill.
Resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 77 basically supports the creation of a state veteran cemetery in the Augusta area.
This is part of a packet that the Senate has already done a resolution.
We have congresspeople who also are supporting this effort and we go to the Veterans Administration
as part of their annual grant program to get funds to have a veterans hospital in our
area.
To your questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll you go.
Do you yield for questions?
I do.
Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming, to your left for a question.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman in the well.
Well, is it not true that I appreciate your efforts in the whole Augusta area delegation
working on this project and isn't it further true that because we have so many veterans
in the Augusta area that this is the next logical place in Georgia for one of these
cemeteries?
I think the gentleman knows what he speaks.
Do you yield for one more question?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes the majority leader of the house.
Do you arrive for a question?
Gentlemen, yield.
Yes, sir.
Where is the nearest cemetery to Auguston and Richmond, Canada?
It's in the Millage Vale area.

do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes the chair of the industry
and the labor committee.
Chairman Warkhizer to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Must be nice to have somebody bills
that need some of these substitutes.
When Chairman Powell presented,
Chairman Belton's first bill, he was at 35,000.
I believe he's been cleared to 42,000.
This bill, as I believe I'm keeping count,
is the eight compact bills that this house has done
over the last couple of years.
and this is for professional counselors.
It merely allows those,
especially military spouses
who have completed all the requirements in their own state
and then meet the minimum requirements in state of Georgia
to hold that license and to practice in state of Georgia.
Now, I'll stand for any questions.
You do not have any questions.
