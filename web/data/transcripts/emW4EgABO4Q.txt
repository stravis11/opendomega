TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning.
Y'all know what I know.
It's a great day to be a Georgian.
A little chilly outside there, representative finish.
Members, will all please come to the chamber
and get come closer to your seats,
cause we're getting ready to ring the bell, Mr. Clerk.
.
.
.
.
Good morning members, all members come to the floor, we're going to have the morning
row call, all members present will please vote green to signify their presence in this
This chamber, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
All members voted, all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you
We lock the machines, door keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain,
to which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning comes to us from down in South
Georgia and he will be better introduced by the lady
from the 169th House District,
represented in Angiostean.
Representing.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's my honor to introduce you to my friend Major Paul
Elliott of Douglas, Georgia.
Major Elliott earned a Bachelor of Arts degree
in political science from Georgia Southern University.
He is a graduate of the Army Infantry School
in Fort Benning, the ordnance basic officer basic course
of Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland, right?
I could go on and on about the degrees that he has.
As of recent, he attended New York University
in the fall of 2017 through the summer of 2018
pursuit of a master's degree in European and Mediterranean studies and graduated with
a 4.0.
Most recently major Elliott completed the Eurasian Foreign Area Officer Training Program at the
George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Garmish, Germany.
He is a highly decorated friend of mine.
His military awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal Army Commandation
Medal with two Oakleaf clusters.
I can go on and on again about the things that he's done.
But as you can see, he has served our country in various roles all over the world.
And he retired after 25 years of faithful service to the United States Army.
Most recently, he became pastor of First Methodist Church in Douglas, Georgia, where I met
him.
Mary to Claire Maley and he has his niece and nephew here Sam and Caroline we're
glad to have them here. I met them through Camp 151 which is a service
organization that serves the underserved in our community for a week and he is
the leader of that. He navigated us out of Hurricane Helene. Please make him
and welcome this morning Pastor Paul Elliott.
Thank you.
Applause.
Good morning, everyone.
I'd like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this amazing opportunity to share a Christian word
of encouragement to an assembly such as this with the leaders of our great state.
I'd also like to thank my representative
from House District 169, Mrs. Angie Osteen,
for the blessing of being nominated for such an occasion.
I'd also like to recognize James Bershiat from 176,
who's got the Southwestern Quadrant of Copy County,
so appreciate your service as well.
And Angie, I thank you for your friendship.
I'd also like to thank my lovely and kind
and long-suffering bride, Claire Mealy-Eliott,
who is representing our family today
with Sam and Caroline, my niece and nephew.
You already know that I love you all.
Lastly, I'm honored, truly, to be
in the presence of the representative leadership of my state.
Without your willingness to conduct the necessary labor
of legislation and vision casting in real time,
nothing would happen in our towns and cities,
counties or roadways, and I salute you all.
Many of you remember Chuck Sims
from his time and service in this room
is the representative for District 169 in Coffee County.
He is also a prominent funeral director in Douglass
and unfortunately in the last two weeks,
I've been working with him quite a bit
do to some deaths in our church.
And we were talking the other day,
and I was telling them about this wonderful opportunity
that I had to be with you all today,
and that I was given a five-minute time limit
with which to deliver my message.
And Chuck, without even missing a beat,
said, do not worry about that five-minute time limit too much
because in truth, nobody really wants to get started
with the order of business of the day anyway.
That's his words.
Thank you.
Today's scripture is from the Apostle Paul and his epistle to the church in Philippi.
In chapter 2 we find these words, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort
from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy
by being of the same mind, having the same love,
being in full accord and of one mind.
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
but also to the interests of others.
Have this mind among yourselves,
which is yours in Christ Jesus,
who though he was in the form of God,
did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
but impede himself by taking the form of a servant
being born in the likeness of men.
The great and noble General George Washington
after leading the continental army to victory
over British forces in the American Revolution
elected to resign his commission and return
to his comfortable home at Mount Vernon.
Many of his contemporaries felt
that because of his widespread popularity,
as savior of the colonies from King George III,
that he could easily seize power unopposed.
But he felt that he could best serve his new country
by putting aside power, investing it with the people
for them to decide.
Upon hearing about this about George Washington,
King George III in England is quoted as
calling George Washington the greatest man in the world
for having given up that power.
Soon enough, he would be called forth from the comforts
of his farm into public service again,
first to preside over the Continental Congress,
and then to preside over two terms
as the United States First President.
Once again, many felt that he could easily retain power
by not departing office, but he knew he could best serve
his country by stepping aside as his season of service
had come to an end.
Many of you here today are absent from your homes
and from your families, from your places of employment,
your businesses, your farms, even your cats and dogs.
Your paths here to this moment that we're all sharing
are as diverse as you all are,
and each of you has his or her own story.
Maybe you were asked to run for the office
that you now occupy.
Maybe it was expected of you to run through office.
Maybe it runs in the family.
Maybe you had an ambitious streak
and you wanted to defeat your opponent in a fair contest.
You can't play football anymore
so why not duke it out on the field of political battle.
Whatever led you here,
whatever brought you here is not the point.
I often reflect with my church family
that the moment, this moment,
that we're all sharing has never been lived before.
We're all sharing this together for the first time
and anything is possible with each passing moment.
With the examples of our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ, as well as our first president,
we can see that power is rightly viewed as an instrument
which can be used for tremendous good.
The power of your positions, ladies and gentlemen,
impact the people of this state in ways
that many of them will never know.
In fact, you can go as far as to say
that they are helpless against whatever decisions
that are made and the legislation that flows from them.
It's important that we all take it seriously
and I trust you all to do just that.
I also recognize that many of you could be enjoying
the fruits of your labor at your homes
or on a trip somewhere exotic, perhaps.
But you're here.
You're getting ready to do the work on behalf of 11.2 million
Georgians and the work you do matters and it matters to me.
Like the example of Jesus and of General Washington, you don't see this as a
position of superiority, but as a position of service.
I encourage you to remember to reflect the glory of God and all that you do,
both today in this working session and in the lives the Lord has blessed us with.
Now I'd invite you to please stand as we pray.
Father, we are so grateful for this day,
this beautiful day that you've blessed us with.
I'm so grateful for each and every individual
that is here today in the areas that they represent
from our great state.
I ask that you pour abundant blessing upon them
and those people that they represent,
their families, their futures.
We're grateful to be here, Lord.
We're grateful for the life that you have blessed us with.
Help us to not waste one minute of it.
And it's in Christ's name, we pray.
Amen.
I invite you now to join me in pledging allegiance
to our great flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands.
One nation under God, individual, with liberty
and justice for all.
Thank you for being here with us and family. Thank y'all for being here. Thank you for your service to our country and thank you for your service as a good lord in your community and all of those you minister too. Thank you for being here with us.
our country and thank you for your service as a good lord in your community and all of

Mr. Clerk, I think we have a report of a standing committee.
Mr. Clerk, will you read?
Representative Lynn Smith, the 70th district, bearing the committee on natural resources
and environments.
And to the following report, we'll speak to your committee on natural resources and
environment.
That endurance consideration, following resolution of the House, instructing the name
back to the House of the following recommendation, House resolution, 2008, due pass, respectively
Please submit, Mr. President.
Lynn Smith, the sub-history chairman.
I completes the reading of the porch standing committees.
Members we do have an invite resolution this morning, but we're going on to morning orders
for us.
So, if members will take your seats, members please take your seats, come to order.
We have two special morning orders, so watch.
I want you to keep these doors closed for a few moments you don't have to lock them
but keep managing them very well.
We don't need any noise from any rooms for these morning
orders, especially this first one.
Members would please take their seats
and give the member in the well your attention, please.
I won't ask you all to join me and stand as I recognize my friend Rep. Spencer Fry.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You all know I've never given a morning order before.
Fourteen years is my first one.
I'm not going to keep you long.
I want to talk about, I appreciate, thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to get in the well
and to read these names into the record.
And I want to tell you all a little bit.
In 2017, I had the men, the patriarchs of my family
passed away.
My uncle, Benjamin Lewis, who taught me to fish.
My grandfather, hersel price, who taught me to raise cattle.
My father, who taught me the Beatitudes, just recently, a couple months ago, my mother,
who taught me to be tough, passed away.
I remember what my grandfather said at his mom's funeral.
But when his dad passed, he thought he was a man, and when his grandson was killed at
five years old, he thought he was a man.
But then when his mom passed, he knew that he had become a man.
My mother taught me music, which you can find on any platform if you want to listen to it.
Art, she was a renowned calligrapher, and as a conservative evangelical, I can only imagine
the interesting conflict of emotions when she was commissioned to calligraphize a piece
in Goldleaf for President Carter, which hangs in his office at the Carter Center.
When she taught me to be tough, I mean she taught me to be tough.
I think she only loaned me about 500 bucks
when I was in my early 20s,
and she made me pay it back.
That was it.
But all the way I was raised was here in this every day.
Y'all remember those little bitty micro cassette
answer machines we had in the 80s, right?
And if you call my house,
it says, if you think you can,
or if you think you can't, either way you're right.
leave a message.
Now that is emblazoned in my brain because
not only did her and my father when they switched over to cell phones
that was there both of their messages on their cell phones.
So I heard that for over 40 something years.
You know in 2014 I quit drinking.
Not sober.
I just quit drinking because of this job.
It's too important for us to get in trouble.
And I felt like sometimes we might make a bad decision
if you're out having a cocktail or two.
But when I buried my mama, I had to take a shot
of her favorite alcohol.
And it was fireball.
And I buried it with my dad in the veteran's cemetery in Griffin, Georgia.
I tossed a chocolate chip cookie in there on her ashes, because she was famous for
her chocolate chip cookies.
But I did write her a song, and I'm going to tell you the first verse in the course.
She can mama's fireball and smoke in her cigarettes.
Thinking about the time she said, now son, don't forget.
If you think you can, or if you think you can't, either way you're right.
Always do what Jesus said, but never run from a fight.
You better count your blessings every day.
better say your prayers before you go to bed. Never let your love dissipate and just keep
keeping on and I'll see you at the pearly gate. Thank you my friends for listening to
that. Her name was Cheryl P. Fry. May God bless her and I'm going to see her at the
to pearly gates.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
We're up to you, Fry.
You know what I know.
We only have one mama, and they're special.
I'm glad you did that this morning.
Special lady, I know you miss her, and a lot of people do.
thanks to her influence on your life.
You're a good man.
Thank you members.
Representing Bayesmore has a group
that she's going to recognize.
Y'all give the lady your attention, please,
and some friends.
We're gonna have them.
Come, yes.
Come, come, come.
Yep, this is our room.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'm going to say it like this.
My family, we have built such a relationship that I call them my family, and I thank you
for being here today in your house.
So who we have in the gallery, they are from the Turkish community.
They brought some college students and leaders of the Atlantic Institute and spring educational
services here to their house.
That Atlantic Institute is a Georgia-based nonprofit dedicated to the promotion of understanding
dialogue and peace.
The Atlantic Institute also organizes intercultural dialogue trips to Greece and many others.
And that's what we were on last year.
We thank you so much and we will educate it.
I ask that you stand up and this August body recognize you here in your house.
They will also be taking a tour, so when you see them in the hallway, please greet them
and say hello.
Thank you, Representative baseball.
Welcome.
We're glad to have you here.
Hope you enjoy your time with the Capitol and thanks for what you're all are doing and
representing the community and being part of the people's house here today under this
go.
Thank you so very much.
We're very welcome.
We look forward to hopefully meeting you out in the hall.
Thank you.
That completes our morning orders.
Members, if you will, we have an invite resolution now
that is very special to me and I'm sure it is
to all of you as we honor one of our own family here
and that's Mr. Abbott Massey.
I'm gonna ask his family to come up and join me.
I'm going to ask Mr. Clerk if you will not only read the caption but if you will read
this resolution, House resolution honoring the life
of Mr. Abbott and Massey, Mr. Clerk.
House resolution 1013 by Representative Burns
of the 159th, Dickie the 134th, Hawkins of the 27th,
Dubnick of the 29th, Meeks of the 178th and others,
a resolution honoring a life and memory of Abbott Massey
and for other purposes.
Whereas Abbott Massey lived a life of distinction
defined by exemplary service to his state, devotion
to his community, and steadfast commitment
to education, agriculture, and civic leadership.
And whereas starting from his earliest visits
to the Georgia State Capitol in the 1940s,
he developed a lifelong connection to the Georgia's public life
that led him to serve as executive secretary
to Attorney General Jean Cook and to be appointed by Governor-elect Ernest Vandiver as director
of the Department of Commerce during which time he created the state's first tourist
division as well as the state's first welcome station in Screven County, the oldest station
still operational in the United States.
And whereas his career began most closely tied to Georgia's agriculture through his leadership
but the Georgia Poultry Federation,
where he guided the industry's growth with vision and dedication,
and he continued to serve full time as President Emeritus there after.
And whereas his passion for education in the University of Georgia was evident
in his service as President of the UGA Alumni Association,
and as Trustee of the UGA Foundation,
and as a leader in preserving the historic four towers
and establishing the Veterinary Medicine Experiment Station.
And whereas as many honors include the UGA Distinguished
Alumni Merit Award, the Blue Key Service Award,
the inaugural medallion of honor from the College
of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences,
the College of Family and Consumer Sciences
Appreciation Award, the Distinguished Service Award
from the College of Veterinary Medicine
and induction into the Georgia agriculture hall of fame.
And whereas he was further honored through the creation
of the annual Abbott-Massie lecture
by the Georgia Society of Association Executives,
and he received the Organization's President's Award
for his work to protect nonprofit volunteers
under Georgia law.
And whereas as additional testimony
to his influence and service, Abbott-Massie met seven presidents
of the United States, counted the late President Jimmy Carter among his friends and championed
Georgia women of achievement as the first man to serve on its board of trustees, the
only man to serve as president, and the first person chosen his trustee for life.
And whereas he was united in love and marriage to his wife, Kayanne, and together they built
a life in Gainesville, Georgia, raising two children, Lewis and Camille.
And later enjoying the blessings of four grandchildren, Chandler, Mary Cameron, Christian, and Lucia,
and of family members Amy and Gilly.
And whereas a compassionate and generous man, Abbott Massey will long be remembered for
his love of family, friendship, and community, and will be missed by all who had the great
fortune of knowing him.
Now therefore be it be resolved by the House of Representatives that the members of this
body join in honoring the life and memory of Abbott Massey and express their deepest and
most sincere regret at his passing.
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.
Thank you members.
Mike Giles, you remember the family.
Come on up here.
partnership in working with Mr. Abbott over the years certainly will be recognized.
Members, any of us could do what I'm doing right now that had the honor and the
pleasure of knowing Mr. Abbott and working with him over the years. And I'm going to
make some more remarks about Mr. Abbott, but I want to invite his son, Lewis,
All of you know as well to introduce the family, Lewis, if you will, and allow me to present
you with this resolution, members of this house, we're also proud to be a part of and present
to you and the family as we honor a dear, dear Georgian, the Stab at Massey, Lewis.
How'd you know?
Thank you.
Lewis, can I have more・・・
please please be seated they don't listen to me very well thank you speaker
John Burns thank you Dale Burns the real star of the Burns family thanks to
each of you for your service to the state and for the time that you work with
my dad over the years greatly appreciated I want to thank the speaker staff
Chris and Jacob and others who helped make this resolution possible and thank
many friends in the gallery who worked with Dad over the years here at the
State Capitol. I want to just say a couple of brief things. Number one is he loved
the State Capitol and he loved this state. He told me that in the early 1940s he got
in the car with one of his older brothers and they drove to the State Capitol
and he met John P. Wilson, who was the 20th Secretary of State of Georgia.
And then in 1947, when he was a student at UGA, he got in a car with three other students
and they drove here to observe firsthand the chaos around the three governors controversy
that so many of you have read about, 1947.
And as mentioned by the clerk and the resolution,
dad had offices here at the State Capitol.
In the 50s, he worked for the Attorney General.
He worked in what was the predecessor
to the Legislative Council's office, drafting bills.
He said there are only two people in the office at the time.
A lot less bills then, I guess.
He also worked for a judge on the Court of Appeals.
And many of you know that room 341 was actually
courtroom for the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Georgia Supreme Court in the 50s.
And then in the late 50s he got to be the commissioner of the Department of Commerce, which is
now the Department of Economic Development. And in that job, he had one major victory.
He met Miss Georgia in 1959, who became his wife and our beloved mother and grandmother.
His dad once said that if Abbott ever fell in a lake, one thing for sure, he would come
out of there with a fish in his pocket.
Dad did live a wonderful, fortunate, lucky life.
And we are here today to thank you for this recognition.
My wife Amy is here, our son Christian, our son Chandler and his fiancee Steph Bennett,
And the speaker recognized Mike Giles earlier who worked with Dad for many years at the Georgia
poultry federation as they lobbied on behalf of the poultry industry.
Let me finish with this.
If you read Dad's bio, it says he has an undergraduate degree from UGA and a law degree from Emory.
But I think his most important degree was a PhD in joy.
Every single day he was at this Capitol, he was joyful.
And his legacy will live on thanks to you and others at the State Capitol.
Thank you for letting us be here today and share in recognizing and honoring the life of
Abbott Massey.
Thank you very much.
I know many, many of you, y'all may be seated, many, many of you, these members and great
Georgians in your own right would like to come and express your sentiment about
Mr. Abbott Massey. And thank you to his friends in the gallery too. We appreciate
y'all being here to honor Mr. Abbott as we will. Because we all know that Mr. Abbott
was a trusted friend, mentor, advisor in so many different ways to so many
people over the years that served in the, with the honor that we serve with as
members of the General Assembly, especially members of the House.
And I thought of it this way, as Deilin and I have talked, I think I believe that the
good Lord has a plan.
His plan for Mr. Abbott was long life, good health, because he impacted so many of us with
his attitude and just that enthusiasm that he, I think he embodied it all.
Everyone he met came away with, boy, I feel better to talk on that guy.
And I think we all try to, he was a true Southern gentleman.
If you look it up in the book, the dictionary probably has Abbott Massie's name there.
Personal story about Mr. Abbott and his longevity.
But I was looking through some old newspapers at home
from the Springfield Herald in 1956 or 57.
On the front page was this group establishing
the J.C.'s Jung People Google it, the Georgia J.C.'s,
the J.C.'s and who was inducting and establishing
that new chapter down in Effingham County,
Mr. Abbott mass, you know, and guess what?
One thing, he may have looked a little bit older,
but one thing was the same.
That hair was perfect then, and it was perfect now.
So he's pasted that gift alone, and I'll go in and tell y'all,
I'm gonna get a haircut this week,
but I've got this hair in honor of Mr. Abbott this week,
trying to emulate Mr. Abbott in every sense of the word.
So that was something that was special to me,
and Mr. Abbott just had that big grin
when I gave him that newspaper, that first trip,
the history of our state that he would talk to you about.
And he would bring the life for you
as he told you about our state and our successes
and everything he had been a part of
and what he witnessed.
Louis just spoke to that.
A fixture, a fixture, that guy has been a fixture
in this capital for a couple of years.
And he's made a difference in here.
Miss Kayanne, what a beautiful, beautiful Miss Georgia.
She was, what a beautiful, beautiful lady.
She was during her entire life.
And a graduate of Agnes Scott, and you all know that.
I just realized that.
Y'all know where they went on the first date.
Trivia, Niagara Falls.
Yes, they did.
With her mother sitting in the back seat of the car, of course.
What a romantic Mr. Abbott was.
You know, another special thing for me,
as we've done in Scriven County on US 301,
the longest established welcome center in our country,
is in Scriven County in our state.
And Mr. Abbott was always an advocate
for keeping that beautiful building,
historic building in place,
and also is that welcome center still serves.
Visitors coming from South Carolina,
going south on 301 and headed back home in our state.
For those University of Georgia friends here, and I think we all are, he did bleed red
and black.
There's no doubt about that.
I don't think anything happened in Athens that Mr. Abbott was not a part of.
Would that be fair to say?
In so many different ways.
I think about that longevity and that help that the good Lord blessed Mr. Abbott with.
He called me a few years ago and said, hey, are you coming to the ball game?
It was one spring morning.
He said, what ball game is to have it?
He said, if it him, Kennedy, they're playing Gainesville right now in baseball.
He was always there in every sense of the word for what we do here, but what his community
was all about.
And I did wear an elephant paper for the Gainesville folks up there that he cared so much about.
I thought this was interesting, y'all probably heard this, your mother told him said,
Abbot, when he was going to work for the Georgia Poetry Federation in 1966, he said, Abbot,
you don't know the difference, we're not gonna chicken, how can you do that?
He learned pretty fast, he did a great job of being responsible for the great success of
that industry.
It's so crucial to our state and the well-being of so many families around all over our
state, not just in North East Georgia. One of the things that I try to emulate, and
I know you all do too, is, you know, I like to know people's names. Mr. Abbott knew
your name. He could call your name when you met him. That's one of the things that
was always so special about him, and he wanted to know about you. He wouldn't
know about your family, where you came from, what you did, but it wasn't
forgotten because the next time he spoke to him he remembered and he talked to you about
things that were important to you. We should all try to emulate that as we make people feel
special because he did that. Now he had a special friendship, he had a special friend
sitting right over to my right, Dale Burns and you know Mr. Abbott was constantly upgrading
and his ability to be in touch with every day.
Drummer Tesla, a red Tesla.
He had an Apple watch.
So I can hear him right now, the phone would ring her.
I said, who are you talking to?
I'm calling Mr. Abbott.
They were comparing steps.
Who got the most steps in that day.
And so he'd be here most of the time.
I can tell you that.
But she really thought she was one of his special girlfriends.
She got to look in and listening.
Mr. Heaven had a lot of special girlfriends.
She was special to him, but she realized
how special all of us were to Mr. Abbott.
He calls, you know what he did?
He cared about people.
He cared about his neighbor.
He kept up with the times.
He did that.
He was always relevant, always relevant.
To the family, thank you for sharing your dad,
A man especially in your life, as you join the family,
grandchildren, he was so very, very proud of you all,
y'all know that, and you all have that great hair
that Mr. Abbott passed on, that gene is still alive.
I think Mr. Abbott's life and legacy, and that's important.
We've talked a little bit, a little bit about legacy
over the last few days.
There's a legacy of kindness to every Georgian he came in contact with,
to the point they remember him well,
that care he had for our state, for our well-being,
from an economic perspective, but from a personal perspective.
He will never be lost on me.
And his devotion, his devotion to this state,
but to his family, and just fellow men.
I'll just say this.
Thank God for the life of that fine, fine man right there,
Mr. Abbott-Massie.
Thank you, family.
We love you.
We, again, thank the Lord for Mr. Abbott-Massie.
Thank you for being here with us,
and letting us honor this family.
Thank you, members.
you
Thank you.
Okay.
I'll just let you know, Ms. Babis.
Lewis is obviously his son, Camillo is his daughter.
They were traveling, they tried to get here,
but as we honored their dad,
but we certainly make sure they can watch us for it.
And I think they'll be, thank y'all.
Members, if you would,
we all learn to go into the end of the room.
Members, if you would like to speak to the family,
you may join them in the south any room
and have a photo and tell them of your high regard
of Mr. Abbott-Massie.
Thank you.
We have a little bit of business I need to attend to, but before we move on to afternoon orders.
We have a motion to withdraw a bill from one committee and recommit to another.
For what purpose is reps any forward rise?
That's Mr. Speaker, that you want to make a motion?
Yes, sir.
The lady's recognized for a motion.
That we move House Bill 590 from the Committee on Regulated Industries to the Committee on Motor Vehicles and both Chairman and Agreement.
Thank you.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 590 by reps and a quarter of the 170th and others to be entitled back to a men's title 43.
The official go to Georgia, Antietta, relating to professions and businesses so as to provide for the regulation of trailer manufacturers.
On the latest motion, HB590, be withdrawn from the Regulated Industries Committee and
recommitted to Motor Vehicles Committee, is the objection, hearing none of this so ordered.
We have some afternoon orders, we want to call on Chairman Bonner, then Representative
Pantitch and Martinez representing Bayes Moore and chairman MacDonald. We'll start with chairman Bonner
You don't have a time limit. We will let you conscious be your guide. How about that?
I'd rather you be my guide mr. Speaker
Hey, uh, good morning. Come on. We'll spin
This is a good one. It's been pending for a few days. We're glad it's finally accomplished. Mr. Chairman
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise to honor and celebrate a great Georgian and a true American hero.
Earlier this week, General Tom Cardin, our former adjutant general, was nominated to be the vice chief of the National Guard Bureau.
This is the culmination of an incredible career that saw General Cardin go from enlisting as a private in the Georgia National Guard in high school
to now pinning on a fourth-star reaching the highest level in the United States
military. So General Cardin, as I said, served as our
agit in general throughout his career here in Georgia. He was a friend to many of us.
He led troops into harm's way. He led our state through numerous natural
disasters and throughout the and throughout the COVID pandemic, his actions
saved countless lives here in Georgia. So we are so honored and excited to have
General Cardin become the only the second serving four-star general in the
National Guard. He'll be up the National Guard Bureau in in Washington. He'll be an
advocate for not only for Georgia but for all of us in the military and I think
it's fitting that we celebrate him today and look forward to his continued
service. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Bonner. Yeah, absolutely.
Members, if you will reflect back with me on those days, on those Governor Kemp's press conferences
on COVID and bringing information to Georgians, boy, he was really good and did a great job
in making sure that he did his job protected and working to serve Georgians. So, congratulations,
the general. He's a good man and I'm really glad he's on our team. Represent
Pennage and Representative Martinez. Recognize for an afternoon order.
