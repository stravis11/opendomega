TRANSCRIPT
----------
Mayer of our capital city, they just approved the raise, makes $237,000 or $36,000 a year.
But the governor of the entire state only makes $175.
That doesn't make good sense.
So this simply sets the governor of salary at $250,000, which I believe is most appropriate.
But then it falls in line with our constitutional officers and the speaker of the house.
So whether it be our lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house, the attorney general,
the insurance commissioner, all those folks that are statewide elected, although I did
not bring the PSC involved, would then be 80% of the governor's salary.
The proposed pay raise for Governor Brian Campwood may cam one of the highest paid governors
in the country.
Good evening.
It's day 36 of the Georgia legislative session.
Welcome to lawmakers.
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta.
More details about the raises coming up in our Capitol report.
If you've ever called 911 in Georgia and became frustrated by being put on hold, getting
transferred to another jurisdiction or waiting a long time during an emergency, help is on
the way.
On the show, we'll learn how Georgia will spend more than $5 million dollars to overhaul
the 911 system.
It's part of a nationwide effort.
Also, education takes up more than half of the state's budget, and there are dozens
of bills to help improve academic outcomes.
We'll hear from some of the sponsors this evening.
But as always, Sarah Callis reports on the action at the Capitol today.
Hi, Donna.
the capital, both chambers stayed busy as the countdown until
Sinidai is on.
In the house, a surprise visit from the speaker's chief of staff,
Terry England.
England was injured in a farming accident earlier this session and has been
recovering at the Shepherd Center.
Members then unanimously passed Senate Bill 72, which would allow terminally ill patients
to access experimental treatments.
They also approved SB-85, which would create a scholarship grant program for Georgia youth
and foster care.
These young individuals often find themselves at a disadvantage.
However, this bill gives us a chance to change that narrative.
After a lunch break, the house took up SB 233,
which would add individuals with first-hand experience
with addiction to the Behavioral Health Reform
and Innovation Commission.
The additions to the commission is set forth in 233,
or recognizing the very strong contributions,
necessary contributions from the addiction community
across Georgia. This has always been a mental health and addiction commission effort, and
the addition of additional addiction related professionals and addiction related family
members are strong. Members also debated Senate Bill 9, which would criminalize artificial
intelligence videos designed to interfere with elections.
I would argue with you, the most important thing we can do for our constituencies is to
ensure that when they go into that box, when they are saying to themselves, I'm going
to cast the ballot for this individual
or for this referendum.
The most important thing we can do for them
is make sure that we have given them accurate information.
We cannot live in a world where our constituents
10.7 million Georgians, almost six million voters
are asking themselves, what I just saw,
is it real or is it not real?
At that point, the integrity of the election,
no matter if you fall on paper ballots
or machine ballot is gone.
They passed 152 to 12.
The other tort reform bill also made it to the floor today.
SB 69 would set regulations around third parties financing lawsuits, such as banning foreign
entities from being litigation financiers.
Currently, there are no provisions whatsoever that outline regulations on litigation financing.
No earner could will you find it.
So what this bill seeks to do is put some guardrails and regulation on the industry.
The bill passed 98 to 69.
The House unanimously approved SB 105, which would allow veterinarians to give tell advice
to pet owners.
The Senate took up HB 428, which would codify into law access to in vitro fertilization.
The bill was crafted after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos created
with IVF should be treated as children and banned the procedure until a similar bill
was passed there.
Senator Josh McLaren said that not only did he support the bill, but he also had a personal
connection to it.
I myself am a donor-conceived person.
The technology was new around the time that this happened for me in the late 80s.
But it's been a long journey and it's a really important realization for all of us to have
when talking about this issue that many of our families are affected by this are uplifted
by this.
86 would give pay raises to state judges, including state Supreme Court justices.
But an amendment offered by Senator John Elbers added pay increases for all of the state's
executive officers, including Governor Brian Camp, raising his pay to $250,000.
The mayor of our capital city, which represents about a half a million people, makes $236,000.
The governor who represents 11 million people makes $61,000 less.
Think about that for just a moment.
That is just not right.
We shouldn't have people be paid so far out of balance, even though knowing that in the
private marketplace without a doubt, they would get paid multiples more.
I think it's the right sub-nice balance and gets us on the right path tying it to a percentage
in the future.
and pushback the amendment was passed, as well as the bill, 45 to 10. It now returns to the house for final passage.
House Bill 307 would increase resources at schools to diagnose and help students with dyslexia.
The bill would also remove the three queuing systems as the primary instruction for teaching reading.
We learned that one in five people, children, experienced some form of dyslexia. We didn't know that in the past,
But this mandate that we also have, not only is the child identified, not proficient
in reading, but it also has displayed.
This also mandates that there be an inhibition program set in place to help that child get
proficient.
In Senate Resolution 292, would form a Republican-led Senate Investigative Committee to look into the
New Georgia Project's illegal campaign contributions to its former founding member, Stacey Abrams,
her 2018 gubernatorial campaign.
What this bill is going to do is let us investigate these type of activities and see
what type of amendments or changes or new campaign finance laws or ethics laws we might
need to kind of create more transparency and prohibit this illegal use of dark money
in our campaigns.
Democrats say the investigation is unnecessary and more political theater.
In Washington, D.C., they spend a lot of time investigating political opponents while wasting
taxpayer dollars without providing any benefit to the American people.
But for those politicians in D.C., it does get them headlines, it does get them media coverage.
This bill is no different.
The resolution was passed 33 to 21 along party lines.
The House and Senate will convene tomorrow when the House is expected to vote on a bill
that would crack down on fentanyl trafficking and give final approval to protections for
IDF.
That's my Capitol report.
Donna?
Donna?
Thanks, Sarah.
Cell phones, the Internet, the other technology, all of turn Georgia's 911 system into a
bit of a dinosaur.
New legislation spearheaded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would
modernize the system.
Next generation 911 reaches police, fire, and emergency medical assistance from any phone
in any location, allows voice, photos, videos, and text messages, helps manage call overload,
natural disasters, and transfer of 911 calls based on caller location.
In the legislature, Republican representative Will Wade of Dawsonville moved the bill in
the house, and Republican senator John Albers led the bill through the Senate.
I spoke to both of them earlier today about the need
for Georgia to upgrade its 911 system.
Over the summer, the House had a study committee
and I believe some senators were involved as well
regarding the state's 911 system.
And quite frankly, it's like a lot of parts of life.
Technology enhancements, the utilization
and how people are living and moving and communicating
has changed over the last few years.
And the 911 system is just, it's old
and it's outlived, it's useful life.
So it was time for us, as state leaders,
to look around and say, okay,
what solutions can we come up with?
And next gen 911 is what demands,
the 21st century need to be met with.
So we're excited that the house was able to introduce this,
Jima and Jika, who are state agencies
that help emergency management across the state.
They were engaged in the process,
kind of helping make the detailed case while we need this.
And so I was happy to introduce the legislation
and get its chevrore through the house
and give it over to the great hands of center albers
who could take care of it in the Senate.
And as a state, we've had different municipalities
do some of this on their own,
but the lack of a statewide network
to connect together all these 911 centers
has put it as a little bit of a disadvantage.
So this great piece of legislation
that Representative Wade sponsored
and I'm happy to help in the Senate
is gonna allow us as state to bring
that entire foundation in place
that everyone can leverage at
because people are at their most vulnerable moments
when they call 911
and we can't have that be an outage or a delay
and they also need to use newer technology,
text, send pictures, videos,
all the ways we communicate in this day and age.
I think some people have done what I've done.
I saw an accident and then when I called in,
they told me I called the wrong place
and here I am thinking I'm helping somebody,
but it took a while.
That's, this would prevent that, right?
That's correct.
And so what will happen is this will allow local communities,
Think about Georgia 400, I commuted every day.
If I'm in an accident or I see an accident
or I'm sitting in traffic,
I may not exactly know which county I'm in,
I might be in for sight or Fulton or you just don't know
and you see an accident you call 911,
we wanna make sure that as soon as they get that call,
they can geolocate your cell phone where you are
to make sure they're getting you to the right quickest
agency, whether it be police, fire, EMT, et cetera,
they will be able to serve you and know exactly
where you are.
Just like the private industry is able to deliver you
your uber eats or your supper or your meal at your office,
they're going to know exactly where you're calling from
and it's very important.
And look, I'm sure the Senator heard dozens of folks
called me and said, look, I've been on 9-1-1
and had the hold.
Folks, if you're in an emergency,
that's like pouring gasoline on a fire.
And sometimes that's literally what's happening.
And people are sitting and waiting.
We can't allow that to continue.
This legislation will help our communities to adopt next gen 911.
We're funding $5.75 million in the first year of its implementation.
So those early adopters can get engaged and it's going to help a lot of
Georgia's all across our state.
How long will it take to get it fully operating?
It'll take about five years for the entire platform to be set up,
but it will happen iteratively.
What's important is we've had 911 systems that have gone down,
power outages, network outages,
and the phone companies are getting rid of their legacy
technology, so this has to be done,
but also gives that continuity that we need so badly.
We're now, if you're calling here in Atlanta,
and for some reason there's a problem in that facility,
they can dynamically be picking up at other places
in order to get the response to be right away.
Add that with artificial intelligence tools,
which can pick up every call on the first ring
or absorb that information.
This way when you're getting 200 calls,
we don't have to sew down the dispatch process
their first responders, they'll a little bit of handle
that all in the back end smoothly.
It also helps transition those calls that are not
emergencies to make sure they're getting the right
places without stopping what really needs to be a
true emergency response.
What are the terms of the workforce?
I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm just going to say one of the things I'm
hopeful for is, you know, the state has spent
on a large amount of funds on expanding our
mental health and crisis line.
988 is a tool that I think many Georgians are still
not aware of.
I believe that we'll have an opportunity
for those 911 centers to transfer to 988
until people start realizing 988 is also a tool
when it's not typically the same type of emergency.
So that I think is another component
that's gonna be added along that five-year plan.
Absolutely.
What can you tell me about the workforce
in terms will it mean any changes
in terms of dispatchers, other people are involved?
They will actually get some new
more beneficial tools than they have today.
As we talked about texting, pictures, videos, what's going on, imagine that real-time
information coming in dispatch that they can relay to law enforcement officers or to
firefighters.
So they're going to have some new and enhanced tools.
Our 9-1-1 dispatchers who are really just a critical part of our first responder network
are very excited about this.
In fact, they have led the way along with Georgia Emergency Management and Georgia Emergency
Communications to get this done.
really mean a lot when we have a natural disaster like a storm like Helene
that kind of thing. Yeah we we had dozens of folks testify to had we had
next gen non one prior to Hurricane Helene the response times for some of
the most difficult situations would have been able to be addressed much more
quickly and honestly just being able to restore peace of mind more quickly
helps temper those frustrations and tragic situation so it's going to be
great. Look, I think 9-1-1 centers across the state still have open spots.
There's a, you know, they've got plenty of job opportunities. So I think this is
going to be exciting for the 21st century graduate who wants to be utilizing
that technology and speaks AI the way maybe you and I may not have that
capability yet. We're working on it, but I think it's going to be a detractive
job for the next iteration of workers too. This is what teamwork's all about when
you see things that tend to get backlogged in other states or other areas of
government here in the state of Georgia or a team we're getting things done to serve
our citizens.
Well done sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is it.
HB423 is on its way to the governor's desk.
During our conversation I also asked Senator Albers who chairs the Senate's Public Safety
Committee about a couple of his bills including SB27, which would criminalize doxing.
But first I asked about a bill that would help ensure emergency organ transport vehicles
have the same abilities as ambulance services.
His interest in promoting organ transplants is personal.
He donated a kidney to his son in 2021.
Centipil 58 allows for life-saving organs
when they're being transported.
From one medical facility to another,
you usually look similar to like a fire chief's car
or a small ambulance,
that sometimes they have to ride emergency
because there's a sensitive time to get that organ.
Sometimes there's actually a medical team
that is with that organ as well.
So in the times they need to be driving for emergency
with a lighten sirens, it allows those
who are certified to do so and have the proper equipment
to do that.
It's very important because not everybody
was a fortune as I was with my son.
We were in operating rooms right next to each other.
So this makes sure, no matter where that organ's getting to,
it's gonna get their timely,
we're gonna save people's lives.
Let's talk about SB27 really quick,
dealing with doxing.
Tell us about it.
So doxing is basically online stocking,
but it goes so much further.
With the tools we have today,
whether it be social media
or any other electronic communications,
people are sharing people's specific location at times
in order to do harm.
Some of it is traditional stocking
that has made people very fearful and uncomfortable,
but sometimes it's literally led to bodily harm
and even death.
So this is an important issue that we modernize our law
to keep up with the technology that's around this.
Many of us were swatted a year and a half ago.
I was swatted twice as was many folks in this building,
but it's not just about us.
This is the ex-spouse in a bad marriage
where someone's acting poorly.
This is a young girl who's a teenager in school
who's got somebody aggressive doing something terrible.
So this is to protect people.
That's what we're all about here first and foremost
is working together to make sure our citizens are safe.
The bill criminalizing doxing has passed on the Senate and in a House committee, so we
can expect it on the House floor soon.
The legislation dealing with transporting organs has moved through both chambers and
is awaiting the governor's signature.
I want to thank Chairman Albers and Representative Wade for our conversation.
Well, coming up, legislative efforts to improve outcomes for school children and to help
Georgia's looking to become first-time homeowners.
Two house Democrats join us to talk about bills they feel
passionate about as the session winds down.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPP.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization dedicated
to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the State Capitol during the session and year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen, I don't fear anyone.
This is a woman, people wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it.
By acknowledging our own worth.
Help please.
Do continue.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
That's amazing.
Oh, I'm excited now.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking?
But look at this.
It really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
Your love is like fire.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
Welcome back to Lawmakers. I'm Gunna Lowry. Our next guest will discuss legislation they've
crafted on a variety of issues. Joining us is Democratic Representative Imani Barnes
of Tucker. Her committees include higher education and public and community health. And Democratic
representative Bill Olaia of Atlanta.
He's on the education, governmental affairs,
and information and audit committees.
They stay busy.
Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
You both have education bills, so we'll start with that
and then we'll get into some other things.
And let's start begin with your healthy start act.
HB60, you've come on the show before to talk about this.
You want to make sure all children have access
to school breakfast and school lunch.
You've pushed it for quite a few years.
Tell us where things stand.
This will be the third year that I've pushed
to Healthy Start Act.
Fortunately, all three years, we got the money in the budget.
The Healthy Start Act is the law that would codify
feeding our children free school breakfast
and free school lunch.
So explain that, so people don't understand.
The budget is one thing, actually having a law
that requires this to happen on a regular basis is another thing.
That's another thing.
So we can fight for a budget line item
that will get the money in a budget
that will do the same thing as my bill, my legislation.
The legislation would codify, would make it law.
So each year we don't have to fight for a budget line item.
Okay, all right.
So let's talk about your education bill,
Representative Olai, you've also had the education bill
called the Educational Opportunity Act
focusing on students living in poverty.
Tell us what that's all about.
Yeah, so Georgia Educational Opportunity Act
would, for the first time in 40 plus years
of our state's funding formula existence,
it would provide additional resources
to support children living on poverty.
We know that poverty is the greatest barrier
standing in the way of our young people
and educational outcomes and future success
that we want for them.
And this provides additional resources and tools
for school leaders and educators
to meet the unique needs of today's children.
And we know that the Quality Basic Education Act
or the Funding Formula has not been changed
as you said in 40 years.
So how are you feeling about this?
I know you didn't get it through at this point,
but you're still keeping hope alive in this.
Well, you got it, you got to keep at it.
And we had, we had some great conversations.
To buy partisan bill, really appreciate
the support of my colleague Tyler Paul Smith.
I wanna say we had the first bipartisan,
or probably the only bipartisan press conference
just to bring some attention in the awareness around
the need to invest more fully in our public schools
and get the resources into the hands
of our educators doing so much with so very little
so that we can help our young people thrive
and be successful.
So the bill is still alive for next year.
So we'll wait and see what happens.
I know you'll keep fighting with it.
Okay, we're gonna switch gears again to another,
another of your education bills,
HB106 to bring back driver's education
as an elective.
Is there a personal reason behind this?
I have a young teenager that's getting ready
to get on the roads.
I had a feeling that there was something that didn't fit.
Yeah, and so tell me how things are going
in terms of this bill.
Pretty much.
When I was in high school, I took driver's ed,
I feel like it makes me a better driver on the road.
And we all know we've had a lot of teen deaths
on the highway in the past few years.
And just putting drivers at back into the high school
gives more children who can't afford
those personal driver ed services the opportunity
to be taught how to safely drive on our Georgia roads.
Yeah, I think a lot of people feel the same way,
but right now you have to pay for it.
That's right.
And that's another one you're gonna keep alive.
We're gonna keep that one alive too.
Yeah, okay, let's switch to another one
sticking with education.
Let's talk about your student teacher promotion act bill.
Tell us about it.
Yeah, so.
So, 310, I think.
HB310, so currently college students
who are on a path to earning their teacher certification
and stepping into classrooms go through a practicum.
And so it's in classroom experience and work
that allows them to build confidence and skills
that are necessary for their preparation
to stepping into that profession.
And they're dropping out of the program
because they're not being compensated.
This is a 40-hour, a week, a minimum of 500 hours,
a semester, and they're not being paid.
And inflationary pressures are affecting us all,
including students who have to pay for tuition,
who have to pay for gas tune from school,
who are paying for groceries,
and this would bring us in line with other states
who currently compensate student teachers
for their working classrooms.
And let's face it, we need teachers.
We're really losing our teachers.
So this is one way of keeping them.
So there's a fiscal note involved.
So is that part of the problem?
So no fiscal note as of yet.
Okay.
But it would give student teachers up to $1,500
upon completion of their student teaching portion.
That's likely to make a difference, okay?
This is right.
We're gonna switch to something else,
old school too, I'm calling it that old school.
The back to school tax-free holiday
that are used to allow you to have at least a weekend
sometimes to buy clothing and school supplies and no taxes.
I'm trying to bring back to school tax,
free weekend back.
It's called Back to School Relief Act.
it would make school supplies, shoes, computers,
things our children need to go back to school,
tax-free.
We just passed a gun tax-free piece of legislation
and my bill for tax-free school weekend
did not get a hearing, so.
But in October, I think we're still waiting
to see what's happening with the gun bill.
It may have passed in both of them.
Yeah, that's another one you'll be fighting.
Yeah, we're trying to help parents with the inflation
and trying to get our kids back to school.
Food is expensive.
School supplies are expensive.
Laptops that children need.
So just bringing that back.
We have one on the Senate side.
Nabila, Islam is carrying the Senate back to school.
Tax-free and I'm carrying the house.
So hopefully we get some attention on that as well.
OK, we'll keep up with that one.
While we're talking about education,
I know you want to talk a little bit about what's
What's happening at the federal level
with the Department of Education?
Where are your thoughts?
It's dismantling it, I should say.
It's unfortunate and disappointing.
We know that the state pulls in billions of dollars
to support Title I schools, to support meals programs,
to support children with disabilities.
And so in the absence of this agency,
we're talking about hundreds of layoffs
who is going to be managing and administering
these vital programs to our schools and our communities.
And, you know, I had a friend liking it
to smash in a fly with a hammer.
Probably not gonna get the fly
and you're gonna cause a lot of damage in the process.
And that's what's happening.
I run a workforce development youth focus nonprofit
next generation men and women.
We operate exclusively out of Title I high schools
and it's hard.
A lot of that fear and uncertainty makes it difficult
plan, it makes it difficult to keep morale up, to do the difficult work, the hard work
that many educators and community partners such as my own is doing.
And so we could potentially be back for a special session to figure out what's the extent
of the cuts, what are we going to be left needing to cover in terms of funding to make
make sure that those vital programs are ongoing.
Yeah, and not just for the Department of Education,
but some other federal programs.
Oh, definitely.
So we'll see what happens with that.
I want to get into real quick that you have two programs
that will deal with, you want mobile units.
You have your in-path bill that you've talked about before.
But another mobile unit for postpartum women,
talk about those, we have maybe a minute, less than a minute.
The Healthy Mother's Act, the Healthy Mother's Act
would provide mobile maternity units
in our maternity deserts in the state of Georgia.
So though maternity deserts do not have OB-GYNs
in the vicinity, no hospitals,
and no obstetrician care in the vicinity.
And so we would provide mobile units to these areas,
which will also mitigate some of the other diseases
that come along with being pregnant.
You got high blood pressure, you could have diabetes.
And so, sending mobile units to our role
and our districts without maternity care
is of the utmost importance
because we are number five on maternal mortality.
Impath, real quick, what was that before?
The Georgia Impath Act is for mental health,
putting mental health,
addressing our mental health issues.
We'll have to have you come back to that.
All right, all right, thank you so much.
Thank you both for being here.
I appreciate that.
That does it for lawmakers today.
We won't have a show tomorrow, but the legislature will meet for day 37, so look for a capital
report from Sarah Callis tomorrow at the end of the PBS NewsHour.
Have a good evening.
