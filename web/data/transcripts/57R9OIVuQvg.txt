TRANSCRIPT
----------
I know that African royalty often raises eyebrows in America thanks to certain infamous emails.
So I can imagine the Google searches to verify that this Nigerian queen was legitimate.
Well, here I am.
And I bring you greetings from his majesty, Ogyama Atsu Ashe III, and the good people of
the warry kingdom in Delta State, Nigeria.
It was a royal affair at the capital today, as a queen of Nigeria paid a visit to promote
her cause, Elevate Africa.
Good evening and welcome to Lawmakers.
I'm Donna Lauer in Atlanta.
More on the queen later.
We've all seen those missing personal alerts.
a new push to include people with autism in Maddy's call. We'll chat with the lawmaker behind
the legislation. We'll also discuss bills aimed at shaking things up for landlords, tenants,
and property owners. One of the most talked about bills this session would ban transgender
athletes from participating in girl sports. The sponsor of the bill in the House version is in
the studio. We also have a lawmaker who voted against it to tell us why. First, let's hear from
from Sarah Callis on what happened on this rainy Monday
in Atlanta at the Capitol.
Hi, Donna.
Perhaps it was legislative hangover
from Thursday's Frentate Cross over day,
but Monday took on a far more mellow mood in both chambers.
In the Senate, the day started with a royal visit
as Queen Allori Atuache, the third,
stopped in to promote her cause, elevate Africa.
The Queen Concert of the Worry, Delta State Nigeria,
had a sense of humor when it came to knowing
who she actually was.
I know that African royalty often raises eyebrows in America
thanks to certain infamous emails.
So I can imagine the Google searches
to verify that this Nigerian queen was legitimate.
Well, well, here I am.
And I bring you greetings from his majesty,
Ogyame Atuache III, and the good people
of the Warri Kingdom in Delta State, Nigeria.
the Elevate Africa non-profits role is to quote
in power in spotlight new African leaders
in indigenous solutions.
Last month we inaugurated our 2025 Elevate Africa Fellows,
17 remarkable fellows from 13 different African countries.
All of them embody the brilliance
our continent offers to the world.
Their work spans from revolutionizing agricultural systems
to pioneering AI-driven healthcare solutions,
innovations that can contribute meaningful answers
to our global pressing problems.
The Senate then took on the only bill on the rule stocket.
HB-15 is a bill that adds cleanup language
in banking and financial laws.
This bill this year particularly contains revisions
to laws impacting banks, bank holding companies,
credit unions, merchant acquired limited purpose banks.
That's a particular term of art.
farm bank offices, installments, lenders, money service businesses, money transmitters,
sellers of payment instruments and check casters.
And there are also a few areas that touch on mortgage lenders and broker laws.
The bill was passed 46 to 1.
The house quickly gabbled in and gabbled out after passing the local calendar.
But members made time to commemorate the municipal electric authority of Georgia.
Thank you to Reputation for Excellence in Governance, Operational Efficiency and Physical Responsibility.
May Ag's contingency success as a testament to the leadership of its management employees
and participant communities who have made public power real asset in Georgia.
And discuss President Donald Trump's administration and its effects on Georgia.
One lawmaker condemned more proposed government agency cuts from President Trump's administration.
The proposed 87,000 federal job cuts within the VA predominantly affected military veterans,
which comprised one-third of agency employees.
This threatens to undermine the very foundation of honor, respect, and gratitude that we owe
our veterans.
The Veterans Administration is not just another government agency.
It is the lifeline for millions of men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting
our freedoms.
Representative Josh Bonner congratulated former U.S. Representative Doug Collins appointment
as VA secretary.
Your colleagues, I just wanted to take a moment to just speak a moment about how proud
we are to have one of our former colleagues, one of our former congressmen, Doug Collins,
is our new secretary of the Veterans Administration.
I've been in communication with Secretary Collins and I'm happy to report that he's doing
an incredible job for us.
While it is true that we will be finding some efficiencies within the veteran administration,
the sole purpose of finding these efficiencies is to do one thing and that's to serve our
veterans better.
And finally, lawmakers prepared to go trout fishing tomorrow.
Tomorrow is trout fishing day.
This is our Georgia Legislative Sportsman's Caucus event tomorrow, Tuesday, March 11, 2 p.m.
to 6 p.m. at the West Palisades Park.
Okay.
That's at 932 acres, res, drives, southeast, the closest place to the Capitol and you can
catch trout fish in.
So everything will be provided, the gear, the waiters, everything is provided.
Just need you to come if you can.
committee meetings will take on new importance this week as they start to look through the
440 bills passed over from each chamber on crossover day with only a month left in this legislative
session. Tomorrow, the House is expected to vote on the budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
And as you know, Donna, it's the one piece of legislation they are mandated to pass each year.
That's my capital report.
Thanks, Sarah. Now to some grim statistics. In 2021, the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children reported 286 children with autism went missing. Wandering is common and
dangerous for children with autism, especially during a warmer months when children are playing
outside. Family gatherings can be high-risk situations for children with autism. Also,
But children with autism may be reluctant to come when their names are called, run away
from police sirens, or be afraid of dogs.
We're going to talk about trying to help families of children and adults with autism and
more.
Joining me is Democratic Representative Carl Giljard of Savannah.
He's Secretary of the House, Creative Arts and Entertainment Committee, and he's on
the House Appropriations Committee.
And Democratic Senator Danzella James of Atlanta.
of Urban Affairs and Vice Chair of Interstate Cooperation.
Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
Thank you.
Representative Killier, we're going to start with you.
What made you introduce House Bill H.B. 465,
the Autism Missing Person Alert System Act?
Well, Donna, it's a bill that saves lives.
My brother, I'm one of 10 children,
and my younger brother has Down syndrome
and suffers from autism.
But there's a young lady named
every spencer who has a son who suffers from autism.
And those are individuals that are a young and adult.
This bill is a saving life bill.
And the GBI had gotten over 175 phone calls this year
for reports of people that were missing.
So how could we come up with a bill that would save lives?
I think House Bill 465 is going to provide that.
And so tell us what the bill would do,
because it passed in the house unanimously.
It is, you know, a unique bill that patterns out the Maddie's Law.
And Maddie's Law is the disability alert for those that have disabled family members.
So this will simply sound the alarm for those that have a family member with autism
dismissing.
The chances are, through the GBI, that the timeframe will be cut down, that law enforcement
could have a better sense of finding that individuals, because of the way the alert goes out.
And with the GBI being the persons that are orchestrating,
I'm sure that I will have a chance to save lives.
And Matty's call also is for elderly people too, so.
It is.
It will be encompassing a lot.
You, you favor this law.
Talk about it a little.
Oh, yes.
I also introduced legislation Senate Bill 211
that almost was exactly like the bill that passed.
But my bill didn't move much in the Senate.
The only difference in my bill was that it added
a ID bracelet for all the people with autism
they could wear it.
Like the ones to say,
I have heart condition or diabetes or whatever.
We want one for autism too,
because these kids, I have a grandson that has autism.
that has autism.
I have only two grandsons,
so his big brother was a genius in doing great
and he's seven years younger
and he's still at Douglas County schools,
but he's different.
He was nonverbal until he was seven.
But when they, I think parents are often in denial.
And so by the time my son and his wife knew something was wrong,
the lieutenant governor, Kasey Kegel,
and I got an opportunity to introduce legislation
so that insurance companies could pay
for the screening for children.
From up to eight years old,
I wanted to make it up to 12, but they made it up to eight.
So we found out, and when I found out
that it would not just help my grandson,
but thousands and thousands of children
eat right here in Georgia.
So yeah, so I'm working very hard on that.
Early screening is important, I know that.
And so I know you'll be supporting his bill
when it comes over the Senate.
That's where it is now.
Absolutely, and I'm very honored that he asked me
to carry it when it got there.
And I'm trying to talk him in to put in just
that little bracelet on there so that we would be able
to also have another way in everything
that we can do to help our artistic young people.
because my mother taught special education
in Atlanta Public Schools,
and the kids are so misunderstood,
and she wants to make sure that we take care of them.
Well, let's hope that we get unanimous in the Senate, too.
But I want to talk to you real quick
about a couple of the things.
Several years ago, for you, for several years,
you fought for tenants' rights,
and you have SB 106.
It would repeal the current law to place restrictions
a rent regulation by local governments.
Tell us about it briefly.
That bill is the rent control bill.
Yeah.
And the state of Georgia has a rent prohibit any rent control.
And it's only one of nine states that
does not have some kind of rent control.
So they prohibited it.
So I want to lift that prohibition
and let local control happen with the cities
and the counties.
Because after Mr. Chair was,
he was a chair of Black Caucus,
and he sent us to all the HBC schools.
And I had an opportunity to talk to so many students
that were having problems finding somewhere to stay.
And it was because the rent was doubling,
tripling, and sometimes quadrupling.
And that's what happens when they get ready
to renew the lease.
And then I found out it's not just the students,
it's our seniors who are now needing to go get a small house.
It's the veterans who are coming back
and want to rent something close by.
So we have a real serious problem with the escalating rent.
And so it's hard to stop that.
And then I found out that it's foreign entities
that come in and buy all these things
and all the buildings and the empty places
or by whole building and the leases that they have now,
those people are gone and they raise them up.
So we need to put this prohibition,
the mayors wanted, the county commissioners
want to have that control,
and they know best was better for their area.
Well, keep an eye on that.
I want to get to some more things.
I represent the Gilliard.
Another of your bills passed unanimously,
H.B. 303, the original 33 act, it refers to Georgia's first 33 African-American lawmakers
in 1868.
After reconstruction, they were some of the first black state legislators in the United
States.
And there's a statue on the Capitol Grounds and their honor.
Tell us what your bill would do.
So you know that the original 33, Donna, they stood up so we can sit down.
And so this bill simply gives us 33 names that will be honored inside the Capitol as a
a memorial, you know, these were 33 heroic Americans.
And they were kicked out.
I didn't say that.
They were kicked out of them.
They were kicked out in 1868.
The legislature.
They were not able to serve.
And 14 of them were lynched.
I want to say that again.
They were lynched.
Wow.
And so this is important that every time I have that little
name tag on, and I think I'm all that in the bag of chips,
I think about the giants of the shoulders that we stand on.
And so this is a fitting tribute to 33 great Americans.
Okay.
And real quick, tell you, you've got some HOA bills, right?
I do.
Give me a little briefing, I'll tell you.
OK.
I want to say real quick, that my uncle, Lira Johnson,
was the first black senator since reconstruction,
and he didn't come until the late 60s and early 70s.
Oh, OK.
Yes, but yes, I do have these HOA bills,
because so many people are having so many problems
with the HOA's now.
and getting their homes taken from them
and sold on the courthouse steps.
So we have to do something.
We've had five hearings.
I put legislation in.
It went through a couple of the committees
and it stayed on the rules now
because it didn't get crossover.
Okay.
Unfortunately.
We'll keep an eye on SB 107 and 108 then for you.
Correct. Thank you.
Thank you.
I want to get in something with you, Representative Gillier.
We have a little time left
and I know that you formed
one of the first positive rap groups
in the nation called Candy Love.
Tell us about it and drop a few beats.
Candy Love was the first.
Let me, let me, let me clear it up
before they was outcast, before they was good at mob.
We were the first.
We were the first kings of the South for rap.
We did positive rap die.
Okay.
So one of the things we did our people fight against
with another, maybe one day they would discover
others lost their lives so we can gain
throw it in lives of crack cocaine.
Release the grip and then you will be free,
get a taste of some spiritualality.
Whatever you do, don't give up the fight.
Stand up and fight for what's right.
All right, Ed.
I just needed somebody to give me a beat to go with that.
All right.
But we were the first.
So I'm looking forward to hearing my comrades
in the General Assembly now try to get me to wrap.
Oh, yeah.
I think that should happen anytime soon.
We'll have you back here on lawmakers.
There you go.
We'll be right here.
Thank you so much.
We'll be paying attention to your bills, which are now,
both of them now in the Senate,
and we'll keep up with what you're doing.
Thank you both for being here today.
I appreciate that.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
All right, coming up, we discuss bills
dealing with maternal health and transgender athletes.
Two members of the Georgia House join us.
This is Lawmakers on GPP.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the state capitol during the session and year-round,
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
And a queen.
I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman.
People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it.
Five-knowledge in our own worth.
Oh, please.
Do continue.

This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
Okay, this is amazing.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking, but look at this.
It really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
Welcome back to Lawmakers I'm Don Allowing.
Both the House and Senate pass bills before crossover day to ban biological males from
playing girl sports.
In the Senate it's called the Fair and Safe Athletic Opportunities Act.
The House Bill is called the Riley Gaines Act, named after a swimmer who became an advocate
for removing transgender women from women's sports.
We're going to talk about that bill and more with two members of the House.
Republican Representative Josh Bonner of Fayetteville is chair of defense and veterans affairs.
He was commissioned as an active duty army officer in military intelligence before transitioning
to the United States Army Reserves and Democratic Representative Ann Westbrook of Savannah.
an attorney, and on the House Economic Development, Tourism Judiciary, and State Planning and
Community Affairs Committees.
Woo!
Welcome to Lawmakers, both of you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Sarah Bonner, tell us why you wanted the Riley Gaines Act.
So I'm the father of two girls, have daughter of play soccer, and it's been very near and
dear to me to make sure that in Georgia, that we protect female athletes.
And so that's exactly what the Riley Gaines Act does.
protects female athletes in Georgia,
and it keeps biological males out of their sports
and out of their locker rooms.
And so that's a subject very near and dear to me,
and it's also with a lot of constituents
and a lot of folks in Georgia.
Okay.
You voted against it?
Why did you say no?
I voted against it because there is nothing going on
in girls and women's sports in Georgia
that is solved by this bill.
There were no, even prior to this bill,
there were no transgender athletes competing
in athletics in Georgia, that's according to reporting from the AJC, even in the entire
NCAA of 500,000 NCAA collegiate athletes, there were less than 10 transgender athletes
competing.
So, with all the issues that we have in Georgia and your previous segment covered many
of them beautifully, affordable housing, lack of access to health care, we don't need
to burn precious legislative days of our 40-day session on an issue that is frankly non-existent
according to the numbers in Georgia. There are issues facing girls and women's sports
throughout the country, including in Georgia. Those issues are under investment and are
programming. Those issues are harassment and abuse. And some of those scandals around
sexual abuse have reached Georgians, but this bill just doesn't solve anything that's going
on in Georgia.
All right.
Your response?
Well, I was certainly pushed back on that.
We do know that it's happening in Georgia.
We know that it has happened.
We passed a rule a law two years ago that allowed the Georgia High School Association
to put into rule a ban on biological males participating in female athletics.
So we certainly haven't seen it in that period of time.
But we know it's happening based on the testimony of those that came to committee that were
against the bill, a number of those folks said that they did participate in female athletics.
And so, and I would push back to say, even if it's just one, who wants to sacrifice their
daughter on this altar of ideology when we don't have to?
So who wants to be the one?
One is too many in my opinion, and I think we owe it to every female athlete in Georgia
to offer a level playing field that they can compete on.
You did have some Democrats vote for it, but mostly in the long party lines, right?
We certainly was a majority party line vote, but we did, in both in the Senate version
and the House version, we did have some Democrats vote with us, and we're certainly appreciative
of that.
And I think it certainly shows that this truly is a bipartisan issue that when the polling
is done throughout Georgia and the U.S., it's overwhelmingly in support of this legislation.
Anything you want to add?
Yeah, I'll just add, there have been many dark periods in our history where things have
of pulled well, where things were popular.
And, you know, history doesn't repeat,
but it often rhymes, and scapegoats change
at different times in our history,
but one thing we often hear,
when we are seeing individuals scapegoated
as we're doing it for our women and our girls.
And so as someone who played sports
all the way through college,
my college athletics, my earlier years in athletics
were my leadership training, what got me here,
and I know I have colleagues in the house
who have that same story, this isn't what girls and women need.
We need support for our programming and all those kinds of issues.
We don't need to be used as political props.
All right.
Chairman Bonner, now we've got you, you have passed it in the House to the Senate.
The Senate has passed the House.
Tell us what happens next with these two bills since they're so similar.
Certainly.
Well, so we're certainly working with our Senate colleagues.
Our goal is regardless of what version emerges, our goal is the same, to protect female
athletes in Georgia.
And so whichever version of the bill does that, we're certainly going to push forward,
but we'll be working very close with our senate colleagues in making sure that the input
that they put forward is incorporated into the bill.
Okay.
We'll see.
We're going to change gears right now.
We'll see what happens with that.
We're president Westbrook, HB488, another bill that you sponsored, the Pregnancy Center
Fraud Prevention Act, which aims to prevent pregnancy centers from misleading advertising.
You spoke on the issue last month during a big rally in favor of your legislation.
What are pregnancy centers and what would your bill do?
Well, these centers go by a number of different names.
Sometimes they're called crisis pregnancy centers.
Sometimes they're called anti-abortion centers.
Sometimes they're called fake clinics.
But they confuse and mislead women.
They are not clear about what services they offer, what services they don't offer.
They really exist to talk women out of having abortions, and they do that by sort of dressing
up and masquerading as health clinics.
But they do not have to provide the range of health services that clinics do.
They don't provide the standard of care that medical clinics do.
They're not bound by HIPAA.
And so women go into these centers thinking they're getting one thing.
And what they're actually getting is counseling out of one of their options that's available
to them under the law in Georgia.
They aren't regulated as business enterprises because they're nonprofits generally.
And they aren't regulated as health providers because they aren't health providers.
In fact, you'll see those disclaimers sometimes on their website that we are not a substitute
for healthcare.
So at a time where we know that maternal mortality is sky high in Georgia and those rates are
not coming down, infant mortality is high in Georgia.
Women can't access OB-GYNs in half of Georgia's counties.
Pediatric care is hard to access in about 42% of Georgia's counties.
We shouldn't be funding these clinics that don't actually provide health care.
Women have a right to accurate evidence-based care.
So the bill on the first bill would prohibit basically false advertising by these crisis
pregnancy centers.
And it would all, the second bill, the companion bill, two bills actually are companion bills
address the funding because Georgia funds these crisis pregnancy centers, these sort of
fake clinics, to the tune of $2 million every single year.
And given the state of women's health care in Georgia, Georgia's have a right to ask
whether that's the highest-invest use of their tax dollars.
My bills would redirect that funding
to an evidence-based home-visiting program
that's already being used in Georgia
and it's getting better outcomes for moms and babies.
Okay, nothing passed by four crossover days,
but it's still alive.
That's right.
We'll see what happens next.
Next, but next year because it's a biennium.
I'm gonna change gears a little bit.
You spoke on the floor today.
You praised Georgia Congressman Doug Collins,
who is the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
tell me what you learned about what he's planning.
Well, as all of our federal agencies are doing now,
they're looking at how to find efficiencies in government.
And the Veterans Administration is one
that routinely constituents of mine
of folks all over the state of Georgia of Veterans
don't have great experiences with the VA.
It's a very bloated and inefficient agency.
And so what Congressman Collins, Secretary of
Collins, is doing is seeking to find
efficiencies in that.
So it's not making any cuts to the frontline workers
that provide the service, but a lot of the administrative
and back-end work.
All the things where the process has been kind of
gummed up for veterans.
And so the overall goal of finding those efficiencies is
to make sure that the veterans receive the benefits
they've already earned and receive the best health care
that they can.
OK, we'll keep up with all of that.
I'm going to get one more bill in for you.
You have another of your areas of interest
as maternal health care.
And with health resolution 274,
it would, you want to allocate more money
to actually two million more dollars
to the Georgia pregnancy and early childhood
home visiting program.
Tell us about that.
And we'll run out of time soon.
I'll be quick.
Because I kind of covered this a little bit already.
This is basically just reallocating those dollars.
Instead of sending $2 million every single year
Georgia taxpayer money to clinics that don't actually provide health care.
Let's redirect that.
Let's direct that to this home visiting program that is already established.
It's serving women and babies in rural Georgia and it's getting great outcomes.
Okay.
And you had a veterans bill.
Tell us about it.
So there's a number of veterans bills that we got passed.
In fact, Representative Westbrook and our co-signed a veterans bill together.
So there are ways we can work together for our veterans.
But one in particular that I'd like to highlight is the Save Act.
It is a bill that regulates the claims consultant industry.
These are the companies that come in and help veterans assemble their packets to apply for
benefits and get them that much faster.
We provide a regulatory framework for those companies that allows them to operate in Georgia
regulated and allows a veteran to get those benefits that much faster.
And how did your bill do?
So it passed over to the Senate and we're hoping to have a hearing this next week in the
Senate committee.
Who's carrying it for you?
That would be Senator Chuck Payne.
Okay, and is he a veteran too?
He is.
All right.
So you're feeling pretty good about that.
I am.
He's the chairman of their veterans committee in the Senate,
and that particular bill was voted out of the Senate last year,
and we've got high expectations this year.
Yeah, can you believe after the day, ten days left?
Ten days.
You guys have a lot of work to do, and not much time to do it in, though.
That's right.
But you're ready, huh?
We are.
Okay.
We'll stick with it.
Well, thank you both for coming on the show.
I appreciate it.
Thank you, John.
Thank you for having me.
Today, tomorrow, my conversation with the Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Commissioner Kevin Tanner.
Among other things, we'll talk about forensic beds for people in jail who may need mental health services.
Until then, have a good night.
The End
