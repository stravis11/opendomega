TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
So we will call our meeting to order. I'm gonna ask Senator Williams if you'll open
up with a prayer. Let us pray. The day Heavenly Father, we thank you again for the many blessings
and opportunities that you've given us all. I thank you again for our men and women and
blue and our men and women in harm's way and the armed forces. Please bless them and protect
them. Give us strength, give us courage, give us knowledge to carry out the duties of this great
state of Georgia and give us level heads and give us all the courage and the patience and the
strength and the name we pray, amen. Thank you, Senator. Welcome back. It seems like it's been a while
since we've had an opportunity to visit in this committee. We have on the agenda this evening two
pieces of legislation that we wish to consider. You have it on the agenda. Senate Bill 355 by
by Senator Robinson and Senate Bill 358
by Senator Burns.
I'm going to ask Senator Robinson
if he would provide presentation for SB 355.
What about him, Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes the Senator from Savannah.
We have no notebooks on this end.
Well, let's get that carried.
Let's get that taken care of.
I think he's starting now.
We'll hold until you get a full set
Information Center. Thank you for that.
We'll get this in ministry to be organized and
And move
Well, you know it probably had to come up I-16 and it got caught in that traffic down around Jonesboro
And that what happened to you center
It happens to me all that
Well, I'm glad the notebook finally arrived from Savannah
If you would as you look at the agenda you will see that SB 355
Yes, it's Tyrone.
Oh, thank you.
All right.
Now we got Tyrone covered, Savannah covered, Augusta covered.
We've even got Katala covered.
That's good.
Senator Robertson, if you would please share the input from SB 355, your mic number, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
and thank you for allowing me to present from my seat.
I'm looking at Senate Bill 355, LC560021.
Mr. Chairman and committee members,
I don't think any of us will deny the amount of confusion
that the state of Georgia and the citizens
that live here have suffered since the elections of 2016.
I think we remember right after that election,
there were all talks of fraud, voter fraud,
ballot stuffing, ballot box stuffing,
and all kind of accusations made.
These accusations at that time,
we were told that our secretary of state at the time
had manipulated the elections,
and our citizens were in an uproar,
and there was a polarization amongst citizens
that we had not seen in my lifetime when it come to elections and then four
years later, in 2020, we saw it again even greater. Our constituents,
confidence in our elections were absolutely cratered. The state's response to
these citizens has been weak at best. The 180 members of the house and the 56
members of the Senate have done the best job we could to go out and try to
restore the confidence in the voters and the men and women who send us here to
carry out what they think is their business and to manage their money, their
tax dollars, responsibly and in the best way possible. But still each and
every day. We are all flooded, whether it be text messages, whether it is emails or letters
of citizens still concerned about the integrity of our elections. SB 202 that we fought for
and passed just a couple of years ago went a long way in correcting some of these problems,
but we still have a ways to go. And I'm going to tell you what we do not need to do is
attempt to change horses in the middle of a race while we are solving the problems that
have been around since 2016. And so last year, an initiative was taken to bring in something
that is commonly called ranked choice voting into Georgia. This has been an extraordinarily
successful campaign throughout the country. It is a well-funded campaign with lobbyists
in all states attempting to do this.
What they have succeeded in doing is putting
rank choice voting and a lot of municipalities.
And I want to be clear, rank choice voting is not new.
Rank choice voting was around in the early 1900s.
And because of issues related to rank choice voting,
it went away.
And then later in the, I believe if I'm right,
It's going to be in the late 70s, possibly early 80s.
The discussion started again.
And in the early 2000s, rank choice voting was brought back.
We saw some of the chaos associated with rank choice voting
and the New York mayor's race, where it was over 15 days
before the citizens of New York knew who their mayor was going
to be because of the process used to count rank choice votes.
And if you've never seen a rank choice vote ballot,
it looks much like in some races,
like the lottery card that you pick up at the circle K
with all the bubbles on it.
You have many, many choices,
and there is a certain way you have to go through
to rank your choices,
whether they're three candidates on the ballot
or whether they're 20 candidates on the ballot.
I have a sample of a ballot that was used in 2013,
and many anapolis in their mayor's race,
where you have a possibility of 40,495
possible combinations of candidates.
And understand, we have citizens in Georgia
that are complaining because they're having problems
with touch screens, they're having problems
with ballot scanners, they're having problems
with QR codes, and many of them on both sides of the aisle
concerned about waiting in line in our precincts. If you want someone to wait in line all day,
whether it be you and your healthy self or your 80-year-old grandmother, then hand her a ballot
with all of these choices and all these decisions that needed to be made and all of these bubbles
on it and ask her to stand in there and rate her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth
candidates when in actuality she may only want to vote for one person and so if her one person does
not get the majority of the vote on one of the one of the first or second ballots then
her vote is gone away it's thrown it's the ballot is discarded and we move on to the votes of
the other individuals but what this legislation does is it prevents ranked choice voting in Georgia
except for those who already have the opportunity to do it and that are our
men and women who serve in the military and rightly so they should have a right
that is unique to them so they could vote because with run-offs and other
types of contests they don't they're not afforded the opportunity that the
rest of us have of getting in our vehicle and driving to our local precinct
and voting on that day but to be clear some of the biggest problems with
ranked choice voting as it is today are exhausted votes. In other words, votes just don't count.
They're exhausted. It means that your vote either over-voted or under-voted, which means you
inadvertently voted twice on the same column. Or you under-voted, which means you skipped over
one of those columns to vote because you were confused whether the columns were horizontal or lateral.
Or you chose only a candidate who hadn't advanced any further rounds.
Therefore, your ballots exhausted.
There was a rank choice voting election.
And I know it's going to shock everybody, but rank choice voting is done in San Francisco.
It went for 20 rounds and exhausted over 10,000 votes.
And I can tell you, Senator Williams, who has the most experience
As as a as an election supervisor than anybody in the general assembly that I'm aware of
Could tell you that if he had to tell the voters waiting to see the results of election that there had to be 20 rounds of counting votes
To determine who won there would be chaos in his community. This was in San Francisco
Ranked choice voting and it's if you are confused
Don't feel left out. It's a very confusing process this confusion has left to it has led to it
voter turnout that is lower than what is normally looked at throughout the
United States. And I believe that is one of the things we tried to address in
SB202 was to increase the number of individuals who had to write to vote. And I
believe everybody from the governor to the Secretary of State, everybody in the
House and the Senate have realized that the the corrections that we made, the
steps forward that we took in SB 202 increased voter turnout to record numbers.
And I think if we bring something like rank choice voting into the state of Georgia,
we will reverse that trend.
Rank choice voting has a tendency to recruit and draft individuals who want to disrupt
the process, to process delays by coming up with concerted plans as to where they want
I count where they want to cast their one vote for the candidate they really want and
then how they manipulate the other votes after that in order to eliminate the biggest threat
candidate in the race.
One of the biggest targets for ranked choice voting is third party candidates.
All of us have to go out and run for election.
I happen to go out and run for election as a Republican.
I have, I've had opponents who ran his Democrats.
And if an independent wanted to come out and run, they have that right.
If they follow Georgia law, they have the right to be on the ballot with me just as much
as the Democrat does.
And it is my job as a candidate to go out and try to get every vote I can.
Not just for my Republican friends, but for my Democratic friends, my independent friends.
I do not need a game system set up
to eliminate an independent
who may be just as qualified to serve
in the Georgia State Senate as I am.
And rank choice voting sets that up.
I look forward to the testimony from the experts today
and I think once you hear the testimony you will realize
that rank choice voting while being very novel
and being very unique would be chaos to elections
in the state of Georgia.
And with that, Mr. Chair, I'll yield to any questions
from the committee.
Questions from the committee for the author.
You must have done it.
I'd say I thought you'd done a great job
because there were no, I can guess where it's coming from.
May, from the gentleman from the gentleman from Savannah.
Chair recognized the gentleman from Savannah.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to my colleague,
the Senator from the 29.
I think I've pretty much got that district down pad.
Is it not true that the ranked choice voting
will eliminate the extremism we get
from the dedicated primaries?
No sir, actually it increases it.
It increases the extremism as the last issue
I was discussing where it gives certain groups
on both sides opportunities to come in and manipulate,
especially those elections with multiple candidates.
As far as there are certain issues,
if you review a lot of what the proponents
of ranked choice voting say, you know,
they're trying to look at making our elections
least polarizing, less unfriendly.
Well, I think you and I know that
if you want to find Republicans and Democrats
that treat each other with the utmost respect
is the men and women inside this building.
and we tend to do that.
And a vast majority of the polarization
that happens here in the state of Georgia
is what we read about in the news and on television
because the vast majority of the citizens out there
are too busy to try to polarize it.
While I agree there is polarization in certain pockets,
rank choice voting does nothing to eliminate the pro-polarizing
and my contention is it does more to aggravate it.
To my good friend from the second best city
the state of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, one follow a question. Yes, sir. Senator, you are
aware that the Savannah is the first city in Georgia and therefore the best city because
we are the first city. Yes, sir. You always want to you always want to be the second ones
you can correct the mistakes that the first one made. Thank you for that clarification. I
appreciate other questions for the off for the author. Seeing none, we will go to first
to some invited testimony from individuals from with interest in this issue and then we'll
take public input. Chair, I'd like to recognize via Zoom, Manonlin, Melissa, is that right?
That's right, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Melissa. Let's see if we can't get you on the screen.
If you would just identify, thank you, identify yourself again and tell us where you're from.
I think it's Maine.
It sure is.
Thank you, Chairman Burns and Vice Chairman Williams and Honorable Members of the Committee.
My name is Madeline.
I am a visiting fellow at the Opportunity Solutions Project.
We are a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.
we work all over the country with one clear goal,
which is to help more people achieve the American dream.
And I'd just like to thank the committee
for the opportunity to testify via Zoom today.
I am due with a baby on February 8th,
so unfortunately not able to be there in person,
but I appreciate the opportunity
to testify here via Zoom.
And I would like to thank the sponsor,
Senator Robinson, Lieutenant Governor, Jones,
and Chairman Burns for all making this bill
priority this session. I'll say Georgia is a national leader on election integrity. As the
sponsor mentioned since 2016, the General Assembly has heard voters concern and taken action.
There are forms that you've passed have increased election security and transparency and accountability.
As a result, as you know, well, Georgia experienced record registration and turnout in the 2022
midterms. And I think that's a testament to the hard work of the lawmakers in your state.
And I'll tell you states across the country are looking to your example.
And I would submit that banning ranked choice voting is the next step in protecting Georgia voters.
And as the sponsor mentioned, SB 355 will protect voters by prohibiting ranked choice voting
for all federal, state, and local elections with an exemption for you, a Cava voters
to comply with the timelines that are set by federal law.
So first today, I'd like to give you an idea
about what's going on nationally with ranked choice voting.
In 2023, there were a record 74 bills sponsored
by a variety of proponents in favor of ranked choice voting.
But lawmakers across the country have wisely rejected this.
And since 2022, Florida, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana,
and South Dakota have all banned its statewide and preempted
local jurisdictions from adopting it.
And I'll tell you just in the last few months, Louisiana
and Missouri, South Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah,
and Wisconsin have all introduced bills
similar to the legislation here today.
In fact, no legislature is actually ever enacted
ranked choice voting statewide.
Maine and Alaska are the only two states
to use the system in addition to local jurisdictions.
And it was because they were passed
by ballot initiatives, some majorities.
So let me tell you why I'm here before your committee today.
I'm a lawyer and a policy expert,
but I'm also a voter and I live in Portland, Maine.
So I've been voting in bank choice voting elections
since 2018, both at the local level and at the state level.
And I can tell you from personal experience
that bank choice voting has been a disaster.
It has been a disaster for voters in my state.
It has been a disaster for candidates
running for public office.
And it has also been a disaster for election officials.
I'd like to tell you a few of those reasons.
So first, as the sponsor mentioned,
ranked choice voting requires legitimate ballots
actually to be thrown out.
And I think we can all agree that Americans win
when their votes count.
But in every election that uses ranked choice voting,
ballots are thrown out.
This is a design of the system.
It's a feature, it's not a bug.
So as the senator said, so how does this happen, right?
So unlike a traditional runoff election
under a ranked choice voting system,
voters have to vote for all of the candidates.
He described it as a lottery ticket.
And I would say it's like a CBS receipt.
If you look at the ballot, it's long and it's cumbersome.
And voters are required to vote for every single candidate
down the ballot in order to have their votes count.
And that is an order for the system
to manufacture that 50 plus one majority.
So if a voter decides that they only
want to vote for one candidate as they do right now in Georgia,
either as their first choice or for all the choices,
And that candidates no longer in contention,
the ballot is thrown out.
So let me tell you how that's worked
on the track record in the real world here.
So in Maine, our 2018, our second congressional district,
it's our northern district or rural district,
there were over 8,000 ballots that were thrown out.
These are people who showed up on election day,
cast their ballots only to have them discarded.
They walked away, not knowing whether or not
their ballots counted, those voters could have just stayed home.
And the last guy who was also experienced similar results
in their 2022 special election,
this was the one to fill the seat of the late Congressman
Don Young.
There were nearly 15,000 ballots thrown out.
And in New York City's 2021,
it was the Democratic mayoral primary,
140,000 ballots were thrown out.
That was nearly 15% of the total ballots cast.
I think we can all agree that that is a huge problem
for voters.
So the second big issue is the delayed results
and rank choice voting, which of course,
as we know, causes mistrust from the voters,
rank choice voting guarantees multiple rounds
of ballot counting because of the complicated nature
of the ballots and the tabulation.
So if no candidate receives a majority,
this process has to go on.
And as the sponsor mentioned,
sometimes 20 rounds, like in that San Francisco race,
it delays results sometimes for weeks, months,
and I'll give you an example.
This is in 2022 out of Alameda County, California.
You may have heard about this race.
It was a glitch in the ranked choice putting software
at two months after the election was certified.
So the third place winner had actually,
the third place finisher had actually won that election.
And then in the 2021 New York City Democratic
mayoral primary that I mentioned,
that was thrown into absolute chaos
because a week after counting,
there were 11 rounds of tabulation,
they thought discovered an error as well,
135,000 test ballots had been counted by mistake.
So it took eight additional rounds of counting
and a month to declare the winner.
Even though Eric Adams had actually won
in the first round of that race.
And here in Maine, I'll tell you,
we had eight days to decide the official winner
of our 2022 Congressional race up in the second district
because of a technical snaffoo.
It led to two memory sticks,
which had recorded more than 16,000 ballots.
They were corrupted.
So ballots are discarded, results are delayed.
And I will tell you,
it is incredibly complicated voting process.
And I urge you to take a look,
as the senator said, that Minneapolis race,
the ballots, incredibly confusing.
So if you've never seen it, take a look.
And I'll say also voters are given an ultimatum, right?
So that's a really important point
I want you to consider for the voters in your district.
Either vote for people you dislike,
who might pose your principles,
or risk having your ballot toss the side.
That is the choice of ranked choice voting.
So into those of you who hold elective office,
unless you want your ballot to be tossed,
you would actually have to vote for your opponent
in your race under ranked choice voting.
Again, consider the voters in your district,
vulnerable voters like the elderly, right?
That's what happens here in Maine.
I'm telling you race after race.
They've been voting one way,
and now all of a sudden they are forced to vote
for all of those candidates all the way down the ticket
in order to guarantee that their ballots will count.
Another really important point I wanna reiterate here
before the committee is that underranked choice voting,
winners, losers, and losers win.
That's a routine issue with rank choice voting.
So in that congressional race here in Maine
that I was mentioning, the incumbent actually received
the most first place votes,
beating as opponent by almost 1%,
he would have been the winner under a traditional election,
but because of the challenger,
was declared the election because of rank choice voting.
And that challenger never actually received
majority of the ballots cast in the election only a majority of the ballots that were not tossed
aside. And I want to give you one more local example where I live in Portland, Maine. We had a race
in 2021. There was a candidate who had a mere four percent of the vote after the first round of
tabulation, but he won and was given a seat locally on our government because of ranked choice
voting. So I urge you just think about your most recent election or your colleagues. Does that
kind of result sound fair. And I can tell you as a voter, results like these do not inspire confidence.
One other point I'd like to make is just the instant runoff voting is a real misnomer.
I heard a lot of people just say this is an instant version of a general runoff.
Well, it's not. Ranked choice voting is not an instant runoff vote because of all of the delays
that are required under the system. And it's not a viable alternative because ballots are thrown
out. It does not produce a majority. It is an instant and it turns winners into losers.
I think we can all agree that elections should be fair and prompt and inspire voter confidence
and every vote should count. Any voting that by design throws out valid votes should be banned.
It's un-American, un-democratic, and I urge you to protect the voters in your state by rejecting
this disaster's voting system, the nightmare that we've lifted your main and supporting SB 355.
I appreciate your time and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you.
Thank you for your input. I look to the committee of the questions for
the invited witness. Any questions?
Seeing no questions. Thank you for your input. We appreciate it. I need a
temperature alert. What's the temperature where you are in Portland, Maine today?
Well, I'm going to tell you we had 14 inches of snow last week. So it's chilly here.
Okay, I want to make one comment. I've never shoveled humidity.
So south, you can put your snow shovel away, okay?
Do we know to thank you for your input? Thank you.
It's the right, it's the other set, all right. Our second person is Jordan Kiddelsen. Jordan,
are you here? If you join us please, if you could, limit your comments around five minutes,
and then we'll take questions as appropriate. State your name and your professional affiliation.
Chairman Burns and distinguished members of the committee, my name is Jordan Kiddelsen.
I'm the policy director for the America First Policy Institute and I came in today from
the other bastion of election integrity, the beautiful state of Arizona.
I appear before you today in support of Senate Bill 355
to prohibit rent choice voting
for any local, state, or federal elected office.
R-C-V is a confusing,
chaotic, disenfranchising system
whereby the person with the most votes doesn't always win,
which is essentially un-American to his core.
The process makes the fundamental right
voting harder for both voters and election workers alike. As the voter is easily prone to make
mistakes during what is an unnecessarily prolonged period of multiple voting rounds, a ranking candidate
preferences, after which if not submitted correctly, the person's vote ultimately isn't counted
anyway because their preferred candidate has been eliminated from contention due to ballot
exhaustion. Our system is built upon the fairness and transparency of one person having their one
vote counted one time, not one in which some people's votes are worth more than others. And I
think every senator sitting in this committee would agree with that notion. Members of this committee
also agree that election workers are already under a significant amount of pressure.
Imagine a scenario in which these same people are compelled to preside over a system where
instead of counting totals for two candidates for office, the election workers and their
equipment rank the order of ballots for multiple candidates for an office, then redistribute
and re-rank those votes multiple times after the first count until eventually one candidate
It reaches 50 plus one.
Truth be told, most Democrats and Republicans I know in this state and around the country
agree that this could even make a voting machine cry.
What this simply translates to is more pressure, more counting errors, and a more time consuming
environment when more Georgians than ever are demanding and deserve timely and accurate
election results.
And it make matters worse, a recent MIT study showed that our CV in Maine increased rather
than reduced outside spending on the toxic negative political advertisements that millions
of Americans have come to resent.
And in a recent school board election in Oakland, California, where rain choice voting was
used, a major error led to local officials even swearing in the wrong winter.
It took three and a half months before the rightful winner was sworn in.
Is this the type of complexity and twisted process that we wish to subject hundreds of
thousands of voters in Georgia to?
In fact, in Alaska, since ballot measure two was passed in 2020, implementing California
style jungle primaries and rain choice voting, Alaskans have collected just in the past several
months, over twice, the required number of signatures needed to send to the legislature
a full repeal of rain choice voting. With full consideration of this testimony today,
I urge the members of this committee to move this bill forward and I applaud Chairman
Burns, Senator Robertson, Lieutenant Governor Jones and members of this committee for raising
awareness to this issue and yield the remainder of my time back to the chair. Thank you very
much. Thank you for your input. You do have a question. Senator from the second.
Now, I haven't studied ranked choice voting and I haven't read a litany of information,
but just follow me with my public school education. If myself, the center from the second
and the center from the 29th were on the ballot. Now, we don't agree on everything
after time. But if we're on the ballot and then we were with the good senator from Augusta
and the 22nd and we were all three on the ballot and the senator from the 29th beat us both out
because he got over 50 and one. It ain't no, it ain't no risk on. He's ahead plus the 51 so there's
no need for any risk on. Is that not true? So ring choice voting has oftentimes
been termed the Common Core of Elections. And so the Common Core of Elections doesn't
begin until one candidate does not reach 50 plus 1. If the candidate, if there is a candidate
that reaches 50 plus 1 in the first round, then they are declared the winner. It's only
if they don't reach 50 plus 1 where it goes through multiple rounds of tabulation. However,
that scenario is not likely because in a in a in rain choice voting, oftentimes final five
voting is utilized for the purposes of the primary election. And those top five candidates
from the primary make their way into the general. So it is very difficult for a candidate
to achieve 50 plus one when you have several candidates
running on the same ballot in the general.
Just one of the follow-up questions, Chairman.
So when we talk about the ranked choice voting
like for example, I follow the states
as you've mentioned, you came from Arizona.
So for example, in Alaska, there's a Democratic Congress
woman who loves guns, fish, and has one
because of ranked choice voting because she is a Democrat,
but she loves guns and fish and she's in Alaska.
So she's prevailed because for folks who love guns,
fish and Alaska, she's the candidate of their choice.
So I'm just trying to understand
how that diminishes a voter's capacity
because it allows them the opportunity
to pick somebody that likes their ideals
because I might like guns
and I know the Senator from 29 likes guns
but the Senator from 22 may not.
So, you know, we might get kicked out of the race
and the center from 22nd is still in
because he doesn't like guns.
But that's just my understanding of it.
Maybe you can shed light on that
a little bit better for him.
Well, because of the capacity that I appear in,
I can't go into the philosophical ideological component
of rain choice voting,
but I will tell you in that Alaska election
in the initial round of voting,
there were far more votes for the other two candidates
initially then there were for the the ultimate winner in that election. So the will of the voters were ultimately ignored because the election went through multiple rounds of tabulation.
And in Alaska, as you well know, how could you rightfully have an at large congressional election whereby somebody of that persuasion.
one or advanced through the election but then you have a state in the presidential contest
that went so far in the other direction. It seems like there is an attempt and effort
to disenfranchise voters and instead insert other winners who really ultimately were losers initially
in the first round. That is the most disenfranchising thing because oftentimes when the person who
has won the election has been declared the winner by that time, there have been thousands and
thousands of ballots that have been tossed and people as a result that have been disenfranchised.
And so any election, any system of voting whereby you have some ballots that have been counted
and other ballots that have been subject to what's called ballot exhaustion or tossed or thrown out
that goes against the very foundational concepts of freedom fairness and transparency
that are founding fathers originally meant for this country. And it's how I wanted to find
that question. I just want to clarify that you can have a state that goes in totally different
directions. The state of Kentucky has a Democratic governor, two Republican US senators,
and overwhelmingly went for former president Trump. So I don't believe that that's true at all.
Thank you for your question. Other questions from the committee.
Chair, C's nine. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate your input. We've now, I'm sorry we have a question.
Oh, you like fishing? Oh, you like fishing? That's right. That's right, especially Alaska.
Thank you. I appreciate your input. We've heard from two individuals that are supportive of the
bill. We're not going to hear from three individuals that oppose the bill. And I'd like to invite
Scott Turner, former State Representative Scott Turner to come join us and share with us your input.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I had actually prepared a couple of notes, but I want to answer a couple of questions that kind of came up just now.
And Senator Milo's question over and I hate talking about Alaska because nobody nobody in Georgia is pitching you the Alaska model so we can discount that all together.
But a unique thing did happen in Alaska and over a third of Nick Begge who was a republicans the other republican besides
Sarah Palin in that race over a third of of Sarah Palin or Nick Begge's voters voted for the Democrat in that race
That was a will of the people's election result. So to your point, there was a great deal of crossover
And that's based upon candidate quality first and foremost and I believe elections are one
not by systems but by candidate quality first and foremost, but you know in 2013 I was elected
in a special election there were five of us in that first round and I think one of them dropped
out got this qualifiers there was four of us heading into election day on January 5th 2013
and I was 122 votes shy of winning without running off in a four-way race and I had this whole big
agenda in my head, and I had to sit and wait for a month while I went and run a special
election runoff.
And that runoff happened on February 5th, 2013, and the vote total, the vote total for
total turnout was 1,500 votes, which was about what I got in the first round, when there
were four people in the vote.
And I wanted to talk about ethics reform, and I wanted to talk about civil asset forperture
reform, and I wanted to talk about liberty and justice for all.
And the very first conversation I ever have with Speaker David Rolson, he asked me, what
do you want to work on?
I said, I want to get rid of runoffs.
And he said, you might find some analyze in this building.
And took me a while, State Representative Wes Cantrell came along later and convinced me
that ranked choice voting was the solution to our runoff problem and runoffs are a problem
in Georgia.
I live here, by the way, I'm not an outside group.
I represented my first house just for eight years, honorably.
I'm here to advocate for my neighbors,
not from some far off place,
but Kennesaw State University recently published a study
where they said $75 million out of local coffers
have to be used for any statewide runoff.
$75 million, think about that for a second.
That's hot holes that can't be filled.
That's a playground that can't be built.
That's a police officer salary that goes on paid.
$75 million, that's a problem.
The second problem is,
these folks who are talking about on the screen
And to come up here and they talk about trash ballots or ballots that are thrown out in some of our latest runoffs that we've had for US Senate, 500,000 people don't come back.
Their first round vote thrown out like it never counted their voices silenced by our current runoff system.
It's not right.
It's been as high as many 750,000 people haven't come back to vote in the second round.
Now, there are some people who aren't going to vote for a second choice on a ballot,
but I would posit to you if you give them the opportunity, be far less than what we see in our
current system today. The second thing is, or the third thing that this Kennesaw State
talked about was the actual political climate of runoffs and how much more negative
through the holidays, we have to be bombarded with negative advertisements. And you can get that.
I've sent it to all of you last year and years previous. It's not a new study. It's been out
for a couple of years now. SB 202 introduced our CV to Georgia, meaning that if you voted for SB 202,
you actually voted to bring ranked choice voting to Georgia for the first time. It's the only way
it's ever been used in Georgia for military and overseas voters. It allowed for a very specific reason.
It allowed us to go from a two month runoff where we were certifying our final winners in January
to a one month runoff where we are certifying now at the end of November, early December.
SB 355 cars out in exception for these folks, so you're not actually banning anything,
and it's important to know that you, O'Coffe, is the only thing that we use Ranked Choice
Voting for.
So you are actually passing a piece of legislation that doesn't ban anything new.
And in fact, creates an exception that preserves Ranked Choice Voting for Georgia.
So you're not actually doing the thing that you're set out to do in banning Ranked Choice
Voting.
If it's so bad, if Ranked Choice Voting is so bad,
why are you subjecting our men and women in uniform
to something that is confusing and would disenfranchise them?
It doesn't make sense.
Your work on SB202 and allowing for Ranked Choice Voting
met a very specific need.
You saw value in it.
You would never ban it because it's working for this specific instance.
We have no stories of a soldier or marine or airman being confused by the ranked choice
ballot.
At least not that I know of, I mean, maybe they're out there.
If ranked choice voting, I want to talk about a little bit about timing too.
City of Boulder, Colorado just ran a ranked choice ballot.
They have multiple rounds.
You know, I've heard some folks come up here and tell you it takes forever for the results to be tallied sitting in Boulder, Colorado had multiple rounds. They ran their instant runoffs within a couple of days.
They declared a winner within a few days had certified results by the end of the week of the election.
Compare that to how we do it today.
At a minimum, we don't know who our winner is for a month and we have to pay for it $75 million.
And we have half a million people who are silenced by that process.
You know, there's a study by Ted Cowser, he's a political science professor, he says, for
every one piece of misinformation, you have to overcome that with four pieces of refutation.
And unfortunately, that's where we find ourselves in the RCV debate today.
We recently had a panel discussion.
I invited you all, and I hope that you'll have an opportunity to watch the video where
We debunked many of the myths about ring choice voting.
The panel featured, but at least one of the folks
you'll hear from today, who has actually
run ring choice voting elections.
And we collected emails from legislators,
from you guys that sent us the stuff
that you are hearing from people who
are opposed to ring choice voting.
And what we found is the opposition really fits into two
categories.
The first category is demonstrably false.
It's just untrue.
Second category is, technically true,
but run-offs are worse.
And I'll give you a couple examples.
One opponent, I'm sorry, in the post-election polls,
wherever rain choice voting is used,
whether it's in Maine, Utah,
Republican Party of Georgia of Virginia,
wherever it's used, 80 to 90% of the people say
it was simple and easy and it wasn't confusing whatsoever.
That's across the board, doesn't matter where,
could be a blue state, red state, doesn't matter,
happened in New York, even with all the stuff
that has allegedly been confusing about New York.
It's just not confusing.
The only thing confusing about rain choice voting
is the opposition.
Rain choice voting is as easy as one, two, three.
Think about your three favorite ice cream colors,
which one do you want first?
Here's your first choice.
You go to Baskin Robbins,
I'm sure you can come up with 40,000
different combinations of Baskin Robbins.
You have no problem picking out who your first choice is.
The second thing is I have heard a opposition to a brain choice voting talk about one specific
race out in Burlington, Vermont and they talk about how the first round candidate got 29%
of the vote and then that person became the winner and they say any system where somebody
can only get 29% in the first round and become the winner is not legitimate and let me introduce
you to two individuals. The first is Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan. Got 26.7% of the vote
in his first round. He became Lieutenant Governor of the state. Second person I want to introduce
to is Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp got 25.5% in his first round. Last time I checked, it's less than 29%
became Governor of the state and has led us through some tumultuous times with an ease,
What a great leader, leader, Brian campus.
That's not a knock on Ranked Choice Voting or Instant Run-Offs.
That's a knock on any type of run-off.
Those types of results happen today.
It's not a knock on Ranked Choice Voting.
I have a lot of other stuff written down.
I'm really passionate about this issue because I want to see elections in Georgia maximize as a conservative.
a conservative. I want to see, I want to see elections run as efficiently as possible. I want to see
people's voices have maximum opportunity to be heard. And I want to see elections run without
a two months extra runoff. And I think the people of Georgia want that to, and they at least would
like an opportunity to have to use this in very key specific ways so they can continue to do a
proof of concept on it, just like what you authorized an SB202. Thank you. Thank you for your input.
Senator from club.
Good night. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Scott's good to see you today. Thank you, Mr. Whip.
You brought up the uniformed and overseer citizen absentee voting act and said that
that we voted on that and we passed that an SB202. Is that the way I understood that?
Yeah, that's correct.
Is that federal law?
No, the Uacava is federal law,
but you allow for rank choice voting in SB202.
Yeah, and we allow it for military individuals overseas.
You allow for rank choice voting to be used
for Uacava voters in SB202.
Okay, so you answered my question
without answering my question, and I appreciate that.
If I don't understand your question, I appreciate that.
Let me ask you a question.
If I go into Baskin Robbins,
Should I be mandated to get three flavors of ice cream,
or can I just get chocolate?
Well, here's the thing.
What if chocolate's not available?
My question is, if chocolate is available,
and I walk into Baskin Robbins,
should I be mandated to get three different flavors?
No, I just get chocolate.
No, and that's not how ranked choice voting works.
If you wanted chocolate,
you could just walk into good chocolate.
You used your, I'm using your example.
That's all it is, and I appreciate your time.
Thank you, sir.
Other questions?
I have spirited discussion, other questions.
Representative Turner, you've exhausted us, I'm sorry.
I have that effect on folks.
I highly don't balance, sir.
Highly unlike.
Thank you for your input.
Our next testimony comes from Josh Daniels.
Mr. Daniels, if you would please introduce yourself
and share with the committee your input.
Thank you, thank you for your time.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Josh Daniels.
I am a former election official.
I feel a little bit like a combat veteran
because I counted votes in the 2020 election.
It was an eventful year.
But in that election, I was serving as the county clerk
and county auditor in the second largest county
in the state of Utah, Utah County.
It's a creative name, about 700,000 folks
that live in that county.
And our county was the first county
to implement ranked choice voting for municipalities
in our state.
And I was privileged to administer those types of elections
for our municipalities in our area.
But you know, I'm not new to ranked choice voting.
Our Republican party in Utah has actually been using
ranked choice voting for over 20 years
in some of our party meetings, our caucuses
and our party conventions.
It really speeds the meeting up when you've got
four or five candidates running for one spot,
instead of having multiple rounds of voting
and keeping all of the party leadership
in the same room for hours and hours,
we've begun allowing a ranked ballot that we would submit.
And we've been doing that for a couple of decades now.
And so when we implemented ranked choice voting in our county,
we didn't experience any of these problems
that people are talking about.
I've heard things are disastrous,
That's not what I've heard.
I've met the Secretary of State from the State of Maine and they said that it was easy
and that they didn't have a lot of problems.
I've met other election officials around the country and have not heard sort of any of
these actual sort of war stories, if you will.
I mean, I could share war stories because I served in Fulugia Iraq with the Marines.
And about 16 years ago, I was watching that, you know, war of five Republican candidates
in the New Hampshire primary about this time, 16 years ago.
And I was sitting in the the chow hall in Faluja Iraq.
And sometimes at that same chow hall, I'd sit at the same table as this Navy lawyer named
Braun DeSantis.
Little did I know he was going to get in that war up on that television 16 years later.
But I remember thinking back then, boy, five candidates for president and you only get
to pick one.
And this kind of underscores the reason why folks want to use ranked choice voting.
In our cities, the cities wanted to use it because they had to have a runoff as well.
They would have to have an election in August and then an election in November and in August
they would narrow the number of candidates running for council and mayor down to a certain
number that would go on to the sort of general election.
They're nonpartisan races so the general election functioned as a runoff and one of the things
that they noticed was that in the summertime people really were not keen on voting for people
for city council in the middle of the summer.
There was a lot less people interested in that election, a lot less turnout.
And so some cities wanted to use ranked choice voting to say, well, let's just vote on all
the candidates in November when people are familiar with election time and we'll devote
a little more attention to the candidates.
And we don't have to pay all the money to have this preliminary election, if you will,
in the summertime.
And so we use these ranked ballots so that folks could just vote in November and not worry
about this splitting or spoiling effect that necessitates the runoff, that you all are
very familiar with in some of your notable U.S. Senate races.
So as we implemented ranked choice voting, we were very concerned about whether it would
be easy for voters or not.
We did some sampling, we did some education, we did some polling.
We went to an assisted living center and had residents there use the ballot.
We didn't give them any explanation.
We just gave them the ranked ballots and saw if they could figure it out or not and saw
what kinds of concerns came up.
to report to you that there weren't any concerns. It was pretty intuitive for them to rank
and bubble, you know, first, second, third choice. When it came to counting the votes, it
was not any more difficult than any of the other ballots. We used the same systems. We
scanned the same paper ballots. We go through the same reporting cycle. There's just one
more step at the end where within your system, you just run the sort of winner selection
process to do that instant runoff that that rank choice voting requires. And we were able to report
rank choice election results at the same time. We reported plurality election results from
from other cities and other elections. And so we didn't experience any of these
disastrous or difficult hurdles that that had been discussed. And then we were able to audit
the election the same way we do all of our other elections. We we even did some post election
surveys to see about voter satisfaction. Voters reported
overwhelmingly that they found the ballot easy, that they did not find it
confusing, that they liked the ranked choice, and that they wanted to
continue doing ranked choice. And we've now done ranked choice elections
for our municipalities for three different election cycles. And the post
election survey results are always the same. A commanding majority of
respondents who have participated in ranked choice elections, find it easy to
use. Don't find it confusing. I want to continue to use it. They like it. And so we've had a good
experience with that. There certainly has become more of a political issue recently. I think the main
example is why it's political because what you probably didn't hear was that that second
congressional district in Maine, what had happened in Maine was that was a blue district. It went for
Bill Clinton. It went for Obama. It is, it is a solid blue district. But in Maine, they have
three very viable parties, the Republican party,
the Democratic party and the progressive party.
And what had happened was a very popular statewide
Republican official who wasn't particularly extreme,
he was able to win as a Republican in that blue district
because the Democrats and the Progressives,
that voting coalition, if you will,
kind of split themselves.
And so a Republican won a blue district,
which, if your team Republican, that's pretty cool.
When your opposition splits themselves, so to speak.
But then what happened was Maine Institute
and ranked choice voting.
And so then that Republican lost after being
in office for a couple of cycles.
And so if you're a Republican and you're in that district
and Maine, well, then yeah, you don't like this.
But at the same time, this cuts both ways, right?
At the end of the day, I think the thing that matters most
is getting a majority of your community
to sort of make their choice known at the time
that it makes sense to make that choice.
In the case of Utah cities,
it makes more sense to vote in November
then to vote in June.
And I think for your state, you can understand
that getting your voters in November
to be the commanding decision on who wins a US Senate race
and not telling the citizens they need to show back up
a month later to sort things out.
That's gonna be more effective.
You're gonna have broader participation
and more buy-in from your electorate
as to who won those elections.
And I think that's the power of rank choice elections.
Is it eliminates the need to have run-offs
are multiple cycles of elections.
It eliminates votes splitting and spoiled elections.
And voters then leave more satisfied
and you actually have outcomes
that are more broadly representative
because often you're having those ranked elections
at the time when most people are going to be participating.
So for those reasons, I think you should consider it.
And if you have questions about implementation,
I'd be happy to answer them.
Thank you for your input.
Chair recognizes the center from the 50th.
Mike, number 16. Thank you. First, thank you for your service, and thank you for coming
to testify today. I had a question about the military ranked choice ballots. Is it not
true that the ballots that we send are, we technically send two ballots, one, which
is a regular ballot that they vote on, and then a separate ballot that is a ranked ballot
just in case there is a runoff? So your specific way that you do it in Georgia, I can't speak
to that, but I've heard that, but it couldn't, but it wouldn't need to be two ballots,
but it really depends on how your local clerks are actually counting and organizing.
Some states will do just one ranked ballot for those overseas citizens, but you could,
you could do what you just described as well. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you. The chair recognizes it from a second.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, just a question so I can, I like to keep this, uh, so my constituents,
uh, back down to 16 and watching this, uh, when you talk about the ring choice voting,
if you wanted to vote for one person, you could vote for one person and let that be it, right?
Absolutely. That's what that's what your wish was. That's right. I'm a vote for this one person.
and if he don't, he don't make it happen, then God be with him, right?
That's how ranked choice voting would kind of work.
Absolutely.
So you don't have to vote for everybody.
You can just make your person and go exactly and you're done.
That's right.
But if there, there's no runoff, so there's no situation where you
would be able to come back and vote for the, the next person, right?
Exactly.
Yeah.
Okay.
And find a question for you is if you are going to have runoffs,
then would you believe that the state should then invest in making sure voters know that there
is a runoff so that they can come back out? Absolutely. Yeah. That's one of those things that's
very difficult. You have a runoff and voters may not know, hey, you got to show back up in
November or December or January, right? And I think when you get to that question about,
you can just vote for one. You can just pick chocolate. The problem with the election is that if you
You just pick chocolate, you have to wait until you put your order in to find out they're
out of stock.
And oh, by the way, you don't get anything.
You know, imagine going to a restaurant and they give you a menu.
And on the menu is a ribeye, a filet, and halibut.
And then you say, well, are all these fish and stock was a lot, we don't know until you
put your order in.
Okay.
Well, I order the filet.
Okay.
What do you order?
The ribeye, you order the halibut.
Great.
Then the server comes back says, hey, sorry, we're out of the ribeye.
What can I have the filet?
Nope.
There's only one chance to make your order.
major order. Now we're out of stock. That's what happens in the election, right? You come to the
Senate election, you say, I vote for the libertarian. It's like, well, the race is not between the
libertarian. It's between the Republican and the Democrats. So you need to make a choice. Oh,
you don't get an opportunity to make that choice. You got to come back in a month and make that
choice, right? So you don't get to find out really what that race is about until it's too late.
You've already thrown your vote away in a sense. You've been, uh, you've been given a really poor
choice. And I think ranked choice is a better choice. It gives you the option to give all of your
choices. Thank you chair recognizes the center from the 29th.
Thanks sir. I appreciate you making the trip from Utah, right? Yes sir.
So when you were more of the pocket auto drive,
that'd be similar to the election superintendent by me here in Georgia.
Correct. Now, were you there when the pilot public started? Yes.
And how long did it go as a pilot pilot before it became the actual method done under current state law it's still a pilot cities can choose to use that method if they want and every year a city's having an election they can choose that year to use it or to not use it.
And so the first year that that was offered was 19 we have an odd year for municipalities and then they you know cities have done it again in 21 and then more recently in 23.
Yeah, cities have switched back and forth. A lot of the reason that they might use it or not use it is depending on how many candidates are going to be running for office. If a lot of candidates run, it necessitates that June what they call a primary election.
Who makes the decision if you run, if you use it or not use it, the City Councils make a decision to opt in or, you know, to use it or to not.
City Council members in your car they elected yep City Council are elected nonpartisan so it's not a party affiliation, but they're all elected. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
Thank you. Any other questions for the witness.
Thank you for coming. Thank you for sharing. We're grateful. We have one more invited presenter or witness West Ken trail representative West Ken trail.
We're grateful for his presence.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, it's a bucket list item of mine to come back after eight years
serving down here and speak against my friends bills.
We're just about to have you.
There's a challenging issue.
There's good people on both sides of this, okay?
So one of my best friends opposes me on this issue, I get it.
So I'm just here to very briefly make my case for this by understanding how things work
around here and their political forces at play.
So I'm going to try to persuade you based upon experience and facts, all right.
So 2014, I got elected, I went, I got to experience firsthand a nine week runoff in the middle
of the summer begging people to come back and vote.
Please come back and vote.
I got a clear majority in the primary, but I had to come back because I didn't get 5%
plus one.
I knew if I made the runoff, I would win because the other two candidates, I knew I was
the second choice of both of them.
So I almost had 70% of the vote, but there was a 21% drop off in the summer to vote.
This really alerted me personally to the problems we have with runoffs.
In fact, that year would have been a much larger runoff vote, much larger drop off, but
we had a senatorial race and we had a congressional race in my district that drove some of that
turn off.
It would have been a lot worse.
Runoffs result in voter fatigue much less turn out on average. It's over 30% less people turn out for the runoff millions of taxpayers dollars are wasted on something that could be easily avoided the only people who like runoffs are political campaign consultants because they make a lot of money off of all of us during those times. That's the only people that like them voters hate them. They hate runoffs and I'm here for the voter. Okay.
So, I immediately began to study, I called an instant runoff voting back then or RCB.
It's the same thing.
Right after I got elected, I began to try to persuade my colleagues, and this was a good
idea.
Nobody had heard of it.
But let's be clear.
Ranked choice voting does not eliminate runoffs.
It simply makes the runoff, if necessary, occur on the same night as the regular election.
You still got to run off. It just happens on the same night. You don't have to wait.
What used to be nine weeks now is four weeks. So I began to run these ideas by leadership. I finally
got their permission to run with some bills so I would get a fair hearing on these bills.
This all happened prior to the election of 2020. Let's be clear. Prior to election of 2020,
I wrote three bills. One was the bill that's been talked about. It became part of SB 202,
HB 59, which allowed for ranked choice voting for overseas citizens and military personnel.
HB 284, which allowed municipalities or counties if they so chose in their area,
local control. If they wanted to use our CV, they could do so. And HB 285, which would allow for
for range voice voting in presidential general elections only,
since we don't have a runoff for our presidential election.
Let's just pretend for a moment we had our CV
in that 2020 fun election we had.
The winner of our presidential election got 49.5% of the vote.
The loser got 49.3% of the vote.
65,000 people voted for third party candidate.
The research shows that had those people had
the opportunity to vote for their second choice,
the election would have been different.
Would have been different.
We had a different outcome.
Senate raised that year.
One candidate received 49.7% of the vote.
Higher than the presidential person
who won all 100% of our electoral votes.
And yet he was subjected to a runoff
in which he lost because there was a lot of reasons.
We'll just go, we'll leave it at that.
but 10% less people showed up for the runoff.
RCV is not a partisan issue.
It doesn't benefit Democrats or Republicans.
It benefits taxpayers and voters.
That's who it benefits.
So I told you, you know this already,
came up early in my bill, got rolled into SB202,
which I assume most of the ours at this table,
all the ours at this table today voted for.
It resulted in moving to a four week runoff
instead of the ridiculous nine week one,
that we had endured for years.
An instant runoff would help us avoid all these
negative things if you had more than two kinest.
You don't have to vote.
I keep here, there's a lot of,
I've forgotten what it's like being down here
with a lot of the spin and the misinformation, okay?
But you don't have to vote for every candidate on the ballot.
Plus, you guys would control what our CV would look like
if you wanted to.
It doesn't have to look like what main did
or these examples that are given.
Everybody, you figure out, you make it,
you'd write the rules for how you want it to work.
It doesn't have to be blanket.
It could be just for general elections.
It could be just for a presidential election
where we don't have a runoff in Georgia.
And routinely, we give 100% of our electoral votes
to someone who didn't even get 50% of the vote.
So we got a problem in Georgia with these runoffs.
We can fix it.
Instead of runoff voting, our CV results in a true majority, runoffs give you a false
majority because you have less people that come out, a whole lot less in a lot of cases.
It allows voters to vote their conscience instead of being forced to choose between the
lesser of two evils.
You can vote for your first choice and then know that your second choice will count if
your first choice doesn't make it to the runoff, okay?
Now let's be clear, we're facing a time where we're about to get to a general election,
where there's a lot of voters in America that don't like either choice.
And I would submit to you that if none of the above was on the ballot, he would have a
really good chance at winning this fall, if it goes like it looks like we're going.
We need to have more choices for voters so they can vote their conscious and not feel
like they have to vote for a person that, because that's really the only two viable candidates.
runouts are expensive. We talked about their negative campaigning. One of the things I did in my
election, the two people I would run against, they were just killing each other. I didn't say a word
about any of my opponents. I just ran on what I was for and guess what? I won because they were too
busy fighting. And I knew because they were fighting, if I went to a runoff, all those people were
coming my way for either voting. It's exactly, I got 40% of the runoff. They both got about 30
and I got the other 30s. I got 70 in the, I'm sorry, in the general, in the 70 in the runoff.
Access, more candidates will run for office if we have ranked choice. And a third party candidate
can actually know how much support they really had based upon the first ballot. You know,
third party candidate in Georgia never knows because people are, are, you know, what do I do?
If I throw my vote away, quote unquote, by voting for the libertarian or the green party or whatever,
Or do I vote for the one of the candidates I think might actually win?
So our CV eliminates that problem for the voter. So
That's what I got Mr. Chairman happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. Thank you for your input
We appreciate it again my good friend from Savannah
Now I just want to make a clear Mr. Chairman
I know everybody's thinking I'm asking all the questions, but I only two Democrats three and told on the committee
So I get to ask a lot of questions.
All right, we're so glad to have your answer there.
You've asked a lot of questions.
It's my memory and research, right?
It didn't matter how many D's or R's were in the room.
But go ahead.
I'm not.
Well, you know, I remember.
So Representative Cantrell, this will probably be the second issue we actually would agree on,
right?
The first was daylight savings time.
That's right.
It's very controversial.
And the second would be Rain Choice Voting Now.
Let me be clear.
have affected the outcome of the two US senators that are in my party. I'm going to be the
first to admit that it definitely would affect the outcome. But I'm not, I was going to run
off, five person runoff, one by 20 votes in my house raised, five people in a race. And
I did have people vote for me and leave. But if there was an opportunity to kind of look
at how we do the ballots in how rain choice voting works, what would be your assumption
as to the benefit to the voter versus the state.
Because what I'm trying to understand
is I've heard from two conservative folks
and I believe two other folks that are conservative
and there's a split on the issue.
And where my folks are, I'm agnostic
about ranked choice voting or the 50 and one.
And if you don't get 50 and one,
then you get pulled into a runoff.
And you know, so how did you find the happy medium
in that what would be the ideal compromise?
I know that's a bad word I didn't cuss,
but I'm Baptist, but what would be the compromise
to make this a reality?
So one is easier on voters,
two, it doesn't cost any money,
because as you know, Representative,
we don't appropriate any money
to administer elections in the state of Georgia.
So this falls back to local taxpayers.
So what would be the fiscally conservative answer to that?
Well, I'm not sure I'm completely following your question,
but I would say that number one,
We say down here, we believe in local control.
So I think a great starting point
would be to allow municipalities and counties
if they want to implement it and then see how it goes.
Before you can prohibit it across the board,
except for military and overseas citizens.
I also think that you could select the elections,
not make it blanket, but if you wanted to try it
in a general election only where typically
There's three candidates, because three candidate model works the best with RCB.
It does.
It's simple.
It's right to the point.
But the people that are arguing hard as Ford are those that are in these municipal elections,
where there's, you know, 20 people are running for city council.
And it just, it's so much expense.
It's so hard to get voters to come out and vote.
People are getting elected, you know, with 25, 30 votes in a town that's got thousands of people.
people, it's just not, the process is flawed.
And it's because we were just where our voters held.
They just tired of it.
2020 was a great example.
And we had to vote twice in the spring,
twice in the fall and then in January.
It, you know, people just sick of it, you know.
If we want voter engagement,
get rid of the run-offs, man.
I mean, people are engaged,
but when you're running campaign commercials
during Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays,
You know, people just sick of it.
They're tired of it.
They're not coming back.
And it just boils, it boils into the whole system.
Thank you for your input.
I appreciate it to the Senator's point.
There are four Democrats on this committee.
Incidentally, only two are present this evening.
But point may always welcome.
That's because one is a ex officio.
That is true.
But quite a number of the Republicans on this committee
are also exeficient.
Well, can you get me some more exeficial Democrats, Mr. Chairman?
I'm sure we'll take that on a consideration, Senator.
Thank you.
Okay.
That concludes the input from those who've had been
previously scheduled.
We have only three input individuals who requested
to share their insights.
We welcome you if you could, by the way,
if I understand it correctly.
All three are in favor of the legislation.
So the chair will recognize Victoria Cruz.
It's Cruz.
Right, that's okay.
We could limit your input to three minutes if we could
as we move forward into the evening.
We're now approaching 615.
Yes, is this...
It is indeed.
All right.
I hope you can all hear me.
Yeah, my name is Victoria Cruz,
and I'm from Athens, Georgia.
So I drove a little bit to get here,
but it's not as far as Arizona or Utah.
I am in favor of the bill
because I believe ranked choice voting
should be banned for all of the reasons
that Senator Robertson brought up.
I have been looking into ranked choice voting
for quite a while.
And I just have not seen a case where it turned out without controversy.
There's, there's an amount of opacity to the process, opacity in the voting.
You don't know whether your vote was filled out correctly, especially in the case of abs and tea ballots.
right choice voting in an absentee ballot.
If you make a mistake at the polls,
you can redo it.
They'll tell you that you made a mistake
or did you realize you should vote for all these?
But if you do it as an absentee,
your ballot comes in and the way you fill it out
is not known until it's opened and run through.
And if it is rejected for some reason,
like you over-voted, or you under-voted,
like you didn't like any of them,
so you put them all last and the last few
and left a few first spots open,
then your vote would be totally thrown out at that point.
So the absentee balloting is very popular.
That's very popular in both parties for a lot of reasons.
So I really think that the legislature should,
the committee should take that into account.
And I also want to bring to your attention
something I emailed all of you.
It is the Alec American Legislative Exchange Council's
policy, it's model policy that was passed this summer.
A lot of input from a lot of election
integrity organizations passed this
and they are, it's called the Safeguard American Boats
and Elections Act.
And not only does it recommend that rank choice voting be banned, but also anything that even that it that is masquerading.
There is also instant runoff. I think that wording should be in the bill. There is also star voting and approval voting. And I'm pretty sure that certain elite mathematicians are working on new ways.
of getting a new form of voting that they can manipulate.
And that is the biggest problem as well.
The one I look at wearing choice of voting
is that the electorate can be manipulated.
Thank you.
Nowadays we have text messaging.
Thank you for your input.
If you would please,
you have some additional information
you'd like to submit as written testimony.
Is that correct?
I would like to submit a copy of the Save Act
for everyone.
Yeah, please share that with Ms. Jackson.
and we'll share it with the committee.
Thank you for your input, Ms. Cruz.
Victor Tripp, Mr. Tripp, we're glad you're here.
Thank you for your perseverance.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, senators.
I'm Victor Tripp of the Cab County,
and I'm here in favor of the bill.
A lot of time and energy has been spent debating
the merits of some version of RCV,
And I think it's time to suspend the debate.
My reason to ban RCV is that it would be a huge disruption
of the system that is already riddled with serious problems.
I would be glad to return to the RCV debate
when the system, we have a system
that inspires confidence to start with.
As it is, we have a system that fewer and fewer
Georgia citizens trust because more and more problems
are being discovered.
In this state, we have paper ballots that must be preserved for two years so that elections
can be audited.
And CISA of the Department of Homeland Security says it's critical to, quote, conduct
rigorous post-election tabulation audits of the physical ballots and paper records.
Unquote.
A rigorous audit must be an independent audit.
However, an independent audit is impossible
when Nobel access is allowed.
Internal audits have been shown to not match the original,
and in some cases there is no evidence
that an audit was even done.
The SOS office says the audit matched perfectly,
and Judge Tottenberg says that that office is, quote,
not credible, unquote.
Then the SOS and the AG go to court to prevent us.
But please vote which comments on SB 355.
Okay, well, I will sum it up then by saying,
this mass has to be cleaned up
before we even think about something
as complex and controversial as RCP.
Thank you for your input, any questions?
Thank you, Mr. Tripp.
Miss Lee, Yale Lee.
We welcome your input.
Thank you.
I agree with, oh, I'm Gail Lee and I live in DeCab County.
I agree with SB 355 as it's written and I think those of you who have sponsored it.
Ranked choice voting is too complicated and it disenfranchises voters because ballots
that do not include the two ultimate finalists are cast aside to manufacture a false majority
for the winner.
It reminds me of the game of musical chairs, which is no way to select those who will make decisions over our lives.
A ranked choice election will, in the end, boil down to only two opposing candidates.
But many voters will not have cast ballots deciding between those two choices.
The voter ends up with no say in the contest between the final two.
Of course, had that election been a traditional runoff between those same two leading candidates
that voter would have had an opportunity to hear debates, listen to the issues discussed
and make an informed choice between them.
There are at least two alternatives to ranked choice voting and one is the system, the runoff
system that we currently have.
The edit time window gives potential voters the opportunity to re-examine and re-educate
themselves about the character and views on issues of the two candidates who receive
the largest pluralities in the general election.
Voters have a greater opportunity to make an informed choice than with ranked choice voting.
Runoff elections guarantee that the winner of the runoff election has a genuine mandate
from a majority of the voters, which is a crucial factor in a democratic system.
Another possibility for an alternative is in a contest among three or more candidates,
the one who garners the most votes and exceeds 40 percent or another specified percent of
the votes wins. If none reached the level of support specified, our current runoff system
is triggered. I personally think we should seriously consider such an alternative. In
my last few seconds, I'd like to say I have prepared a list of things that I think need
to be fixed about SB202 and I'd like to pass it out to you if it's okay.
be 202 is not the topic of discussion this evening.
SB 202 is law.
There will be follow-on legislation that may deal
with those issues, but we defer your input until that time.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, we've completed the input.
I'm grateful for those who came and shared.
I'm gonna recognize the senator from the 29
to close his presentation.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to remind each committee member
there is a packet in your notebook.
If you would look, there are letters of support

And a good friend, Austin Smith,
who is an Arizona State Representative,
who's dealt with this in the past,
and he proudly represents district 29 in Arizona.
And so please feel free to research this,
and I thank the committee for considering
this legislation to do pass.
Thank you, Mr. Duh.
Whip, what is the will of the committee?
I have a motion from Senator,
from the Senator from the 16th.
16th, thank you very much to do pass.
Do I have a second?
I have a second from Senator from the 50th.
Thank you very much.
All those in favor of the motion to do pass,
SB 355 indicate with the uplifted hand.
All those opposed?
That's quite unusual.
Is that a question there, Senator?
I do have a,
well, they say I've got to clarify the vote first.
I think I saw it both ways.
I'm not sure.
Well, that's why I was trying to slow the,
I didn't want to get a point of order,
but you went from calling the question
to skipping over the discussion.
You know what, point of order is indeed in order, sir.
Do you have a question before the author?
I do, all right.
With the majority party with the center from the 29th
of gree on the compromise to lowering
the threshold to 45%.
That question, that's not a part
or germane to this bill, Senator.
talk to me earlier and I'll be back in our conversation but 50 plus one is
where I stand on that thank you all right I believe I saw a vote is that
correct yeah I did so and I believe I saw a unanimous vote in support of do
pass on three five five is that correct I'm a no I will revise that there was
one no vote and I believe it would be about nine. Yeah, he's one, two, four, five, six, seven, eight,
eight, eight, eight, one, no. Thank you very much. The bill is recommended to pass.
Gonna ask Vice Chairman Williams if he will assume the chair so that I can provide you with a much
The next shorter discussion of SB 358.
Like a motion for the dinner.
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
We're going to vote there.
I think majority five out of five.
That's right.
Okay, we'll move right on, we'll recognize Chairman Burns to present your bill.
Thank you, Chairman. I have a great board bill. SB 358. We're working from
committee substitute, LC472735, excuse me, 472735S.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Thank you.
This bill does two very important things.
It clarifies the responsibility of the state election board in its oversight role.
If you maintain an awareness of what's going on in the state election board in the December meeting of the state election board.
There was some discussion about whether or not the board had responsibility and oversight of the secretary of state and the office, the office of the secretary of state and their elections of division.
They split on that two to two.
subsequent to that December 19th meeting, we received communication from, through a member
of the state election board and then the chair of the state election board. So the chair of the
state election board and a letter to the honorable John Burns speaker of the house and the honorable
Bert Jones Lieutenant Governor Georgia requested that legislation clarify the responsibility
of the state election board and and its role in oversight. And what that's that's the
reason that I bring you SB 358. You'll notice it does two things. First of all,
it removes the secretary's state from it from being an ex officio member of the state election
board. Again, if you're a casual observer, you will note that currently the secretary's state
does not actively participate in those proceedings and I'm not aware of his attending their meetings on a
routine basis or even on a casual basis. So there's really no reason for the Secretary of State to
maintain an exhibition position. So that's section one and the most the other thing in section one
that is important is online 25 that it allows the state election board to conduct necessary
investigations so that with the approval of the board they can employ and fix the
compensation of personnel including investigators to determine as determined to assist the executive
director in his and her duties. So in the past the state election board has had to rely on the
the Secretary of State for Investigations,
they will continue to do so,
but they now have authority to do
their own investigations as well.
And then finally,
this legislation ensures that the Secretary of State
is administratively,
The State of Luxembourg has administrative oversight for the Secretary of State and local
elected officials, and it ensures that the Secretary of State provide cooperation with
the State of Luxembourg.
Now subsequent to this legislation being submitted, and with the knowledge that we were having
a hearing here today, I received a letter from the Office of the Secretary of State challenging
whether or not this legislation was constitutional. I'm not an attorney. I'm simply making this
as making the the committee aware of this concern. I invited the Secretary of State to come and
share their concerns with the committee. I don't know if they are here today, but I did ask
our legislative counsel who assisted in the drafting of the bill to prepare a response to that
challenge. And if the chair would allow it, I'd like to ask Mr. Morelle to kind of share with you
his perspective of whether or not the legislature can authorize the state election board to have
oversight responsibilities for the secretary's state.
Okay, Mr. Morelle, thank you.
So, as Sharon's burn stated, he did provide me with a copy of the letter provided to him by the Secretary of State's office, where they raised potential constitutional objections to Senate Bill 3-5-8.
And the basis of the arguments raised in this letter is referencing back to a opinion that the attorney general's office issued back in 2005 when a similar issue came up as to whether or not the state election board could investigate the state or the secretary of state's office.
At that time, the Attorney General opined that there was nothing in Georgia law that
seemed to indicate that the State Election Board had the authority to investigate the
Secretary of State's office and that the law, as written at the time, envisioned much
more of a cooperative role between the Secretary of State's office and the State Election
Board.
I will note is that the laws governing the state election board and the secretary of state
have changed a couple of times since 2005. One of the key points that the Attorney General
made in his 2005 opinion was that it did not make sense for the state election board, which
was at that time chaired by the secretary of state to investigate the secretary of state
himself. As the committee is aware, the secretary of state is no longer the chair of the state
election board so that rationale and the opinion probably is not as of much concern anymore.
The next position that the Attorney General seemed to focus on was that
there was no clear authorization in the state law for the election board to investigate
the Secretary of State's office, and that matter would be addressed by the proposed legislation
of Senate Bill 358. Finally, the Attorney General did point out that there are some unanswered
questions as to the ability of the state election board to have oversight over the Secretary
of State since he is since the Secretary of State's office is a constitution and office established
by the Constitution and the Constitution provides certain duties to the Secretary of State's office.
And at this point, I will concur with the attorney general that it is still probably an open question under Georgia constitutional law.
There is no clear interpretation of the separation of powers doctrine as it relates here, but there is nothing in Senate bill 358, which I'm aware of that directly contravenes any of the interpretations of the separation of powers clause that the Supreme Court has handed down over the past.
200 some odd years and the constitutional duties that the Secretary of State have would
not be affected by the provisions of Senate Bill 358, the limited duties that the Constitution
does provide to the Secretary of State would still remain within the purview of the Secretary
state's office. Most of the references to the Secretary of State and the Constitution
are actually duties placed upon other officials to provide documentation to the Secretary of State.
And then there is also a duty for the Secretary of State to coordinate with the Attorney General
and Legislative Council to prepare summaries of proposed constitutional amendments.
If the Secretary failed to undertake that duty since it arises out of the Constitution,
nothing and this legislation would authorize the Secretary, the State Election Board to investigate
that failure because the provisions of the State Election Board, the provisions of the State
Election Board is limited to enforcing the provisions of the Georgia Election Code, the statutory law
chapter two of Title 21. So any constitutional duties the Secretary of State may have
and elections would not be subject to investigation, but my review of the Constitution as well as
the provisions listed by the Attorney General in the 2005 opinion list only a handful of roles
that the Secretary of State plays in elections that are constitutional who not statutory.
Thank you, Ms. Morella. I'll play for you guys some questions. I don't know if they're for you or
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to Chairman Burns. My question is in relation to the constitutionality
of this, we tried in creating statute in my time in house when we had a labor commissioner
that was absent. Commissioner Butler and we created a chief labor officer and passed out
of the House and the Senate that was ultimately vetoed by Governor Brian Kemp because it violated
at the state's constitution,
because that person was duly elected
as a constitutional officer.
And I remember that chief labor office
only had to do two things.
Go review the audit and to provide legislative responses
to the entries.
And it was vetoed by the governor's
and unconstitutional bill that was an overreach
to a constitutional officer elected by the state.
And this seems to be headed down the same path.
So my question chairman has a governor's office
that the governor's flow of leader weighed in as to this bill.
Thank you for the question.
I'll defer to the governor's flow later.
Now, I'll say the governor certainly has his prerogative.
If he feels that this bill is unconstitutional, he can so note.
But I believe that it's clear that legislation has granted the secretary
state with most of the authority he currently has.
and this bill simply takes the oversight ability
and invest it within the state election board.
Again, this is not an unconstitutional act.
It's an act of a legislature
to ensure the state election board has oversight authority.
This bill does three things.
It removes the Secretary of State from the board,
not even has an effect ex officio.
it allows the state election board to have oversight for the Secretary of State's responsibilities
as it relates to elections, and it provides the state election board with investigative
powers.
Senator Harper?
Yes, sir.
Sorry to burn.
You did it.
Yes.
Thank you for the bill.
I think it makes a lot of sense with the issues that we've had over elections to have
an election board with power to do some things.
I have a question for you in the area of investigations.
Yes.
And that you and I have had conversations in many areas
about the power and the funding is what I would look at.
The number one is the funding capabilities
or the funding money for this to give them the power
to investigate and what power do those investigators have
from a standpoint of can they subpoena can they request
documents is does that need to be broadened
When you say investigator, what powers do they have
and where would they derive those powers from?
Right now they would conduct the investigations
as designated by the State Election Board.
I don't presume to have that detail available.
I would suggest that the State Election Board
will make by rule those responsibilities.
I think the most important thing is,
the State Election Board currently has no way
to independently investigate
any allegations of the Secretary of State, or any of his staff, or any local election officials.
And if you look at lines 31 and 32, it specifically says that the State Election Board
has the authority to investigate the Secretary of State and local election officials.
Now they would still work. I would say for the majority of their
investigations through the secretary's date, but they would have the
power to investigate independently. Yeah. Funding for this.
Funding of this will have to certainly come through
appropriations. And we're in discussions with, depending upon the results of
this legislation, what resources the state election board would need.
I believe we have a vote on a new state election board
Chairman pending in the Senate as well as a new member of the state election board. So we're
looking at an opportunity to empower the state election board so that they can have oversight
responsibility and that they there's no confusion about who where that oversight responsibility is
vested. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Yes, sir. My question is for the legislature council. This may surprise some of our members
on this committee, but I've read the Georgia Constitution and I looked at it again today.
I can't find anywhere in the Georgia Constitution that gives the power to operate and run the
elections to the Secretary of State. I'm looking at Article 2 under voting in election
Section 1, paragraph 1, and it appears that the elections are to be done by a secret
ballot, and the procedures that are be conducted will be in accordance with procedures provided
by law. And then it talks about paragraph 1, Section 200, General Provisions, again,
that the General Assembly will provide by law for a method of the appeals and so forth.
But nowhere in the document that I've read does it indicate that the Secretary of State
is responsible for conducting the elections.
Can you comment on that?
The, you are correct that the constitution does say
that the elections will be conducted in accordance
with the procedures by law.
I will also point out the article two, section two,
paragraph one of the constitution does provide,
and the last sentence I'll read it,
that the general assembly shall provide by law for procedures
whereby returns of all elections by the people
shall be made to the Secretary of State.
So at the very least, the Constitution does provide a role
of, for the Secretary of State,
as receiving the returns of all elections.
Correct.
Correct.
But those procedures would be determined by state law,
which would be passing of general legislations
and correct.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Just follow up, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just have a question as relates to the Secretary of State having investigative power.
Many of you may recall now Governor Brian Kemp was Secretary of State that investigated
those 12 folks in Whitman County and then related those charges to a criminal prosecution
and which those charges have now been dropped.
Under what authority was then Secretary of State Brian Kemp operating under to have that
investigative power?
I'm not pretty to that particular case, and I wouldn't presume to speak for the Secretary
of State at that time, Mr. Camp or the current governor.
I would say that the currently, the Secretary of State has an investigation's division,
and that they do routinely pursue allegations of voter irregularities.
I would suggest that the Secretary of State in his office has no oversight and that's
what this bill is about.
This bill is not necessarily targeted at direct voter allegations or voter irregularity
allegations.
It's targeted at the ability of the state election board to provide reasonable oversight
over the election's responsibilities that the Secretary of State has been legislatively
provide.
Well, that's why I was trying to understand this German and maybe my public school education
not let me fathom it. So if the counties are only supposed to supply to the Secretary
of State the information, and if there's any malfeasance, then he has a division in
his office that would do the investigations. So who would the investigators of the State
election board be investigating if they could they could investigate either allegations
that perhaps the elections division of the Secretary of State has not pursued, or they
could have pursued investigations associated with irregularities of the Secretary of State's
office. So that there's reasonable oversight. We're not out there on a witch hunt looking
for problems. We're out there to provide reasonable oversight of a very critical process
that impacts every citizen in Georgia.
And my final question, would that not be a function of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
And they could and have been called in to assist in the investigations of voting irregularities.
But I will also say that the Secretary of State's election investigation division is
generally the primary lead on that responsibility.
They could call in the GBI if necessary and as appropriate, realizing in every case where
there is probable cause. The the the allegations are referred to the attorney general or the
referred to the district attorney within that jurisdiction. Thank you.
What I have witnessed in the past for my experience would be the Secretary of State's investigative
division would investigate the allegations of irregularities and elections. And then they would
turn that over to the state election board and they would actually meet and they would take action.
But is it not true, Mr. Chairman, that the state election board acts on the recommendations
of the investigators of the secretary of state? That is correct. And when the secretary of state's
investigation needs to be supplemented currently, the state election board does not have that
capacity, right. Do you have a question? No, thank you.
Yes, sir. Yeah. Isn't it true, Chairman Burns, that none of these powers that we're talking about
are in the Constitution. They're all in general law that the Georgia General Assembly has passed
over the course of time in our state history. So we can change them a minimum in any way we want
Through the legislative process. That is my understanding. Thank you
Any other questions from the board?
Well of the committee
Senator Roberson. Mr. Chairman, I make the motion do pass
Have a second
all.
How to,
So I'm reading off of his LC 47, 2735 Sierra.
Second seems good.
Okay.
Any discussion?
We have a motion.
A second in discussion.
Yes, Mr. Chairman to the concept of this bill.
It seems that we're creating another investigative body wasting precious taxpayer money
that could be allocated to other agents. Any other member? All in favor say aye. Any opposed?
So carry.
That concludes our meeting. You want to adjourn it?
Our meeting will be adjourned.
