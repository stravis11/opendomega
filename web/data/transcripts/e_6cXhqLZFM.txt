TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well good afternoon. Thank you all for being here. I'm Larry Walker and as of
yesterday I'm officially the president pro-temporary of the state Senate. It's
an honor of a lifetime to be selected by my colleagues to lead this August
body of dedicated public servants and the fact that my tenure begins at such
such a critical time for our state makes this opportunity all the more humbling.
2026 is going to be an action-packed year for Georgia politicoes.
I think everyone knows exactly what I'm talking about.
The semi-Quince Centennial.
Oh, you thought I was talking about the high stakes.
Special election going on now and all the bruising primaries and multimillion dollar
midterm for all the statewide offices.
No, 2026 is our nation's semi-quincentennial.
I said it twice, correctly, I hope.
I won't try to say it again.
Yeah, July 4th will be America and Georgia's
250th birthday concurrent with these political campaigns
that inevitably will get a lot of attention during 2026.
America 250 will bring patriotic celebrations,
reminding us all of what United States America's Americans,
our love of country, our cherished freedoms,
and our common pursuit of the American dream.
There's probably no concept more associated
with the United States of America than that of the American dream.
So when the majority later approached me about using this theme as we focused our majority
caucus agenda and developed our caucus priorities, it made total sense.
I've spent my legislative career fighting for hard work in Georgians who don't necessarily
have a team of lobbyists helping them under this gold dome.
In cutting red tape and fighting government bureaucracy,
just standing up for school bus drivers and cosmetologists,
I wanted to be a voice for the everyday citizen.
The thought that for too many of our friends and neighbors,
our fellow Georgians affordability concerns
have them believing that their American dream
may have slipped beyond their grasp.
That breaks my heart.
This caucus, the Georgia Senate Republicans,
are going to do our part to change that by making sure
that our state, government, is part of the solution,
not the problem.
I'll turn it over to the majority later.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, thank you, Mr. Pro Tem.
As we enter the 2026 legislative session,
obviously cost of living concerns are at the forefront
of everyone's minds.
Last year, broad stabilization in certain areas
in some improvement in others,
but the absolutely terrible federal policies
from the previous four years took some time to unwind.
Started with COVID, starting with COVID shutdowns
and supply chain disruptions
followed by massive federal spending,
punishing inflation compounded year after year after year.
While the Trump administration is confident that we will see economic improvement continued
in the coming year, Senate Republicans are standing with me, understand that the accumulated
high prices have made things very difficult for too many families in Georgia right now.
Without a doubt, we faced many challenges in recent years.
That's why I found I find inspiring that term, the American dream, as it was coined
in the midst of a difficult time in American history,
the Great Depression.
In 1931, Beth Seller, in his Beth Seller,
the epic of America, James Trusslow Adams wrote of a quote,
dream of a better, richer, and happier life
for all of our citizens of every rank, end quote.
It is the goal of this caucus this session
to tackle affordability issues brought
and broader quality of life issues heard head on
while doing our part to reignite the American dream
of a better, better, richer, happier life
for every single Georgian willing to work for it.
That starts by making sure hard-working Georgians
keep more of what they earned.
The past few years, Georgia Republicans
committed to a multi-year reduction of the state income tax
while delivering direct relief payments for taxpayers
to help combat Biden inflation.
Now, after months of a study,
the Georgia Senate Special Committee produced a feasible roadmap to completely eliminate
the state income tax, starting with the elimination of the tax for its first $100,000 for working
families. Last year, we also delivered property tax relief with continued improvement in the
statewide home set exemption. And on that note, I just want to be very clear on behalf
of this caucus that as we work to strive to do bold things, we can and will do everything
on our power to address property taxes and income taxes to help families.
But the final bill that was passed out last year and got signed into law contained an
opt-out provision that was unnecessarily exercised by too many local governments to the
absolute detriment of property owners and we're going to address that.
The Senate will work to eliminate the opt-out providing relief no matter what local jurisdiction
You reside in.
Owning a home is virtually synonymous also
with achieving the American dream.
And we want that goal to be attainable.
In addition to property tax relief,
we also will be very specific in tackling issues
that drive up the cost of homes.
That includes limiting institutional investors
who gobble up single-family homes and recycle them
on the Georgia rental market.
Main street Georgians can't be expected
when a bidding war with Wall Street billionaires for their dream home.
Senate Republicans will also be looking to reform the permitting process for
providing surety for home builders, local governments must have a timely process
eliminating bureaucratic barriers for builders which increase the supply and
also decreases costs for potential home buyers.
The cost of living crunch has had a detrimental impact on the quality of life that we've seen,
which has been difficult on the pain of high prices in impacting Georgia being the best
place to live work and raise a family.
We will make sure Georgia communities are safer by supporting our first responders, by
cracking down on dangerous street racing, we will preserve Georgia's natural assets,
water, land, wildlife, while promoting outdoor access and economic development.
We will set up our next generation for success by ensuring Georgian's children have the opportunities,
services and resources they need to thrive.
That means the Senate will continually and on the multi-effort to improve literacy in this state.
Building on the framework of the Senate Children and Families Committee supporting children in the foster care system.
ensuring that we retain and reward our best teachers,
tackling chronic absenteeism in the K through 12
public education space, and placing guardrails around
technology accessible to children,
even if that includes artificial intelligence.
My optimism does not rely on Washington, DC.
It resides here in Georgia.
It's grit on local communities,
the innovation of the Georgia industry,
in the compassion of the people we represent across the state.
Across the state, families who have felt squeeze
or ignored continue to get up every single morning
and do their best.
They deserve a government that meets them where they're at.
I believe the Senate Republicans
reigniting the American Dream agenda does just that.
In closing, I will return to James Trusslow Adam's definition
of the American Dream, quote, a dream of a social order
in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain
to the fullest stature of which they are
and ain't late capable and be recognized by others
for what they are regardless of the fertitious circumstance
of birth or position.
Ask yourself, whose ethos is most reflective
of that sentiment actually better yet go further,
which political party makes that aspiration more attainable.
I think it would be a disservice as majority leader
If I did not state the obvious on behalf of our team,
the insane liberal Democrat policies
is what's driving prices up.
Four years of Joe Biden's crippling inflation
from massive federal overspending.
Millions of illegal pouring across the border,
stressing our support systems.
Radical environments policies driving up energy prices.
Wasteful local government bureaucracy,
driving up the cost of homes.
And there's nothing affordable
about the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare.
Democrats, federal, state, and local
have created problems and actually have the audacity
to claim that they should be the ones that actually
solve those problems that they created.
That's like putting the arsonists in charge
of a fire department.
We Republicans will be standing, starting a fire
of our own this session.
We will reignite the torch that lights the path
for every Georgia's pursuit of their American dream.
Thank you.
And with that, take a couple questions.
Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff, will you see where this legislative process goes?
The only comment I'll make to that is that,
as a former elected official,
I was a city councilman, I've been a elected school board
in my home county where I live.
And the General Assembly, this last five to 10 years,
seems to have to take up issues that local governments
are not addressing on their own.
People are being taxed to death,
they're seeing greater regulation.
I know some of these, whether it's a school board
or some of the cities, they blame regulation,
whether it's on the feds or the states,
but they also have a responsibility to the people
that elected them to do more, do less with more, you know,
tying their bell just like every family that's trying
to put food on the table and it goes to work
every single day.
So we are hearing from the citizens in our community
saying, hey, do something about it,
but I hope that the local elected officials will do more
in working collaboratively with us
to address these cause issues that are really
being generated by local government.
Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the question, I mean, I think our goal this year is to have
a collaborative session.
We will have awesome competition between the House and the Senate.
My goal is to make sure obviously we win those competitions just like in a football game.
But I think at the end of the day, we are one team, we're one team working with our Lieutenant
Governor Burjones were working with Governor Kemp, and at the end of today, the citizens
of Georgia want us to deliver results.
They don't care what's happening in this building, half of them don't even understand
what's happening in this building.
All they care about is, is there pocket book being heard, are there kids getting the
best education, and are we creating the best quality of life for Georgia?
And I think that's the goal of this caucus working with leader abstraction and speaker
Burns.
We'll see, we're going to talk more of that as the days and weeks come.
I know there's interest between the Senate and the House, so I think there is an opportunity
for both chambers to work collaborative with it.
I will tell you just on a personal note, I mean I come from one of the highest growth
counties in Georgia and Pauling County,
and I can't walk out my front door without seeing a new
neighborhood rental community being built.
I think the challenge that citizens have is,
as you put more people into a community,
that's more stresses on our education system.
That's more stresses on our water system.
And I think as we look at what people want in this day and age,
they don't want all these stresses while they're dealing
with all sort of the financial stresses at home.
So, I think we have to address the balance,
and there'll be more to come on that.
Ty.
I appreciate the question, Ty, I mean, my wife's a high school teacher, I have three
kids in the public education system and I've served on the local school board.
So I feel like I've got a pretty good pedigree to be able to talk about these issues.
At the end of the day for us as a caucus, we're going to do what the citizens want.
I know in Pauling County, Georgia, we saw a ballot initiative pass with 64, 65% of our
citizens saying, hey, we want to cap on assessments.
Something has to happen with the spending.
At the same time, we've seen school boards all over the state with excessive fun balances.
While we've seen other counties literally going bankrupt, I think as leaders at the state
level working with our school boards and our teachers and our principals, we have to figure
out what is at right balance.
At the end of the day, the central office cannot be dominant while we're not putting resources
in the classroom for teachers like my wife.
At the same time, the state, every single year for the last few years working with Governor
kept, we've given teachers pay raises while we've seen local governments who do have strong
fund balances not give teacher pay raises.
So we need to have a conversation about how we're going to address this.
I think taxes right now, it's not just a short-term 2026 political issue.
This is a long-term issue that Georgia is going to have to come to grapples with.
And also too, this caucus has passed school choice legislation trying to empower our parents
to have more choice in the lives of our kids.
And so I think through all of that, these conversations talk about the bigger long-term impacts
of education, which we should have, which should be about empowering the taxpayer, empowering
people, empowering parents, and then most of all also empowering our teachers.
Yeah, I mean just in short, our Appropriations Chairman Blake Tillery, I know that's an issue
that's passionate to him and several of our senators.
We just want to make sure we have a strong foster care system.
It's resilient for the years to come.
I think we've made great strides over the last couple of years and I think there's going
be more to come on that, but I think it's a long term issue that we want to continue
and make sure has adequate funding, there's transparency and accountability, but it's
also most importantly, we're doing everything we can to support the kids.
I think we have to head on and talk about what is going on with energy costs.
The balance of whether data centers should come and go, once again, this is a conversation
that's coming up that local governments should be solving that we're finding here in the
state capital.
I think there are aspects of the financial arrangement for some of these data centers that
I think honestly should be debated.
That is the debate our caucus will have with the leaders of this building to see what
is in the best centers of the citizens.
But at the end of the day, I think if hard work in Georgia is there having to tighten
their belts as it relates to the money that they're bringing in, to put food on the table,
to pay for gas, to pay for child support, child care, maybe child support too.
If they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing,
I think that is a real concern.
I think we should have a transparent conversation about it.
It shouldn't be all about what big business wants.
I think we need to talk about what the average citizen wants
and find again what is that balance,
because the energy challenges, whether it is around data centers
or other things are only going to exponentially increase
as we see the population increase in Georgia.
And I think also the challenges that we're seeing,
you know, from a resource perspective.
I think that's why we're interested in protecting water
and seeing more things happen in terms of our natural resources,
especially after the devastation we saw around Hurricane Helene
in Middle East and South Georgia,
and the devastating impact it's had across our state.
So I think there's more issues to come on that.
More discussion?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
