TRANSCRIPT
----------
I want to thank everybody for coming out. It's my pleasure today to support SR 84. Quite frankly,
Democrats unlike Republicans truly mean it when we talk about individual freedom. And this is
indicative today of our support of SR 84, which will allow women the right to choose the reproductive
health options. And we believe the people of Georgia also view women as equal citizens and will
will support her health care options by going to the ballot box and supporting SR-84.
We as the Democratic Caucus support SR-84 and especially support Senator Harrell as
should be spearheading these efforts.
So with that, I will give the podium to Senator Harrell.
Thank you, Leader Jones, and thank you all for coming today.
One of the most common questions I hear from constituents is, why can't we vote to protect
abortion rights like other states have?
And the answer is simple but frustrating.
Georgia's Constitution doesn't allow for direct ballot initiatives.
But that doesn't mean Georgia voters don't deserve a say.
Poll after poll shows the majority of Georgians oppose the state's extreme six-week abortion
ban.
Yet because of gerrymandered safe districts, too many elected officials, like our colleagues,
on the other side of the aisle, they can ignore the will of the people without any consequence.
That's why we are fighting for SR-84, a constitutional amendment that would protect abortion access
up to fetal viability as determined by doctors in each individual case.
Back when we first passed House Bill 481 in 2019, we could only imagine what harms would
come of it.
But now, Georgians are seeing that firsthand.
They've read about the two Georgia women, Candy Miller and Amber Thurman, who died as
a result of delayed care from pregnancy complications.
They know about women whose lives were put at grave risk by being forced to carry non-viable
pregnancies or suffered horrific, avoidable complications from miscarriages.
They're showing up in ERs, with sepsis, hemorrhage, and renal failure as a result of delayed
care.
Instead of being able to deliver the standard of care to prevent these harms, doctors
are being forced to practice medicines with their hands tied behind their backs.
We all know and love women of reproductive age, and we can't help but wonder, what if
that happened to my loved one, to my daughter, to my granddaughter, to my wife, to me?
The people of Georgia deserve the same opportunity
as voters in other states to make their voices heard.
For 50 years after the Supreme Court decided
Roe v. Wade Republicans said abortion should be
decided by the people, not by a judge.
So today, we are fulfilling that request.
Senate Resolution 84 gives the people
chance to decide. Let's put the issue where it belongs on the ballot. Thank you. Questions?
We have had plenty of conversations since 2019 in committee testimony and such, so I do
I just do believe this is thoroughly debated.
I think that Georgians, by and large,
like the constituents who came to me,
you know, why can't we vote on it?
They just don't know what the hurdle is in Georgia.
So I think if you're gonna send a message,
it's an educational message,
that they need to come to their legislators
and say that this is what they want.
And so in driving that message,
your implementing change.
