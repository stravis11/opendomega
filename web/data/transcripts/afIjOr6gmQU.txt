Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered on the local calendar? Chair, has none of the previous questions ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bills? Chair, has none of the report of the committee has agreed to? Shall these bills now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bills on the local calendar will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted this so, Clerk will lock the machine. All in the local calendar, yeas are 165. The nays are zero. The local calendars have received a record as a constitutional majority vote is therefore passed. I'm glad to see you all too. We're going to move on and take up some further actions. Representative Beth Camp has recognized for a motion. Lady will suspend for a moment. Okay, Chair Lady Camp. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to make a motion to agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House for HR 1022. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? HR 1022 for closing the members of the Constitution and the Constitution of the Constitution. Chair Lady Camp has recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We see the Senate substitute added some lines to this, lines 2 through 4. And it talks about the $2,000 statewide homestead exemption that was the measure the Speaker put forth and representative Reeves diligently worked to get to the Senate. I have married the bills. My bill relates to the homestead exemption, the floating statewide homestead exemption. And so they were added together into one measure. And I ask for your consideration to agree to this measure. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? The Chair hears none and the House amendment is adopted. On the ladies' motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Resolution 1022 as amended by the House. All those in favor will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the ladies' motion, the yeas are 171. The nays are zero and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Resolution 1022 as amended by the House. Representative Blackman, chairman Blackman is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 581 as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 581 to be entitled to amend Code Section 285-41.1 of the fish code of Georgia and Tettor, really an economic analysis, certain tax benefits of law or proposed law. The gentleman is recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Chairman Blackman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think both the House and the Senate have worked diligently on legislation to help property owners and our homeowners. So what we have here is the amended version of what they sent us. And I think it's very close to an agree on their part. It includes three measures that passed favorably out of this body earlier this session. Explain part one. It includes measures from House Bill 1031 by Representative Washburn. Thank you, Representative Washburn. And it has language for locals to help deal with some unintended consequences and add some transparency measures. Part two is the statewide floating homestead provision with an opt out for our locals. It has a cap at the CPI and that was Representative Camp. Thank you so much. You worked very hard on that particular bill. That was 1185. And then part three is House Bill 1115, the F-loss provision. And it is included with some pretty strict guardrails, but it gives locals access to this plus one penny if they in fact adopt at the city and county levels, the homestead, the floating homestead exemption as part of this bill. That was Representative Williams. Bill, thank you so much for your hard work. Mr. Speaker. Do you have a couple of questions if you'll take them? Well, just to close, I'd say this has been heavily vetted and fully supported by ACCG and GMA and other stakeholders. And I'd ask for the body's favorable consideration. Will you yield for a question? I have one for you. Yes, sir. I will yield for a question. Representative Wilkerson in the back to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman you'll... Yes, sir. I will try to yield. Yes, sir. You scared me. Did you say ACCG and GMA both agreed? They fully support the measure. That means I got a question. What does this do for the three-year lock? Right now, if you appeal, you get a three-year lock in your property taxes, whether you have a rollback or not. Does this remove that automatic three-year lock? It does not remove the lock, but actually what we determined, I think during the off session, when there were several hearings that were filed, is that the unintended consequence has been an unfortunate one for the homeowners. Say, for instance, in one county, I think it was paulding, over 90 plus percent of the filings for that appeal are actually by the corporate side. And so homeowners are getting shoved to the back of the line. So this appeal is still available. And if you're found by the equal board of equalization, even one dollar in your favor, then that three-year lock would still apply. So does the gentleman further yield? Yes, sir. Just to clarify, the three-year lock only applies if you get a reduction of your taxes. It is not automatic. That is correct, sir. And again, like I said, that actually had that unintended consequence, according to the testimony that it has actually raised property taxes. Thank you. Gentlemen, has him further questions? I will again ask this body for their favorable consideration. You'll the well. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment? Chair here is doing the House Amendment is adopted. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 581 as amended by the House, all those in favor of vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted, all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 164, the nays are two, and the House has agreed to the Senate sub as amended by the House on House Bill 581. Representative Stenson is recognized for a motion, Representative Stenson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1303 as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? To be entitled back to amend Code Section 42, 86, the official go to Georgia, Antidio relating to special license plates, promoting or supporting certain worthy agencies, funds or nonprofit corporations. Representative Stenson is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute in the House Amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I ask for your support to House Bill 1303, the amended bill that you have on your desk is 8M390433, and it's the Special License Plate Honoring the Shepard Center. The other portion of the legislation includes a Special License Placed Honoring Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, the funds raised by the sale of this Special License Plate will be dispersed to the Delta Life Development Center, and the final portion of the legislation that includes license fees for operations of vehicles, for amluses and herds. That is basically the bill, and I ask for your favor of support to House Bill 1303 as it amended. Lady has no questions. Okay, so I yield the will and I ask for your favorable support. Thank you. The lady has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment? Chair, here's no one in the House Amendment is adopted. On the motion, the ladies' motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1303 as amended by the House. All those in favor? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? So, the clerk will unlock the machine. All the ladies' motion, the yeas are 172, the nays 1, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1303 as amended by the House. Members, I want you to give some special attention to this next action. Representative Seabaw is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I make a motion. We agree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 451. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 451 to be entitled to amend Title 45 to go to Georgia annotated relating to public officers and employees, which does require the provision of supplemental illness-specific insurance to certain first responders diagnosed with occupational post-traumatic stress disorder. Representative Seabaw is recognized. Representative Seabaw, you can tell a story and make an introduction if you'd like to. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, colleagues. If you'll remember, House Bill 451 addresses the growing epidemic of first responder. A first responder PTSD in Georgia and requires local and state governments to provide a one-time, lifetime supplemental insurance benefit. For first responders to cover expenses, should they suffer or be diagnosed with PTSD resulting from exposure to line of duty traumatic events? This bill's passed unanimous out of all the House committees, out of this body, out of the Senate Insurance Committee, and out of the Senate. We did ask for a friendly amendment, and we made one check. The gentleman who feels the spend just for a moment. Representative Seabaw, if you'll continue. We made one change on page 9 line, 214, I believe it is. It's just a simple change to the date from January 1, 2024 to 2025. And at my request on page 1 line 14, it now reads, this act shall be known and may be cited as the Ashley Wilson Act. And today we have with us, Gwyneth Police Sergeant Ashley Wilson in the chamber. And I want to thank her for her tenacity and support in making sure we found a solution to this growing problem. And we have found a way to assist these men and women that are suffering PTSD and several of them taking their life. But now we have a way for them to get the help that they need, and we're going to save lives by doing this. And if I can, Ashley, we stand and let us recognize you. And I also would like to mention we have Jenny Hill with us. She's with a nonprofit foundation called Back the Blue Jenny, was a Cobb County police officer that also suffered from PTSD. And now she has a canon that she takes around the country to help lawners and people who are suffering from PTSD. So Jenny, we're welcoming you as well. Thank you for being with us today. And with that colleagues, I'll ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. General, I yield the well. Thank you members. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to have to say that I'm not a good person, but I'm a good person. General, I yield the well. Thank you members. Ladies, thank you for your sacrifice and your tenacity. We appreciate both of you in your service and our thoughts and our prayers and our actions will support you. And the experience is you two have had with your fellow officers and we just appreciate both of you. Thanks for being here. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to Senate substitute to House Bill 451 that we agree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 451. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose? Is representative Sharpe a rise? Paul Mary and Quarry. State you in Quarry, sir. I'm not sure that I've been in the emergency medical field for 35 years and I've seen a lot of things over my life that I probably never forget seeing. And I know that several others have been in the same situation that probably couldn't handle it and taking their lives. And I support this bill 100%. I'm going to give you a service to the people of Georgia as a representative and as a dedicated EMS. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 174. The nays are zero and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 451. Congratulations. Representative Sebaugh and Ashley Wilson. Congratulations. Representative Sebaugh and Ashley, will you all join me? Would you mind? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you for being with us. The one and only, Chairman Jason Shaw is also with us. Jason Shaw. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Stay right there. Thank you. We're going to see Stephen Sains as recognized for our motion. We're going to see. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I motion to agree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 206. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 206 to be entitled to amend Title 36 of the EFIS to go to Georgia and it's related to local governments to provide for the creation of a commercial property assessed conservation, energy and resiliency development authorities. Representative Sains is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My dear colleagues, I want to start off by apologizing to about my excitement on a good piece of policy. I understand it came to us late, Thursday, and although it does a lot of good, simple could not be utilized to describe this piece of legislation. However, as you look at the Senate substitute for clarification, SCSFA, we did get this 26 page bill down to 16 pages. So, in terms of what the C-PACE, the commercial property assessed conservation, energy and resiliency financing does, a financial tool that has been utilized in 34 other states and within this bill makes a very conservative utilization of it within the state of Georgia. It will allow our private developers to obtain a much lower market interest rate on certain parts of their projects, whether it be to renovate or to build that they can currently obtain. It comes up to no surprise to you, nor any families in this state, nor job creators that we are living in a high interest rate environment. And again, C-PACE is a tool that our Georgia legislature can provide to our communities to have a lower cost and improving facilities, replacing an aging roof, installing water or energy efficiency fixtures, or building, like in my area, a more hurricane-proof standard project. The Community Development Tool comes at no cost to local taxpayers, as you can see in lines, 185 to 189, as well as in your Senate substitute, which you will see doesn't look much like the House version. This is only because we modified it from creating a new title in Title 36 to modifying the development authority title. Again, that makes it to where it creates less local government within the title. This bill comes from the favorable consideration of the Economic Developers Association, the Georgia Hotel and Lodging Association, the Georgia Restaurant Association, the Association of Manufacturers, the Municipal Association, the Georgia Healthcare Association. This is because this tool can be utilized in any project that is looking to build in the state of Georgia for 20% of that project for a variety of circumstances, from nursing homes to hospitals to, I believe, Baptist Convention Centers to many more items that every community can benefit from and to be transparent. The reason I looked at this not very simple policy as a good measure is a Brownfield side in downtown St. Mary's, Georgia, that 20 years ago was our leading economic developer, the Elman Paper Company, that now is sitting dormant because there is no developer that has been able to retrofit that project within market costs. This tool that is currently already accessible in the state of Georgia, but not accessible to communities like mine or yours because our DDA structure that we currently have in place for it is not attainable for smaller cities or even medium-sized cities. This will allow them to come to market at a much lower cost. With, again, and I want to describe the structure of this because we did get a couple questions about it last night, what will happen is the developer goes and does a financing application to the local development authority that has allowed this tool to be used within their authority. They must then, if that development authority finds it within the code section of this law within the applicability and within a capital provider that can guarantee the bond, they must then enter into an intergovernmental agreement that includes all participating local governments, the developer and the capital provider. They then can issue revenue bonds that is paid for by the developer through their property tax assessment. I will yield, Mr. Speaker, for any questions if there are any. Yeah, you have a couple of questions. I will yield for as many as you find pertinent to the bill. Well, I'm not sure about that now. We won't have to qualify all of them, but I'm going to recognize Will Park. He usually has pertinent questions. Let's see how he does. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Sometimes. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that House Bill 206 passed this House last year with bipartisan support of 135 years? It is true. Is it not further true that participation in this program would be completely voluntary and at no cost to the participants? It would be at no cost to the participating local governments. And again, it's a voluntary way for the developer to tax themselves to obtain a lower risk and lower interest rate on part of their loaning and building. Thanks, sir. My final question. Is it not true that I plan on voting yes to this bill because it will allow for private low cost financing to modernize infrastructure to increase energy efficiency, conserve water, and improve resiliency? So, it's a good idea when we can agree on good policy for the state of Georgia that improves the quality of not only development in our bill, in our communities, but our communities overall. So, thank you. I yield for further questions if there are any, Mr. Speaker. Do you have a couple more? Chairman LeHood to your right and the corner has a question. Chairman LeHood. Well, the gentleman you? I do. It's not true that the business community in this state is asking for this bill as evidenced by written requests from multiple business associations around the state and that this will allow, enable them to be critical needs in regards to commercial real estate development. They are asking for it. And unlike some policy questions we have, this request doesn't come from us having to decide, is it of enough benefit to spend state resources, but we are only creating a structure that we can infuse private capital at a less risk and thus less interest rate to that provider. So it makes sense that the business community is strongly in favor of it. Thank you. And one more question, please. I do yield. I do that this can be done at no cost to taxpayers and the local government and the bar war encourage all the fees associated with it. As a great fiscal steward, as evidenced by the committee that you chair, you are correct. It is at zero cost to the taxpayer. And in multiple lines of this legislation, it makes clear that the faith and credit of this state, nor any participating local government, can be utilized for the repayment of the bonds. I'll yield for a further question. I have a question from Representative Darlene Taylor up the center out on your left. Does it, gentlemen, yield? I do. Is it not true that I had so much interest in this particular idea that last year I can be in a meeting with my local bankers, builders, cities and counties. And they all were very much in favor of this because it's giving an opportunity to affect efficiencies in building over long term low interest rates. Madam Chair, lady, I agree. And thanks to your efforts along with many in this room, the banking association and the credit union associations have been worked with. And it's been made clear that if there is a traditional loan involved within the project, that that institution must give a prior authorization for the C-PACE structure to be utilized. As one in the back in the right quarter, Chairman Carpenter has a question. Chairman Carpenter. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that I've actually voted no twice on this bill? But after doing a really, really deep dive into this, I realized that while the policy seems skewy from the federal government, it is ashamed to not allow the states to utilize what the crazy federal government has come up with. I appreciate you reflecting on your stance and being pro-businesses. I know you are on many things in ensuring that our communities have tools to combat the current high interest rate that we are facing all around this nation. You have more. I'll yield for one more question, Mr. Speaker. I'll recognize Representative Al Williams for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that you have done a much better job explaining this bill this time than you originally did? I was told by many that I left y'all unsatisfied by the brevity that I spoke in last Thursday, not, and I hope I haven't repeated myself. Is it not true you haven't repeated yourself, but it wasn't just the brevity. It was the lack of. Is it not true that I too have voted against this bill, but one of the questions that you have answered has satisfied me in that there is no liability on the part of any development authority, because we already knew passives and pick up taxes anyhow, but I just was concerned about the liability. I understand you are concerned, and you are very right in saying there is no risk to the development authority as the only way that the capital provider can obtain the loan is through the assessed property. And furthermore, I know that you would be excited to be for a measure that will allow our coastal communities to enhance their ability for the sweet cherry one that you speak of, so favorably, to enhance their ability to conserve that cherry one for the appropriate uses. I don't follow a question to my newfound friend who I admire because of his taste in wine, but is it not finally true that the gentleman from Dalton spoke of the terrible policies of Washington that we will be looking for a refund check of all that terrible federal money that was spent down there? I will yield the well on that note, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your favorable consideration to this measure. Sounds like the gentleman was tired, hungry, and thirsty the other night, so I think we can all agree on that. Gentlemen has yielded the well on the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate substitute on House Bill 206. All those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed. We will vote no in the clerk. We will unlock the machines. Have all members voted for what purpose is representing House to rise? Parliament for infalloring. State inquiry. Is it not true that this is a different bill than the one we saw in Thursday night that was passed out on the floor? Sounded like it to me. Thank you so much for putting the true bill on those. I will read it carefully again tonight after we adjourned and make sure it was. Well, I think we had the wrong one that was passed out late Thursday night. Thank you. Thank you for that point of clarification. For what purpose is representing Becky Evans rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. I guess Mr. Speaker isn't it true that sea level is rising and the climate is warming and that this bill will help our communities in Georgia to become more resilient and sustainable. The only thing I can tell you, I'm ready to get out of here and get out in the sunshine. So you may be right on the least part of what your statement is. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 206. The yeas are 142 and the nays are 22. The House has agreed. What the chair recognizes representing talented for a motion. Representative Townsend got a coastal thing going on here. Representative Townsend's recognized. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to say I'd like to agree to HB 181 and the Senate has passed. You want to agree to the Senate's substitute? Senate's substitute, yes, sir. Absolutely. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption? House Bill 181 to be entitled to amend chapter 13 to title 16 in the official code of Georgia and attended related controlled substances. Someone's recognized to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Everybody, I'd like to thank you for your past support and upcoming support. Hopefully, this overrunably passed in the House of Senate, House last year, Senate this year. Basically, they adjusted just a couple of things. They lowered the penalties for the store clerk. Everything else is safe, the same except for the date as well. So we're still requiring strong labeling, still requiring penalties for the bad actors on the higher level and just really appreciate your support and answer any questions this time, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you. He's here to the well. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 181. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed. We'll vote no when the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 164, the nays are six, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 181. Gentlemen, lever it is recognized for a motion. House Bill 220. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I moved that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 220. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 220 to be entitled to a man title 44 of the Fisher go to Georgia and Senator Lane the property says to provide for means of enforcement of condominium property owners association instruments, rules and regulations. Representative Leveritt is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This was a bill we passed out last year that would address the way Homer's associations, condo associations, and property owners associations can enforce their covenants. The bill required that there be notice and a right to cure given to the property owner before the association took any action. We also added provisions that made it clear that addressed a judicial decision that effectively required the HOA to go on your property and try to fix whatever the condition was before they even went to court. This changed it so they would have to go to court, prove to a judge that there's a violation rather than just go on the property. Another reason they were requesting this is they don't want to go on property because they sometimes get shot at when they do it without a court order. So this was for the safety of the HOA personnel, condo association personnel, as well as for to protect the rights of the property owner. In the Senate, they added some additional provisions that strengthen the interest of the property owners by saying that they can't take away their suspend voting rights based on failure to pay fines. And they also added a provision where members can call a meeting, the annual meeting of an HOA or a property owner association by a certain number of signatures. I think it was a pretty low percentage if the officers failed to hold that annual meeting. So we believe the changes made over there strengthen the bill, increase the rights of those who are in HOAs and property owners associations, and I would ask that you favorably approve the motion. Gentlemen, has a question for you? Yes, sir. I'll give you a judgment card to your left. Has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, you? Yes, ma'am. I'll be yield. So just to be clear, in the first part of the bill, lines 21 through 28, we are saying that the HOA, after giving notice, can just come onto your property and change things. No, exactly the contrary. Well, right now the courts actually rulings have required them to do that. This would change it so they don't. They would go to court first and get an order and allow you a hearing in front of the impartial third party to present your position. Thank you for clarifying that. Thank you for clarifying as well. That's an important point of the legislation. Representative Chirman Park, thank you. You're a chairman, I want to get that straight. What park before I get in trouble? What park has the question you recognize? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Levering, to go off of a representative Clark's point, so on lines 21 to 28, would this allow an HOA to immediately go to a court as opposed to simply talking to the homeowner about addressing certain issues or problems that they may have to be having? No sir, because at the request of the Realtors Association there is a provision in the bill that requires a written notice by a letter and an opportunity to cure before they take that action. Thank you for the clarification. Thank you and congratulations on your recent promotion. One more, Mr. Chairman. Yes sir. Representative Ronda Taylor. To your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Oh, thank you. Yes ma'am. Can you explain to me how this benefits the homeowner's rights? Is there an unbiased program in here where both sides are represented for protection? I'm sorry, Madam Representative, I didn't hear the, you said is there a, what? Can you explain the benefits of this for the homeowner? This seems to be proactive for the HOA's only. What in this bill gives homeowner's rights? Well I would say as it is turned out, everything does. The homeowner, the HOA or the Condo Association cannot take any action unless they first tell you there's a problem and tell you exactly what it is and give you a chance to remedy it. They can't take any action at all. Secondly, this will encourage them not to go onto your property before they let you have a hearing before a judge to present your side of the story. The judge may agree with you that there is no violation. So it actually will eliminate the current state of the law which requires that they try to go onto your property to, if it's some kind of condition that needs to be cured in their position, it'll eliminate that need so they can take, for after giving your notice and right to cure, they would then initiate the action and let you have a hearing before a judge. Is the gentleman further? Yes ma'am. Let's say for example that what you said just happened, they notified the homeowner, the homeowner has to go to court. What, what, what actually enforces the law? I mean you can get the order from the court. And the reason why I say that is because we've been having hearings on H.O.A.'s and rentals and the stories are hard that the H.O.A.'s are just dismissing whatever the judge is saying, what would the court say is they just, what forces are enforces the law and ability? Well I mean the homeowner could enforce the law, I suppose the issue the lady is talking about is admittedly not touched by this bill but it tries to avoid those problems from happening on the front end by giving people more notice and more rights than they currently might have. I appreciate the attempt in trying to resolve this ongoing issue. Yes ma'am, I appreciate your question. General has a further questions. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, I'm Miss Speaker, I would ask the bodies' favourable consideration of the motion and ask you vote green. Thank you. Thank you for your presentation. All the General's motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 220. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines. All the General's motions, the yeas are 160, the nays are 10 and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 220. We're going to vote no. Reps. Elevator, you're up again. 825 chair recognizes, represent any deliberate. You're going to be worn out man for the night so if you keep going, if the members is recognized. Thank you Miss Speaker, there isn't any going to be about it. Miss Speaker, I move that the House agree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 825. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 825 to be filed in act to amend chapter 23 title 47 of the EFISCO to Georgia and it's headed relating the judicial retirement system to require certain counties that can pry single county judicial circuits to supplement the retirement benefits paid to the circuit superior court judges. Reps. Elevator is recognized to explain the Senate amendment. Thank you Miss Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 825 was a local district attorney supplemental retirement bill. Those now apparently in the opinion of legislative counsel cannot be done as local bills but have to be done as a general bill drafted so that it has limited application. So HB 825 provided that the district attorney for the Columbia County Judicial Circuit could have local supplemental retirement. It's there's no impact on the state. It's all to be paid by the local jurisdiction and the local jurisdiction has requested this. In the Senate, an additional similar bill got added for the judges of the state court of Fulton County. It was representative Bruce's bill which he presented in this body passed. So we've got basically two local retirement supplement bills combined now into one. Both bills have zero or not fiscal bills in the opinion the auditor. They have no impact on state funds. They're all to be paid from local funds and I would ask your favorable consideration of the motion. Now you'll for any questions. You have one question. Representative Roger Bruce, you call him out now. He's going to respond. Jim was recognized for a question. With the gentleman here. Yes, sir. Thank you very much for carrying the bill. You're very welcome. Thank you for classing my bill up with your bill. You have no further questions. Thank you, Miss Bacon. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your favorable consideration of the Senate amendment. Thank you.

Title 21 of the official go to George Anderson. It's in the primaries and elections generally. So is required the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a statewide system for the posting of scanned paper ballots. Representative Luthood is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. House Bill 974 is a combination of three House bills that crossed over to the Senate. They were combined over there and sent back for us to agree. And what Section 1 and 2 does is puts a visible security feature on the ballots. Sections 3 and 4 require that the Secretary of State post ballot images online and it specifies the resolution threshold. Section 5 expands audits, pre-certification audits, and Section 6 requires the Secretary to stand up a optical character recognition verification audit program.

I ask the members of the House to agree to the Senate's substitute to HB 994. Clerk will you read the caption? House Bill 994 to be entitled neck to a mentautos 51 and 52 of the EFISCO to Georgia annotated relating to torts and waters of the state, orts and watercraft respectively. Those are revised liability for the negligence and operation of a vessel. RIPSE Powell is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute to House Bill 994. Thank you Mr. Spoken ladies and gentlemen. You may remember by halfway through the session we passed this bill that was to save the Georgia Marine industry that leases boats. At that time what has happened was because of a carous liability which was Georgia was only one of the three states that had this, was that the people who were in the business of renting boats to the recreational industry in this state, that they were accepting total responsibility even for the folks that rented these craft if there was an accident. And because of that a lot of our boat leases that they were going out of business because they just quite frankly couldn't afford liability. Thanks to Chairman Lundston's Committee and so many others who approved this bill took it out and I had that time as first time I probably ever bragged on GTA LA that they accepted this change of torque reform to that because it saved an industry for this state. When over to the Senate and we had the only change that they made was they raised the insurance rates so that for these people who are in the business of leasing boats and marinas and such that they will carry a 500 and a million dollars liability which when it left the house it was 250 and 500,000. This would be in case there was some accident something that happened because of a flow of the boat or something like that. Mr. Speaker be glad to answer any questions then if there are none I appreciate your support and save this industry in the state of Georgia. You have one question representing Gamble of the Senate all when you're right. Yes sir be glad to. This is gentleman you I will is it not true that for all of us who enjoy the waters of our state and recreation on our lakes and our rivers and even our oceans that this is a great bill and it certainly will help our friends across the state that are in this business. It certainly will and thanks to the members of this house and even the Senate that I rarely brag on this is actually going to be good for the business in this state since we have so many wonderful lakes and so many people want to go out and have a good time. So many people want to run about or lease about instead of owning one so thank you so much. Just to ask a further questions thank you ladies and gentlemen I appreciate your support for this. Mr. Chairman I know the Senate would believe it but one of them walked in about time you were saying something nice about them so we certainly can he can verify that that's the case. I'm not going to be a good man but I'm not going to be a good man. No you can't. Gentlemen is yielded the will. All the gentlemen's motion the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 994. All those in favor will vote yes those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines. All the gentlemen's motion the yeas are 174 the knees are zero and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 994. Chair recognize represent the manor for a motion.

Mr. Clerk no we don't need to do that yet I'm sorry. Representative Tim Fleming is recognized for a motion representative Fleming. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I make a motion that we agreed to Senate substitute to House bill 1207. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption House bill 1207 to be a title in act to amend chapter 2 title 21 of the official code of Georgia and it's related to elections and primaries generally so to provide for proofing a balance by local superintendents and certain races. Chair recognizes representing Fleming to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you Mr. Speaker House bill 1207 is a combination of several measures that we worked with on the Senate that added to House bill 1207 which passed this body unanimously. So I'll walk through the sections real quick section one of the bill states that election workers must be a U.S. citizen to work in the process. Section 2 and 3 was a measure brought by the Secretary of State's office and what it does it reopens qualifying when nobody has qualified in a contested election and it would reopen it on that following Monday at 9 a.m. and closes Tuesday at 5 p.m. immediately following the original qualifying period. Section 4 is a candidate ballot proofing bill that we passed unanimously in this measure in this body basically given a 24 hour period for candidates to review a ballot before it goes to print or is loaded to the machines. Section 5 comes from counties election superintendents basically what it does it authorizes elections superintendents to determine the number of voting machines at precincts own election day. Just on election day currently in law it has that there has to be one machine for every 250 registered voters in that precinct what this does it gives the county election superintendents board of elections to review data how many voters voted early in the early voting process how many voted in the aftert process so they can best deploy their equipment throughout the county as a see fit. Section 4 some sorry section 6 deals with some clarification around poll watchers and what they have access to to observe and what they do not. Section 7 prohibits the use of threats or violence that would prevent or interference with elections operations regarding elections officials and poll watchers this has been in the code for many years and only said poll officer but we added election official and poll watchers to that language. So I would ask for your favorable consideration to hb-207 and Mr. Speaker there's no questions deal the well. Gentlemen has a couple of questions if you yield. Yes. Jasmine Clark to your left. Thank you. Mr. Speaker does it. Gentlemen you yes ma'am. Could you explain to me why especially in times where sometimes it's very difficult to find enough poll workers in the first place that we're limiting who can be a poll worker. In what section are you referring to. So this is this is where this is not poll workers this would be with this would be anybody that is if you read it a person employed or attained by county elections in the undertakes any election related duties arising from this chapter so yes that would be poll workers because they do get paid for the process and believe the blue is if you're going to work in our elections you need to be a US citizen. This is a gentleman further you yes ma'am. Can you explain why I mean if I feel like there's a spectrum between someone being undocumented and someone being a citizen we have permanent residents we have people who are applying for citizenship and I think that working the polls could be a very nice civics lesson and how our elections work. Why would we limit this to only citizens when again a lot of our jurisdictions are having problems getting poll workers. Well I would disagree you had to be a citizen to vote so I would say to work in the process you should be a citizen as well. All right thank you. Gentlemen you are for another question. One more Mr. Speaker. Representative Colum in the back all the way in the back on your left. Yes sir to my friend. Is it not true I just had a local election that this legislation would have solved part of the problem. Yes sir Representative Colum you know I've talked about that several times I believe you had a municipality in your district that had some issues with their last municipal election. HB-107 would help address that. Mr. Speaker I would yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen is yielded the well. All in the gentleman's motion the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1207. All those in favor will vote yes those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines.

Mr. Clerk, we're hearing the caption to House Resolution 11661166. House Resolution 1166 by Representative Meeks of the 178th and others of Resolution Creating House Study Committee on Exchange Storage and Bond Coverage of the Agricultural products grain and livestock. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Agricultural and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chairman Meeks has recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker. Bring to you House Resolution 1166. Ladies and gentlemen, as many of you know across our state, where a houseman are required to carry a bond. And over the past several, over the past 12 months, we've seen an increase in the number of bonds are being called. And many times the amount of the bond is not covered the cost of the agricultural goods that have been agreed to be purchased from agricultural producers. So this is a study committee to take a look at the issue. We appreciate your favorable consideration. House Resolution 1166. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Now you're the well. General Mahaz, those questions are yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The Chair here is known the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machine. On the adoption of House Resolution 1166, the yeas are 162, the nays are zero. This resolution haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the resolution to House, read the caption to House Resolution 12831283? House Resolution 1283, by the way, I represent Apollo 33rd and others. I resolution creating House Study Committee on Safety and Consumer Protection of nicotine vapor products. This resolution haven't referred to the committee on regulated industries. That committee recommends this resolution be adopted. Chairman Powell is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, the House of bringing to you, HR 1283, this grace, a House Study Committee on Safety and Consumer Protection of nicotine vapor products. You know what these committees consist of? Five members appointed by the speaker. And the reason for this is earlier in the session, Representative Gaines had the vapor bill, the registry bill. And we poured in a good bet of time and effort over and regulated an industry committee. And we realized at that time that this is an industry that's pretty well out of control to the standpoint that we don't know what's good and what's bad for the consumer product. Now, somebody like myself who has participated enjoying the pleasures of nicotine and tobacco products all of his life, I'm not even familiar with what this stuff does. I have been told that a lot of these products that are sold are adulterated. They come from out of the country. The product got more bootloads of that stuff coming from China in places like that. But there is no standard and it needs to be dealt with. We thought we had put some good language in that bill of representative gains. But still there's other things that need to be dealt with, such as a lot of these vape shops fill their own vapes. Which is kind of reminded me of some of you who are as old as I am. You'll remember when pipe smoking was popular. You could go to tobacco store and they'd mix your own blend of pipe tobacco. Well, nobody smokes a pipe anymore as it put pot in it. So there's not that kind of tobacco products being done anymore. So now what you've got is you've got these vape stores that they're mixing this on vape product. And you know, what I have always been told is that pure nicotine is like a poison that you could put pure nicotine on your skin and it would kill you. So that's what we're trying to do. Look into this and carry it on a little bit further. And that quite frank, this about the consumer protection on these vape products to see what's in them. They glad to answer a question. If you are none, please vote for this so we can speak and I'm going to five of you good folks to study it over. General has a question. Now, think if you don't mind representative Hutchinson to recognize for a question. Be more than glad to. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am, I yield. I just wanted to thank you for this and thank you for giving me my signed-i-died bingo car where it says, Alan Powell goes to the well-making jokes. So thank you for the jokes. Well, I'm not responsible for that bingo car that you have that was passed out, but thank you for the compliments, ma'am. You're quite welcome. My question is, we spoke in regulated industries about whether or not the chair of this committee could expand his study to include Delta 8 and Delta 9 products and other products that we have on the street in Georgia today to try and address that problem. Are you asking me does this? Does he have the authority to expand the study? Well, you know, I think the latitude of a study committee since it's so close, one is nicotine-based-based products and the other is a hemp-based CDB stuff. And from all actions that I'm hearing is that the Senate has succumbed to the pressures of the monopolies that have the cannabis licenses and we've got all that clean-up language for the hemp stuff and it looks like they're getting a little bit light and a little bit light and a loafers over there about wanting to vote it out. So this might be an excellent committee while they're looking at they to look at all these products that are being sold that there's no control as to the purity of them and what may be adulterated and what may be of harm to the consumer in Georgia. And yes, I think that would probably be a good idea. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Schfeger, if there's no other questions, I'll be more than glad to view this well. Jim, as you will in the well. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none of the previous questions ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution that Chair has done to report the committee has agreed to? Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor, the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. All the adoption of House resolution 1283, the years are 171, the days are zero and the resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House resolution 1360, 1360? House resolution 1360, by the way, I have to see the 13th and others, a resolution creating the House study committee an alternative to opioids for pain management. This resolution now may refer to the committee on health, that committee recommends this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. Representative Katie Dimpsey is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I bring to you a resolution for us to develop a House study committee on alternatives to opioids for pain management and other reasons. It's those other reasons, I think, that are also so vitally important. Over the past several years, we have taken a number of actions to combat the opioid and overdose crisis in Georgia, but the data clearly shows that more needs to be done. This study committee is our standard study committee with seven House members appointed five non-legislative experts to from our agencies from DCH and DPHDD, the commissioner or their appointees. What this would basically do is give us an opportunity for a robust conversation to study the ways and be aware of the existing non-opioid alternatives, including non-opioid pharmacologic treatment options, educational programs, and ways that we can not only help people who have real pain and need real pain medication, but also those who are easily led to become addicted. Mr. Speaker, that is what it will do. I will be glad to take any questions or yield the well. Lady Hasn't no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable support. Is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Bell rise? He weighs. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. All the adoption of House resolution 1360, the yeas are 170 and the nays are zero. The resolution, Henry, is either requisite, constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House resolution 13841384? House resolution 1384, by reps into black, one of the 146 and others, a resolution creating the House study committee and assessing the semester and quarter system at USG and TCSG institutions. This resolution I've been referred to the committee on higher education, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chairman Blackman is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, fellow members, for you House resolution 1384, which would take a look at the semester system versus the quarter system. I think over time there have been many assertions regarding that transition and the benefits to our state universities and technical colleges. And this would just allow us to take a little deeper dive and closer look at that, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has a question to feel yield? I will yield, yes, sir. Rimsley, Stacey Evans to your left. It's a recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. To one of the co-sponsors, yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Isn't it true that when I started at the University of Georgia Go Dogs, it was the last time we were doing the quarter system at the University system of Georgia. And then I'm very curious to see if the study committee will tell us whether that change, especially in the university system generally, but particularly in the TCSG system, if perhaps having an extra time when workers come out of the workforce through the quarter system might serve us better. And then I really appreciate you bringing the bill. Yes, thank you. I think we are of a like minds on that. Thank you for the question. No further questions. Thank you. Thank you for your consideration. Mr. Speaker, yield the well. Gentlemen, yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's the under report. The committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution, we will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? All the adopts in house resolution 1384, the yeas are 171 and nay is zero. This resolution has received a request. Cost of majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, where you read the caption to house resolution 12291229. House resolution 1229, I'm glad to meet the 130th and others. A resolution urging the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to provide for additional resources to address elder care, nursing home access and expanded disabled residential programs for the veteran community populations. This resolution has been referred to the committee on defense and veteran affairs. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Representative Gladney has recognized to present the resolution. Representative Gladney, gentlemen, if y'all would lift her down the aisle. It's like they had a roadblock, didn't it? Representative Lynn Gladney. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise this afternoon. Today to offer my sincere gratitude, first of all, to the leadership of this house in support of HR 1229 and all of those who support veterans. I'll continue by offering an opportunity and a challenge. I know that we've all seen the VFW ladies and gentlemen around our communities with their veteran caps and regalia on. When was the last time you recognized an unsuspecting veteran by thanking him or her for their service? You're asking them about their tour of service. I invite you to seek out these experiences from them. Additionally, I challenge you to take it even a step further and to ask them how they feel about the services and the benefits they receive from their local VA. I have no doubt that you will learn a lot about the obstacles and the experiences that challenge them. At the request of the Georgia Department of Veteran Services, a Georgia State Senate subcommittee was submitted a prepared analysis from Kennesaw State University which indicated that the current population of veterans, which is over 600,000, is not sufficiently supported by the two existing veteran nursing homes and one veteran cemetery. These facilities are located. One in Augusta and one in Millageville. Today this urging congressional resolution requests the United States and the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide for additional resources from their currently proposed $369 billion VA budget to address elder care, nursing home access and expanded disabled residential programs for veterans in our community. Allow me to make a quick sobering pivot for my veteran colleagues. You know what the forces comp protection condition is. If you've seen those movies, it's called an Fcon threat level. Currently in the United States and NATO forces are at the highest threat level indicative of foreign and domestic threats. Furthermore, military recruiting efforts struggle to meet quotia and to maintain an efficient, effective, highly trained defense force. I would challenge us to consider this profound proverb. The character of a nation is determined by how they treat those that they think they do not need. For those who serve, they are owed our continued advocacy for their health and for the diligence in honoring their final resting site. It is my honor to ask you to please support this resolution. With that, I ask for your favourable consideration. Consideration. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I yield the well. Ladies, you are the well. Thank you for your presentation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favour of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Resolution 1229, the yeas are 170 and nays are zero. The resolution, however, is the requisite cost of majority is therefore adopted. Congratulations. Members, I'm going to take up a couple of pieces of legislation that we carried over from Tuesday. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the Senate resolution 189 SR189? Senate resolution 189 by Senator Dollzell of the 27th. A resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution so that it provides a general assembly made by General Law authorized local boards of education to impose levy and collect development impact fees and use the proceeds to pay for a share of the cost of additional educational facilities. This resolution has been referred to the committee on government and affairs that committee recommends this resolution be adopted. I think Todd Jones is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, on behalf of the Forsyth County delegation, it is my privilege to come to you with a constitutional amendment question regarding the imposition of impact fees for school boards for high growth school districts. Those are school districts that have grown 20% in the last 10 years and have spent $250 million in the last 10 years to give you an idea. The only school district out of 181 that qualifies as Forsyth County and it has built one school each year for the past 23 years. Mr. Speaker, that is the summary of the question on SR189. You have no questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here is none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here is none of the report. The committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. That is a great idea. Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. All the adoption of Senate resolution 189, the yeas are 88, the days are 84, and this resolution having failed to receive the requisite Constitutional majority is therefore lost. What purpose represent you if Jones rise? To make a motion. State your motion. Mr. Speaker, I would like the motion for reconsideration of SR189. On the general's motion of this House, reconsider this action in failing to give Senate resolution 189 a requisite majority. All those in favor of reconsideration will vote yes.

Colleagues, I bring to you House resolution 1432 and as a clerk stated, this would create the House disaster mitigation and resilience study committee. Over the last several years, as we've seen, an increase in development in our communities, growth, not only in building and infrastructure, but people as well. The impact from storms that we have from different times each year has increased the cost, not only in property damage, but in lives lost as well. Two years ago, in January, we had a tornado come through my area. Unfortunately, there was a child that was lost their life there and a lot of property was damaged. And so this study committee would seek just to look at ways to increase our resiliency from the impact of these storms. A lot of things being done around the state in pockets in different places. And this would take a look at all of those and see if there's things that we can replicate throughout the state and things that we can give to the to Jima and the folks there and support the good work that they already do, but help them be more effective and give them more support. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to answer any questions if there are any. Gentlemen, has no questions? You'll be well-nast for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, Jeal, to well, Representative Holley would like to speak in favor of the resolution. Representative Holley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues ask you to join me for your favorable consideration of House Resolution 1432. For the viewing public, this may come as a surprise, but this might be one of the very rarest of times in our chamber where Democrats will modestly recognize a moment of hope and possibly finally seeing the light from our colleagues across the aisle, from behind the smoke in the hot air. Yes, it was a surprise to me, but at the national level, the 81-person conservative climate caucus led by Congressman John Curtis of Utah, of which has two Georgians as members, the Congressman Carter and Ferguson, has made the following declaration on its official website. Get this. The climate is changing. Private sector innovation, American resources and resource and development investment have resulted in lower emissions and affordable energy. Again, this is their site. They also say climate change is a global issue and solutions should reduce global emissions and not just be feel-good policies. Practical and exportable answers can be found in innovation embraced by the free market. Americans and the rest of the world want access to cheaper, reliable and cleaner energy. With innovative technologies, fossil fuels can and should be a major part of the global solution while reducing emissions is the goal. Now, it sounds so similar to the goals originally put forward by the progressive climate caucus that studying these effects may protect individuals displaced by climate change. Further, as you see on this resolution, or lines 16 and 17 of the bill highlighting the quote, coordinated and collaborative effort to develop comprehensive responses and solutions and quote, or actually goals that are shared by long-standing green economy proponents like the Center for Sustainable Economy, American Farmland Trust, Clean Water Action Fund, and the Climate Justice Alliance, and Greenpeace. Harvard Business School, Jr. Professor and Oxford University Scholar, Robert Eckles, even opined in his article quote, what I've learned from conservatives who are addressing the challenge of climate change, end quote, that neither liberals or conservatives can claim a monopoly on the best ideas for addressing the climate change. The truly best ones must be bipartisan because there are the only ones that will be put into practice. Areas of focus here should be public policy, a carbon tax, and the appropriate roles and relationships between the financial sector and technology. This year has been the warmest on record to degrees higher and affect that increases the tipping points of the ice caps melting, which has we seen in recent years contributing to the rise in the sea levels that also has been devastating the coastline. Researchers have reported that there's some very direct correlations between the change of global temperatures and human migration. As the Association for Environmental Resource Economists noted, that while the United States prides itself as a sign of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to hold governments accountable to satisfy ambitious climate action goals, but by their studies, the business community has derived a 10% higher return and revenues from green goods and services as a result of responding to these changes with free market solutions. This represents a level shift in market capitalization. With richer returns, we should not run from the burgeoning opportunities available in new green markets, providing responsive low-carbon investments that can save money in the long run and save time and help both governments and private partners make wiser use of funds and resources. My colleagues, it's 2024 and we would do ourselves a huge disservice by believing that the bad actors are limited to the stereotypical poorer communities, which often are worse off to adjust to more preventative measures, or that the bad actor would be fossil fuel industry giants that share in the characterization as the biggest abuser, but also are the most capable investor and new technologies that might better help our society to mitigate the harm of natural disasters. Judging the degree to which we ascertain the impacts of these climate change differences on our natural environment and our state landscape will more solidly direct our attention to the effectiveness of joint partnerships among the social responsibility of corporate community and ESG, that is the environmental, social, and governance investments that might give us clearer critical data and necessary metrics to better gauge accountability and addressing our behaviors relative to such change. The means can justify the ends and sometimes the end goals are not so far-fetched but can be easily found right here in Georgia. Mr. Speaker, only a few blocks from our press and site is South Face, a well-respected organization that has taken up the mantle of incorporating standards of energy conservation and to the quality of bills for a state's residential and commercial infrastructure advancements. Initiatives like resilience hubs employ the use of rainwater harvesting barrels and solar plus storage battery systems. There are additional possibilities which might result from this study committee that encourage positive economic growth including reduced risks to our state's biodiversity among both flora and fauna improved air quality low carbon energy careers healthier soil for crop production and cultivation and improvements to our water containment systems. The data can better enrich our activities and behaviors as both individuals and businesses. You know, it's hard to admit that your friends on the left side of the aisle were wisely onto something by recognizing that the actions of people might be negatively contributing to the erasure of our ozone layer, the erasure of our soil and the contamination of our drinking water. But oh, I've learned from one who created the sea, the land and earth that sometimes when folks come to see the light, sometimes you just got to count it all joy. That's why colleagues, I hope you will join me in supporting House Resolution 1432. I now yield the well and I've had so much fun. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here has known that previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to report the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair here's another report the committee is agreed to. So this resolution now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted for what purpose is represented really rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Sir, is it not true that my friend there, I don't know what he's talking about, but this bill here is to help when emergency happens like in 2018 when her came Michael or in 2020 whenever we had the tornadoes in Chashford to help get the emergency groups together to get rebuilt and quicker. That's what my understanding of my reading of the bill was. For purposes rip, chair lady camp rise. Staying boring. Isn't it true that on the night of the inauguration of Governor Kemp in 2020, a litany of tornadoes hit my area and caused lots of damage and it was very challenging trying to mobilize in the dark across county lines trying to make sure that people got the help they needed that night in the coming days as well. I think that's the purpose of what we're doing. Appreciate the ladies' insight. For what purpose is represented night rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Staying boring. Mr. Speaker isn't it true that I like my colleague Jason really just wants to make clear to this body that this is a study that is just about looking at the disasters that it has nothing to do with a climate change. It has nothing to do with environmental social governance. It is just simply a resolution that allows this state to react to the natural disasters that happens here and not the fallen politics and climate resolutions and regulations that are driving people out of the states that are embracing them. I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks. If all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine. All the adoption of House resolution 1432, the A's are 152, the NA16, the resolution, haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House will come to order. House will come to order. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House resolution 14351435?

The Trust Fund has already saved over 58,000 acres in 25 states and half of these battlefields have already been lost with the American Revolution Air War.
