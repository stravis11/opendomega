Have all members voted?
So the clerk will lock the machines, doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
We will again our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
I think you're in for a real treat this morning and I just want to tell you who her boy is
but I can't and we'll let our Williams do that. There's a reason she's got a
Bulldog face mask on. So our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the
gentleman from the 168th Health District Representative, Al Williams,
Representative Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning and good morning to my colleagues. And
and I know some of you will be shocked
that I'll say this, but this is the best day of my life.
Why is it now?
Because this is the day the Lord has made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
I am really honored this morning
to bring our chapter to the day.
Go long ways back with her husband's family
and it's just good to have her here
to share with us this morning.
And I was thinking, as we were sitting,
I know that she comes prepared.
I know the Lord called her.
She's from Macintosh County.
There was an embedded elotr reference now
which she lives in a better district,
168 in Liberty County.
Now, we also know that she drove late last night
She drove late last night to get here.
For those of you who have not made the trip,
anywhere you come, Representative, Mr. Jordan Lita,
is 250 miles.
As the birds decrow flies, the donkey walks,
or the car drives, is 250.
Minister Erica LeCounc comes to us this morning,
having been born in McIntosh County,
but I told Representative Hugo this morning
that Liberty County men are known for the ingenuity
and the intellect, so her husband, Richard Jr.
crossed the county line and scooped their best
and brought her back to Liberty County.
And here she is.
She has three children.
She works for coastal electric,
the customer service representative.
And all of us like to talk about, we know great coaches.
Of course, they have a profound impact upon our lives.
Certainly, two coaches had a profound effect upon our son's life,
who has become the legendary Richard the Count,
defensive back for the goals, the University of Georgia, coached by Kirby
smart but in high school coach Warner, coached him down to Liberty County High.
And I told him, folks this morning, this is the second time.
First time I asked Richard to come, he had just completed being on state
State Championship team from Liberty County High and Basketball.
When he finished early, and was admitted to the University of Georgia in January, and
they wouldn't let him come.
This time, he's laughing, he's in camp, in Fort Lauderdale, I believe it is.
And we worked as excited about coming, and they wouldn't let him come.
In April at the NFL Draft, Richard will decide when he comes in the future.
We're looking forward to that.
But the parts you don't know about great coaches is Richard's first coach, as a person that
put him on the right road, and minister Erika Lackout was his first coach.
I've heard how, as a boy, he'd be working about, he'd be ready to go in, no, no, no,
we're going to stay a little while longer.
She cussed him in basketball and she cussed him in football.
But most of all, she taught him to love and fear the Lord.
So he's a man of great character.
So I'm extremely pleased to present to you this morning from our churches in Darien,
Georgia, and you know our mixed temperaments, you know I'd forget the name of the church.
battle of truth, church. I know the pastor passed on the wood. So let us hear her as she speaks
to us this morning. Minister Lacan. Good morning. Good morning to the House of Representative
into all who gathered here today.
I would like to say thank you to the speaker of this house,
Mr. David Rauston.
Rauston.
For the invitation and the special thank you
to my state representative, my state representative,
Mr. Al Williams, for welcoming me, yes.
And to thank you, and I want to also say thank you to my Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ, for a 40-meters opportunity to come
before you wonderful people this morning.
It is a privilege and honor to come before you for the purpose
of this devotion and prayer.
Thank you so much for having me.
Again, I am Eric at the count.
But most people know me as Richard LaCount III,
the University of Georgia, Bulldogs, number two mom.
And that's OK.
I love that.
When he learned of the invitation for me to come here,
Richard really wanted to be here with us.
And like Senator, I mean, Representative Al Wem said
that he couldn't, they wouldn't allow it.
and that's okay, maybe one day he'll make it back here on his own.
After April.
I'm pleased to tell you that he is healthy for everyone who is thinking.
How is he doing? He is doing fine. Richard is well.
I'm not just telling you that, but he is well.
He's healthy, he's fit, and he's training for his very first job interview.
Woo, which, by the way, is coming really soon, so remember him in your press, please.
And to each of you here today, I want you to know that, that even though you may not
hear it very much, we appreciate you.
I came all the way from Riceboro, Georgia, drove all night last night, and I want to make
sure I say that.
Thank you. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. We see your hard work. We hear your voices.
We are very grateful that even in the midst of the pandemic and racial
inquilities, equalities, job losses and political divisions, you all stayed the course.
And that, I want to say thank you.
Thank you again.
And that echoes your voice.
Your voice is the power that the state, our great state, is looking and waiting on.
We thank you for that.
Thank you for not wavering and doubting.
Thank you for your patience for sitting in here day in and day out.
The book of Philippians 4 and 13 says,
I can do all things through Christ.
Who strengthens me?
This very scripture have gotten me
and my family through many, many hard times.
I'm sure you all as well.
And right now, as our nation in this great state
of Georgia struggle and face adversity,
we must put our trust in our savior
and believe that he will take care of us.
He will, and he will help us in every situation.
Again, I echo these words to you.
Indeed, we can do all things, not some,
but all things through Christ.
He's the one who strengthened us.
I decree in the Clown this day, February the 10th of 2021,
our great nations shall be strengthened
in the name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior.
I decree second Chronicles, seven and 14.
If my people which are called by my name,
shall humble themselves.
Yeah, and pray and seek that faith
and turn from their wicked ways,
then our Lord, he will hear from heaven
and he will heal our land.
Glory to God, glory to God.
Despite a tough 2020 for all of us, I knew it was for me.
As we began our 2021 year, we can still dream and listen to the voice of God that echoes
in our spirit's daily.
If I may tell you a short story about Richard, he had many and I went through lots, lots
lots and lots through my memory being trying to think of one that would be fitting for
the day. And I came up with this one that he's a dreamer and he had a dream to play at
the University of Georgia. And as a young child, he discussed details with other adults
and many people that knew him in an unusual way.
It was kind of weird sometimes hearing him talk about football
when he's four or five years old,
talking about the details as a little boy.
But my husband and I were amazed.
It had no idea what was going on and where did he get that knowledge?
And that level of knowledge from.
So one day, we watched him study and film sitting
in front of computer at five years old,
rewinding the computer back in four, back in four.
And I just happened to ask him, what are you doing?
He didn't say he was dreaming.
He responded to me that I'm watching film.
I'm just watching.
He was looking at Hurt your Walker and Tony Dorset and Dion
Sanders and people who names, he couldn't even spell
some of the names.
I had to go in and type the names and pull the videos up.
And I got to tell you all what happened after that.
Of course, when it was game day at our little community
direct department, this kid who sat there for hours
in front of the computer, he went directly out of my van
onto the field and did exactly what he saw and what he researched.
And of course, he snatched the football out of many children's hands
and ran it back for touchdowns, which led the chaos.
Could you imagine what the rest was thinking?
What are we going to do with this five-year-old?
But we see what happened when you dream at that level.
And when you finally reach your dream, it is so important.
important, it is so important for us not to lose our dream and for us to remember that
we have so many people behind us watching us, watching you, people who are literally
thinking about how do I get here one day, how do I get to the place where you are, encourage
other people in our community daily, encourage our children, they don't just like sports,
A little witty thing is, rich at love.
This is one of his dreams being here.
And you heard Representative Al said twice.
He wanted to be here and couldn't make it.
So we pray that the third time would be the charm.
Glory to God.
Glory to God.
But I want to leave two things with you.
There are two words.
The two words that I wanted to leave with you today,
we must remember the dream and the definition of a dream
that I like was to have a series of thoughts,
images and sensations occurring in a person's mind.
As leaders, we all have a responsibility to dream
and to help others accomplish their dreams.
Rather, as our colleagues or our family,
and especially our children and our community,
The other thought is an echo.
I had a dream months ago.
It was sometime last year that I was standing
inside a circular room similar to this.
I thought that I was at the University of Georgia
where sometimes I periodically let prayer for the parents.
But it is clear to me today where I was.
I know today where I was and what I was doing in that dream today.
I'm standing before you for my community and my co-workers and my family to tell you
all.
Thank you for such a wonderful job.
Thank you for standing up and representing our state.
In the midst of everything, you are still standing and you are fighting for us.
Thank you all.
I couldn't remember the words that I said in that dream, but I do remember standing
here and saying thank you. I'm reminded of the description Romans 10 and 17 it says so faith
come by hearing and hearing by the Word of God we must remember that our very words are echo
when we speak our words go out in the universe it goes out and it comes back.
We have to be very careful. We must remember that our very words one day. It's going to come back to us rather
we are here or in our homes or in the various places. Be careful what we say. Our words are echoing back to us faster than we can
even imagine. And we will be held accountable to every word that we say proverbs 18 and 21 says
life and death are in the power of our tongues. I would like to say Psalms 19 and 14 says let the
words of our mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable and pleasing in your sight,
O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer. At this time, I ask that you stand and join me in prayer.
Father, we just bless your name on today, God. We give your name the glory and all the honor.
Lord, we thank you for this day. We know this is the day that you have made. Everything that's
in this room, Lord God. You already know about it on this day.
Lord, we ask you right now that you will give us more clarity,
focus and understanding. Lord God on what to say, how to say it,
and witness it. Father, we thank you right now, Lord God,
for giving us an opportunity to repent, Lord God, for anything
we did or may have said that was not pleasing to you, Lord God,
we ask you right now in this time in this space that you will
give us, Lord God, that our prayers will not be hindered, that we'll be able to be
moving forward and doing the things that you call each and each individually person to
do. Lord, we thank you and we glorify your name. We give your name to glory and all the
honor in this house, Lord God, in your Son Jesus name, we pray, amen. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
would you stand?
One nation.
On the top.
In the visible.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
During this session, we've had a lot of people get up here
and do morning orders to celebrate the death of somebody.
But today, I want to celebrate the life of an individual in my community.
One of the benefits of representing a military community
is that every day you get to see heroes among us.
Today in the middle Georgia community,
we are celebrating one such hero
with a drive-by birthday celebration.
Lieutenant Colonel Crawford Hicks
was a B-17 pilot in World War II.
Successfully bombing Berlin four times.
And on a mission, excuse me, on May 30, 1944,
His plane was shot down behind German lines and remained a prisoner of war until General
Patton liberated his prison camp on April 29, 1945.
After World War II, and serving as a POW, he decided to continue his service in this
country until 1966.
He has multiple medals, recognizing his service and sacrifice, and today he turns 100 years
old.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I rise to say happy birthday and thank you to Miss Helen Butler.
She is the executive director of the Georgia Coalition of the People's Agenda.
Thank you for your service to the Morgan County Board of Elections.
Georgia, from all 159 counties, have experienced free and fair elections because of you.
We will always respect and protect you.
Thank you for your organized work for voter engagement.
Happy birthday.
Okay, recognizes Chairman Corbett and representative Sains for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Fifty years ago, last week, commemorated a sad day in Camden County and for this state.
The thigh-call plant made trip flares as part of the Vietnam War effort.
Building 132 had 80 workers in it, the majority African-American women in their 30s and 20s.
When the explosion and building 132 took place, it resulted in one of the deadliest industrial
disasters in the United States, killing 29 people.
I hope you'll join me in supporting a local effort led by Miss Jenny Everett to have
this site of the explosion commemorated as a national landmark and the victims nominated
for the presidential medal of freedom.
If we can please now join in a moment of silence
and memory and reverence for the 29 Patriots lost.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Representative Holley
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This morning, we asked the members of this distinguished body to rise in memory of Mr. Eugene
Edwards, who passed earlier this week.
Mr. Edwards was a friendly long-time resident of Henry County with his wife for 55 years,
the Henry School Board representative, Miss Anna Edwards.
Miss Edwards was a proud Baptist Christian deacon, master plumber, father of two, father
of three who led a host of voter education workshops, fund raising dinners,
coach Little League football, and could be happily seen leading civil rights
commemoration marches around the historic McDonough Square.
May we all recognize him with a moment of silence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order.
Good morning, Councillor.
Good morning, colleagues.
Today I bring to you 13-year-old John.
Just like me, John wants to work with animals when he grows up.
He is a smart and funny boy who likes to watch TV.
He likes Spider-Man, Adventure TV shows, playing and watching football.
He's smart and funny, and he's one of the many, many beautiful children who are available

All right, we're going on now to the rules calendar.

House Bill 153, members, on a wheat hour, the 119th and others to be entitled to act to
to amend Part 2 of Article 15 of Chapter 1 of Title 10.
The official go to George Annotated relating the Fair Business Practices Act of 1975,
so as to provide for requirements for solicitation of services for corporate filings required by the Secretary of State.
Ms. Bill Lambert, for the Committee on that Culture and Consumer Affairs,
that committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Representative Wheatour to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleys, bring to you House Bill 153 starting about this time of year, small business owners,
Georgians all across the state, start getting solicitation in the mail that looks an awful
lot like a government document.
And it instructs them that they need to register their corporate filing with the Secretary
of State's Office for a cost of $150.
This is a solicitation, and a lot of people get dut.
What this bill will do is at the top of those solicitations, it will clearly read this
is not a bill or official government document, this is a solicitation.
Thus saving Georgians all over the state, the registration fees, which is only $50 if
they do it themselves to the Secretary of State's website.
That's simple, but a good consumer bill, consumer protection bill, I'll stand on yield
for any questions.
Do you yield for questions? I do. Chair recognizes
Representative Al Williams to your left for a question
Well, gentlemen, you yield. I do. I think it's a great bill
Do you accept a basket that I keep full of stuff that you can send to the appropriate ones when it passes?
Good bill. Thank you
Do you yield for one more question? I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes
is up in the gallery to your left representative Meeks for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Thank you for this bill.
It's very important and very informative.
But can you tell me why you didn't select the type of times new romans for this to be
printed in?
I have an affinity for Helvetka, so just it's pleasing to the eye.
I appreciate the gentleman.

Do pass by committee substitute
Chair recognizes chairman heath Clark to present the bill
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this bill simply adds the state
defense force to the state and demnification fund. The state defense force is a
volunteer unit component of the Georgia Department of Defense. They get called up
by the governor to serve in disaster relief among other missions and when a
And a member of the state defense force is killed or disabled in the line of duty.
This bill will ensure that they are covered with the state indemnification plan.
And with that's the bill, Mr. Speaker, I will stand for any questions.
You do not have any questions.
I will yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.

The eyes are 170, the nays are zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed the clerk will
read the caption to House Bill 97.
House Bill 97, my representative, levered to the 33rd, plumbing on the 121st, Skoggins
of the 14th, Oliver of the 82nd, Wilson of the 80th and others, to be entitled an act
to amend Article 2 of Chapter 9 and Title 15.
the fiscal to Georgia and Tate
relating the jurisdiction power and duties
so it's required and provide for our oath
for certain clerks, the pro-big court,
this bill I referred to Committee on Judiciary
that committee recommends a dis bill do pass.
My have times have changed.
I waited almost four years when I came to this capital
to pass a bill.
You waited how many, Dean Smarrie? Four.
Now we have two members that on day 15 of their first session
will attempt to pass a bill.
So I had a dilemma.
Which of the two will be the first freshman to get a bill?
So last night, I did a very scientific method.
We flipped a coin, and the winner was Representative Leveritt, who will now be recognized to present
House Bill 97.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, the House is my pleasure today to present you a bill that will deliver
blessings of liberty, prosperity, and almighty God
until the citizens of Georgia.
And it will do so by making technical revisions
to Title 9 of Title 15 of the Georgia Code.
The bill does three things.
It requires the chief clerk of a probate court
to take an oath.
It sets out the text of the oath, and it
requires that the oath be recorded
upon the minutes of the court.
The reason for this is because the deputy clerk
can be in the line of succession if the probate judge
were to untimely pass away during office.
And so this is a way of establishing
who the identity of that person,
and yes, it apparently has been an issue in one or two counties.
And so the probate judges council requested this change.
The speaker will yield the welfare questions.
Well, I sure hope so.
You must not have explained the bill very well.
That's just bored looks like.
just keep popping. Chair recognizes the whip of the majority caucus
representative Kelly to your right for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the gentleman yield. I yield. Representative
Labor, I appreciate this piece of legislation and the work you've done on it.
But as I look at line 42, do you have the bill in front of you? I do, sir.
Maybe I want to get it.
On line 42 it says all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are repealed.
I know you were never asking one of this body to vote for a piece of legislation we didn't understand.
Could you explain to us what laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are being repealed today?
Yes sir, I believe the existing law is being repealed and replaced with this one.
That's the extent of my knowledge.
I hope you're right.
Do you further yield?
I do, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes, oh, you got bipartisan concerns out there.
Representative Bentley to your left for a question.
This will be good.
That's a gentleman yield.
I yield, ma'am.
Is it not true that I am the chair lady
of the funeral home caucus and the strawberry queen
of this House of Representatives?
I have no doubt of that, ma'am.
Does the gentleman further yield?
I do yield.
Can you explain how House Bill 97 is going to impact
the funeral home business?
Yes, ma'am, I believe not at all.
But it will make it easy for people
who are trying to probate wills when the judge dies.
Will it help the funeral directors get our death certificate
at a timely matter so we can get paid by the insurance
companies. As I'm assuming that is a matter of great concern to the lady, yes.
Well, with that being said, I will vote for your bill. Thank you, sir.
God bless you, ma'am.
You want more? Not particularly Mr. Speaker, but I don't know what the
custom is. I don't want to appear too eager to get out of the well.
Mr. Speaker, to quote the great words of the Poet Laureate,
Porta Wagner, I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand.
I ask for your favorable support of House Bill 97.
A man that knows Porta Wagner's got a great future in this house.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
the previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye,
those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine.
Representative Lever to someone covering your machine, your vote, I will give you specific
permission to have somebody vote your machine.
What's your position on this bill, are you for it or against it?
They would vote Representative Leveritt's machine green.
All right, you're covered.
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted?
If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 97.
The eyes are 172, the nays or zero.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 134.
House Bill 134 by resident of Anderson, the 10th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 14 and
total 50, the fiscal to Georgia and it's had a relay in open and public meetings, so
as to exclude meetings relating to cyber security, contracting and planning from open meeting
requirements, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary, that committee
recommends that this bill do pass.
So the runner up freshmen will be out recognized here in a moment, but I have to tell you
when you lost that coin toss. I've never seen a look of devastation on anyone's face like that before I mean I hurt my heart.
Chair recognizes representative Anderson to present the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I am truly honored and humbled to stand before this body today to present this bill.
and I have been told that it is appropriate and timely for me
to make this statement, this is a simple bill.
This simple bill will protect the lives, livelihoods,
of all Georgians.
And with that, I'll present to you House Bill 134.
This is a bill to allow governmental agencies that are subject
to open meetings, open records, to discuss cyber security
contracting and planning in closed session and
exhilarated documents from open records requirements.
The other piece of advice I'd gotten was be brief.
So with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well for questions.
What do you have a few?
Chair recognizes representative Ridley to your right for a question?
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
So in this bill, it talks about exemption of meetings
from public inspections and all kinds of good stuff.
Is that going to hurt any of the meetings
that we have in our office in afternoons?
Thank you for that question.
And the answer is no because the walls are thin.
Those meetings are open to the public,
regardless of where you're at in the hall or next door.
Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to your left
for a question.
Jim McNeil for a question I do you're gonna have some fun with our colleagues a little bit down the road here
But I do have a serious question isn't that true. I thank you for bringing the bill
I think we both served in local government
Isn't it true you and I have talked and the one concern I have is about too much
Negotiation towards pricing and spending of dollars going on in these meetings more than would
necessarily have to to keep it sacred and you
Have affirmed to me. You don't believe that's the case
but you're going to continue to look at that because we always want to watch the taxpayer's dollars
But isn't it true that we want to do that by keeping them safe and keeping these plans
The plans themselves out of the public eye
But the awarding of the contract not so much. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question
the
Verbit actual verbiage in the bill itself says no vote in executive session to enter into cybersecurity contract
will be binding on any agency until a subsequent vote is taken in open meeting where the identity
of the contractor and the terms of the agreement are not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection
A of code section 50-18-72 are disclosed before the vote. So the terms of the contract as
far as the dollar amount and the timing of the contract will be disclosed following
in that vote, or as a part of that vote,
but not the potential identification of deficiencies
and vulnerabilities.
Do you feel for one more?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dubnick,
to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As a gentleman, you know, I do.
Representative, do you have the bill in front of you?
I do, yes, sir.
If you'll turn your attention to around line 49 and 50,
You talk in the bill that the identity of the contractor in the terms of the agreement
that are not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection A of code section 50-18-72.
Could you brief this House on what is involved and who's not subject to paragraph 25 of subsection
of code section 50-18-72.
Okay, the answer to the question is everyone.
Everyone is not subject to that except for specific plans and discussions and related
documents surrounding security, security plans and security protocols.
Gentlemen, further yield?
Yes.
Can you quote those lines for me out of that particular section that I'm referring to
that's in your bill. I cannot at this moment I did provide a copy of that to another colleague
of ours the other day that I had in my file and I have not requested in my file so no
sir I cannot. Final questions gentlemen further yield. Yes sir. So you and one other member of
this distinguished body have that information but you know there's another 178 of us that are
trying to make a policy decision here. Great bill thank you for bringing it. Thank you sir.
Mr. Speaker, I would yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration on this bill.
The gentleman has wisely yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
