TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for
assembling with us this morning to discuss an issue that is weighing heavily on many Georgian's
minds. I'm Senator Elena Parent and proud to represent the 42nd Senate District
and serve as the Chairwoman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. Alarm bells are sounding around
the country right now and for very good reason. Time and again legislators and our courts are
mandating that reproductive medical care conformed to certain religious views and not to long
established medical standards of care. The DOBS decision we now see was really just the beginning,
although what a beginning it was, landing with all the force of an earthquake around the United
States as women saw a right that they had held for 50 years evaporate with the stroke of Justice
Alito's pen. Currently in Alabama, chaos is unfolding as the Alabama Supreme Court altered the
the medical landscape with a truly radical decision
that frozen embryos created outside of a human body
are deemed to be human children under law
that cannot be discarded.
Contraception itself, the beginnings,
the foundation of family planning,
is a target of an extremist right-wing agenda
and this battle is unfolding on many fronts.
How do we know this?
Justice Clarence Thomas voiced support
in his concurrence in the Dobbs case overturning Roe v Wade.
For also overturning Griswald versus Connecticut,
the seminal 1965 decision that gave couples
a right to the use of contraception
for their family planning.
In the U.S. House of Representatives,
195 members, 90% of them members of the Republican Party voted against the right to contraception
act in July of 2022.
They would not take that vote to affirm the right to contraception.
Senators Mike Braun of Indiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee have both indicated publicly
that they believe that decisions about contraception
should be left to the states
and no longer be a fundamental American right.
The majority of Americans are concerned
about these flashing warning signs
on further government intrusion
into their family planning.
The Heritage Foundation, an influential right wing think tank,
has called for a feminist movement against the pill.
For those that are not yet alarmed, one only need look at the certainty many felt
that the Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade would always allow the right to abortion
for women across the country.
One only need look at that to realize that taking these things lightly is a huge mistake.
So yesterday I filed two bills to address reproductive health care.
The right to contraception act will codify our right to choose when we start or expand
a family.
The right to IVF act will codify that a human egg or fertilized human embryo outside
of a human uterus is not considered a child or minor under state law for any purpose.
And the truth is, I filed these bills not out of a sense of hysteria or to score political
points.
Our neighboring state has taken radical action that have thrown the family planning efforts
of thousands of couples in Alabama
who are desperately seeking the opportunity to be parents
into question, potentially crushing their dreams
of being able to be moms, be able to be dads,
to have children, to add to their family.
We need, Georgians need certainty to know
that that level of terror will not be inflicted upon them.
Going through the process of trying to expand your family through IVF is already physically
and emotionally draining.
Feeling like that opportunity could be ripped from you at any moment, especially when
there's great cost to undergoing that type of assisted reproductive technology is not
the type of emotional rollercoaster.
I want Georgia couples, women, men to face or be afraid of.
And right now, there are couples here in Georgia questioning whether they should spend
the money to embark on that journey, knowing that that ability could be ripped from them
at any time.
I am very concerned, though, that our Republican colleagues here in the State Senate simply
do not agree about what we view to be fundamental rights to family planning that are standard
medical care.
I invited everyone in the Georgia State Senate to sign on to both of these bills yesterday.
I saved spots for my Republican colleagues
so that they could sign on in the top five
to show their support, to demonstrate that these are bipartisan values.
These are things that the vast majority of Americans and Georgians agree on.
I kept them at my desk for several hours waiting for Republican co-signatories
and none were forthcoming.
So in the end, I filled in with other caucus members of mine
who democratic senators whose values are firmly aligned
with allowing Georgians reproductive freedom.
So that makes the warning size flash
even more strongly to me,
that not one of my colleagues was willing to say,
I support IVF, I support the right to contraception.
Here's the deal,
Georgians have the right to healthcare,
to reproductive healthcare,
and to contraception and family planning tools.
And any restriction on this access is dangerous
because it prevents people from making choices
that affect their physical, mental, economic,
health, and well-being.
These rights are sacred, and this should not
be a partisan issue that is used to play games
with constituents, lives, and the families
that they are hoping to build.
So with that, I would love, I have the honor
of being able to bring up my good friends
and a whipsmart lawyer, representative Marvin Lim.
Thank you senator parent so like a good lawyer I will start with with the law as she did.
One of the many far reaching implications of dobs is that the Supreme Court explicitly
called into doubt the case that that my colleague senator parent named which was Griswald
be Connecticut, which came in 1965 before row, and that was almost 60 years ago now.
That did establish that there is a constitutional right to privacy that prevents any government
from restricting access to contraception.
Because we have been taken back almost 60 years, and because, again, the threat to this
right is not imaginary, but it is very real.
Senator Parent mentioned what has happened at the U.S. Congressional level, and I should
also point out that several states have also passed or at least attempted to introduce
bills that try to ban access to contraception.
That is why I stand here with my colleagues today as a proud sponsor of the Georgia Right
to Contraceptum Act, which enshrines this law in our state law.
I will say that as a Catholic, who is originally from the Philippines, I was taught and know
quite well the stage, the Aquinian natural law teachings on this matter, yet even the
Philippines in 2014, I will note, one of two countries in the world besides the Vatican
that continued outlawed divorce, managed to pass a law, guaranteeing universal and free
access to modern contraception. Unfortunately, we in America seem to be moving in the opposite
direction. I cannot stress enough, we cannot stress enough how critical access to contraception
is for all people, including men like myself, who must bear great responsibility in both family
planning and generally sexual and reproductive health.
We know for a fact that contraception reduces rates of unintended pregnancies, reduces
the need for abortions, which again is especially critical because of DOBS, reduces HIV transmission
to newborns, promotes maternal and infant health, something we've been talking a lot about
here in the Georgia General Assembly, and reduces sexually transmitted infections.
These are all facts, period, born by evidence time and again.
And these are things that, along with all people, again, including men, like myself, should
care about because of the responsibilities we bear.
And to the extent that so many men, unfortunately, do see contraception as primarily a woman's
responsibility, it only underlines that any restriction will, accounting for the realities
of human behavior, become that much more of a deterrent to access.
We also know that contraception is particularly critical in all respects to minority and
low-income communities, like my district, which is comprised of almost 50% immigrants
like myself and 25% of people in poverty. These communities are disproportionately burdened
by sexual and reproductive health challenges, in part because of existing disparities with
contraceptive use and non-use, which extends to both education and access to these services
and goods. So access to education, cultural influences, excuse me, other factors do account
for these existing disparities, yet regardless of the reasons, it is again clear that any
restriction at this stage will become exponentially more, exponentially more of a deterrent to
the critical access we need across races, across genders, and yes across political divides.
All of this is why we have introduced the Georgia Right to Contreception Act, which in
the House's House Bill 1424, the threat is too grave and too real not to act.
And with that, I'm proud to turn it over to my co-sponsor, Representative Terry Inolvitz.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for being here today.
I will never forget that night here in the General Assembly when House Bill 481, the
so-called Heartbeat Bill, passed out of the chamber.
I spoke against it along with many of my colleagues.
We fought hard.
But what sticks with me the most, what comes back to me when I think about that night,
and I think about that night often, was being in the anteroom, listening to the discussion,
and having Republican colleagues, I say colleagues, because it was more than one, say to me, you
guys don't need to worry.
I know you're upset about this, but we don't want to be primary if we vote against it,
And don't you know that row will never be overturned?
Don't you know that row will never be overturned?
And I will tell you, so many of us believe that in our bones, that that right to control
our bodies, that right to bodily autonomy was something that could never be taken away.
But, y'all, we were wrong.
We were wrong.
Women are suffering, families are suffering because so many people were wrong when we
actually thought that that right was something that we would be able to keep.
And now we have seen what's next, right?
Justice Thomas has no illusions and he's not unique.
So many of these Republicans have no illusions.
This is about controlling women and one of the best ways you can control women is by controlling
their bodily autonomy.
You control weather and when they are able to reproduce.
And that is what we are saying.
We know that these rights are fragile, and I will tell you, don't be surprised to hear
that any Republican thought that Rome might never be overturned because they didn't want
it to be overturned because most people, most Georgians poll after poll after poll, tells
us that most Americans do support access to reproductive health care.
They have no problem with contraception because so many people know that contraception
is health care, right?
I take the pill right now, not because I'm trying not to have babies, that ship has long
since sailed.
But because I'm in Perry, Menopause, and ladies, it's awful, it's awful.
So if I can try to control some of the things my body is doing with contraception, I am going
to take advantage of that opportunity because science is a miracle.
And we know, that's probably the quote that will be run, we know that our reproductive
rights. Our fragile, we know that IVF is on the chopping block and we know that it is just
a matter of time for contraception. It is not a question of if but when we know this. So being
able to sponsor this legislation is something that is so important to me as a Georgian, as a woman,
as a mother of a teenage girl who's dealing with her own, you know, learning about the joys of
being a woman and all the things that come along with that. This is important. This is important
for Georgians. I also approached Republican colleagues to ask if they would be willing
to sign on to this because we do know, right? The numbers tell us. The polls tell us that
this is an issue that has overwhelming support. And there's that quiet support, right? There's
that secret support. There are people who, where if this comes to a vote on the floor,
they might take a walk instead of voting no or instead of voting yes. We know that support
is there and it was disappointing, but honestly not surprising that no Republicans have decided
to sign on, even though I know that they are getting the same emails I am getting from
women, from families in their district who are sharing their stories of why IVF is so
important to them, of why contraception is so important to them, of why it is a critical
healthcare resource that we must ensure every Georgian has access to.
And so I'm very happy to support this legislation.
I'm glad we are doing this in Georgia.
It is an honor to be a part of this.
And I'm not a lawyer, so I can't talk about the legal things.
I can talk about some of the cultural things,
so because I am also a Catholic.
And I am a mother, and I am someone
who has made these own decisions for myself.
And I tell you, there are no monoliths and politics.
We know this, right?
And the majority of Catholics support access to contraception.
I mean, these are just things that we know.
These aren't surprising statistics.
They're not new statistics.
These are things that we know that we continue to affirm
with new polling.
So now I want to actually introduce Alicia Stahlworth.
Thank you so much for being here with us
because we have these advocates who have been fighting
and working for this also.
We are going to be in the well speaking about this.
We'll be talking to our colleagues about this
and we've got these armies of advocates
who are also ready to help us in this fight.
Thank you for being here today.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone. My name is Alicia Stahlworth. I am the Southeast
Campaigns Director for Reproduct the Freedom for All, formerly known as
Neyraw Pro Choice Georgia. I want to thank the sponsors of this legislation
for taking this stand alongside of us and really trying to codify the right
to contraception because we know that our rights are at their risk. Like we've
been wrangling this bill for over seven or eight years within our reproductive bubble.
And we've been saying this for a long time that they are coming for all of our rights.
So it's an honor to speak to you all today alongside these champions.
It has been nearly two years since the Supreme Court handed down the decision Dops v. Jackson,
Women's Health Organization, and the Constitutional right to abortion.
I really not only gave the green light to anti-abortionist
remiss to begin enforcing bans, but it also
sent a clear and terrifying message to Americans.
Our freedom to determine if, when, and how
to start a grow a family is on the line.
And you've heard the legislators say this over and over
again, because ultimately, that's what's at stake.
And his concurring opinion adopts decision,
just in time, even when it's far to call on the court
to overturn its precedent of farming the right
to contraception.
And for some reason, this was like a wow to most of the Americans.
But again, it's all intertwined.
You see, we know that those hostile to abortion
never attended to stop with ending role.
The same extremists working harder than ever
to roll back abortion rights and assets
are also targeting our other fundamental freedoms,
including access to birth control.
And as recent Alabama Supreme Court decision shows, IVF,
they don't care that American support
reproductive freedom, including birth control.
Brian Kim and the extremist Republicans like him
were never going to stop at abandon abortion.
Shortly after the adopt decision,
Governor Kim was caught saying he was open
to banning birth control.
Polling shows that the overwhelming majority
protecting legal access to contraception
and those and that the voters are concerned
about states restricted it.
We did appalling in 2022, September of 2022
that showed 94% of Georgia's supported assets
to birth control.
At the national level, Republicans in Congress
have nearly shone their hand by blocking efforts
by Democrats to protect birth control.
195 House Republicans voted against the right
to contraception act and Senate Republicans
ultimately brought it after it passed the House.
The doubt of decision affirmed that these actions
are unrelated.
They are not empty threats.
These are promises to an increasingly
extreme minority that will continue to award them with power.
There's no time to waste.
We must agnow to protect access to contraception
here in Georgia.
And we keep fighting freedom will prevail.
The people of Georgia are with us.
Together, all of us are the majority.
And together, we can build a future we want to live in.
Thank you so much for having me here today.
I'm passing it on to Dr. Lisa Zeman.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
It's an honor to stand with the legislators, the lawyers,
the advocates on representing healthcare professionals,
and the women and couples I see every week,
navigating economic hardship and challenges
to access medical care as is.
We don't want to burden them anymore.
I am Dr. Mimi Zeman and OBGYN and co-author of 16
editions of a medical guide called Managing Contreception.
Contreception is a critical cornerstone of public health,
economic stability, and individual freedom.
When couples can plan their families, children
and brought into the world have the best opportunity
to thrive.
That's why we must pass the Georgia's
right to contraceptive act.
Survey after survey show that over 90% of adults
support the availability of contraception.
This overwhelming consensus underscores
the importance of contraception to people
on the right and the left.
Contraception is essential not only for family planning,
but also for managing various health conditions
like menstrual bleeding disorders.
As we've seen with abortion restrictions,
There were repercussions for the care of miscarriages.
Similarly, if contraceptive access is limited,
then treatment of all other gynecological conditions
will be affected.
And for those people motivated to reduce the number
of abortions, the most effective way to do that
is increase access to contraception.
In a study conducted in St. Louis, when no cost IUDs
and contraceptive implants were made widely available,
abortion rates in the city plummeted
to less than half the national rates.
In the state of Colorado, a family planning initiative
that made these same methods affordable
resulted in a 50% drop in teen births and abortions
saving the state $70 million.
So wire contraceptives under a threat
in the name of religious beliefs.
Years ago, the Supreme Court cited religious freedom
to allow a private company, Hobby Lobby,
to deny insurance coverage for birth control.
A later ruling broadened exemptions
to include publicly traded companies, private institutions,
nonprofits, universities, and other employers
claiming religious or moral objection to contraception.
These religious groups believe life
starts a conception when a sperm fertilizes an egg
forming an embryo.
Let's talk about embryos for a minute
because they've been in the news.
They consider the failure of an embryo to implant
as loss of life, or as was ruled in Alabama last week,
the loss of an unborn child.
They argue incorrectly that certain birth control methods
prevent embryos from implanting, thereby increasing loss
of life.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
In fact, the use of any birth control method
prevents fertilization and therefore prevents
loss of embryos.
It's when couples do not use contraception
that many more embryos are formed
and then eliminated from the body
around 60% of embryos formed or passed
when no contraceptive method is used.
Therefore, anyone holding religious beliefs
about embryos deserving protection
should actively support the use of all birth control methods.
They should support this bill
and doing so would actually be more in accordance
with their values of protecting life.
Women will be the beneficiaries of greater health care
ask us access, not less.
Couples will be able to plan their families
and bring children into the world when they are ready.
As an OBGYN practicing in Georgia post-dobs,
I've seen firsthand how people are suffering.
There's no place in our exam rooms for legislators
to restrict access to essential health care.
It's our duty as citizens to protect and expand this access,
ensuring every Georgian can make personal health decisions
in accordance with their own values
and their own religious freedoms
and without political interference
or the imposition of someone else's religious beliefs.
Thank you.
Senator Paren.
Thank you so much, Dr. Zeman,
for that first-hand account.
We are happy to take a few questions
if anyone has any.
First, there you are.
Obviously, across other days tomorrow.
Yes.
I'm expecting you to get this done before this session
or is it setting the stage for?
Well, I did.
I did a great question.
I did have a conversation with the majority leader
Gooch about that yesterday.
And he said, well, we wouldn't be able to move on that this year.
And I noted that they have introduced
a number of immigration-related measures
that they are intending to move on this year.
So I pointed that out to him.
So anyway, so there is no obstacle
to actually moving on that this year
for those that need the rest of it to be tied together.
What is the next thing?
Sorry, rule is next, and then we'll get over to you.
Bringing you back to state law and Georgia law,
what is it in Georgia law that you believe
would lead to an Alabama scenario?
Because the law is being different.
What is it in Georgia law that's raising the concern specifically around IVF from the Alabama
District?
I'll say something first, and then if anyone else wants to weigh in.
I mean, from my perspective, our code is riddled with all kinds of places where there are
question marks.
And therefore, we need this strong, very clear, very simple statement that embryos outside
of a uterus are not children.
You know, 481 is a bit confusing in that regard as some language that would seem to be
protective, but other language word, you know, we could start to have tax exemptions.
And the thing is, you know, the Republicans have to confront, are they really going to
maintain this belief that life begins at conception and all of the implications for reproduction
and science that that then threatens.
Does anyone else want to land on that?
Yeah.
So after George's abortion restrictions were passed,
and even in the process of the hearings
for this legislation, right, we had doctors coming
to the Capitol telling us, like, this was going
to lead to a lot of confusion and potentially
a lot of very dangerous health care situations
for women, so many pregnancies wanted pregnancies,
and tragically in the emergency room.
And so many doctors told us that there was a real risk
that women would go to the emergency room,
say with the placental abruption,
say with a miscarriage happening.
They could be going into sepsis.
They could be bleeding out.
But if that fetus has a heartbeat,
these emergency physicians were very, very concerned
about what they might be able to do.
I received an email from a constituent this week
who tragically lost a pregnancy at 17 weeks
and was bleeding in an emergency room here in Metro Atlanta
because the fetus still had a heartbeat
and they were trying to figure out
when her health was going to be on the precipice
to the point where they felt like they could act
without repercussion.
Now the sponsors of this legislation
and some of the folks in the majority party have said,
no, no, no, the exceptions, they're clear.
No doctor should worry about this,
but we know the reality is that doctors are deeply concerned.
And we have placed a barrier between the doctors
and the patients and the life-saving care that women need.
So when we talk about the laws, yes,
there are exceptions that are written
into the current code in Georgia,
but we know that the reality is that
there is a lot of merciness for the actual medical professionals
who are on the ground in our emergency rooms
and in our doctor's offices trying to help women
and help frankly save their lives.
I know that physicians right now are working on
trying to bring clarifying language to the General Assembly
so that hopefully we can pass things
that do make it more clear.
So doctors have less doubt about how
they're able to care for their patients
without risking their own freedom, right?
Even if you've got a doctor at first, you know harm.
They're trying to protect their patients,
but they also don't want to risk being arrested
and put into jail, right?
I mean, this is a real thing.
So, yeah, there are exceptions and things
that are written in our law, but we know the reality
is that there is a real murkiness and a real hesitation
amongst a lot of physicians.
And that is life threatening for Georgia women.
I will just add to that, without a clear statement of what your right is.
You're not only creating merciless for the physicians, but for people.
Those that are trying to plan their families.
Those who are lawyers, but also most people, the vast majority, which will not have time
to read the code or the Constitution or case law on wrongful death, wrongful life, etc.
That is what Dobbs unfortunately has created is uncertainty, not only with respect to
It's created some certainties, unfortunately,
but it's created a lot of uncertainties
that impact not only the physicians,
but ultimately the patient and the people.
So I did wanna say that as well.
Great point.
Kenna, I have one footnote to this.
Thank you very much, Nan Orox State Senate 36 District.
Believe them when they tell you what they're gonna do.
And that's what we're seeing.
I remember years ago when the US Senator from Pennsylvania
stated we have to block this, stop this contraception and it was jaw-dropping to hear that out
of a mouth.
But the take-home lesson is, politicians and judges are not gynecologists, but they're
behaving as though they are.
And years ago in the Health and Human Services Committee, there was an effort to block access
to fertilization services of medical experts.
And this capital was flooded.
This capital was flooded with families,
bringing their children or their children's photographs
that are where a result of in vitro fertilization.
And at that point in time, years ago,
78,000 Georgia families had taken advantage
of this medical option.
78,000.
There's no telling how that number has grown at this point.
So I say to the GOP, if you want to make this move in Georgia
be prepared because you're going to be overwhelmed
with opposition from Georgians who know better,
how to control their access to medical services
and reproductive choice.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Do you get your question answered?
I was just going to ask, what is the next
item you can find in the yesterday?
What is the next item in this process?
Well, what I would like is to, and I'll
let representatives and nullilates and LIM
answer us to the House.
What I would like in the Senate is to,
we could have a hearing.
That's the first step is requesting a hearing.
However, as stated previously, the best and most effective
way to move the legislation is we'll look for other health care bills where this could
come through the process because under our rules there isn't time to have it move as a stand
alone.
But we can move it as quickly as tomorrow on cross over day if Republicans want to join
with us in the state senate to reassure Georgians that they have access to family planning
tools that have been the standard of care for decades and right and fundamental rights
for generations, they will hasten to do that tomorrow.
I want to take you back to the roles that I know that in the hierarchy role, it references
to persons that unborn children are persons, and I'm going to use that to get tax breaks.
And I know that's kind of a gray area.
I mean, could someone use that gray language to go to the notice screen, or what's like,
what happened in Alabama?
I think they absolutely could.
Does anyone else want to weigh in on that?
I mean, that would be my perspective.
I agree with what my colleagues said
about the merciness that exists,
and it's on purpose, it's on purpose, right?
Making it confusing, making it sweeping,
having conflicting clauses in there is all on purpose,
because the true goal are the things
that we are raising up today to say be concerned about this.
I will just echo that.
Yes, they absolutely could.
While I, where I, the lawyer and the other side,
would make a variety of different arguments
as to why they would be incorrect,
the problem starts in the fact
that you're creating that uncertainty at all.
So I think, again, even regardless,
as important as the substantive right is
and the binary that is this right protected or not,
the uncertainty is as much of the problem.
The fact that someone could even bring a case
and not any of us in this room could 100% say
that claim would be denied,
that would be dismissed on a motion to dismiss
something early in the process,
and that would not cost the state,
or whomever being sued the physician,
thousands and thousands dollars in attorneys fees.
The fact that we can't answer that in this certainty,
yes, now is the problem.
I just wanna add that Georgians need to know
that OBGYNs are leaving states with restrictions.
We don't wanna practice this way.
We've taken oaths to take the best care of our patients
to respect their autonomy and privacy.
I was in that 481 room before it was passed
and we warned that this would happen.
Now we have data.
OBGYNs don't want to practice this way.
We don't want to ask how sick enough is the patient
for us to intervene.
We want to do what we were trained to do.
And we should be allowed to do that without this kind
of interference.
You're here.
Yeah, and I'll just, and to what?
The doctor said, remember, we are already a state where more than half of our counties
do not have an OBGYN.
And we are already a state with staggering, highly high maternal mortality rates.
Have we tried to address that as a general assembly?
Yes, but we have not gone far enough.
And the bottom line is if you are creating an environment where gynecologists are afraid,
where obstetricians and gynecologists are afraid to practice their medicine in our
state that is harmful for women and we will never, never get rid of our very
high maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate if we are chasing doctors
out of our state. We could take one more if anyone has any. You get everybody?
I have any comment on what's happening in Alabama specifically the
legislation that they're putting out there is the idea of criminal and civil
immunity. Right, right. Yeah, that approach or any
comments. Well, I'll just quickly say that I have not read that legislation. So, but my impression
is they are taking more of a tort reform approach, which then may give the doctors some certainty,
which of course, as Dr. Zeman has testified just now, we know is a very important. But what I
notice is they are not friendly attacking. They do not want to have to say that a
frozen embryo is not a child. So they're trying what they can do to come up
with another way around it. And I think that's very telling. I have I'm aware
of the legislation. I have not fully read it, but I will say the defense of
something is not the same as protective affirmatively protecting a right. And
and the defense will never be as good in addressing
what rights exist and addressing any possible
certainty or uncertainty will never be as good
as an affirmative statement as to the right.
And again, this is why they're attacking it
from a different angle.
No, we have not read the legislation,
but the fact that it's about an affirmative defense
or a defense rather than an affirmative right
is the problem.
And meanwhile, women's lives are on the line, right?
the gears of justice, you know, regardless of whether
you have a defense in place,
the gears of justice grind slowly.
And we know in Alabama right now,
there are women who had been going through the IVF process
who have now had to completely put that process on hold.
No regard from their general assembly,
from their Supreme Court to what that means for their bodies.
No regard, I mean, physically for their bodies,
with the process of what they're having to do
to prepare their wounds for that transfer, right?
No regard.
So, yeah, there can be litigation.
And that litigation can ultimately result in those protections.
But meanwhile, women, real actual women are the ones who are going to pay the price potentially
with their lives.
