TRANSCRIPT
----------
I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving break and now it's time to get back to work.
We all been kind of scrambling, trying to play catch up after long weekends, I'm sure,
but we're getting there and then the fun will begin in earnest tomorrow, I guess.
But we, I hope we'll have shortly Jason and Vitality joining us via Zoom, see on yet.
I spoke to him 45 minutes ago and he's planning to join us.
And I think Senator Halperen is in a committee meeting, another committee meeting.
Maybe she'll be able to join us before we finish.
We don't have any presenters today.
I'm just going to kind of recap what we've worked on and then we'll talk about recommendations.
If anybody wants, we probably need to let us sign up sheets. If anybody wants to speak after we
go through all the recommendations, pro or con, to anything we discuss they can, but just get my
attention, I guess. We'll do that. As is customary, I'd like us to open with a word of prayer and I
I haven't asked anybody so I'm going to put somebody on the spot and I guess it's going
to be Chairman Strickland.
What is your number six?
Six.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Y'all, about with me.
God, thank you so much for the day that you've given us, Lord, and thank you for giving
us a chance to do this work at the State Capitol, Lord.
Please guide us and lead us and help us to make the right decisions for all of George
and Lord.
safe over the next week as we dive into deeper issues as well here that affects everybody in this
state lord and Jesus name I pray amen thank you chairman I've already gone through the the
welcome and the roll call again we've got three members present this is a five member committee
so we do have a quorum and we expect to have Senator Anna Rotardi joining us
Hopefully shortly and possibly Senator Jason thank you senator avatar. Welcome. Okay, so now we've got we've got it for here. That's good.
All right, I just want to kind of we've we've got a draft report that is in your file.
looks like this and we'll just kind of go through hit the highlights of that if you don't mind
I'll just walk us through that so we've had three meetings prior to this one this is our fourth meeting
we met on August 10th and making it the office of the secretary of state licensed division
we met September 27th here at the state capital and October 31st here at the state capital
This study committee was created by Senate Resolution 85 during the 2023 session and the object
of it is to look at what others tell us are onerous occupational licensing requirements in
Georgia that can inhibit economic mobility, limit job prospects and hinder small businesses
and I would add to it a kind of stifle entrepreneurship. So we want Georgia to continue to be a robust
place for business, number one in the nation for business. And these license, the occupational
licenses can be a hindrance to a good business environment and good economic development. We heard
from folks that more than one group told us that the occupational licensing, licensing
requirements that we have really disproportionately impact lower income occupations, the time it
takes, the cost to get the license and all of that is a disproportionate burden on some
of our best citizens that are out there working hard. August 10th we heard from Daniela Perry,
the Vice President of the Georgia Chamber Foundation. We heard from our very own Sarah
Clinton and Assistant Legislative Council. He's here with us today. We heard from Mr. Gabriel
Sterling the Chief Operating Officer of the Secretary of State. That was a good
meeting we had that day and the meeting to here at the Capitol. We heard from
Mark Hayden, the Director of State Governor Affairs for R Street Institute.
And you see his testimony in here on page five.
We heard from Austin Bannon, Employment Policy Fellow
with Americans for Prosperity.
We heard from Dr. Pierre Luigi Mancini,
the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Multicultural Development Institute.
Go on over to page seven.
We heard from Ms. Darlene Lynch, head of external relations
for the Center for Victims of Torture.
And she basically really, her job title did
sort of as misleading as far as what she talked about.
What and about torture is about physicians
that are licensed in other countries
in trying to eliminate barriers for allowing them to practice
here in Georgia is what her topic was.
And then also Pauline McKinney and Leslie Kelly
with voices for Georgia's children and Belisa
are beanie with Sarah Family spoke on that really
that same topic.
And then changing gears we heard from Jay Gayler and Sarah Boyer
with the Georgia's chapter of the American Study of Landscape
architects meeting three, October 31st.
We heard from Miss Shay Rawls and Mr. Jamal Lofton
with Kaiser Permanente, Georgia.
And I did not include this in my one-pager of recommendations,
but I do want us to, this reminds me,
I want to circle back to talk about this,
but Virginia has got a successful program
that Kaiser Permanente is taking advantage of where people trained in the military as a
corpsman or a medic in the military are given an expedited license and I guess other medical
fields with military training and Kaiser is hiring a lot of these people with great success
and of course we've heard over and over about the workforce shortage and health care,
the health care workforce shortage in Georgia. In fact, we have a separate study committee
solely dedicated to that topic, but it's real and it's pretty severe and the demographics of the
medical folks that we have, I mean, they're aging out and it's only going to get worse. So we've got
we've got we can't keep doing the same thing and and solve that problem. Then we
heard from Robin Pinchton and Elizabeth Harrison with the Georgia Nursing
Leadership Coalition and Jamie Kavanaugh and Megan Ford Forbes with Institute
for justice. And then lastly we heard from let's see Spencer Johnson and Trenton Turk and Mark
Chastain with the Survey and Mapping Society of Georgia and Gail Mackie or Mackie probably
with the Georgia License Professional Counseling Association, Rusty Royston with the Soul Science Society
of Georgia. So we had a lot of testimony. We heard from a lot of different varied fields. We did not
anywhere close to talking that we weren't able to talk to everybody. We have, as a reminder, over
40 occupational licenses just under the Secretary of State's office. And then there are other licenses
elsewhere in other agencies. So we just kind of hit the tip of the iceberg, frankly. I
don't, I didn't see in this report, but we did hear from a lady that was a makeup artist.
Is that in here somewhere? Who wrote this? Okay. Okay. No, that's, that's fine.
We also had material submitted and written form to the committee, and I probably need to get with you to make sure we include that in our report, I would think.
But so lots of good information.
There was, you know, kind of a common theme throughout it all, I think, where people were wanting to go to work,
delayed for me and able to go to work, prohibited from going to work because of the
our license requirements and a pretty high level of frustration with the process,
how aggravating and bureaucratic and burdensome it is, and how long it takes.
So that seemed to be kind of a recurring thing.
I want to draw your attention to other material we have in our folder today we've got a letter
from the Georgia Forestry Association and a flyer from them where they are requesting
that they have their Board of Registrations moved from the Secretary's State's Office
over to the Georgia Forestry Commission.
is a existing bill alive to do that. It's House Bill 53 that was introduced in 2023.
So that's in there for your consideration. I have a recent, so let's look at this email
and it's kind of redacted so it reveal any personal information. But as recently as
end of October. My office received an email. I'm going to read it to you for the record.
I own an occupational medicine practice in Bonair, Georgia. That's my district. I'm trying to hire
a PRN nurse practitioner who is a military spouse. She has been trying for months to get her
NPE nurse practitioner license transferred from Ohio to Georgia, but has not been successful.
I've heard you speak at eggs and issues and other events about the frustration around the transfer of license from another state
The Canada is beyond frustrated and feels as if the state is giving her the runaround as to what is needed to complete the process
If you have any guidance, it would be appreciated
So we're working with this constituent to try to get that issue resolved
But I get this type of request
You know, probably about every other month.
Sometimes more than one month,
this kind of a common request,
and I'm sure the other senators do this, do likewise.
Just to kind of finish going through what's in the folder today.
Representative Chuck Martin,
I hate to brag on the House member in the House bill,
bill and especially, but he passed House Bill 155 in the 2023 session. It's really good
piece of legislation. I've got an idea of how we can maybe make it even better. That's
what the Senate is here for to make house legislation better. So we'll talk about that.
And then lastly, I thought this memo from FGA, and I forget what acronym stands for, honestly.
But foundation for government accountability, foundation for government accountability is
probably right there.
Anyway, I think this cap capsulates, if that's the right word, Counselor correct me if I get
a lot of what I hope we can achieve legislatively from the study committee, some of it is maybe a
a little beyond what we want to maybe tackle at least today, but the number one recommendation
they had, the foundation for government accountability, very prominent national organization that
I'm very familiar with, obviously, they suggest we recognize out-of-state licenses and
Really House Bill 155 actually goes a long way to do that.
I think that we did good work when we passed that.
Recognize out-of-state work experience,
reduce licensing fees is another idea
that I think makes sense, sunset licensing boards.
I think the the recognize out of state work experience number two also to me ought to apply to recognize military credentialing and military work experience.
But that's
The information we've included for you today
Do I have any questions or comments from the committee members at this point? I've done a lot of talking
Senator Ann Brittar you have anything you want to add? Yeah, it's just
Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman?
We'll hear you very well.
Thank you.
Well, first I just want to thank you in the committee for I think doing all this work.
I think there's a lot of important information here and I think beyond the importance of the information.
I think it's the intentionality that we find ways to support small business owners entrepreneurs.
But for me I think personally the biggest takeaway is that with the workforce crisis and the constant increase in costs of doing business in Georgia because of the national global economy and inflation.
Hopefully we'll see some legislation and some policy work and maybe even some rule changes with some of our state agencies to help.
I think some of the folks that we've engaged with heard from and talked to, I think this
is an opportunity to give those, you said this in the beginning of your comments, you
know, an opportunity for those that are in poverty or blue collar workers and others
that are working hard to, you know, make ends meet, put foot on the table, take care of
their families, I think an opportunity for us to kind of lead and provide opportunity
by eliminating unnecessary licenses or, you know, fees or taxes or other things that may
get it in the way or even just the approval process for some of these industries that go
through.
And I think whatever we can also do to support, honorably discharged veterans are being
looking for new careers and wanting to do new things outside of the world that they
are accustomed to having maybe served in
and worked in here in America or abroad.
I think this topic of occupational licenses impacts
those group of citizens and families across Georgia
more than we think, and Senator Dugan understands that
and others, so I just wanna say thanks
and hopefully out of this we'll see some positives
that we can do to impact many of the citizens in Georgia
in the weeks and months to come.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
All right, regarding the report
before we get to the recommendations,
which will be included in the report,
does there any of the committee members?
And I know this really in very fair
because you just got it, but the else,
y'all see anything you need to add, delete anything like that.
Early captain. Um, I think you might want to have a speed of
this stuff that was also provided. Um, right. And I'll do that
if y'all are okay with me doing it after the fact. I do think
we're going to be required to vote on this report today. Our
deadline is December 1st. So you can. And I'm pretty sure
on this, you can do this like attachment one, attachment two, but you don't have to
pre-live it all and you can just say, and it goes in patchments and then it's a good idea, is that?
We didn't make like a nothing that small of that information. That'd be awesome. Good idea. Thank you.
So the only thing I guess on page 10, and this is just a, you know, just me, I guess, but
most of these things have a heading, it seems like I was just that last committee, I guess
that's under the practical strategy. So maybe that fits like that.
I think that would read a little easier maybe.
Well, I guess what I was talking about is that very last paragraph on page 10 may be put,
you know, request a recommendation from Samsung as a heading.
is the survey and mapping society of Georgia just so it just gets kind of lost to me and
that you're okay with that just keep me straight on this okay but I'll do if you're okay
with that will do it. Well, I just, y'all help me say the right stuff when we go to vote on this
because I guess we're going to amend it with some recommendations anyway. Try it. Okay, so let's get
to the recommendations. I'm sorry. Okay, we're going to modify this thing. The distributor error,
but we're not going to modify it. You've got a page nine. You look up on the end of the
that burden the character on to get down to the boards
that have collapsed were in the home of Fort Lawn.
I think that should be the key in there.
Right, I've got to come out of it.
If that were down again, I wouldn't know something about it.
Bows, but yeah.
So you have to agree through this time.
And you read fast.
you read fast. So we got that, you found that, okay. Recommendations and these again are
my ideas and it's open for discussion, debate, amendment, whatever. And we had a scrivener's
here two on number three. Number one, it's past Senate Bill 157, and I'd like Senator
Strickland to remind us what that is and where the past year is on that.
Yes, so that bill passed the Senate, I believe it was 55 to zero. This past session and still
sits in the house, it made it out of the house. Just here, he committee did not make out a rules
on the last day for a floor of it. But that bill is the one that deals with how criminal records
are treated when it comes to occupational licensing boards. And one of the big things we heard going
back to the theme of all this is the idea that sometimes what I would also say not just sometimes
are lower paid workers, but your most vulnerable people that are sometimes in bad circumstances
that then have to deal with navigating a process that even if it's not overly burdensome,
can seem so burdensome that sometimes they even try to work in certain areas and 157 deals with
how your past criminal history is treated by awards and we had the committee go through,
we had the bill go through the committee process last year, the best testimony we had was
individuals who had previous mistakes they made and they're trying so hard to now move past that
and bring their really bring generational change to their families by not just being a product
the criminal justice system, yet they get this wall. And many times they don't even know how
something I did 10 years ago will impact me. So Wago get trained, why invest money to become an
electrician, whatever it is. And if I'm going to be told no because mistake I made 10 years ago.
And so that bill makes it where every board is only going to consider certain offenses that are
directly related to the certain industry and the public safety, for example, someone that
that had a past U.I. might still be an electrician,
but someone that has a history of stealing from people
probably shouldn't be working in nursing home.
And so it creates a standard we're really gonna make sure
that we know that the criminal offense
is directly connected to the industry
that someone wants to work in.
And maybe that's a great part of the bill.
Maybe the best part of the bill is that now
every board's gonna publish which offenses
keep you from working in certain areas
and individual can get what we call a pre-clearance
where you can go in a plough before you get training
to a board to see how your criminal history
will impact you when it comes time to get a license.
So again, that bill passed a Senate
and I think we've got support in the house.
It just got wrapped up and like a lot of our bills
and day 40, all the back and forth
that kind of got lost and shuffled.
So hopefully we'll get that done quickly this next year.
So will that go back to the house judiciary or?
I believe so, who about to the committee
that it came from?
I believe that's still the process.
Okay.
So back in the house, just sharing committee.
It's not 10 degrees and disagree.
No, it didn't get that far, OK.
Thank you.
Number two, implement changes requested
by the Survey and Mapping Society of Georgia,
also known as SAMHSAG, and supported
by the Georgia State Water Registration
for professional engineers and land surveyors.
I don't remember exactly all the details
of their testimony, but basically, they took the initiative
to come forward with a proposal to streamline the experience.
First of all, to allow testing, change the timeframe
when people can do the test test, which is,
they can do the test right after they finish their education
and don't have to wait for all the field experience
to then take the test after maybe they're a little fuzzy
on some of the education piece.
And the other was to reduce the number of years
that they had to have field experience.
And it was like a kind of a matrix based on
whether they had a high school diploma
and a social degree or a four year college bachelor's degree.
bachelor's degree. And this is the industry itself, including the board, the licensing board,
proposing a solution because they see such a problem with getting people to come into their
field and stay and such a workforce shortage. So to me, that's an easy thing that we can do to
try to accommodate this industry. There may be some interest once we start this from the
professional engineers to do something similar, so I'm so I'm told. So we may end up
won't include them in some legislation. Any discussion of that or questions?
I'm just reading the background of what they're proposing here.
We're on survey and mapping.
I think you're looking at Georgia forward.
I'm good with that one.
I think the survey mappings, non-controversial and sort of almost an internal issue that, you know, I don't see any pushback there.
But I've been surprised sometimes the full four.
I'm sure I will be again probably here.
Moving on, number three,
this is the one on the Georgia Forestry.
And there's a letter and a flyer in the folder.
There was a bill introduced in the house.
Thing is, house bill 53, it's still in the house.
I of course represent a lot of forestry area
and I would like to accommodate their request.
I think it makes a whole lot of sense.
I mean, the Georgia Forestry Commission
is amenable or agreeable to doing this.
So I've talked to director Laumour about it.
And he said as long as the funding,
the license fees come to his agency
where he can administer this.
He's happy to do it.
He's appointed by the governor.
I assume he's talked to the governor about it.
But he has testified, you know, not in front of us, but in front of a committee that he's
willing to take this on.
He's not lobbying to take it on, but he's willing to take it on.
I think it's a hacker characterization.
So I think there's a lot more synergy having them under the Georgia Forestry Commission
that where he's dealing with people that understand what
forsters do and what forstries about.
So I would make that recommendation.
You all can.
Without having 53 in front of us, as long as they're not doing away with the board,
they're just moving where the board is housed.
I don't think they'll have as much of an issue.
When I first read it, it looked like they were doing away with the governor's appointed board.
But that responsibility now is like,
and that's not going to go over well.
But if it's just moving the board.
Just moving the board is understanding.
And I say you worded your recommendation
to you didn't mention the house bill even, sir.
And again, that may not be anything that we would act on
in the Senate until, you know,
we see what happens with house bill 53.
But I think it makes sense they're frustrated
or they're at, frankly.
Number four, this is sort of just real broad.
But it gets to the crux of a lot of what we've heard
in the testimony and what we've discussed.
We have a good many licenses on our books
that almost no other states require, we have a several that maybe say three or four states
other than Georgia requires. To me, when you're an outlier like that, you should give you
pause to look at why are we doing it different than everybody else. And so this is just sort of a
based on the Supreme Court case on the lactation consultants that Jackson
versus Raffin's burger where they said the government bears the burden of
providing a legitimate interest or reason for a license under the Georgia
Constitution. I think we ought to just as a sort of a kind of guiding principle
say that we like to sunset licensing requirements where the license is not proven necessary to protect the public health.
Public safety or public welfare, you know, consumer protection, safety, that kind of thing.
And then I gave some examples of types of licenses that at least I have in mind,
that might fit that category. That would be up for discussion and debate and more
committee hearings and more testimony, but a low-voltage contractor
installs phone systems, security systems. I mean, you know more about this than I do.
I think only three or four states license that why we do, I really don't know.
We heard Tesla money from the lady saying all she wanted to do was open up a shop to do makeup.
She wasn't going to cut hair or, you know, color hair or anything like that.
She has to go through the whole cosmetology licensing process.
1500 hours of experience.
Lots of money to go to school. I mean, I think lots of money.
money, $20,000, $30,000, and we have people doing that at
dealers or maces that aren't licensed, and people do it at home
that aren't licensed, and people can do it on a movie set
without a license. That's just some examples.
Any heartburn with that? Questions? Concerns?
All right. Number five. Early on, the first meeting we heard from Gabriel Sterling
with the Secretary of State's office, he talked to us about their modernization initiative where
they have implemented new software and a new system to more efficiently manage the
licensing process. He talked about some funding needs there and I think there are you can make a
legitimate argument that they don't have the financial resources to properly do what they
are required to do. Our state now is almost 11 million people. A lot more people applying for
licenses or new in licenses and we haven't kept up with the times financially or with technology.
So that's my attempt to indicate that I would be supportive anyway of hearing what their
budget needs are to and seeing what kind of return with the state would get if we were to
appropriate that. Anything there? Number six, that's really the sort of the same thing.
Julie Annas here, she represents some of the nursing groups, but I've heard for years and years
that the nursing board is understaffed. The people they have are they can't retain
employees because they are not paid market adequately and that's part of the backlog on the nursing
licensing. So I think we need to, from an appropriation standpoint, look at that and be open-minded
to allocating more resources to that same thing on number seven.
Number eight, and this gets kind of to the email I received from a constituent
and problems we hear over and over, and I may call on Juliana to speak to this,
but nurses are licensed by the nursing board if they're an advanced nurse which
means they have an advanced degree like they're a CRNA or they're what else
Julianna, sorry.
So these advanced educated nurses with advanced degrees were under a protocol agreement with a licensed physician and do they are able to do more than a nurse that doesn't have the advanced degrees, because they're working under the supervision of the physician.
well I get the license with the nursing board and then they've got to get their protocol agreement
approved from the composite medical board and it can sit there literally all for six months, a year
and a lot of times they have trouble getting a status of what's going on with it or that you know
they finally get somebody and they say well you missed you didn't fill out this rider that and it
just goes back and forth. It just seems real, real problematic to me. My idea for a solution
to this, and again, there probably is a better idea than this, but this is mine now. I'd like
to have some robust discussion and debate on this topic, and I'd like it to be in our recommendations
to generate that, but I think after they submit a fully completed, totally completed application
to the composite medical board, they ought to be deemed after 30 days they ought to be deemed
approved and be able to go to work. They're already licensed and they have oversight from the
the nursing board already, the physician is already licensed and has oversight from the
composite medical board. I don't understand really why the protocol agreement even has
to be approved at all, but this would at least give the composite medical board 30 days
to respond if there's an issue. Otherwise, they should be able to get a word. They could
do it as a provisional license if they wanted to.
I mean, I don't have all the details in my mind
working out, but yes, sir.
Two questions, Chairman, from me.
One, I thought Gabe said something about
they were going to an online application process
that was being phased in.
I think he did say that.
Which should speed up that process.
That was a phone call.
That was it for the 8th floor, and once you get that.
Jilliana, would you mind to go to the podium and?
I'm Julie Anna McConnell, and I represent United APRNs, and I will also
represent it for the Dean's and Directors Association and Georgia nursing
leadership coalition. Yet what the Secretary of State
since the APRNs, right now they receive an authorization to practice.
You know, we had legislation that would, that would instead of an
authorization, they would get a license where only one of 11 states do not
issue an APR in license. There was some concern with the governor's legal
council that there was not adequate implementation moving from that
authorization to a license or license. So the author of the bill, Senator
Hustler asked the bill that the governor vetoed the bill. So we're working on
that right now and working with the Secretary of State's office. But what
but they're talking about the Senator Diven,
that would be the APRN license,
once we get a license,
are even right now the authorization to practice.
But when they, that's for them to get their APRN,
but then if they must have a protocol agreement
with a position,
and that if they're going to get that also enables them
to get like a DEA number,
so that they can write prescriptions.
Okay, that protocol agreement is the one
that must be approved by the composite medical board.
And you are correct, we have backlogs.
We have examples of going from six, seven plus months
before that particular, the protocol agreement
between the APRAN and the physician.
And so that's where a center walker is referring to
what's that APRAN and that physician wants
they prepare their protocol agreement.
And in that protocol agreement,
that enables the physician,
they give that APRAN, for example,
the ability to write radiographic imaging orders,
the authorization to write prescriptions.
So they can only do that if it's included
in that agreement between that physician and that APRAN.
And the majority of the time too,
they must pay a minimum monthly amount to that position for that, for that protocol agreement.
And that is the, and so you got, they're, they're getting an approval from the Board of
Medicine and they're also getting their, their approval to as a advanced practice nurse
through the nursing board. So they're really working with two different boards. So where
we're trying to, I think Senator Walker was saying once that, that position in that APR
in that if they come together and they approved the protocol agreement then to allow them
to not that they could be filed with the board of medicine, I think is what he was recommending.
But right now it must be approved by the board of medicine.
So is there any other questions?
Yeah.
I didn't have as many questions as I have now.
I'm sorry.
Did you just tell me the APRs have to pay to do their job?
It's for a protocol agreement with a position
if it's in certain situations.
They yes, they can have to pay up to like,
I've heard them $1,000 or more per month
with that position.
To have the physician agree to let them do their job.
Yeah, and with the position with that protocol agreement,
they authorize them because they're working
under the supervision of that position that the physician is then required to review and sign off
on 10% of their medical charge. So in a month's time if they see however many patients that AP
are in does see in a month and they must approve 10% of that position must approve 10% of them.
They don't actually see in most of the times they do not see that patient but they sign off on the
the 10% of their records.
Okay.
And it's a little confusion because we have in the statute there and that's also another
thing we're trying to, you know, eventually look at an examine because you have an APRN
like for example, my husband had several years ago, he had a kidney stone.
So we went to a clinic in Biford, Georgia, okay.
and there was, like the APO in there.
Now, there was not a position,
it was late Friday afternoon.
Okay, that nurse practitioner could write the order
for him to have a CT scan.
Yes, you've got a kidney stone.
Okay, he's in terrible pain.
It's that he's probably gonna be in a lot of pain,
but he'll probably dissolve by Monday.
But I can't even give you one prescription
because I can't write schedule two.
Now, he could write like an antibiotic,
but not schedule two, like a hydrocodone
or whatever, some kind of pain medicine.
So we had to leave Beaufort and drive all the way
to the immigrant clinic at Blowery Branch,
I mean, not Blower Branch,
and about 20 miles, 30 miles away,
and spend the night in the emergency room.
Now, when you have the nurse practitioner or APA
and the hospital, they could,
because the physician is there
and they're working under the oversight
of that position in the hospital,
and that falls on a different code section.
Then they did not, they immediately started him
on a pain medication.
That, at that time it was the PAs and the APORians
have comparable scopes, right?
And comparable barriers.
That's the reason we were working jointly with them.
But because that PAs was in the hospital,
immediately started him on medication on pain meds,
and then we spent the night.
So we had to spend 30, 45 minutes getting there
and paying for another CT scan,
I'd not in the emergency room
because that PA could not write a schedule two
that was in the clinic with a physician.
And that's kind of a side note
on just the kind of barriers that we're facing right now.
But right now we're talking about even getting started
an APRAN and we have right now have a legislator
I'm working with that has a daughter
that just graduated, okay, they got their APRN,
they met all the requirements,
graduated to become an APRN,
took them six weeks to get their license
at the Board of Nursing.
But then they have to, once they get their license,
if they're gonna be working in certain situations
and they need a protocol agreement with the physician,
then they have to get that approved
by the composite medical board.
And that's where right now it can take,
We've actually had, we've got a stack of issues coming from AP audience with a lost jobs
because it took them six months to get that protocol agreement approved by the composite
medical board.
So, that's the reason we need to look at something to where we can make that shorter.
And if the protocol, if your protocol agreement is with Dr. Smith and Dr. Smith retires and
the nurse goes to work with Dr. Jones, they got to go through it again. And so she can't
she can't work or to work to her full scope while she's waiting again for that protocol agreement
to be approved. I have one. I don't know. We don't go too far down this road. I guess here, but
one question I would have is what is the composite medical board? What are they looking at?
whether or not they accept or reject protocol agreement. What's the standard they're looking at?
Well, one of the problems I understand they're having right now because it's going from like a very
short form. Now it's like a multi-page very complicated form actually complete. So I think we've
heard that when they complete these forms only about 25% of them are completed correctly the first
time because, and you're talking about nurse, APRMs who have master's degree, some of them
even doctorate degrees, that the form is so unerous and so complicated to complete that only 25%
I'm completed the first time. Then I've got to come back and correct the completion of it.
There have been some issues also with the protocol agreement that if you are a nurse practitioner,
like if you're, you've got to have also supervision in the area of what you're, what you're trying to work in in your area of expertise.
So sometimes that is a reason that they may come back and say, no, this protocol agreement, this physician is cannot be your supervisor, you cannot have a supervisor.
but it's just and I think it's just also just the maybe the resources there that just it's just
just like the Board of Nursing it's not that complicated process with the Board of Nursing
hopefully now too once this is automated it's going to expedite the process but right now it's
on average taking four or five and six weeks just to get that APRN either new license or renewal
completed and it's no, the people that we work with at the Board of Nursing are excellent
and they do a great job. There's executive directors doing a phenomenal job. It's just they don't
have the resources available to meet those numbers and getting those licensed, either renewed
or new license administer. So it sounds like there is a benefit to having the
composite medical board review these agreements. It's just a matter of how long it's taking to get
done right now and is that you're not advocating that we no longer have them reviewed because
sounds like you said about 25% of them at least have issues with how they're done not done correctly
and so it's I mean I don't think nobody's advocating necessarily give her that process are we?
Well I think like central Walker said I think this is something we really need to
to really sit down and take a look at it that and because it why is it though
if there's an agreement when you have a medical physician, okay, a doctor, and you have an
APorian who has a master's and doctor degree. Why they can't also look at the look at the form
itself. Sure. It should be it should be able to complete a form between these two professional
individuals and then where maybe like he said with a 30 day just in case there's an issue doing
I don't know, background check or whatever, but it should be able to that position and
that nurse practitioner be able to come to fill out a form and a supervisor form together.
I don't want to run this too far down the rabbit hole, but my understanding is these are all
hard copy documents that are sent to the composite medical board.
It's stuff on a form that is on paper that is sent as a packet.
Is that true or not?
I will have that was my understanding, but I cannot for a fact tell you that it that is not automated. That's why I'm back to what I was talking about a little while ago, but doing it online, you know, when you're on your daily Amazon purchase.
And you leave something out of a column. It says stop. You can't go ahead.
And so I'm thinking is even that would help speed up the process so it's not that you miss checking a box on a piece of paper.
It's a required spot in the online tile that won't let you proceed unless you do that.
To me, I agree that would be extremely helpful and speed the process, but to me it's not a dig and this is not unlike the study committee I served on with you when I first got elected where we were.
looking at DBHDD and a DCH and all the duplicative oversight and all the confusion and calls that
calls. To me, you've got a license nurse that has already had a background check or she
wouldn't have been able to get her license. You've got a license position that's already
had a background check. He wouldn't be licensed, hopefully if he had done something wrong.
really it's a private agreement essentially
between the doctor and employment agreement
between the doctor and the advanced nurse.
And I don't know where the state's role is
in improving that employment agreement
as long as they are acting within their scope
and practice and their license.
To me, it's like the composite medical board,
I can see why they wanna have it on file
in case an issue arose with a physician or nurse
to say, who all is this person working with?
But I don't, the approval process,
I don't see a whole lot of value in it.
If a doctor is not, doesn't match up right
with the skill set of the nurse,
I mean, to me, that's a,
they're setting themselves up for a big time lawsuit,
probably. I don't know. I don't see a lot of value in it. And I think it needs to be. But I do think
this is an issue we could have a several committee meetings on and bring the composite medical board
back in and really has this thing out. This may not be the right way to put it on our radar, but
I'd like it to be a topic. There's something I'm very interested in trying to improve,
and I agree with you. On the surface to a layman, it doesn't make sense to me.
But I would like to see why they've been doing it. And if we're going to actually fund it by
doing away with it, then we just adequately funded it right there because they no longer exist.
So, well, I'm not suggesting doing away with the composite medical board, just the responsibility.
This would make something.
Just that one, just that one outside.
They've still got all the positions to look after.
Let's put it on there.
We will, we will be fully informed by the conversation started.
The number nine might be too ambiguous and too far-reaching or so ambiguous that it could
be far-reaching, but I just put it on there because I like the terminology universal
recognition.
I guess.
You're talking about like composite bullets or what do you call them, the articulation
agreements with other states that, uh,
reciprocal, the second compacts.
Let's start with the same.
Yes. That's a part of what I'm.
Yes, sir. Uh, there's one way to do it.
Okay. So number 10, number 10. Uh,
I think what I wanted to talk about on this one is we heard
testimony, so House Bill 155 goes a long way to allow for requiring expedited licenses
for military, military spouses, and then licenses by endorsement for everybody else that moves
into Georgia and has a very similar license in another state, but it gives them 90 days
to issue their license. I would like to see us go to 30 days after 30 days once all the requirements
are completed because to me even 90 days is too long and I have to wait to be able to go to work.
The biggest pushback I think I heard when we were in Macon was what we're having to wait on
criminal background checks and it's we got to go through a federal some sort of bureau
then it's taken you know 45, 60, 90 days to get it. My solution to that or my suggestion to that
is have the person on the application include a sworn affidavit in front of a notary saying that
they have no criminal record and if the background check comes back otherwise they can revoke
their license. But I think there's a pretty straightforward, you know, if you falsify something
under a sworn affidavit, you could be, you know, held criminally global for that seems like to me.
So that would be how I would address that issue.
Jump in, man.
Yeah, I mean, we're not getting it done in seven months now.
And you're wanting to take it for three months to a month.
Yeah, it sounds good.
I just don't know how you're going to get from point A to point B.
And we've said consistently that if it's not for the help
and safety of the Georgia citizens and review it,
I'm looking at that headline in the paper
where new practitioner under the guidance of a new Georgia
law passed by so and so,
went to work after falsifying their comments on a,
I mean, they're both made a criminal act saying that they didn't have a criminal background,
which I can see where those two could possibly happen hoping that they don't get caught
and then something bad happened.
So I want to, I would rather give them a hard stop 90 day deadline on this thing and say,
look, you got 90 days.
We are going to fund you.
we're going to give you the resources, do it,
but you've got 90 days.
And after that, it's on you to see how they go that way.
But I've just taken it from seven months to a month.
OK, so what I am in number 10, what I'm talking about,
so you have a copy of this in your folder, HB 155.
And if you look, I highlighted on page three, the 90 days on line 67, but if we move up
to line 49, it excludes firefighters, I don't really know why firefighters exactly,
but it excludes firefighters, healthcare providers, and low enforcement officers.
So this is talking about occupational licenses other than firefighters, health care providers
or law enforcement officers and health care providers is defined on line 19.
And it includes physicians, optometrist pharmacists, counselors, social worker, registered
nurse, advanced nurse, EMTs, all of that.
So we're talking about licenses other than health care
and law enforcement.
And it have to have a license in another state that's
current and being a good standing as well.
Because I understand what you're saying.
I do think we minimize that risk by splitting people working
in health care and law enforcement on our providers too.
We also minimize that risk with having a current license
in other state, but there is still the concern.
I think that that you've had the state background check,
I remember around this, but then the federal
is the fingerprint base running a run that's federal
that would catch everything.
And that's a concern is not having that available yet.
But she bragged about their average turnaround time
was 14 days or something like that.
But that's not what we hear from constituents.
So I don't know, I'm a 14, I'd have been in the number,
but it is way less than 30.
Our fighters are cousin of the CDL license.
It's a three past four years ago.
Change there, send it.
Okay, I'm all about million forward.
I just don't wanna pass a law that's a
unattainable. And think you're being realistic and pragmatic. That would be the first time for me, but the, but I also understand that we're not passing this bill on the floor today. Right. We're putting together a framework for further more detailed discussion by broader body to look at.
look at. Yes. So it's not one of the things I'm going to jump up downside. Now I'm going to
support that. I agree. Okay. Well, thank you. And I added an 11 as we were going through the report.
And again, this is really just something I kind of want to look into. It doesn't even have to be
in the recommendations because I can do it as a senator anyway. But I think what they're doing in
Virginia, what Kaiser Permanente they talked to us about is worth exploring to see if we
want to have a version of that. In Georgia, it's called the Military Medic and
Corp. Program MMAC Program. So my number 11 I guess would be consider adoption of a VA-type model
of the Military Medic and Corp. Program.
That was in here, it's in the packet.
Yes, sir.
Senator Amertari, you sleep.
Make him turn his camera on.
Yeah.
Are we going to go to the floor of the Senate debate all this?
You have a motion. I have a motion in due path to adopt the report whenever the chairman is ready
All right, I have a motion. I'm wide awake
I have a second. I'll second. I have a second any further discussion
Thank you all y'all been excellent to work with so now we're both
All in favor, sitting by by saying hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Any opposed likes on.
All right. Thank you very much.
We got it done.
I enjoyed working.
Great job.
Thank you.
All right.
So the now we'll adjourn the meeting.
He'll be turned this camera.
You
