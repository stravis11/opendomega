He will be introduced by the gentleman from the 151st House District, Representative Mike Chokus. Representative Chokus. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pastor Womack resides in America, Georgia, with his wife, Fay, who's here joining us today. Stand up, Miss Fay. He and Fay have been married for 34 years and have two daughters, a son-in-law, and their biggest joy is their first grandchild, Ripton Cole. Their youngest daughter is a kindergarten teacher at Chris County Primary School, Noel Williams is district. Their oldest daughter, Kayla, is 29 and is married to Earl DePri, both of which serve as educators in the Slah County School system. I had those folks up last week. Their grandson, Ripton, is 15 months old. Pastor Womack has served as the lead pastor at life point church for 24 years and serves as a district overseer for the Church of God. He has also served as chaplain of the Sumter County Sheriff's Department, and 18 years for 18 years and seven years with the Georgia State Patrol as their chaplain. He enjoys the outdoors being involved in his local community, pastoring life point, and especially being the new papa to his grandson, Ripton. Pastor Womack is a man of God, an inspiration to his life point church family, and a friend to all. Members, I present to you my friend, Pastor Womack. What a privilege it is to be here today and be a part of this great session. He's a beautiful crowd. They were joking just a minute ago about taking up an offer, and I thought, man, but then I got to look at the amount of people that are here and really thinking it might be a good idea. I'm thinking more love offering for the pastor. No, I'm kidding. I do have to give a shout out to my two daughters, which have got both of their classes zoomed in on us this morning. Our youngest daughter, Kelsey, of course, in Chris County, to her kindergarten class. Good morning to them and into my oldest daughter, Kayla, her sixth grade class, middle school. That's the great age. So we're shouting out to them this morning. I always like to start with a little bit of humor, and I was listening the other day, and I read this little joke, and I thought it was funny. It says, as a storm raged, the captain of the ship realized his ship was sinking very, very fast. The storm was just tearing it apart. He called out and he said, is there anyone here that knows how to pray? Everyone was kind of nervous, and one young man stepped out at about the age of 25, and he said, I kept it, I knew how to pray. He said, that's good, you pray, while we put on life jackets, because we're short one. Pray a lot. I was told only five minutes, I'll try my best to keep it down to that, and it's hard to do with a preacher. I don't know if any of you hear of pastors or preachers, but it's hard to do, but I'm going to do my best. Amen. Got amen over here. I want to talk to you this morning on the thought, this changes everything. It's very evident in our society and in the world we live today that things have changed. A lot of things have changed. Look back over the years, hairstyles have changed. A lot of things have changed. We all have changes in our lives, and we can't get around and get away from it. Some days we may be shouting praise God, other days we may be screaming, help me God. Change happens. Whatever the day brings, changes will come, and they come frequently. What we need is a godly mindset, a godly mindset in order to handle the changes that come our way that we are inevitably going to face. The constant transitions that we deal with in life, all seem to speak and scream change, change. But every day that we have, we also have the opportunity to look at those days as a way and a time for God to bless us. Each moment contains a gift from God if we look for it. It's our job to do the looking. It's God's job to do the providing. It can be a smile from somebody. It can be an encouraging word from somebody. It can be the word of God through prayer and meditation and reading the word of God that he can speak to our hearts. Maybe it's a paddle in the back from a friend, a colleague, or maybe a boss man. Then there's the obvious things like promotions. Everybody likes to be promoted because promotion brings extra benefits with them most of the time. It's rather obvious things like if you have children in school and they bring home a really good report card. Good things. Maybe someone calls you their hero and they look up to you. They admire you for whatever reason that you've accomplished something in your life and shown them something in theirs. That's a good thing. And then maybe an unexpected financial blessing may come your way. That's an obvious, obvious good thing. Or here's a big thing for me. If you can go seven days without something breaking, tearing up, or falling apart. In Matacot 3 verse 6, God says this, he says, I'm the Lord and I do not change. With all the changes that we see from day in and day out, all the things that we go through, there's one thing that never changes and that's God. He never changes. It also says in Hebrew 6, 18. So God has given us both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it's impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can take courage for we can hold on to his promise with confidence. Jesus promised this in Hebrews 13 and 5. I will never leave you and I'll never forsake you. The truth is change brings challenges. But here's the difference. You and I as the individuals that we are, regardless of where we come from, where we are, or where we're headed. You and I get to set the environment where the change takes place. The value of your existence. The value of your outlook. The value of your environment is set by you. It's set by myself. I got a bottle of water here that I brought with me or was given to me today. Now it says smart water. I told my daughter the other day, keep drinking honey because it ain't working. She wasn't nearly as excited to hear that as you were. And while the value may be a little different, you can go to Walmart and you can buy a bottle of water. And the cost of it will be about 15 cents. This particular bottle was offered to me this morning at no cost. But if you take that same bottle of water for 15 cents from Walmart, take it to a high school ball game. The value goes from 15 or so cents to $1 to $2 depending on which school you're in. Take the same bottle of water. It's a container. It has content. Take that same bottle of water and you go to a college football game. And the price could increase up to $4 to $5 per bottle.

You take that same bottle of water, the same container with the same content, take that same bottle of water to a Pro football game and that bottle of water could cost anywhere from seven to ten dollars per bottle. The container never changed. The content is still the same. It never changed. The only difference was the environment where the container and the content is located. My friend listened to me this morning very clearly. Don't let the enemy of your soul devalue who contains you and the content that he's put in you. There's something to be said about who we are, what we do, where we're from, and what we represent and who lives in us. And just like that bottle of water, don't let anything or anybody rob you of your environment. You get to set that. Let the changes come. We won't walk in fear, but we'll walk in faith. Let the changes come because we'll trust God with the changes. Let the changes come because we'll trust God with the challenges that come with the changes. And we'll set our environment which will determine the value of what's around us. Paul said it like this in 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 12. For I know the one in whom I trust and I'm convinced. I'm convinced that he's able to guard what I have entrusted to him until the day of his return. My friend, this changes everything, everything. May I pray with you this morning. Heavenly Father, we come to you today and the name that is above every other name, the name of Jesus Christ. God, we thank you for this day. Lord, I thank you for every single representative that's in this room. God, they represent the great state of Georgia and they work hard. Lord, I pray that you would bless them for their labor. Bless them for their time. God, honor them as we honor them. Lord, I pray that today you would allow their minds to be open to your call and your spirit. God, let us look at our environment and let us make up our minds that we will set the environment. That the content and the container is ours to take care of. Lord, I pray that you would bless our leadership of this state and I pray God that you would give each and everyone a covering by your mercy and grace. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen and amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God and indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the pastor in the south any room. Chair now recognizes Chairman Tarvan, the chairman of the Committee on Information and Odits.

about this very special day when strolling, strolling thunder, meaning moms, dads, pushing their babies are here at our capital today. What a reminder, how important those early years are birth to five when the brain develops so fast and the focus of each and every one of us on the blessings that we have to be here today because our brains are working and the responsibility that we have to carry that forward to families across our state in so many ways. The brain develops so very fast that first year, some of you are young parents, some of you here with us are grandparents. It's so important to realize that that eye connection, that nurturing, that healthy feeding, that loving a child that helps the brain reach the potential that it can. Today you're invited to join many who are here if you would stand up and let us recognize you from gears and families that are here with their children. Thank you so much. We are all invited to join them across the street at Central Presbyterian Church for lunch from noon to 12, from noon to 1, and you will certainly enjoy time with each of these lovely families. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Chair Leader Dempsey, and thank you all for being here today as well. Members, we have a special invite here in just a moment. Representative Moore, if you will come down in front, I think our special guest is going to arrive just in a moment. House will come to order and members, please take your seats. Please take your seats. They're like magic. Our special guest has arrived. Chair now recognizes, represents the Angela Moore for a special resolution. Good morning, and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It is my high esteem to have you join me in this invitational resolution to Michael Harris, the second, joined by his parents to the Georgia House of Representatives. May you have a high five up against Harris so they can identify you. As the general lady from the 91st House District of Georgia, which encompasses DeCab, Rockdale, and Henry counties, and in this instant Stockbridge Georgia, I am abundantly proud to welcome Stockbridge's own to the House Chamber today. Michael Harris, the second, is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Atlanta Braves. But wait, there's more. He was drafted by the Braves in the third round of the 2019 MLB draft and made his MLB debut with the team in 2022. This past August, the Atlanta Braves and Mr. Harris agreed on an eight-year contract extension. Now you can clap some more. He was named Rookie of the Month several times, and this past November, Mr. Harris was named the 2022 National League Rookie of the Year. But there's more. Mr. Harris is only the seventh Atlanta player to win this designation. Mr. Harris was born in the Cape County, Georgia, and graduated from Stockbridge High School, where he continues to inspire not only the children in the public school system, but the people who have mentored him, the adults. Today, Michael, we at the Georgia House of Representatives, the upper echelon of the state, of the entire state of Georgia, honor and salute you, and thank you for being an inspiration for Georgia's children. Thank you. May I please present our Rookie of the Year for the State of Georgia, and from the 91st District of Georgia, Michael Harris. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad to be here. I didn't know going through school, I would be in a building like this, talking to you guys. I'm on behalf of myself and my foundation, Catch 23 Foundation, I just want to appreciate everybody in here and the legislative body. It means a lot, like I said, and it's kind of surreal. I won't really hit me until I get back home. But I just want to, since my appreciation to you guys, you mean a lot to the state, and it's good to be back here and get such an honor. I won't have a token of appreciation, I guess you can say depends on how much you value me, whatever. I wanted to give both of you guys a ball, a representative, a representative more, and the House Speaker. Thank you. I think that's Georgia grown, what a y'all think right there. One of our very own. Thank you, Michael, for number one entertaining us with some great baseball. But thank you for remembering who you are, where you came from, and giving back to the community. That's very, very special. And you will, I know you will continue to be blessed, and we will be blessed in the future for you caring about your fellow man and the young people and the impression you are making on a lot of folks. Thank you for being here with us today. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you members for your attention. We're now move on to our afternoon orders. First afternoon order will be chair lady Cooper for an afternoon order. Chair leader Cooper is recognized for an afternoon order. Take your lady, take your time, chair lady. Anywhere, lady Mr. Harris, make his way. I wish I'd be rich this afternoon. Thank you. Members, please take your seats and let's give the member in the well. Your attention as we move on to afternoon orders, we have some information. Thank you all for being here. Members, if you will, please take your seats. Thank you, chair lady. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is Skin Cancer Awareness Day. Until 130, they're going to be down in room 230 doing screenings. A lot of you grew up in Georgia and the hot Georgia sun. You are at high risk of developing a skin cancer or if you are fair skinned. And one of our members who is fair skinned, who is wise enough to get regular checks, just had a skin cancer on her face on her nose. She couldn't even see it but a regular check found it. It was malignant, it was removed and she still has her pretty little nose. But skin cancer kills and you need to catch it early so here's your chance not to go to a doctor's office, but you have to wait with a skin specialist. If you have any kind of a bump or something you do not know what it is, please go downstairs before 130 in room 230 and get a check. It is so easy and like I said, the life you saved may be your own. We also have a health meeting on the clock and I appreciate Mr. Speaker, you calling us to order. Thank you. My pleasure. Those are great checkups. I've always taken advantage of them so I hope all of you will as well. A little preventative medicine we hope. Representative Lisa Hagen has recognized for an afternoon order. Are you ready? Let's do it. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Friends and colleagues today is Forestry Day at the Capitol. You may have noticed you have your wood embages on your desk. I hope you enjoy those. Please note that they will not get you back into the chamber. You do have to have your regular badge on. The doorkeepers ask me to remind you that you must have your regular door badge to get back in the door. But I hope you enjoy your wood embages. And I hope you also will join us at the depot this evening from 5 to 7 for a reception with our foresters. There are some special guests that will be there. Mr. Speaker, will you be there? Yes ma'am. I'm sure all of you will make plans to be there. We do thank our foresters and everybody that's affiliated with that industry. We are the number one state for forestry in this country. And so I know we all wanted everything we can to support that industry. Thank you. So she put me on the spot. So, Representative Buckner and Representative Cannon, we were with those folks at like 7.30 this morning. Did I miss you? It was a pretty good crowd. No way. It's a great group y'all. They have a large contingent here with us today. And I think most of y'all saw that tremendously, tremendously large piece of equipment. A skitter out on the street between here and L.O.B. So thanks for recognizing Georgia Forestry Day at the Capitol. It's a great group and they bring a lot to all of our lives. Georgia grown, Georgia grown, our forestry industry. Representative Al Williams recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I arrived this morning. I was not originally on the list and was not going to do a moment in black history this year. But after listening to Representative Solomon Adesonye, I decided I wanted to inspired me too. And he did such a wonderful job. For years and years, and since I've been in the legislature, and Representative Sanyye, it brought to mind that with John Lewis, I marched on Washington in 63, and marched across the bridge from Sanyye to Montgomery with him in April of 65. But for years and years, we've had a monument outside, to the 33 that were expelled right after reconstruction. And I've been doing research for some years. The chairman of my commission was helping me not to love it. And we found that there was an exception in 1888. Samuel Maccather from Liberty County was elected to the Georgia legislature. The largest precinct in Liberty County at the time was at Riceboro. Representative Glazed has a relationship. He has one client aunt that lived in Riceboro. So no one showed up. The White Pole manager did not show up to open the pole. So Reverend Floyd Snellson, who was a great grandfather of Admiral Annie Andrews, who we honored here some years ago, she's now retired at Mel Andrews. Her granddaddy, who was an activist and a man of great integrity and bravery, saw himself in another inn and opened the poles. Maccather won that pole over Wemmingland, was elected to the Georgia House. Came to serve. It was vigorously opposed. But the finding was for him after investigations. Here was a man, if you can imagine, an 1888, who came in this legislature, marched in a procession to swear in a new governor, the only African American here. A couple of years later, he'd reached the age he decided to retire and he retired. I was spoken to Representative Gillian and the Black Caucus is going to do something about this little known Black fact. I had never heard of Samuel Maccather, but he was, he, some of his biggest accomplishments, were within two miles of where I now live. He was a member of the Midway Congregational Church in Midway and out of that was born the other Midway Congregational down at Golden Grove where Reverend Floyd Snellson was a pastor. We're going to do some things. But after looking at this great revelation, I realized and I felt a moment of great sadness because with accepting a representative, no, you're all from Liberty County. You must be sad about that. It's great to be from Liberty County and on your way to glory, you can't get there until you come through. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Thanks for the history lesson and the invite to Liberty County, right? Representative Carlton Howard is recognized, representing Howard is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I counted the privilege today to stand before you in this wheel for the very first time. Even though I've gotten a lot of attention about it with an episode a few days ago, I hope it went too much of a distraction. But I did want to take this opportunity to think the medical staff here in the house or in this building. Dr. Michelle Arr, the medical staff, the doctor of the day, and of course, Dr. Leader Beverly. He used his watch to take my pulse and made sure he escorted me to the Kaufman clinic to make sure I was checked out. And everything checked out well. I just didn't drink on the water that day and told my wife I didn't have to have breakfast. And I paid for it a little later on. But all this way, also, we thank you for that. But I rise today for this black history moment. And if you exit that middle door today of this chamber, you will see a portrait of a visionary. They called her the mother of the children of the people. She was a far-seeing spirit. She dared to educate the sons and daughters of the formerly enslaved. She labored for years building a school in Augusta, that same school that my father attended, the Haines Institute. And it became a model for young educators wanting to follow in her footsteps. She never married nor did she have children of her own, but she dedicated her entire adult life to her race. She used education as a vehicle to for upward mobility and implored it effectively in the 19th and early 20th century. She is Lucie Craflane. Lucie Craflane was born in Macon, Georgia in 1854. In 1873, she was the first graduating class in the first graduating class of the normal school of what was called the Teachers College of Atlanta University. In 1886, she chartered the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta. It was a private boarding school with a rigorous curriculum. Not long after the establishment of the Haines Institute, she partnered with two doctors in Augusta to establish what is known as the Lamar School of Nursing. In February 1917, she co-founded the Augusta branch of the NAACP. Students that graduated from Haines would go on to have stellar careers, noted a physician, Dr. T. W. Josie of Augusta, internationally renowned author Frank Yerbe. In 1974, then-governed Jimicara honored Miss Laney with that portrait that is hanging outside that middle door here in our chambers. Later she would have a street named after her Laney Walker Boulevard along with Reverend C.T. Walker. There are two schools in the United States named for Miss Lucie Craflane, one of them in Minnesota and the one that I graduated from in Augusta, Georgia. Lucie Craflane, it led a full professional life in stealing the young African American boys and girls that you could be anything in life if you so desire to be. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, a year the well. Thank you, Representative Howard. You come from a great house family and we're glad that your and your moment of need that this house family was there for you. Thank you all who took care of Representative Howard on that day. Chair now recognizes Representative Cannon and Representative Brnaw for an afternoon order. The lady will hold just for a moment. Please proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we're here in a Black History Month moment to talk about an organization based here in Georgia called Fathers Incorporated. They recently received a $5 million grant to specifically focus on helping Black Fathers 900 of them here in the Metro Atlanta area to understand access to mental health, to get counted in the census, to escort their children to school and to focus on their critical needs at the state capital. We're really grateful that during Black History Month we are able to talk about these wonderful people. They are here in the capital today. Their CEO Kenneth Braswell will be here all day and we just want to thank them for the work that they do to help unite families in the state of Georgia. Thank you very much. Thank you, Representative's for that information. We certainly appreciate it. We have one more afternoon order and I don't see the general lady on the floor. Oh, you have one Chairman Sokox. No, we'll get those in just a moment. Those are going to be the announcements. We had one more afternoon order. Remember, is any more had an afternoon order?
