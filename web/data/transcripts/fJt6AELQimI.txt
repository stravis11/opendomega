TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everybody. My name is Senator Josh McLaren. I'm here today with a
group of concerned journalists, activists, organizers about the case of Mario
Guevara. Mario Guevara is a journalist who is being held in
Folkston, Georgia, and ICE detention. We've been talking a lot about ICE
recently in this country. Trump just passed a budget bill that expanded ICE
is funding by $75 billion, tripling its annual budget and making its annual budget larger
than that of the FBI and the federal prison system.
ICE is poised to become the largest domestic police force and most funded domestic police
force in the United States.
And what this means for communities, particularly immigrant communities, is fear.
here that family or friends will be abducted, snatched up, disappeared, taken to remote
facilities, windowless rooms, with little contact in some cases with the outside world,
with no guarantee of due process and no accountability for, in some cases, the plain clothes officers
who come and abduct these folks off of our streets and our communities from businesses,
from schools.
Mario Guevara is a journalist, and so his detention raises even bigger questions about civil
rights, constitutional rights, the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press.
And in this country, as we know with our tradition of the freedom of speech and press, it isn't
about whether you agree with someone's opinions, the substance of their reporting, it's about
their right to collect information and disseminate that information, to communities who rely on
to make deliberative and form decisions about their democracy.
And Mario Guevara is a part of that esteemed
centuries-long tradition.
It's for that reason that we assemble here today
in support of his due process.
His charges have been dropped in the jurisdictions
where they were brought.
He has now been in ice detention for a month
without recourse and without any guarantee
that his constitutional rights,
rights, a legal resident of the United States will be protected.
I'm honored now to invite one of several organizations here today, the organizations
here today include the ACLU of Georgia, the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, Asian
Americans Advancing Justice.
But this press conference is also sponsored by, brought to you by the Committee to Protect
Journalists, a worldwide organization that has been at the forefront of protecting freedom
of the press internationally.
internationally.
It's my honor to introduce from CPJ, the director of the Americas, Jose Zamora, who
can explain in a little more detail who you're going to hear from today and the type of message
that we're trying to get out.
Thank you, Jose.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator McLaren.
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Jose Zamora.
I represent the Committee to Protect Journalists and Organization that promotes freedom of the
the press around the world and defense the right of journalists to report the news safely
and without reprisal.
It is deeply troubling that we are here today in the United States holding a press conference
about an imprisoned journalist for doing his job.
Mario Guevara, a respected, Emmy award-winning reporter who has covered immigration issues
for over two decades was arrested while engaging
in a constitutionally protected activity
under the First Amendment.
The charges were dropped, yet he remains detained by ICE.
Let's be clear, Mario is being punished for his journalism.
He is now the only journalist in prison in the U.S.
in direct retaliation for his reporting.
Seamos claros, Mario está siendo castigado por su labor periodística.
Es ahora el único periodista encarcelado en Estados Unidos
en represalia directa por hacer su trabajo informativo.
This is a blatant attack on press freedom,
on the First Amendment, and on the right of communities,
especially immigrant communities, to be informed.
These communities rely on voices like Mario's
to help make sense of the world around them.
Today, we come together to express and announce these
reviews.
We thank our partners, our speakers, and each one of you
for being here today, because defending press freedom
anywhere, especially here at our home,
is essential to defending democracy everywhere.
Mario should have never been arrested, he must be free and reunited with his family and
his community.
To begin, we will hear more about Mario's case from Giovanni Diaz, who is leading his
legal defense.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Thank you all for being here.
My name is Giovanni Diaz, I'm one of the founding partners of the Law from Diaz and
guide a law. My law partner Zachary Guietta is also here. We form kind of the
spear of the legal team that's working hard to get Mario released. So just to
give you a little bit of background about Mario's case and I know you all have
read a lot of articles and there's a lot of information out there and I'll
try to keep it as brief as possible. He was arrested on June 14th and because
Although he's not a legal permanent resident, he is legally allowed to remain here in the
United States and his authorization to work in a social security card and a driver's
license, ice placed a hold on him.
And unfortunately, nowadays, the administration has made it perfectly clear that anybody
who's not a legal permanent resident, at least, or a citizen, even if they've been given
certain protections, and they've been allowed to remain in the United States legally, and
And the government has openly stated in court records that they're not looking to remove
that individual from the United States, ICE has decided that these people are targets
as well, regardless of the crime they commit.
So even when minor traffic violations are anything that they're accused of, and just the
accused of just being arrested is enough, ICE can place and didn't this case place an
ice hold on Mario.
Once the ice hold is placed, there's very little legally that you can do to remove an ice
hold. And you just have to see how the jurisdictions play out. Now there's limits to the ice hold. Very
quickly, we worked to get him a signature bomb. My law partner went to Magister Court a few times,
and by the beginning of the week we were able to get him signature bonds. Those signature bonds
were signed and he was quickly taken to ice custody. It's very interesting the way he was
was routed to ICE custody.
Instead of going directly to the 180 TED Turner office,
the main Atlanta field office,
he was escorted directly to the focus and detention center.
Obviously, a lot of people have been speculating
as to why this is done.
We really don't know why.
It's unique.
It's unusual, but it was done.
We worked very quickly to contact,
and we weren't the only ones.
Many concerned members of the community, members
of the media reached out to the Cab County.
And I think the pressure the Cab County had,
how relentless Zach was,
Zach was in working with the Cab County
and contacting them and visiting them.
They eventually decided to do the right thing.
The prosecutors decided to do the right thing
and dismissed the charges.
But by that time, it was a bit late.
By that time, the ice hole was Haiti
who was already transferred to ICE custody.
and we were already quickly working to prepare
and file a bond motion.
Now a bond motion is the first thing that one does
in order to get somebody released.
Mario is clearly eligible for bond.
Mario has no criminal history in the United States.
Mario has been here for 20 plus years.
Mario is clearly eligible for adjustment of status
through a petition filed from his immediate relative child.
So we were very, very confident with everything
we knew about Mario and the facts of the case
that we will get bond.
On July 1st, the bond hearing was set for July 4th.
We attended, his family attended.
We had a more contentious bond hearing
that we expected to have.
But the judge sided with us, and he granted Mario a bond,
a bond in the amount of 7,500.
And in the immigration world, that's not too high of a bond.
That's kind of usual.
The bonds have incredible ranges, and there
are so many factors that go into what the range or the amount
of bond set by the judge.
But these judges have amazing and almost unfettered discretion
in granting bond and whatever amount they see fit.
But we got the bond, family was happy,
and we were about to go post it.
So up to that point, everything that we expected to happen
had happened.
Mario's family went to post the bond,
and we began to see what things that we've seen before,
which are sort of these obstructionist type tactics
where maybe the bond posting didn't go through.
They cite administrative issues.
We tried to do it electronically.
The family tried to do it electronically.
The next step is going person.
They went in person.
They showed up in person, and they told them,
we're not going to accept the bond.
I think the, I'm going to paraphrase
what the ICE officer told my client's family,
but they stated that although a judge grants a bond,
they have the discretion to not allow it to be posted.
Instead of explaining to the client that there was a stay
that had petitioned that had been filed with the BAA,
instead of explaining to them to what happened,
instead of correctly serving their attorneys,
that was a message that they gave.
So immediately that same day,
our senior associate, Jessica Calms,
went straight up to the ICE office
and told we need information.
By that time, they had already confirmed to us
that he was being transferred to Gwyneth.
Now, for those of you that don't know,
very quickly after being detained from the cab,
he was hit with warrants from Gwyneth County.
This is unusual in that these warrants
were for traffic violations and incidences
that allegedly happened a month or more
before the day the warrants were sworn out.
That in itself is very unique.
The timing of it is very concerning.
They hit on with these warrants
after he was detained by the cab.
So we had those warrants, so it isn't surprising,
and we had prepared the family.
That because he had open warrants,
there was a possibility that Gwyneth would come
and pick them up from his custody.
We've had cases in the past where clients win their cases,
but because they have open warrants,
those jurisdictions have the right
and do pick up the individual.
It's sometimes they don't.
But in Mariel's case, they did.
And they transferred him over to Gwyneth custody.
Once he got to go net custody, Zach, my law partner,
and some of the other attorneys at my firm,
we worked pretty hard to reach out.
They weren't as responsive as the cab county
to say the least, but luckily,
I think with the pressure of the community
and with Zach's pressure again,
those charges were ultimately dismissed.
So thankfully those were dismissed,
and I think the statement from the prosecutors
that they couldn't prosecute that case,
just to keep it as brief as possible.
Mario, we found out later through filings from the government that they did fall to stay.
And they appealed the bond decision.
Now appealing the bond decision isn't unusual.
Ice nowadays, all the discretion that attorneys generally have as prosecutors has been stripped
from them and they basically aren't even allowed to agree with us of what they have the
week it is.
So what they do is they filed the appeal, again, we were prepared for that, but we didn't
think they'd filed a stay.
The stay was a surprise, and I think the stay was a very firm reminder and a confirmation
to us that they wanted to treat Mario very differently than other detained individuals.
So we've responded, we've filed a motion to lift the stay.
We've obviously filed a response, a motion for summary of
Firmance, and we're asking the Board of Immigration Appeals to do the right thing.
We're asking them to lift the stay, and we're confident.
Based on the fact that the law is very much on our side, that we will ultimately get the
stay lifted, and that we will ultimately win the appeal.
just a brief, you know, lesson on the law.
The Board of Immigration Appeals traditionally
has given immigration judges a ton of discretion.
I don't want to say unfettered,
but a lot of discretion in making bond decisions.
And most decisions from the Board of Immigration Appeals
on bond, specifically on the issue of bond, are affirmed.
So we're confident, based on the overwhelming evidence
that favors my client, that Mario will be allowed
to post this bond once we prevail
at the Board of Immigration Appeals.
We've also consulted with partners,
we've consulted with the other attorneys in my office,
and if the decision goes anywhere else,
we feel that the government is acting in bad faith
and we will pursue litigation.
Thank you.
We'll go.
Thanks.
Next, we'd like Mario's daughter to speak, Catherine.
Thank you so much for being here today and thank you for giving me a few minutes to speak.
My name is Katherine and I'm Mario Guevara's daughter.
I'm here today as a daughter, yes, but also as someone who watched her dad spend his life
trying to help others.
My father is a reporter.
He chased stories that mattered,
stories that told the truth about immigration,
about injustice, about people who usually go ignored.
He's always believed that journalism was a form of service.
He didn't do it for recognition.
For more than 20 years, I have witnessed
his unwavering dedication and selfless commitment
to serving the Hispanic community.
A lot of people he helped were just trying to survive
in this country.
He not only informed the community,
but also gave them vital connections and a sense of hope.
That's the kind of journalist that he is,
and that's the kind of person that he is.
Since he's been detained,
our family has felt an emptiness
that we cannot begin to fill.
My mom is exhausted.
My brothers and I feel like we're stuck in a nightmare.
This process has been extremely complicated and difficult every step of the way.
We don't know what to tell people when they ask where he is.
We don't know how to explain how something like this could happen.
How is this even possible?
There are many fears tied to the uncertainty of what lies ahead for my dad, but more
than fear I feel anger, because this should not be happening.
My dad did nothing wrong.
He was arrested while wearing a press badge.
He was live streaming.
He wasn't in the way.
He wasn't breaking any law.
He was doing his job.
And now, with every day that passes, we're losing time we'll never get back.
The pain we feel is indescribable, though I know so many others in the same situation understand
they understand it all too well.
I'm deeply disappointed with this country.
This is not just about one journalist.
This is about what kind of country we want to be.
If a government can punish a reporter for doing his job, what message does that send?
protections are left for the rest of us. To those listening, please don't let
this be forgotten. Don't let my dad become another name on the list. He's more
than that. He's the most hardworking man that I know.
A man whose dedication and sacrifices have shaped not only my life, but the lives of everyone
around him.
He belongs home with us, and we won't stop fighting until he is.
Thank you.
Good morning, thank you for being here.
My name is Oscar and I'm Mario Guevara's son.
I'm here today because my dad can't be you.
I'm here because the person who has always been the strongest in our family, the one we
look to for answers, for calm, for strength, is not the one locked in a detention center.
My father is a journalist, but to me he's just my dad.
He's the guy who drove me to school, worked long hours, and still found time to ask how
I was doing.
He's the one who made sacrifices most people never saw.
He worked evenings and weekends.
He missed holidays, sometimes to cover stories.
But he didn't because he believed that his work made a difference.
When I was 17, I had to have brain surgery.
My dad was there by my side and would turn me up when I was feeling down.
As part of my recovery, he put a camera in my hands and helped me become a young photo
journalist.
He has always known how to bring a smile to my face.
Growing up, I didn't always understand why my dad was so obsessed with his work.
Or why'd he jump up and leave dinner to chase down the story.
But now I do.
He was trying to tell the truth.
He was trying to protect people, especially those without a voice.
His work wasn't just a job, it was a calling.
And now he's being punished for answering that call.
Since he's been locked up, we haven't been okay.
My family feels like we're living in limbo.
And that has been a legal resident of the US for more than 20 years.
He pays taxes, he's followed the law, he raised a family here, and yet, despite having
no charges against him, he's sitting in a cell as if he's a threat, all because he was
doing his job.
We were raised to believe that in this country, freedom of speech mattered, that journalism
mattered. The hard work and honesty meant something, but none of that seems to matter right
now. I want to say to those in power, you are not just locking up a journalist. You are
locking up a father, a husband, a man who spent his life giving back. And we are here,
family trying to make you see him. My sister and I could go on, could go on. These short remarks don't
my father justice, please let him go, let him go home.
Thank you.
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for coming. You know, we're about 20 minutes in and you're
all still here. So that's wonderful. I'm Nora Benavides and I, you know, I thought a lot
about how I was going to come here today, whether it's through my role with the Georgia
First Amendment Foundation, where we protect open government and free speech in Georgia.
I thought a little bit about coming here given my role with Free Press, which is a national
nonprofit where we fight for free, equitable, and open connection online and offline.
I thought about coming here as a Latina,
who has been deeply personally appalled by the indignity
and the dehumanization over the last several months
of people who look like me.
Or, honestly, as a civil rights attorney,
who has known Mario Guevara for many years.
I've appreciated his presence, shall we say,
unique coverage at times in the community.
But the issues that bring me, and I believe,
all of us here today in support of Mario Guevara,
really are us coming together in our most fundamental capacity,
troubled by where we are headed,
and the way that Mario Guevara's case
feels emblematic of the disturbing path
that the United States is on.
Mario Guevara is not a threat to our society,
as the government would have us believe,
just like others throughout the country
that are being targeted for their speech
and for their conduct,
like students from Columbia or Georgetown or Tufts,
some of whom, like Mahmoud Khalil,
were detained for over three months
for exercising their free speech rights,
condemning what is happening in Gaza.
These students were never threats to our society.
Just like Lauren Tamasi, the journalist who was hit
with rubber bullets while she was covering protests
in Los Angeles and other journalists
that were attacked with tear gas in Los Angeles,
just for doing their job.
just for exposing the facts, laying witness to dissent
against an increasingly authoritarian administration.
Again, these journalists were never a threat
to our society, and in fact, each of these examples
show us people exposing a narrative
that those in power do not want exposed.
None of these instances present a threat
to the United States.
There are examples of the very reason
we have a First Amendment and a Constitution at all.
But if people like Mario Guevara are somehow cast as dangerous,
I think that says more about the kind of nation
we are becoming than it does about who Mr. Guevara is.
It says that this country is turning its back
on core American principles.
Principles are founders believed essential
to prevent consolidation and abuse of power by a small few.
Those founding fathers knew that freedom of the press
are freedom to speak, listen, think, and assemble
would be essential bulwarks against overreach
of government power.
So if the exercise of those rights is now penalized,
like it is with Mario Cuvara, simply
because those empowered dislike the message or the messenger,
that means that our basic freedoms are not free.
They have become privileges, doled out for good behavior
if those in power allow it.
I feel like we're in this really weird moment,
you know, I think about what John Lewis would think
if he were here with us,
because I'm sure that he would be standing behind us.
I think about this being the birthplace
of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
of the civil rights movement, no less,
a movement that clung to and succeeded in part
because of people's expression in protest rights.
So let's be clear today,
because it is an honor that you were all here.
Thank you to Senator McLaren for hosting this.
We are here today in diversity, politics,
identity, creed, belief, because we are calling
for the immediate release of Mario Guevara.
He has no criminal charges against him.
He's in this country legally.
He was arrested while doing a constitutionally
protected activity.
But that is one that the Trump administration dislikes.
And this is the environment that the administration
has created.
Trump himself has disallowed journalists
from the White House when he dislikes their coverage.
Congress has gutted millions and millions and millions
of dollars for public media just last week,
and instead is giving over $170 billion
to law enforcement and border police.
And even in our corporate media realm,
companies like CBS are discontinuing programming
like the Stephen Colbert show,
because he spoke critically of the way
that CBS capitulated to Donald Trump.
We're living in a climate of fear and retribution.
And it is a step of courage, it is a sign of courage,
when Mario Cuvara's children come forward,
risking themselves, their own safety,
to describe what they have lived through.
Our community ties are weakening.
Truth is undermined as the bedrock of our democracy.
And I believe that Mr. Cuvara's case
is really just the tip of this fear.
So when pushing back today,
we are not just calling for Mr. Cuvara's immediate release.
Because the very circumstances under which we are here,
more than 38 days into his disturbing detention,
these are daily reminders of the ways
that other people may think twice
about filming the police.
They may think twice about protesting,
and any one of you covering this today
might even think twice about reporting on ice.
And that is the point.
Mario Gavara's detention sends a chilling message
to anyone who might want to exercise their rights.
And it is a rejection of the very premise
country was founded on, to give people agency, dignity, autonomy and freedom to challenge
those in power. I look at the pattern, you know, of what is happening, people who are
targeted for their speech, then detained for their speech, and I worry that Mr. Guevara
may not be the last journalist that we see targeted like this. And so I think it makes
it all the more important, probably essential, that all of us, everyday people, journalists,
lawyers, lawmakers standing behind us,
and other leaders stand up for something better.
This is beyond politics, it's beyond time period,
it's beyond Atlanta, and if it's Mario Guevara's
detention today, it may be one of ours tomorrow.
So thank you all so much for giving coverage and airtime
to this critical case and this critical issue.
I'm now honored to introduce my colleague
from the ACLU of Georgia, Andrés Lopez Delgado.
Thank you.
Morning, everyone.
My name is Andres Lopez Delgado.
And I'm a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Georgia
and the son of Puerto Rican migrants.
I want to begin by thanking Senator McLaren,
free press, the committee to protect journalists,
the Georgia First Amendment Foundation,
Mario's legal team, and Mario's family
for the opportunity to speak today.
The ACLU of Georgia is an organization
that champions the right of all Georgians
to exercise their constitutional rights.
Those rights include the right to free speech,
which is guaranteed under both the federal constitution
and the constitution of the state of Georgia.
We have a long history of standing up for free speech even when that speech is unpopular
and especially when it results in government retaliation.
So I want to take the opportunity today to reaffirm some basic principles of free speech
because it feels like we're living in a time and in a place where those rights and principles
very much need affirming.
First and foremost, I want to say that the protections of the First Amendment extend to everyone
regardless of citizenship status.
And those rights include the right to gather and publish information about government
activity, the right to record public officials doing their jobs in public places, the right
to criticize government action and to dissent from government action.
And the First Amendment safeguards us from government retaliation for engaging in protected
free speech and speech-related activities.
For the reasons described eloquently by the other speakers here today, which I will not
repeat in the interests of being brief, the ACLU of Georgia is deeply concerned about
Madios case and what it means about where we're headed as a state and as a country.
should not have to be concerned that they will face deportation or other retaliation when
they are just trying to do their jobs reporting on matters of grave and deep public concern.
Georgians rely on a free press to know what is happening in our communities. We need to
know that journalists are protected when they are working to bring the public critical
information and that nobody will be punished for shedding light on government action.
The ACLU of Georgia condemns this attack on the First Amendment and is committed to
protecting freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the state of Georgia.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Catherine Jacobson and I lead the US program at the Committee to Protect Journalists.
I want to begin by acknowledging something that might seem obvious, but bears repeating.
It is deeply unsettling that we are gathered here today holding a press conference about
the ongoing imprisonment of a journalist in the United States, Mario Guevara.
But these are not normal times.
I represent CPJ, a global nonprofit that depends, press freedom, and the rights of journalists
worldwide.
Since 1992, we have tracked case-by-case every journalist killed and imprisoned in retaliation
for their work around the world.
For most of that time, the United States was rarely mentioned.
It was the exception, not the rule, a country where, despite its flaws, journalists could
generally do their jobs without fear of government reprisal.
This is no longer the case.
We've seen a steady rise in domestic threats to press freedom, legal harassment, physical
attacks, relentless online abuse, and now Guvara's case stands as one of the clearest
examples of that erosion.
Mario Guevara remains the only journalist in the US
who was in prison following an arrest related
to his reporting.
It bears repeating and thinking on that.
You've already heard the specifics from his family,
his attorney from lawyers and civil society organizations,
and yes, the back and forth between jails,
the dismissed charges, the misdemeanors,
the ice custody, it can sound complicated,
but let us be clear.
The principles at the core of this case are straightforward.
Quavaro was engaging and protected first amendment activity
at the time of his arrest.
He had been legally in the United States for two decades,
and now he has been behind bars for 38 days.
The initial charges against him, all misdemeanors,
were dropped.
He should be free.
Instead, the government has argued that Quavaro
was a danger to society and should be denied bond
because of his supporting activity, including live streaming,
which I assume some of you are doing here today.
This line of reasoning, therefore,
should be caused for alarm.
Guvara, like so many other reporters,
had regularly used live streaming as a way
to tell the story of what was happening in his community.
His work covered everything, from daily issues
to life altering immigration raids,
and informed hundreds of thousands of people
who have subscribed to his programming
across social media platforms.
His absence has left a painful silence and coverage
and for his family, and comes at a time when risks facing journalists in the United States
continue to build.
While we gathered here today in the Georgia State House, this case has resonance far beyond
the state capital.
Guvara's ongoing detention sends a clear, chilling message to reporters, especially those
in this country who are not U.S. citizens, that they too could very well find themselves
at risk in the same way Mario has.
that can happen to Guevara, a respected journalist,
again, who legally resides here and has been
for the past 20 years, who could be next.
Is vital that Guevara be released without delay?
Thank you.
That concludes our formal program.
I just want to thank the committee
to protect journalists and all the groups that are represented
here today along with my colleagues from the House
and the Senate who have shown support political will
at the state level to protect against this type of abuse
in the future.
At this time, we will be open to any questions
from the media.
Well, I mean, we've been in contact with him often
between me, my law partner, and his family.
And he's doing well.
For those of you that know Mario and most of you do,
you know that he's an incredibly positive person.
He leans on his faith and his family,
and he continues to do that well in detention.
But I think there's certain things that have been shaken
to his core.
He's been shaken to his core because a country that
he continues to love, a country that he continues to believe
in the institutions.
He's having a crisis of conscience, I guess.
He's dealing with that.
And also, he's by himself.
And for another long list of things
that are suspicious and concerning in this case,
is that he's being detained essentially in isolation.
Now, the reason that ICE has cited to us
and to anybody else has asked is for safety.
He is a public figure.
As we all know, there were elements about his personality that were controversial, his
style was controversial.
So I mean, there is a little bit of, it's plausible that that's the reason why they're doing it,
but they're doing it just about everywhere he goes, except one instance where they didn't
and they put him in population.
And that wears on you.
That wears on any individual.
on the actions from the government, from the beginning, the first statement that they
made where they lied about my client's immigration history and they continue to lie even
in pleading that they filed to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
It's an easy assumption to make that they're doing this not only to protect him, but to
also retaliate against him and wear him down.
He's had multiple conversations with ICE officers,
and they feel the need to remind him of multiple occasions
that he's going to be there for a while if he fights his case.
So I've argued asylum cases for 13 years.
People who've been persecuted in their countries,
this is evidence of persecution, plain and simple.
But with all that said, he is still smiling.
He's in good spirits.
And he's in it for the fight.
And so are we.
Well, there are several questions from these questions.
Pardon?
The question, which are the next steps?
I think the next steps are, at the moment, we have two things pending in the short
de la pelación. Tenemos el procedimiento de fianza y tenemos el procedimiento de su
enaféo, verdad, el caso de deportación, el caso de la corte de inmigración, que se
cerró en 2012, a mí que todavía está cerrado administrativamente, pero el gobierno
ya presentó una petición para reabrillo. Nosotros ya presentamos una petición que
lo que queremos es que queremos que trasladen ese caso de la corte de la pelación de nuevo
to the court to appeal its residence, because it is clearly qualified for the residence.
They are putting up a document that they are not in agreement with that, although
it is simple and clearly the law, the law is with us, so for the moment, I think
the part that we are waiting for us, that we are waiting for the family, is that we have
to give to the court of appeal that fortunately the opportunity to decide, we ask
because they raise that state, that congelation,
the order of the West's finance.
We also ask that they determine or that they close
or that they close completely the case of the Appalachian
and that they give the opportunity to pay that finance
that they want.
So, for a moment, I think we have to give
the Appalachian court the opportunity to do the right thing.
But we are collecting evidence.
It is clear from the beginning of the case that the government has behaved in a fair way.
The beginning has increased and it does not matter to you to speak of the truth,
nor to reveal the evidence of my own client.
What surprised me is that the part that surprised me is that they are lawyers who I know,
right?
fiscals that I know for many years and the truth does not matter, they have decided
that they are going to put and they are going to put in a way to complicate the process.
The good thing is that there is a repeat, I think the law is with us, it is with Mario,
Mario clearly caliphates the finance that they gave him, Mario clearly caliphates
the residence and we are going to achieve that, unfortunately they are playing dirty and that
is reality.
La otra cosa que tenemos ya preparado el listo por si acaso es la
posibilidad de una demanda en la corte federal pero cada caso es único y lo que
tenemos que testar seguro es que el caso está listo para eso porque no queremos
presentar algo que que bien rápido pierde ok o desestiminan porque no le
hemos dado a la corte de apelación la oportunidad de tomar esa decisión.
Yeah, so the original question I think was, how's Mario doing?
Mario's doing well.
The interesting thing about Mario, and I don't know if I said this in English, okay,
lo quieres en español?
La primera parte, okay, Mario está bien, los que conocen a Mario saben que Mario se mantiene
positive, constantly. It is a person of faith. He has his family that supports him a lot.
And yes, he is maintaining positive with the same smile, the same person we know.
But yes, this is causing a trauma. This worries him, a country he loves and wants a lot.
He does not know how to feel. He is having a conflict with his conscience.
And I think that any person who suffers from this kind of tension,
for so long, will suffer that.
But in general, all the conversations that we have with him,
he has declared to us and he says that he is ready for the fight
and wants to keep fighting because he knows that he deserves what we are going to win.
So, fortunately, there is no any lawyer who has been estimating you for a long time.
What we have in our favour is the finances, the relations of the finances,
they decide a little bit faster and when there is a ST,
it's really that ampero, that congelation of the order in the West,
those appellations they decide a little bit faster.
The good thing is that we have already presented the petition
to decide everything, and the short appellation sent us
the last legal written order.
But that, for me, shows that I think the short appellation
and want to take a decision.
The problem is impossible to see the amount of time.
The amount of time is something that we will also analyze,
true, in the future decision to present a federal demand.
But we have to give the short of the evaluation
the opportunity to take that decision.
I have a question.
Yes.
mm-hmm.
If they are violating the rights of Mario,
mandating it to Foxton, they are violating the rights of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of immigrants who are detained in Foxton.
Foxton is one of the main detention centers of immigration in the state of Georgia.
We have two of them.
Almost all people who have detained with immigration are going to Atlanta and then to Foxton and to Stewart.
This is not new.
these are very normal, all of our clients and all of our clients are the majority, not all,
because now with the amount of people who are more than 60,000 people in the United States
they are looking for alternatives, right? We know that Mario sent it to Floyd County,
they sent it to the federal prison here in the center, where they extorted it.
Ok, and we had to communicate, and I had to communicate with one of them in charge of ICE, one of the lawyers and within a day I translated it again to a place that at least it felt a little more safe.
Ok, but yes, I think that is something that we have fought for years, right? Why send immigrants to these detention centers?
As you are a folks that this is a decision of the government and every time we ask
you why they send someone to these places because they are some because they are
detention centers of immigration and second they never give us reason they say that
it is for space right and it is a decision logistics of the government the good thing
that if they give us access they give the family the ability of the lawyers to visit it we
We have talked about it with the poor video.
We have visited the family several times.
That's why the access to this experience of Mario,
it is the experience that has had millions and millions and millions of immigrants
that have been detained by ICE.
But it is very common that he is detained in FOXTON
because most of the people who are detained in this region
yehana fokstin oyehana stewardet.
¿Cristia es en el sentido de cienchro de interintedición
hablar aproximadamente?
No.
Yo lo hago por video.
Y las razones con los sucios que ha jugado
el gobierno hasta ahora, OK?
No hay ninguna garantía que si yo llego a ese edificio,
como los representantes, como otras personas,
verdad, que los van a dejar en trállito.
Muchos años atrás, no tantos años atrás,
ganamos un grupo de abogados, ganaron una demanda,
the demand that we were making was to visit VTC for video,
confidential, and the reason is for the access to lawyers,
because the federal court decided that they were not receiving the access,
they were not receiving access to lawyers,
because it was very difficult to travel every day,
six hours to a center of attention in Foxten,
that we have access to these visits for video and that they are confidential because it was part of the agreement in the federal demand.
We can talk to the clients and it is a much more efficient process and we can talk to them more than one hour each visit we have.
Yeah, Zach, I think this week is going to file a motion to recover the cell phone because
Zach has basically been in contact with just about everybody who knows in the Sheriff's
Department and also at the prosecutor's office and everybody saying we don't see a warrant
in the system.
So one of two things happened.
Some other agency that hasn't contacted us took it, US attorneys, I somebody else has
it, or the phone was just playing stolen.
So we are in the process of trying to figure out exactly what happened to this phone.
I think it's par for the course considering the government's conduct from the beginning
of this case.
But we're doing this, at least initially, to see if we can get the phone back.
But again, if they don't give them the phone back, that's another reason to file a lawsuit
in federal court.
We'd be suing ice, but, you know, there's a possibility of adding other defendants to it,
maybe the counties that detained him.
There's a lot of evidence of, you know, circumstantial evidence of all the things that have happened to him,
lying about him from the beginning,
not sending him through the normal route
of routing him through the Atlanta field office,
escorting him directly to his detention centers,
sending him to the federal prison
where he was essentially extorted,
and we had to transform him out.
The fact that in the pleadings,
they also continue to misstate the facts of my client's case,
the fact that they file a stay for someone
who clearly has no criminal history,
and that's the first time we've ever seen that,
especially discretional state like this,
there's mounting evidence.
The problem is the government will always,
they have plausible deniability and say,
hey, the things that we've done up to this point
were allowed to do.
So really the big legal question is,
when is this case right to file the federal lawsuit?
We have partners that we're working with
because we wanna make sure that it's right.
The middle district is not like every other district
in the country, we're not talking about California Seattle.
So we need to be very, very careful and cautious
about how we draft this.
And also, we do feel that we're going
to prevail the Board of Immigration Appeals.
And once he's released, it's going
to be a little bit easier for us to prepare the next level
on this fight against these entities.
Thanks, Lee.
Out of respect for everyone's time,
we're going to be available for some one-on-one interviews
afterwards if there are further questions.
I really want to thank all the press for being here today.
I want to thank everybody who has assembled
in support of Mario Gabara.
This is an important case,
and we need to keep visibility up
to protect our constitutional rights.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
