there we really need to pass today that's the state budget otherwise i believe this state the son arrives over the red hills of north georgia tomorrow and over the coast uh... we will begin our day and let me mention one other thing in the any room today this i'm doing this a little out of turn because we we tend to get busy you have the war some of the world's greatest cupcakes from the sweet shop in blueritz which won the cupcake wars on the food channel and i got the owners over here niki griple and susan k-tron i hope you enjoy those we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country i have the distinct honor and pleasure of introducing the chaplain today he is the gentleman from the sixty-ninth house district chairman of the house ethics committee uh... and my friend chairman randy nicks i have come to uh... love randy nicks and to respect him greatly over the years he started out when i started out in this position i think is uh... education or education appropriations chair or higher education i've got one of the education reapportion but he tells me well so you can tell thirty nine days later i can't remember what committee chaired but he went on to ask him to chair the ethics committee and he could not have done a better job and uh... he loves this house and he loves or he's it's important to him that we said a good example at all times and i greatly appreciate that plus i just enjoy hearing his devotions he's he's had some that have really blessed my heart so without any further ado uh... please welcome to the podium chairman randy nicks for our devotion thank you thank you miss speaker i must say that this is a tremendous honor uh... but it's also very humbling i uh... i did a little math and if i've got this right out of sixteen uh... sessions in forty uh... chaplains of the day that's six hundred and forty chaplains of the day that i've heard and i've heard most of them plus another thirty of forty through special session that pushes me towards close to seven hundred chaplains of the day that i have had the honor to uh... to hear and it has really we've had some great great chaplains of the day uh... and that bar is set extremely high specially uh... by the members of this house uh... who have have been the chaplain of the day now i've been honored and blessed to stand here a number of times and as i stand today i realize it is the last time that i will stand here as a member and a colleague which to me is very very special as i said this is humbling when i come up here i always think about old him talk talks about standing in the need of prayer the old hymns is not my brother not my sister but it's me all over standing in the need of prayer it's not the preacher not the deacon but it's me all or standing in the need of prayer not my father not my mother but it's me all over standing in the need of prayer not the stranger not my neighbor but it's me it's me all over standing in the need of prayer you know i think mrs. speaker you may have given me too much time to prepare i usually do this getting to call it seven thirty in the morning and i kind of planted on the way in but uh... you actually asked me to do this on uh... crossover days so that gave me way too much time to prepare i have been over every sermon that i've ever done i've been over every story i've ever heard every point i've ever read every book i've ever read in every topic that i could think of trying to do that now some people say that the lord speaks to him audibly but the way the lord speaks to me is keeping me awake at night and i have been awake several nights trying to come up with something that i felt would be good uh... to uh... to to share today but today i want to share something that has been uh... a real inspiration to me through the years and i want to offer a challenge to you individually and as a body i think this is a great thought and i want to to leave that with you today i want to tell you about a man by the name of doctor Alexander papaderos and what he calls the meaning of life now doctor papaderos uh... grew up on the aisle of creed he was a young child during war war two and he witnessed the atrocities of the second war war uh... many of them are detailed in some of the writings there but they were he witnessed the worst that you could you could possibly witness his lifetime desire was to establish an institute of human understanding and peace and especially reconciliation between creed and germans he devoted his life to healing the wounds of war and breaking the bonds of hatred and it gets great odds the institute was established and was a source of productive interaction between the two countries papaderos became a living legend as a peacemaker and as an example for others to follow the story that i'm going to give to you was actually written or is is given to us by robberton fuljam in many of you know robberton fuljam as the author of everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten and robberton fuljam attended one of the two week sessions at this institute that doctor papaderos ran and he says that on the last day doctor papaderos came to the front of the room and made that ritual gesture and said are there any questions and there was a period of silence nobody even even though he said that everybody had thousands of questions that had come along enough questions for lifetime nobody said anything and finally robberton fuljam ask this question doctor papaderos what is the meaning of life and he relates to the usual laughter followed and people stirred to go and then fuljam writes he said papaderos held up his hand and still the room and looked at me for a long time asking with his eyes if i was serious and seeing from my eyes that i was i will answer your question he said taking his wallet out of his hip pocket he fished into a leather billfold and brought out a very small round mirror about the size of a quarter and what he said went something like this when i was a small child during the war we were very poor and we lived in a remote village one day on the road i found the broken pieces of a mirror a german motorcycle had been wrecked in that place i tried to find all the pieces and put them together but it was not possible so i kept only the largest piece this one and by scratching in a stone i made it round i began to play with it as a toy and became fascinated by the fact that i could reflect light into dark places where the sun would never shine indeed holds and crevices and dark closets it became a game for me to get light into the most inaccessible places i could find i kept the little mirror and as i went about growing up i would take it out in idle moments and continue the challenge of the game as i became a man i grew to understand that this was not just a child's game but a metaphor of what i might do with my life i came to understand that i am not the light or the source of light but light truth understanding and knowledge is there and it will only shine in many dark places if i reflect it i am a fragment of a mirror whose whole design and shape i do not know nevertheless with what i have i can reflect light into the darkest places of this world into the black places in the hearts of men and change some things in some people perhaps other may see and do likewise this is what i am about this is the meaning of my life i would ask you to pause and think about this for just a moment truth understanding knowledge is there but it will only shine in many dark places if i reflect it if we reflect it with what i have i can reflect light into the dark places of this world into the black places in the hearts of men and change some things in some people perhaps others may see and do likewise you know light is a big part of scripture as we study the New Testament and spreading the light is an important biblical concept if you look at john eight twelve jesus said i am the light of the world whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life so that is our source that's the source of light that we're asked to reflect to stand in his light and reflect that to the world and then in the book of john john one five john is describing jesus and he said the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it and that is our guarantee the darkness is not overcome the light that we can shine the light that is jesus christ and then jesus when he was speaking to his uh... disciples talking about them being salt and light in the world in matthew five sixteen said this let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven what a great charge in a challenge that is for each of us i would ask you to just imagine what would happen if each of us as leaders of this state committed ourselves to reflecting the light of christ into the world around us with that as the meaning and purpose of our lives we can truly change the world now there's a great little song written in the early twentyth century by harry dixon lows supposedly this chart this was written for children but it became one of the anthems for the civil rights movement of the fifties and sixties it is a song of commitment unity and hope now mr. speaker since i can't sing i'm going to ask my brother on the back road to help me out with this do you please help me brother this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine help me this time jesus gave it to me jesus gave it to me come on, put your hands together i'm gonna let it shine there you go, come on Jesus gave it to me. I'm gonna let it shine. Y'all can stand if you want some more. Jesus gave it to me. I'm gonna let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. I got a special verse for you. Glitter it for me. All day, sunny day. I'm gonna let it shine. Oh, all day, sunny day. I'm gonna let it shine. All day, sunny day. I'm gonna let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Everybody, one more time, everywhere I go. Everywhere I go. I'm on here, y'all. Come on. I'm gonna let it shine. Oh, yeah. Everywhere I go. I'm gonna let it shine. Everywhere, everywhere I go. I'm gonna let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. APPLAUSE Thank you, brother. I hope if I get a chance, a second chance of life, I'll be able to sing, but I want to thank my brother for that. Let's stand down. Let's have prayer in our pledge. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord causes face to shine upon you and be merciful to you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. And I just pray now, Father, that you would help us to stand firm in your light and to shine that light into the lives of the people that are all around us every day for I make this prayer in Jesus' name. Amen. Please join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, individual, with liberty and justice for all. You don't expect ordinarium when I come to the cathedral? No, I don't. I sure don't. I wanted him to come up and get a picture of himself. Absolutely. I started. Great job, bro. Thank you all. He's good to get out of this. I thought I would. I can't say I still support the flag because I do. Members may greet Chairman Nicks and representative Sharper in the South of America. This is going to be a bittersweet day. We're saying goodbye to a lot of great, great members. Chairman Nicks just indicated his last time to stand in this house and speak. This is the chair's last time to recognize Chairman Don Hogan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, there were three men traveling late at night, a Jewish rabbi, a Hindu, holy man, and a lawyer. They broke down, saw a farmhouse, and asked the farmer if he could put them up. He said, yes, I put two of you up in the house. One has to sleep in the barn. The rabbi said he would sleep in the barn shortly and knock at the door. And the rabbi said he couldn't sleep with the pig in the barn. And the holy man said he would sleep in the barn shortly and knock at the door. And the holy man said he couldn't sleep in the barn with a cow. So then the lawyer said, I go sleep and he went down to sleep in the barn for a while and then knock at the door and the cow and pig were at the door.

That would be what, 30 seconds per member? I'm just going to kind of hit the high spots on the purpose of the morning order. And I know that somebody is going to disagree, but that's just kind of the way it is. Chair recognizes Chairman Eddie Lumsden for a morning order. Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Early yesterday morning, shortly after midnight, I had the privilege of being by my mother's bedside, 96 years of age. I watched her struggle to take her last breath here on this earth. But my heart rejoiced because I knew she was about to be through with that suffering. And I knew that she would be reunited with those that had gone on before that she loves so much and to see her savior. But as I said, they're thinking about her, reflecting on the fact that born a sharecropper's daughter and the eighth of eight children brought up during the midst of the Great Depression, becoming of age during the middle of World War II, marrying a veteran, raising three children who had grandchildren and great-grandchildren and even lived to see a great-great-grandchild. I just thought about the legacy that she was leaving behind, not only through her children, but you see, my mom, when I graduated from high school, went to work at Floyd Medical Center and she worked for 40 years. She worked until she was 84 years of age. She greeted people as they came in with a smile. She answered their questions and she helped them get the help that they needed, often meeting people in some of the most difficult times in their lives. And she did it in such a way with grace and dignity that, as she has passed, I'm just blown away by the number of people that have reached out and shared stories about things that she did for them during a difficult time in their lives. So I think I would just like to honor her in that way, but I'd like to challenge you as well, because I think that's really what we do here. I think we listen to people who have problems. I think we try our best to steer them in the direction that they need to go and get them the help that they need and do it with smile, with grace and dignity. Take a moment and remember my mother, Ruby, Lomiston, Cornette, 96 years of age. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Stacy Evans for a morning order. She waves. Chair recognizes Representative Josh Bonner for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise this morning just to wish my lovely, broad Michelle a happy 24th wedding anniversary. It is my pleasure to spend that time here with you today. And I appreciate that when she shows up later this afternoon that you would help me convince her that this is, in fact, signing die the last day. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Chair recognizes Representative Kendrick for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll make this quick. Today is a special day here in the state of Georgia. Today is the 41st wedding anniversary of my sore and our colleague, Representative Carolin who, usually in today, she chose to spend the day with all of us. So help me in wishing her a very happy 41st wedding anniversary. Thank you for being here. Chair recognizes Representative Spencer Fry for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I come to you today, let you know about this book that I put on your desk and I want everybody to read it with an open mind. I wrote the forward to it. This is something that occurred in Athens about 70 years ago and it's a little piece of history that I think is important for this body to recognize. So thank you all. Have a great day. Chair recognizes Representative Rick Williams for a brief warning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank you and your staff. All the honorable ladies and gentlemen of this chamber. These last six years has been the experience of a lifetime and I thank you so very, very much and I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Drenner for a morning order.

Thank you, Renita Shannon. Thank you, B. Wynn. Thank you, Mike Walinsky. Thank you, Suma Lopez. All of you have done such an excellent job and we look forward to you doing it, continuing to do great things along the way. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Jasper from a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. A lot of us, all of us have some type of railroad tracks in our community and known and seen the dangers surrounding tracks. Mr. Chairman, we'd like to recognize Operation Life Saver. This is a national nonprofit organization that's committed to rail safety. It's their 50th anniversary. We're very special in Georgia. We started just two years afterwards and there was a lady, Ms. Janine Glass-Gal, who has been the volunteer running this for years and years. We really want to recognize her in Operation Life Saver as it saves many lives across her railroad tracks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Bees Moore from a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So we know today is a happy day because the signy died, but it's also a sad day. And I asked that the Dean of the House come up, Dean Calvin Smarrie. We have a plat for you and this is from some of your, your seat, your roadmates. And that's your favorite color. So the last thing I have for you though, I understand you like puzzles. So I just wanted you to know that you still have the chamber with you. I wouldn't take it apart because we're all together, but when you leave, take it apart and then put it back together. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Warcazler. He waves. Chair recognizes Representative Benton. There he is. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and honor of Southern and Confederate Heritage Month. I wanted to talk just a minute about the musicians that have made Georgia famous. Just a few of the hundreds that have come through Georgia or were born in Georgia. The almond brothers ban from Macon. They started what was called the Macon Georgia Sound. Bill Anderson, who is considered to be the greatest all-time country music. Songwriter, one of his most famous was city lights, which he composed on the roof of the Andrew Jackson Hotel in Commerce. James Brown, career almost got sidetracked by getting started because of conviction for car theft and breaking and entering. Put him in an alto for three years, but two of his most famous hits were Papa's Got a Brand New Band and I feel good. Fiddling John Carson from up around the speakers neck of the woods, Fannie Caini. His music was first to what we know today. His country music and his daughter, Rosalie, also known as Moon Shine Cape, were the first stars. Ray Charles, born Ray Charles Robinson in Albany, was blinded by a glaucoma when he was six. His mother insisted that he learned to do everything a sited child would do. She said that he was blind, not stupid. Not last name to avoid confusion with Sugar Ray Robinson, a series of hits, but the one performed the most was George on my mind, which was made the state song in 1979. And finally Richard Peerman, better known as Little Richard, the king of rock and roll for making famous for songs, Tutti Frudy, Long Tile Sally, Lucille, and Good Golly Miss Molly. Mr. Speaker. We still got lots of people. Representative Mary Francis Williams, can you do yours in about 30 seconds? Seriously, we're already past eight minutes. We've got a long, long day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to take a few minutes, but I'll take 30 seconds to just say how much I admire and respect Martha Wigden, head of the House Budget Office and Budget Chairman Terry England. They're both really hardworking, terrific people. I wanted to say that Chairman England is one of the hardest-working legislators I've ever encountered. He and the late Senator Jack Hill have always had that in common. And Chairman England is also such a kind and humble man, regardless of the power and influence of his position, which is huge. Because of the way he is in and around the Capitol and on the House floor, you'd never know that he is one of the most powerful legislators in the building. What I really want to say that Chairman England, in my opinion, thinks in terms of people and not party, and I hope he's forgiven me for running as a Democrat. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right, that's it for morning orders today. What purpose does Chairman Jay Collins rise to make a motion? State your motion to bring Senate Bill 183 off of the table and recommit to the Rules Committee. Chairman. Chairman Collins has moved that Senate Bill 183 be taken off the table and recommitted to the Rules Committee. Clerk will read the caption. Senate Bill 183 be entitled an act to amend Article 16 and Title 15 in the fiscal code of Georgia annotated relating to general provisions regarding sheriff's supposed to revise qualification requirements for the office's sheriff. Is there any objection to the gentleman's motion? Chair here is done and it is off the table and on its way back to Rules. Senate Bill 183. All right, we're going to do, go to the Rules calendar for a little bit. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 84. Senate Bill 184, Senator Alvers, 56 Harper, the seventh and others to be entitled an act to amend Chapter 17 and Title 47 in the fiscal code of Georgia annotated relating to peace officers, annuity and benefit fund. So it provides a certain communication officer shall be eligible. Remember, ship and such on this bill. We'll sign to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security and then to retirement that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Camp to present the bill. Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Thank you and thank you, colleagues. It's pretty exciting to be the first person on the Rules calendar on Sunny Die, right? So we're kicking it off. This bill SB 84 is a bill that is kind of important to me because it talks about communications officers. When we call 911, we have the belief that there's going to be a qualified individual on the other end of the phone that's going to help us get the help we need, right? So this bill is great because this is one important link in the chain of public safety that really had not been addressed. This bill will allow them those communications officers who are in compliance with Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council. They can become a member of the Peace Officers' Anuity Benefit Fund. And at that point, if they wish, they can become a member where they pay into that fund $25 monthly and can be part of their pension fund. This bill does not have any physical impact as far as it goes on this legislature because it's 0.75% of the money that comes on your phone bill every month. That $1.50 is what we'll be funding this. I ask for your favorable consideration. And you have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 84. The eyes are 161. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 505. Senator Roberts of the 29th and Mulles of the 53rd, no, this is being taught on an act to amend Code Section 35, 823, 383, 181, and 465, 138.2. The district of Georgia and Tate are relating to basic training courses for communications officers. This bill I have referred to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. It recognizes chairman Gaines to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I am proud to present Senate Bill 505, which requires new 911 operators to be trained in T CPR, which allows them to provide CPR over the phone. This measure is particularly important to me this fall. My dad had a heart attack and it was a massive heart attack. He was at the hospital when he had that heart attack and was able to get in the cath lab within 15 minutes. He was blessed. He is a doctor and Athens and was able to get there. But if it had been three hours later and he had been in the car, he was supposed to be in the car on the way to a wedding and a rural area, he probably would not be with us today. And so we were very lucky. But I think that's the importance of a bill like this to make sure that if you call 911 that they are able to train, they are able to administer CPR over the phone and life-saving situations. And so that's what this bill does. I saw an article on 11 alive that said that hairstylists in the state of Georgia are required to get 37 times more continuing education than our 911 operators. And so this bill is going to be lifesaving. Many of the larger counties already have this. This is for new 911 operators. I really believe this is going to be a lifesaving measure. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. Looks like you do have a question. How are you? Chair recognizes representative Wolenski. Thank you, Steve. To your left for a question. Thank you, Spear. Does the representative view? I will. It may be in another code of session or in this section. But does it limit the liability of those 911 operators if they're helping something that he and the person doesn't live? Mr. Chair, I understand as they already have that. It's not related to this bill, but yes, Mr. Chair, I do already have that. Great. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will and ask for the body's favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 505, the eyes are 164. The nasa 1, this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 277. Senate Bill 277, my Senator Mulls, 53rd Harper, the 7th and others being titled an act to amend part 3 of Article 4, Chapter 11, the Title 16. The fish go to Georgia, and they're going to carry possession of firearms. Those extend the exemptions from weapon carry laws to certain court officials to include carrying inside of a courthouse. This bill I'm referring to committee in public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Crow to present the bill. All right, Senate Bill 277 will be taken up later today. Later today. Chair clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 516. Senate Bill 516 by Senator Roberts and 29th Mulls, 53rd and others being titled an act to amend part 1 of Article 2, Chapter 8 of Title 12. The fish go to Georgia, and they're going to be general provisions of solid waste management to bill them for the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Butler to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is now a combination of two bills in section 1.

Point two, it is the bill that we passed out of here on the 15th of March with a vote of 165 to 0 that would Dedicate the hazardous waste fees that are collected to the hazardous waste trust fund so they could be used to clean up hazardous waste sites across the state The new part are the other part of the bill that does have some changes is in section 2.2 It is Senate bill 516 and it is different from the original version in that the Scrapped tire fees will be collected by the retailer and then they will be collected by the Department of Revenue At the time that sales tax is remitted to the Department of Revenue That's what the bill does and if there are any questions I would yield for them at this time You have no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute the chair here is none? The Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now Pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines Have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate bill 516 the eyes are 169 the nays are zero this bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Clerk will read the caption to house resolution 1103 House resolution 1103 by represent Newton the 123rd and others a resolution urging the Biden administration to remove its veto and re-approved George's Medicaid expansion waiver this bill ever heard this resolution have been referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services that committee recommends that this resolution Be adopted Chair recognizes chairman Newton to present the resolution Thank you, mr. Speaker. I know we have lots of important legislation to pass. I kind of want to give you a brief What where and why why we would pass a resolution as we all know Since legislation was passed and signed in 2014 only the legislature can expand Medicaid in Georgia only the legislature Can expand Medicaid in Georgia. I want to thank this house for passing on March 26 2019 With bipartisan support SB 106 the patient's first act which expanded medical Medicaid assistance for the first time to some of the neediest of Georgians to able-bodied adults under the poverty level along with elements designed to help them have a pathway out of poverty So legislation was signed by the governor the next day March 27th 2019 Following which his team initiated the waiver approval process with the federal health and human services department Resulting in it being approved in October of 2020 Unfortunately in February of 2021 just before implementation this approval was vetoed by the new administration in the district of Columbia Tens of thousands of the neediest of Georgians would be receiving medical assistance from their federal citizens today Assistance with both physical health care and mental health care But for this veto This resolution simply respectfully request that the Biden administration Remove it to the toe and allow Georgia's responsible and efficient Medicaid expansion that's already been passed to proceed Next the where this resolution and it was a good question asking in rules today about where do these go this This resolution will go to the administration along with the Department of Health and Human Services to Secretary Basera But in addition it'll go to each of our senators and all our congressmen and women to ask us them to get behind This and finally the why probably most important because the Department of Community Health here in Georgia has confirmed that with removal of the veto and Reapproval Medicaid medical and mental health care Medical and mental health care could be provided for these neediest of Georgians in just eight weeks and just eight weeks Not next year sometime not a year or two in the future when we all have legislation we might want to pass to change things I hope we can all come together and get this care to Georgians by June of this year by urging you to support HR 1103 be glad to answer any questions, Mr. Speaker You have a lot of questions I'll take one we're busy day you search chair recognizes Representative Dale wasper to your left for a question Yes, sir, thank you, mr. Speaker with the gentleman you I will is it not true to the president would remove this veto That many many poor Georgians would benefit from it almost immediately and that also our rural hospitals would benefit from this as well Well, there's two steps to that. Yes kind of two questions. I'm not naive enough to think that Telling a hospital every time they spend the dollar Medicaid will give him 83 cents is necessarily the best way to get out of Challenges in our rural areas. I'm not sure I agree on that But I will say that by getting confirmation that in mid-June of this year Georgians across people across Georgia the neediest under the poverty level could be getting assistance With you know when they get out of prison like we heard about our mental health challenges in prison when they're finally on medication and Maybe all substances, but maybe all they can do is volunteer Maybe they aren't eligible to get a job I think about the fact that they could be getting assistance by June of this year And not sometime next year or in the future. I hope that's enough that we can all come together again in a bipartisan way and pass this resolution Thank you for the clarification and answer I yield the will Gentlemen is yielded the well Chair recognizes representative Wilson to speak to the resolution Thank you, Mr. Speaker Colleagues we passed the governor's waiver request at the very beginning of his administration you'll remember that and I along with a lot of my colleagues oppose that measure for for two reasons The first one was clear because when we ran the numbers It was crystal clear Governor Kemp's waiver would cost more To cover fewer people than if we just fully expanded Medicaid it just didn't make economic sense The second reason Was because of the work requirements We knew that they would be added to Medicaid eligibility under this waiver plan and that it would mean denying eligibility for Georgians too sick or unable to work Considering that the intent of the Medicaid program is to expand access to health care and not restrict access work requirements Also didn't make sense but more than that We knew That when the governor presented his waiver request That we're going to include work requirements We knew that the work requirements at the time had been ruled Unconstitutional by multiple federal courts And we're bound to be struck down So it wasn't economically prudent It didn't make moral sense, but it also didn't make any sense for efficiency reasons So why are we here today with this urging resolution? Why are we here on this measure? I'll tell you why we're here Because time is up for this governor It's the last day of the last session for this governor Since we passed his bill to let him get started on this waiver over three years ago Not a single Georgian has benefited from any of its promised benefits and yet you want to blame President Biden? He didn't make our governor include these unconstitutional requirements in the original request in fact I'll tell you in fact President Biden passed the American Rescue Plan Which is funding all of our pay raises and tax cuts this year He even included enough financial incentives for full Medicaid expansion That it would be fully paid for for two years Georgia would net $700 million and create 64,000 jobs Right here in Georgia More jobs I will I will tell you more jobs created then people The governor's waiver plan would have gotten on Medicaid So what are we doing here? This resolution is passing the buck yet again and insulting the intelligence of Georgians Ask you to vote to oppose it and I'll yield for any questions Mr. Speaker You have a question if you care to yield I yield Chair recognizes chairman Hawkins to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Does young on the yield I do very compelling speech, but isn't true That those that are aged and disabled in this state are recovered now the ABD Medicaid roles we presently have Isn't that true? Can you say that again sir that the people that are aged and sick are already covered under ABD age plan disabled presently on Medicaid in this state Isn't that true? The question with this resolution those are we going to cover more people in Georgia and as policy makers We've got to decide what makes the most prudent sense based on Fiscal conservatism right Making sure that we're covering the most Georgians as Efficiently as possible this gentleman yield I'll yield for one more. Thank you Didn't you say though that we had to cover full Medicaid coverage to cover those age blind to disabled? Didn't I hear you say that I don't believe I said that you did thank you, okay Mr. Speaker I know there are some other speakers that want to speak you have a number of other questions, but it's up to you I'll yield the well gentlemen as yielded the well chair recognizes Representative Bowie to speak to the resolution Thank you, Mr. Speaker now I was not going to be coming to the well But when I saw this resolution I was just appalled That we on day 40 are addressing a political football for The governor of this state The governor of this state is utilizing this bill or this urgent resolution to basically say that it is The fall of the Democratic president of these United States that he Backed in 2018 or 2019 his first session did not do what the Democrats told him to do We said Democrats in this house said if you pass this waiver Under the 138 Poverty poverty rate at the federal level. It's gonna fail We told you all this and it did fail So why are we here now said oh I can't believe President Biden did this let me just read this for you I want to get right to the point Back in June of 2019 the Trump administration rejected Utah's request for partial Medicaid expansion Wow That was a Republican governor in Utah a Republican General Assembly and Deathing happy So Democrats say that hey if you do go down this route The Trump administration is going to reject your waiver But Trump is not at office so Biden did basically say they Trump did it say if you're not gonna go up to the 138 Poverty level. It's not gonna cut it and Democrats in this house told you that the best you could do under the waiver of Brian Kemp It's 80,000 people won't be covered But if you fully spam Medicaid you'll be up to least 500,000 or 600,000 I mean is it me or does the math not add up? So Republicans I dare you come to this well and Chastas my President Biden who wants to do the right thing by the citizens of not all the state of Georgia But of these United States of America you failed and now you want to blame someone else governor Kim All up to what you did you knew you weren't gonna get it done in 2019 and now you want to put it on the back of my President no sir no way It's spam Medicaid to date and do the right thing and take care of Georgia It's stop trying to hide behind your office on the second floor if you want to run run But why don't you reckon and not on ours? I'll leave the way You We have one other member that wish to be heard Chair recognizes the speaker pro-tem of the house to speak to the resolution Well, thank you mr. Speaker I just want to say lady will suspend We're not at a rally Okay Lady may continue. Thank you mr. Speaker first let me point out I am not running stay wide I'm running for reelection as a state representative so my comments will be spoken from that perspective as a state representative Georgia is a very generous state when it comes to a safety net One first of all one point almost two million Georgians are on Medicare so they're taking care of with regards to their health care More than chimney in Georgians are on Medicaid and peach care partially funded by state taxpayers that includes 80% of all Georgians living in a nursing home and it pays for 50% of all births I call that very generous And I heard about Economic sense it doesn't make economic sense not to expand Charitable charitable health care, which is what Medicaid is Well, you know, that's true if your definition of economics means the government printing more money Georgia while other states that have expanded Charitable health care also called Medicaid Have been rolling back their reimbursement rates to Providers because you know, there's only so much money Georgia has a record since the expansion of Medicaid of increasing its provider rates Which has increased the number of providers that accept Medicaid and we've also expanded the services to Potential Medicaid patients to take care of the least of the least of ours including pregnant mothers and other such services HIV patients and different including this this year I heard about fiscal conservativism Fiscal conservativism doesn't mean Necessarily providing more charitable health care to able-bodied persons Fiscal conservativism means a safety net to the least among us not a hammock. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well That's completes all the members who wish to speak Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? chair here's none The report of the committee is agreed to shall this resolution now be adopted all those in favor of the adoption of the resolution Will vote aye those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines What purpose is representative of Nolo which rise? Parliamentary inquiry stay true inquiry. Thank you. Is it not true that the work requirement in the governor's exemption application Makes no exemptions for full-time caregivers and is it not further true that if we learned one thing from the pandemic It's that caregiving obligations are a big factor in keeping able-bodied workers out of the workplace If the lady so states, I'm sure she believes that what purpose does representative lot rise Parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry Mr. Speaker is it not true that those individuals in Georgia above 100% of the federal poverty line qualify for insurance on the private marketplace rather than flooding the currently over Run Medicaid system that we have with few providers and that between the 101 150% of the federal poverty line While on private individual marketplace insurance the cost to the To the patient would be zero dollars The lady so states I'm sure she believes that to be true what purpose does the Leader of the minority caucus leader Beverly rise Parliamentary inquiry is it not true to the sovereign monetary policy of the United States require that we print Money to cover the debt ceiling we accrue as a result of serving the people of these great United States Well, I hope they're printing a lot of money because we sure are going in dead a lot of money, so But I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. All right. What purpose does Chairman Todd Jones rise He waves well purpose does chairman carpenter rise Parliamentary inquiry is it not true that believing in consistent federal funding for Medicaid is like trusting a local drug dealer not to short the product The gentleman so states I'm sure that's the way he understands it to be true Have all members voted have all members voted if So the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of house resolution 1103 the eyes are 97 the nays are 73 this house has this Resolution having received the requisite Constitutional majority is therefore adopted What purpose does the chairman of the rules committee rise To make a motion state your motion mr.

Let's vote them separately Clearly Clerk will read the caption to Senate resolution 504 Senate resolution 504 by senator Mulles of the 53rd hatch to the 50th and others recognizing the significant role that Native American tribes have played in Georgia and dedicating a tree in the state capital grounds and their honor On the motion of the rules chairman that Senate resolution 504 be Recommitted to rules all those is there any objection to the gentleman's motion There is objection all those in favor of recommitting SR 504 to the rules committee will vote aye those approves to recommitting will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines If all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on On the gentleman's motion that SR 504 be recommitted to rules the eyes are 100 the nays are 67 and that bill is on its way back to the rules committee Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 364 Senate bill 364 of title 46 the fish go to Georgia and Tate relaying the general provisions relative to telephone services On the motion by the rules chairman that Senate bill 364 be recommitted to the rules calendar or back to the rules committee Is there any objection? Chair here's none and that one is on its way back to rules This House will come to order chair is going to ask all members of the house to please take a seat Before the chair introduces the next member chair recognizes the minority caucus leader leader Beverly to speak to the next special order leader Beverly famous speaker If you see a turtle on offense post I won't you know he has she did not get there one on and I believe that to be true for about 78 years said beside the dean and About three years ago I saw a turtle climbing offense If for a brief moment in time that turtle was sitting on top of offense post, but I watched him until he jumped off and felt well He actually fell on the other side And I was like maybe a turtle did climb offense post maybe wouldn't put the on his home But what I learned from that is that what representative Smiley did Dean has showed me is that everyone has a perspective Everyone has a perspective He has Giving me a grace and our caucus the grace To accept whatever defects I have Whatever defects we have we own them And what of accomplishments that we will achieve in this life They belong to gods alone He has a perspective to go down to Brunswick When the mod Arbery was murdered He had the perspective to teach us how to go through reapportionment with a heads up Even though local control seem to disappear right in front of us He has a perspective to vote on the budget. I think there's only one That he's never voted for and I think I had something to do with that And I apologize because he's like house first you second We have been in negotiations at a Nazim Around sports betting medical marijuana hate crimes the budget on and on and on and on and the one thing that he's always given me Is perspective And he's done that for all of us So if you see a turtle On offense post You know that he or she did not get there alone And Dean Smiley has allowed us all to sit on offense post from time to time I'm gonna miss you my dear brother. Thank you. Let me speak our yield to well You There come those times That you don't really look forward to And I've cried about today.

Since I came into this position, I cannot remember. I tried to remember now for a few weeks a significant issue that Dean Smyrie has not been there to be a rocked olenon, a source of wisdom. We can't tell all the times we've talked, I guess, to we write our books, right? But so many times, saving hope, the transportation funding reform bill, criminal justice reform, hate crimes, citizens arrest, and expansion of gaming. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. I don't have the words to say how much he has meant. But he always did it in a spirit of trying to find a consensus, and he always did it with civility. Many, many times he has been the calming influence on the waters when the storms were kind of raging around us. I thought of today and I thought of the passage from Matthew. Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of God. It's my honor at this time to recognize for a special order, a special child of God, Dean Calvin Smyrie. All right. Oh boy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your kind comments and your kind remarks. And I appreciate that. I appreciate your friendship, your leadership. And so they has been one that kind of dreaded.

For the past 45, 48 years, the citizens of Columbus have allowed me to represent them in this house, Chamber of Georgia House of Representatives. What an honor and joy it has been for me. I thought qualifying week was going to be rough, but this is a toughest moment. I had not planned on going down the room to 30 on qualifying, but I went with Representative Carolyn Huglem to see her qualify and it made my day go better. Today is more difficult because after 48 years of serving in this Chamber, I will not be returning. I will do this hall of Chamber for another legislative session. I am honored that my family members are here and my father is 96 years old. Father Smiley. Can't wait for the procedure. PJ, thank you for being here. I appreciate this very much.

Thank you for being here, Francine. My two grandchildren, you know I lost my daughter in December last year and I want them to be here, Javane and Morgan. So we all give them a round of applause. Thank you. Thank you very much. How did my journey and story start? In 1966, I graduated from Franklin American High School in Franklin, Germany. My grandfather and father both were career military veterans. My grandfather was a master sergeant in the 24th regiment and my father was a helicopter pilot and retired as a chief warrant officer. I'm proud of my father because he was a mechanic in the United States Army and he worked on helicopters. He got out of the army, went to office training school and became a pilot and flew helicopters for the United States Army. The military was not for me. When I was in Germany, my father, when I was growing up, I used to dress me in army uniforms all the time. You know, and I said, Dad, I don't want to be in army. And he said, you going into the army boy, you go about your business. So I was born and he worked away from me to go to Morgan State to ROTC school. So we said the application and said, one to Tuskegee and then you said one to Clark. And of course in Germany, we got back and neither school had received my SAT nothing from either school and that's the mail for you, you know, Germany. And so a friend of mine, a friend of my father's lived down the street, Dr. Robert III, who went on to became, I was, you know, President of Mars Brown College. So we went down to his house and he said, let's take him down to Fort Valley. And that's where I'm in Fort Valley and Fort Valley changed my life. And I owe a lot to Fort Valley State University. And all of you all know how much I love Fort Valley. Right. I'm in England. I love Fort Valley State University. And I didn't do well. I, well, you go to school to study and I kind of got a little wavered. And so I was in my last semester. I was taking a three hour course and a five hour course. I was in the physical science and as far as the physical science and I asked Dr. Steele, as far as he said, well, you got to be plus. I don't know what your problem is. So I went up to this business school. My major was a business with my own economics. And my instructor said, sit down for just a minute. She said, you know what? I met a lot of people. But you got it. You just got it. She just don't know what to do with it. You got it. But maybe doing some school, you'll find yourself. I said, you don't know my mother and father. And I'm pleased to do that. I'm a first married graduate. Don't do that to me. And the football player came by with the minister and our Reverend Dawson. We went in that together and we both got crying. And she would change it. So I went to some school and then realized that the course was not going to be offered in Fort Valley. It was going to be offered at University of Wisconsin. I said, oh my lord, how am I going to get up there? And so you can take a correspondent. And I thought, young people now, you can take anything but only in and there. But back then, it was a career. So I cured my lesson back in Fort and took the course and made a B-plus through the mail. I could have made a A in the classroom. So one summer, I was in the library. And I ran across a poem called The Guy in the Glass. If you read the AJC's paper, they might have did a profile on me. And that was the nucleus of the story. And that poem changed my life. The states, I'm going to do a short version of it. When you get what you want and you struggle for self and the world makes you king for a day, then go to a mirror and look at yourself and see what that guy has to say. You may be like Jack Holland, Chilson, the plumber, thank you, a wonderful guy. But the man in the glass says, you're only a bum if you can't look at straightening the eye. You can fool the whole world down to pathway of years and get packed on the back of your past. But your final reward would be harder to get to you as if you cheat the guy in the glass. I told myself there never ever would I cheat myself. If I said I'm going to be a doctor, I'm going to be a good doctor. I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a good lawyer, I'm a teacher, I'm going to teach school. But if I be a street sweeper, I'm going to sweep streets good. And that changed my projector, that changed my life. And I came home to Columbus and no jobs, of course you're finishing December. But I started all of a sudden called life, you're familiar with it. Leaders of the day and tomorrow and I found the 20th, 20 brightest young people like a fan, 20th, 23rd, 24th, 25th of your age. And we met with all the leaders of tomorrow, we met with all the leaders of today. And my father knew a lot of them. One of them was the vice-American Columbus and he, AJ McClellan, he mentioned me for many, many years. And so we met and we met and we met and eventually I was appointed to the medical center board of trustees, the first African-American, taking the place of a gentleman who had retired. And thereafter, I still look at my jobs, I'm going to have to leave it, I mean leave Columbus and move to Atlanta, get a job. So AJ and George Ford told me, this is my first test of politics, meet us at the Labor Department. I said, what's going on? And said, we're going to get you a job down there. So we met the Labor Department, went in and then they'll forget it. Dorothy Bass, Dorothy Bass looked at them and said, we don't have any opening, we'll take his application and then some clones say get commissioned to say I'm called well on the phone. So what, you want me to call the commissioner? And he said, yeah, call the commission. And so the commissioner asked the phone and said, hey, AJ and George, how you doing? And said, we got a young man down here in Columbus. We're going to get an involved in politics, but he needs a job to stay here. Well, how the hell do we get all the men to work that out? So you got a Bible in the room? And I'm just sitting there as a young 23 year old, not knowing what the heck is going on. And he said, young man, put your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand. He said, do you swallow this weather to keep the whole laws of state of joints for helping me God? I said, I do. He said, welcome to the Labor Department. And I said, what about the state merit exam? He's a son, you're in the politics right now. I don't ask so many questions. That was a Friday. He said, go to work on Monday. And I went to work on Monday and went to work for the Labor Department and stayed there for about six, eight months. And then went to work for GMAC and ultimately to Sonovas. And during that time, we were meeting in Alba Thompson. He was a chairman of special judiciary here in this house. And he was talking to us. Our group was meeting with him. He said, one of y'all called a run for the state legislature. And I said, no, we're not getting into politics. I saw what politics is all about. I got my job. We're not going to do that. We're going to community and public service. And so we left his office and my mentor, AJ McClellan called me to his house. We lived in the subdivision out of county. He lived in the subdivision call from us. And he said, you know what, you're the run. And I said, let me think about it. He said, no, no, you're the run. In fact, you're going to run. And of course, the vice-members Columbia Joy was talking to me. And so I did run and it changed my life. And I had a great group of people to help me. And there were five of us in the race. And I won without a runoff. I was just blowing them back. But it reminds me of that quote, plant seeds to trees for the shade you may never see. And that's what we did. We planted seeds to a tree for the shade we may never see. And I said then that I was going to come up here and do the best I could. And those that helped me along the way. And I almost was coming up here and then one of my opponents filed a suit. And it went all the way to the Supreme Court. And I never forget, because I was staging a Smith Law Frame here at Lawner. The Kegin February was my lawyer and went before the Supreme Court. And I was sworn in prior to it. And the Supreme Court ruled it a moot issue. And then I went on to serve. But my people that helped me along the way, Ben and New Roth, Robert Anderson, Dan Domen, Howard Pelogen, the late Scott Wise, Ben and New Roth and Howard Pelogen. Now, as Karen Hughler will tell you, we can communicate on a daily basis. They're going to call me or text me every day. And some days I don't respond. But it was their idea. And you might want to try this. It said, Smirif for District 92. I had about 2,000 Yars signed out. And then the electionee, they changed the Yars sign to vote Smirif today. That's pretty clever. You got a Yars sign in Yars, Smirif for District 92. And then the next morning, woke up, vote Smirif today. And that went over pretty well. And I appreciate them and the impact that they've had on my life. For the past 48 years, I have worn this name badge as a badge of honor. Over the years, I've had many, many leadership positions entitled, but being called Dean of this House, while it is the least of power, it is the one I admire the most. And I appreciate the speaker. And I'm deeply honored to speak with David Rossman for bestowing that recognition in honor to me. Since elected to this House, I have seen and witnessed a lot. After being elected in 1975, I've had only three opponents in 48 years, two Democrats and one Republican. In fact, at one point, I ran 15 consecutive times without opposition in the Democratic Republic and prior to there, 30 years, which is a long, long time. That's 30 years without opposition. Now that I reflect back, I consider that quite a feat. I have seen and witnessed a lot. Our state has made much progress and we have made positive gains. In 1975, this House was a different place to serve. I've seen great strides in diversity and diversity is hard. Since I was elected in 1974, the age of 24, 27. In my first term, there were only 19 African Americans serving in this body. Today, there are 52. There were only eight women, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, eight women in the House in 75. Today, there are 62 women. Which represent diversity as well as members of the LGBTQ community. By far, better diversity, it makes this House looks like and represents Georgia. Yes, you have added it up in 1975. Now the people's House was made up of 172 men and eight women. I want to recognize that we've come a long way and we ought to be proud of what we are as a state. I want to recognize a few people that have helped this term get up on the fence post. I want that out of home. They told me, don't you ever say that in Columbus ever again, but y'all have just heard it again, those that don't listen. The serving in this House has also allowed me to honor serving with five House speakers. Thomas Murphy, Terry Coleman, Mark Berkhalter, Glenn Richardson, and now speaker David Waston. Terry Coleman, I work well with him and I want to say this, I thank Terry Coleman for keeping me on this Roos chairman. Gentlemen, you get a new speaker, you get a new Roos chairman, and he allowed me to continue on, and he allowed me to continue on as a member of the Budget Conference Committee as well. I appreciate that. When he became speaker, my mentor Tom Buck became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my seatmate. Thomas being Murphy. He was my friend and he had an early impact on my political career. I met him in December 1974 in his office, and you have never been in Tom Murphy's office as it's a treat because it was like a museum in about it being in his serve. He said, West Georgia now, if you ever get that way. But Albert Thompson set up the appointment. He was chairman of the Special Dere, a special Dere's Chair of Committee, and he told me to go to see Murphy made an appointment so I went to him and I walked in and he said, son, what can I do for you? And I said, well, Representative Thompson said I need to come to you about committee assignments. He said, yep, he said, you ride about that now. He said, I make all the appointments. I said, well, let's speak, I'm told that. He said, what do you want to be on? I said, appropriations. He said, what? Appropriation. You're freshmen. So not all of you are not going to appropriation. You won't be in the room who we talking. And he said, what's your next one? I said, ways of me. He's, oh my god, who you've been talking to. He said, you don't, you're a freshman. You don't go in the ways of me. He said, what about your third? I said, banks and banking are help. He's, oh my goodness, son. I don't know who you've been talking to, but freshmen don't get those committees. But he said, I will, I will look at it and get back with you and then I got one of them. And then about after the session started, he put us on the ramen. We were somewhere in a reception. He said, you know what? He said, I want you to stay close to me. I kind of like you. I said, what did I do to my sister? He said, well, you keep your cars close to your chest. He said, a little bird told me that you gave me appropriation. Ways and means as you're one and two. And you gave me banks and banking and health. It's three. But really, the banks and banking and health was your number one. So you kind of tricked the guy. And you gave me the two, you know I'm going to point you. So I kind of got soft and gave you the third. So he said, that's pretty, pretty clever. So that was my first time to speak to meet Tom Merff and have an engagement with him. And after getting appointed to my committee, we first impression, the last impressions. But that started my journey in the house. In four years, which was unheard of back then, he pointed me to Ways and Means, chairman Blackburn, by the third term. Two years later, he pointed me to appropriations committee. And then I told Chairman England, the budget was $4 billion. Well, I have an appropriation. Four billion, now 30. And so he asked me also to join him in Cardiff's film. And he said, what's going on there? He said, we have a little meeting. We're going, we're going to let Joe Frank Harris govern them. I said, Joe Frank sit behind me. He said, yeah, he said, Scott, you're in my, I mean, the whole community in my seat and the fries in Joe Frank and Alexander's in Larry Walker. See it. And so I joined them in Cardiff's film. And Joe Frank Harris was elected governor. And Larry Walker, who was my friend and poetry, asked me to serve as assistant floor leader. Floor, it's a little bit different now days than the walls in 1970, 1981 and 1982. When Larry Walker became floor leader, he selected the two assistant floor leaders, and I was one who was he selected. And so I worked with Larry. And then he became majority leader. And then the governor pointed me floor leader, becoming the first African American in the state. And I went to see Speaker Murphy. And I said, the speaker, I said, the governor, they're going to ask me to serve as floor leader. Oh, you leave him, huh? I said, well, I'm going to still be in the house. But the floor leader, you know, they always fight me. And you know, I said, well, I mean, we're going to work together. I said, can you go along? He said, yep, we're going to be just like one happy marriage. We're going to be all right. The first day we introduced Bill was on transportation. And it was Tom Moeller was a commissioner. And he called me up to, I'm just sick of you. Every time I turn around, you all fighting me. And as I said, I said, don't you think you told me he was going to be one happy married? Well, we about to get a divorce, right? Right here, right now. And so he left me and went on down to the governor's office and came back. I just talked to your boss and told him the same thing. But we had a great relationship. He was a wonderful man. I always tell people, Joe Frank Harris changed the landscape of Atlanta, Georgia. All you got to do is go back and read the history. He changed it. Georgia, we're a congress center. Marda. Georgia, we're a congress center. The dome. I mean, these are things that if you run for, if you're in the rural area, you're in and you were connected. Atlanta, you know, one, no, one no wing and, you know, back then. And but he did it and he stepped fast. And he was very good to me. He and Bill Lee. Bill Lee was the first rules chairman. I was on in Billy Randall and I were on the rules committed together. And the gentleman just came in. Thank you, Representative Lucas. Lucas and I came together in 1966. That was six, I mean, 1975. That was 66 legislators in our class. 66, one third of Jones, Assembly. So thank you, Senator Lucas. I appreciate you and your friendship. Thank you very much for being here. But, but, but the speaker is just here in Billy. We're connected and so we went back and, we were speaking of Ross was comfortable one day. About five or six of us in a Tom Buck. Billy, Terry Coleman and myself because, but speak a lot mean to sit with the conferees for 10 years. When the conferees come from 403, come down this conference, I sat down on the inside and watched them do the budget. It was now on the conference committee, but I sat there for nearly 10 years. So when you found the point of the conference committee, I was very, very prepared. But, but on the room, one day we were sitting back there and Bill Lee came in and said, in 19 nice, I'm getting ready to retire, Mr. Speaker. He said, man, I got to find a rules committee chairman. And we were just sitting in the conferee room and Terry Coleman and Tom Buckson and the speaker, that's your rule chairman right there. He said, who? You see, you mean Calming? I thought I was in good stand with him, but and they said, yeah, he can do the job. That's how I was appointed, rules chairman and speaker, Murphy and I had just a great, great relationship. In fact, at one time, I was on, I was chair of the rules committee, chairman of the Democratic House Caucus, chairman of Democratic Party, and a member of the conference budget committee, all at the same time. Four years of that. And one day I said, let's speak, this is a heavy load. I said, I said, maybe somebody else can do one of these jobs. He said, well, I wake up in the morning, so I don't have to call the two people. And you want them. I said, who's the other one? He said, Terry Coleman, the chairman of the Properation Committee. If you know where the money is, and where the bills are, you have a pretty good day as a speaker.

And so he stayed that way, but he was just a wonderful person and I miss him and I appreciate all the contributions that he made to my career. Speaker David Rauston. First and number one he is my friend. We are from different political parties, but we share a common bond. As you know, a lot of y'all may recall, I was nominated for Speaker as Chairman of Minority Caucus and lost 116 to 58. Now the close race to Speaker Rauston. Loosen the votes in 11 Democrats. I was disappointed, but I understood it. Third of all, it's went by and I forgot they voted against me. But the person you're angry with on Monday, you may need him on Thursday. Hello somebody. The object of this game is 91 and 120. And the way you can shake it up, bake it. That's it. You can't find nine people. Then it's you're talking, but you just kicking the can. You find 90 and you feel it in the can. And I try to be one feel the can. But Speaker Rauston in his address, he stated this and I quote, we are at a point that is both unprecedented and unexpected. As a house and state, we face great challenges that we all know doubt the obstacle thrown in our path. But I truly believe this chamber is filled with good leaders. Public service is both noble and honorable. I also promise a new beginning with the city of Atlanta. Atlanta has a new leader and I promise to work with the city and move all of Georgia forward. I said in my speech and I quote, I don't expect to win today by popular vote. But the mere fact that I am a candidate is a victory for democracy and the minority party. Spalls go to the winner. But whether you win or you lose, politics ought to be about being open and participatory politics and policy. I don't suffer from the illusion of inclusion, but I do expect the decency of participating in this house. No one can break your back unless you bend it. So I intend on standing strong and I will continue to stand for what I believe in and forever forever on the institution of this house which I serve. While we were friends prior to that Monday, January 12, 2010, that day seemed to have made our friendship more of a fixture. We would go forward and for the next 12 years would work on minute transformational issues for our state. The Transportation Act of 2015 tested our relationship. Jay Roberts and Mark Hamilton and I went office and we had to build there in Carolyn Huegel and Al Williams and Stacey Abrams and two or three other walked into my office and C.O.L. being said, we need to talk to you. What's that? We need to not design the transportation bill. I said, excuse me. I said, the speaker most mean to sign that bill and said, if you sign the bill, you will give this signal because of your bandwidth. We need to be able to negotiate and work this together with the Republican with a minority. I went back to see the speaker and told him that I thought our friendship would be torn apart. But he looked at me and I said this to him, I said, do you trust me? I said, do you trust me? It's worse than me. I trust you. I see you sign he died. We worked together both sides of the aisle and we worked of a transportation act. To mean the transportation act is transformational. It is made this state, we used to run transportation on continual resolution from the United States Congress. Now we have money that we continue playing and to me that is a great thing for the state of Georgia. And on the last day of signing he died, he gave me a lot of recognition of being one of the ones that helped pass the transportation bill and I appreciate that. That's why I worked very hard with J. Roberts and Mark Hamilton and transportation committee. I was not on transportation. He didn't know it till last year. I said we got transportation bill coming. I said I'm not on the transportation committee. He said oh my lord, I didn't know that. And Rick Johnson said he's not on this committee. And then the speaker said well I'm putting him on there now. So I've been on transportation for one year. After all of the transit bill and everything else but I'm finally on it. And the permanent transit funding, in fact I called a speaker one day and the speaker said we ought to do something about transit in the state. I said far too long. Transit is a quality of life issue. It affects a lot of people and they live in the hood. And he said well you got a man and I said put $200 million in the budget. He looked at me and he said he said you need to go see the governor. It's about that $200 million. So I went to see the governor. Told the governor the same thing. And I was surprised because speaker was kind of positive about it. And deal looked at me and said we'll do $100 million. I said $200 million. He said no he said $50 million. He went down on me. I said $100 million. He said that's why I was in the first play. I said okay so he put $100 million in the budget. So one morning my phone rang, he was speaker Ross. You need to see the governor. I said what's going on? He said I love him to tell you. It's called the governor and they want to use $25 million for economic development. But we had planned that the $75 million was all we could use through the transit system anyway. So we're able to get $75 million for transfer the first time through bond. And then the speaker said you know what we ought to find a way to fund transit period. And thus 5-11 and Kevin Tanner and those that helped out in that regard. And now we have a bill where transit is funded for the first time. You can't think about that. All these years we never funded transit in the state of Georgia. But thanks to this gentleman behind me, David Rauston, we now fund transit. And thanks to all of you and to me that's a quality of life. The hate crime bill, Bundle Willard, Chuck Estration, Karen Bennett, Megan Hanson. I remember driving to Brunswick and I talked halfway to this gentleman right here, one of my best friends that I have in life, Al Williams. And we talked about it and we drove in different cars. He was on the way. I was on my way. It was in the thick of COVID. I didn't think I was going to go. But I woke up the morning and I got a good of a brother. She had already left. And I drove down there and on the way in Gloria Frazier. Reps in the Frazier call me and she was with the mother of Almond Arbery on the Cooper. And we talked for a few minutes about the situation. And my first call was to speak of David Rauston. I said, we need to do some about citizen red. He said, well, we got a first pass hate crime. And so we did pass hate crimes. And then first thing I did, I called Almond Arbery and mother, Reps in the Hogan. And I told her that I make your promise. We get passed hate crime. We're going to take citizens of the rest next year. And I promise you that. I give you my word. And lo and behold, I see the speaker in. He is in agreement. And we pass the citizens act and citizens of the rest. Thanks to Governor Kemp and Bert Rees and William Bowdeen and many, many others. The Atlanta Output, it was a major issue for me. In the city of Atlanta, we were able to stop that situation. Cannabis, cannabis medical marijuana. When Alan Pete called me, maybe seven, eight years ago, and asked me to sign a bill I told him I wouldn't. I just got my plate full. And then he told me one day to go to a mall just to see. And I saw parents going to cars, by and from the black market, cannabis oil. And by that time, this general right here, Michael Graffley, was taking on the issue. And I want to tell you, that's one of my best joys that I have. It's working with you in passing the medical cannabis bill. That was something that, to me, it was a great deal in seeing these parents and their eyes and what we were doing for their children. It was just something that felt a decent seeing me that to be able to do that. And for that, I'm thankful. I'm thankful for the speaker. And Ross said, it's pointing me to more conference committees than I served as a Democrat. Think about that. Other than the conference budget committee, I was only there for six years. But any other committees, Ross didn't have put me on more conference committees than I served as a Democrat. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the trust and work and relationship into serving on the rules, appropriations, higher ed and transportation. You appointed me to the Jordan World Congress Senate Board, especially committee on access to quality healthcare, especially committee on election integrity, especially committee on access to civil justice system, and the Georgia Freight and the district's infrastructure funding commission. So I appreciate all that you have done and I appreciate our friendship. And I'm looking forward to keeping in touch as a friend, whatever my role leads me to in the near future. Serving in this house also has allowed me to serve with seven governors, four Democrats, three Republican, Georgia Buzzfeed. Because Georgia Buzzfeed was the first governor that could run for re-election. We had one term. Jimmy Connell was our last one term governor in Georgia Buzzfeed was the first governor to be able to run for two terms. And Joe Frank Harris, Zell Miller, Rod Barnes, Sonipi Dool, Nathan Diel and now Governor Brian Kim. Governor Joe Frank Harris, I co-chair his inauguration. We had a great relationship. I would become his floor leader. And he and I and Larry Walker worked together on a lot of issues and working for Governor Harris was a wonderful working experience. I was on the QBE commission to establish the quality of the basic education here in the state of Georgia. It changed our educational system. I worked with him on passing the legislation to create the Georgia dome. I was a flow lead at that time and helped work to build through the house and the Senate. It was a heavy lift and a two-year journey. And at that time the dome cost $200 million. Think about it. One way to look at it now is 1.6 billion. So we built the joke. The Falcons first home was $200 million. That kept the Falcons in Atlanta. And I tell people all the time and I get a lot of criticism for that. But you lose a professional team. You just lose one and see what happens. You just lose a team that has lost one. They know it was just catastrophic for their state. So sometimes we have to make hard decisions. And that was a hard decision creating a dome stadium for Atlanta Falcons. And I took a lot of heat from my Columbus delegation members. Might remember this, but this Georgia is held in Columbus every year. And they were having it at the old Menus, Florida, and it started to rain and it was pretty hard. And a lot of umbrellas, so as the leaders walking on stage they had umbrellas in the holum. And my Lord, that was a bad picture. So one reporter wrote this. I won't say who his name is here. But he said now he can build a dome for the Falcons. But he can't build a civic center for his city. Oh my goodness. That hit home hard. The first call I made was the Tom Buck. And the second call I made was to Frank Martin. And that was in 1992 and 1974. We broke ground for $45 million civic center in Columbus, Georgia. And I was just happy to be at that river. Just say face with the Columbus people. So now we have one. And the last thing I want to thank Governor Harris for. His commitment on the Martin Luther King Jr. birthday and state holiday. But I stayed here today on the birthday. I mean, the assassination of Dr. King. Dr. King was assassinated April 4, 1966, a 54 years ago. So it's our proposal. I never met Dr. King. I met Daddy King one time as well. But I never met Dr. Martin Luther King. In fact, when he was killed, we were summoned to a gym in Fort Valestade University. We had a service there. But when we created the state holiday commission, Secretary of State Max Clealham was the first chair. And I was his vice chair. And he agreed to only serve for one year. And then for 10 years, I chair at the state holiday commission, Dr. King state holiday commission. And I got a chance to work very, very closely with his little Greviscott King. So I will say today that we appreciate the life and legacy of Dr. King. The holiday bill, I got a lot of credit for it. But Jose Williams in Tyrone Brooks, for many years, introduced the bill. And when Joe Frank, when Governor Harris became governor, he asked me to do it. And they signed on. And it was a joyous day that I can always remember. And I'm just so happy 38 years now with your help. We just passed June 10th as a state holiday. And once I went on. I went over to the Senate and they presented me with two resolutions that allowed me to speak to the Senate. And I think the governor Duncan for that on allowed me to do a farewell address in the state Senate on Friday. Another honor to me, that's real difficult for me to describe to you. The last governor I want to mention is Roy Barnes. Roy and Governor Harris had a lunch of for me approximately two weeks ago and invited approximately 12 of senior members back. And we had a great opportunity to chat and to be, to break, break together. And I'm so thankful for that. I was at the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles in 2000. I'm a phone ring and it was Governor Barnes saying that when I get back, we're going to change the state flag. And I didn't think much of it at that time. And we got back, he called me to his office. And I told him that Zeal Miller barely won a reelection. And he didn't try to, but he just mentioned it. And he just said, I want to do it. And that I want to do it. He won by 31,000 votes. I was there. I'm not dead. And I, but I, what a profile, encourage and conviction. And I know forget I was in, I was in, I'm, I was in Millageville and had to get back and got a helicopter to land me on the, the governor's mansion and I walked in. And the governor was in there about 12, 15 CEOs of Georgia. He said, this is the rules chairman here. And we're going to pass the bill out of his committee in the morning. And I said, well, I got to talk to Speaker Murphy about that governor. I mean, we can't just call him. He's, I've already talked to the speaker. He's on board. I said, well, I got to contact my committee. He said, they'll get a memo at 730 AM. And I said, we're going to, that's kind of, kind of, be kind of tough to do. He said, no, we're doing it in the morning. And I went to four or three and I walked in. I was seen at such a bank of, of microphones, over in my political career. And we voted to bill out and, and I commend governor Barnes for taking that action. And I worked with him on so many many issues and, and he was a truly, truly blessed for his friendship. The last one I want to mention is El Mellum. I served in the house with Zeal, I mean, Zeal was governor and, for the lottery. And I wrote with governor Mellum to buy the first lottery ticket. And I thought that was quite an honor. But the lottery has changed the state in so many good ways. And all of you all are responsible for that, for these young people getting a college education. Education is the escalator of the mobility. It is the key to all keys for people to be a more productive life and live as citizens of the state of Georgia. So, so the lottery is a good piece, something that we need to continue to, to work on and to work, to make it better, better every day. Servant's house also has allowed me to honor serve with nine U.S. presidents. Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. Bush. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush. Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. And have served with nine presidents, I said, and I'm visited with seven of them in the, in the, in the White House. And I'm deeply, deeply honored. Both Republican and Democrats. I never forget getting a call from the White House and, Ronald Reagan wanted to meet with a few of us state legislators on welfare reform. And I got criticized by going to meet with the president, but I, I informed them at that time, if any president calls me, I'm going to see him. Period. Don't get who it is. I'm going, if the president of United States calls you, I'm going. So that y'all want to keep raising that saying, you can do what you want to do. But they're going to change me, not one or not older. And I don't care what you do, but I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to meet with them. So I flew up there and one, one, one, one, and had no shame and came back and stood at my district like I always do. And I always, you know, I think, I think about late George H. Bush. His wife served on our board at the Mohawk School of Medicine, Bob Bush. And I got to know the Bush is very, very well. And one day, Dr. Sullivan, we were getting ready for the Mohawk School of Medicine. And he called me, so I got a dilemma. I said, what's the dilemma? He said, they want me in a second, the nomination of George, President Bush for his nomination at the convention in New Orleans. And I just don't know what Tom, what Speaker Murphy is going to say. I said, could I give you a little advice? I said, don't walk the New Orleans rolling. I said, you let me take care. Speak of Murphy. And I talked to Murphy and I told him there was the right thing to do. Our President became HHS Secretary, who's all of them. And it was a big, big thing for the state of Georgia. So I'm really pleased with that. And I've been, it's been my joy to serve with all of them. And in closing, I just say to you, I consider them in an honor. Public service is noble and honorable. And my love is for the rules committee. And I serve with five rules, Jim, Bill Lee, Earl Earhart, John Meadows, Jay Powell, and now Rich Smith for my hometown. Rich, I want to thank you for all the curses you extended to me. And I appreciate that. You're an entire, I've been dear friends and I'm very, very thankful for that. The Propraises Committee, I've served with quite a few chairs. Joe Frank Harris, Bubba McDonnell, Ben Harbin, Terry Coleman, and Terry England. And Terry, thank you for all that that you've done and assisted with me. You've never turned me down, well, you've turned me down on offers. But you never turned down to meet with me. But you hadn't, you see, I don't know if we could be mistaken as you hadn't turned down to come for each, I'll have to turn me down. But it's more good than bad. And for that, I'm deeply, deeply honored and I appreciate that. And you all know how much I love Fort Valley State University. And Fort Valley has been great to me. And I thank you all for the support that you all have given Fort Valley and all the HBCUs here in the state of Georgia through our budgetary process. The Mohawk School of Medicine. I remember 1979, we first talked about Mohawk School of Medicine. And I remember when we appropriate the first billion dollars, I'm saying million, which it was a big, first billion dollars to Mohawk School of Medicine and your support has been unwavering and I am thankful for that. The Speaker's Office, thank you very much. Spirrow. You've been a friend and a comodant. I appreciate you for all that. And I know the sun that you, I would text you on the sun to enter Saturday and you would text me back and people don't know about a lot of legislation getting done over the weekend. A lot of things happen and a cathed little, she's just been a friend for a long, long time, her and her daughter Kennedy and Michelle Spirrowman and Betsy, a messenger of Thorox. Caleb, thank you so much for all that you've done and Caleb walked up to me in Dillanagon and said, the Speaker won't just ride back with him in the car. I said, what's going on? He said, I'll let him tell you. I got in the car and he looked back in the back and said, I got to want you to nominate me for Speaker. I second my nomination and I didn't hesitate. I saw do it. And he said, we got one problem. You can't tell anybody. I said, oh Lord, have mercy. I don't know about that. So the Sunday before the election, I said, it's nowhere for me to lead that seat of Morgana in nominee without giving my leadership knowledge out of it. So I went to see Stacey Abrams and all our other members in total of what I was going to do was not an issue. So thank you for that, Caleb and Keith and Deedra Powell, all of the members of the Speaker's office. Thank you for all that you do. I've only served with three clerks. I think it's three and forty years, but that's it. Jack Ellic served a long, long time and Robbie Rivers, the Speaker and I both spoke at Robbie's home going and our clerk now, Bill Riley. And they do such a wonderful job. And I want you all to give them a round of applause and thank them for all the legions. And the doorkeepers, thank you Pat, all the doorkeepers, y'all did such a great job. And I took a picture with the doorkeepers and I signed it every one of them and I loved them and I appreciate them. Back in the day, when I was elected, the doorkeeper used to be former members of the legislature and that happened for a long time and now having flow leads that are not legislated, it's a good deal because the flow leads that were legislated, sometimes they wouldn't want to get the door. You'll come to the door and I said, well, I said, what's the problem here? He said, well, I said, you're not a legislator, you're a used to bird. He said, what is a used to bird? I said, a used to bird don't make no soup. So open the door, but that's how it was back in the day with our colleagues. And my seat mates, Bill and Mitchell, Beverly or Wavio said that he should use two. But Tom Buck and Nick and Randall, I love Nick and Randall. She served for 12 years. I held Nick and Randall when she was two years old over there in that window. And she was two and now she don't got here and she goes. I know it's time for me to go. My seat mates, Carol and Hugh Glenn, ladies and gentlemen, I love and appreciate it. And he was taught me so much. He's been such a shoulder to me and such a ear to me. I can't, I can't fathom, I can't tell you how much she's meant to me. When I used to talk to her about my family situation and all of that, I talked to about my grandchildren and she's always been giving me that mother advice and I'm thankful for that. Darshan Kendrick, Viola Davis, Becky Evans, Eric Allen who came to visit me today and I appreciate your courtesy, Eric and Miriam Parrish. Those are the people that serve what me now. In my administrative assistance, Cheryl Jackson has been just a wonderful person and I thank her and her husband, Stefano for their courtesy and good to me. Thank you for helping with the farewell reception and healing my honor recently and I'm just really, really thankful. And the first assistant I ever hired was Lisa Johnson, y'all remember Lisa, she worked for the speaker but she was my first administrative assistant and I'll tell you this, I had hip replacement in 93 and when I woke up her husband was at my bedside, holding my hand and praying for me and that's a special person that would leave their home in Atlanta and drive the Columbus and visit me at my bedside and we share a great bond ship there. And Janice Ways of the late Ways used to work with upstairs and sometimes I get up because Bruce Williamson is in my old office on the fourth floor. I really enjoyed that office if that's what a majority of leaders office was at that time and my chairman, Chuck Martin is in my old office on the fourth floor when I used to hang out as well and I will think my chair, I should mention chairman, Rick Jasper for his work in this house as well. And the last thing I want to say is that the media, I want to thank the media. They have a role they play.

Overall, I've had a good relationship with the members of the media. In fact, some of them are dear friends from the media. And y'all know my love and appreciation for Jim Galaway. In fact, speaking of Ross and I, you had a resolution on Galaway and I appreciate him. And I think all of the others that I've had a chance to interact with Rick Allen and Prinus Palmer and Richard Elliott near Boats, Jane Sausler, Celeste Sting, Siblebler, Bill Nigat, and Dick Pettis and Aaron Haines from the Associated Press who assisted me over the years. How can you measure a 48-year career in the Georgia House? Is it by the number of bills you introduce or pass? Is it by the positions you hold? I don't think so. You measure your career by how you honor this institution. And I honor the House of Representatives, this institution. I've always paid honor to this institution called the Georgia House of Representatives and I shall always. What will I miss not being in here with you all? I got my top 10. So, I'm going to give you my top 10. 10? Being chairman of the Columbus Legislative Delegation. I'm going to miss that. That's one of my top 10. I've worked with all these members here and I love them dearly because they have put up with me. I don't know how many years I've been chairman, but I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Representative Hule, Representative Buckland, Representative Smith. Y'all been so great. I'm going to miss all these old days like Omega Day, aka Day, Delta Day, all of them days at the Capitol, Alpha Day. I'm going to miss, what is my friend Kim Scoville, Lupus Day, Sickle Sail Day with Glory Frays. I'm going to miss all my days here, but I enjoy coming to this where we all honor in those different days. Good morning, Al Williams. How are you? Best day of my life. It's the best day of my life. I've heard that so many times. I'm thinking it is the best day. Every day is the best day of your life. Any day you get up, y'all think, God, any day because some people don't wake up and so thank you, Al, for your friendship and for working with you. We met in 1975 and we're still friends and we're still working together. And I appreciate that. Number seven, all members please take your seat and cease audible conversation. I'm going to wake up one of these days thinking about hearing that. All members take your seat and cease audible conversation. I'm going to miss this right here. Can you call on the speaker for me? On the rules chairman or the chairman of the Properation Committee. Can you put in a good word for me? I'm going to miss all of those. Not being able to go to BZB. My favorite soulful restaurant. I'm going to miss that. Number three, what purpose does the gentleman rise? I rise to make a motion, but you're not all recognized. A rules committee meeting. We have a rules committee meeting in ten minutes. I'm going to miss that every morning. I'm going to miss having that. And then the last thing I'm going to miss is Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. It's been such a great ride. You've been, I've seen so many of y'all and God did know you. I appreciate you all the years. I've had some great members of some dear friends. I was at J. Powell's dedication other day and got to talk with Demetri Stuggles. And he spoke at the ceremony. And we talked about family. And I appreciate you Demetri, you've been a dear friend. And just standing there that meant to talk about family is always something that's been dear to me. And I would not have been able to serve up here, had it not been for Sonovus. Sonovus has been my rock. I went to work for that company in 1976. And I had lost my job at another company because of the action that I voted on in here. I lost my job. And I came up here in 1976 when I was home in 1975. I lost my job in April of 1975 after the session. I came back up here unemployed. And I went home unemployed. I was living off, I know y'all don't know anything. I was living off a 90 day notes. Now you roll them over and get another thousand. You roll them over, you get another thousand. But I lived like that for over a year on 90 notes. And one day I was walking into CBNTO in Broadway. And Jimmy Blanchard was walking out. He said, how you doing representative? I said I'm fine, Jimmy, how are you? I said I'm fine, yes, but I'm still looking for a job. He stopped and said, you hadn't found a job since you left another company. I said no sir. He walked back inside, he said, cancel my luncheon. Tell him, I'm sorry but I can't be there. He said, come into my office. I went to his office and I talked to him at that time of School of Mankind Trust Company. And he said, he looked me in eyes and said, if you come to work for me, you'll never regret it. So you'll never regret it. And I'll never forget. I went from a trainee to executive vice president, a member of the government's board of the company, and president of the Sanos Foundation. When I became executive vice president, he gave me one of the biggest lessons I ever could get from a person. He walked in my office and said congratulations. He said, we got 10,000 employees, five states, and you're the highest ranking African American in the company. He said, but do me a favor. He said stick your chest out. Let's stick it out. He said, no stick it out. Let's stick it out. He said, no stick it out. He said, I'll let it go. He said, I don't stick it out no more. He said, if you could get here being you, why change? He said a lot of people get to these lofty positions that they become somebody else. He said, but if you just stay you, you'll be all right. And I appreciate that from him. And he was just a wonderful person. And the speaking does, and I just got to read one thing. I've got so many notes from people, so many. And I just want to read one. It moved me this morning. I don't want to say who it is because, but I just want to read what they sent me. Good morning, my friend. I know you think you back all the last almost 50 years of service in public life, you're reflecting back over your life. And as my mom would say, you are probably very full. Calvin, your resume is very impressive. You have walked among the highest men and women in our nation. You have been granted great, great opportunities and favor in your life. As you leave this journey serving in Georgia House of Representatives 48 years and start on your new journey, I wish you the best that God has to offer. Tonight, as I listen to the news about you and your many accomplishments that I looked at over the news tonight, I think back over our friendship and what you have given me. I recognize your service to the community, but I must say that your kind heart has been more impressive to me than anything. I have seen you grant grace and mercy to some who probably didn't deserve it, but you gave it. Calvin, I have watched you take the high road in almost a lot of political events and community activities, and you have encouraged me to do the same. Your forgiven nature has been a strength that I am continuing to work on every day inside of me to make me a better person. Calvin, in the second book of Luke 1. Verse 5, as Paul has imprisoned before, being put to death and rights to Timothy about his unfaith, say, faith, genuine faith that was instilled in him by his grandmother, Lewis and his mother, Eunice. As I am called to remember the unfaith's faith that dwell first in your grandmother, Lewis and your mother, Eunice, and thus I am persuaded it dwell in the also. Calvin, I see that faith so much in you. I don't know who instilled that faith in you, but that faith you have in mankind, but I have seen it over and over and over again, and that is why I love you. God's pleased, young man, as you focus on your new direction and now have continued your service in the Georgia House of Representatives. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the whale. We have one announcement, and then I know we have a presentation, but there will be a little event going on downstairs in just a few minutes, and some of us need to leave chair recognizes chairman Mitchell for an announcement. Mr. Speaker, just before we make this presentation, the Democratic caucus will meet in 216 for brief meeting and lunch. After the presentation, the House will be in recess until 230. Mr. Speaker, we are going to be joined by the members of the Columbus delegation and the chair of the Democratic caucus, Billy Mitchell. Calvin Smirey is such a great American, a great statesman, and the speaker has graciously consented to have a painting of Mr. Smirey hung in this capital. We have the artist here, Mr. Steven Tett, take a hat off. We would like to make the presentation at this time, Mr. Tett is going to do the honors. Mr. Mitchell is going to say something right quick. Very quickly, this couldn't have been done without the generosity, certainly of the speaker, as well as some of our corporate partners at Malcolm Smith, the Aflac and Columbus, Billy Linville, Lex, the Constratigies, Calvin, Booker, retired, waste management, and myself. With that, let's make the unveiling. As a result of the speakers commissioning this, this will be permanently hung in the capital hallway. We also have bags, boxes, and a basket full of Europe comments and your well wishes. They're overflowing and they're just a way for us as individuals to say thanks for the memory to Calvin. I mean, Representative Smirey, the Dean.
