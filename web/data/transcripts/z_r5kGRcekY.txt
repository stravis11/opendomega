TRANSCRIPT
----------
The purpose that is programmed today of this press conference is to
highlight the issues that are important as it pertains to
safe storage and gun safety in the state of Georgia.
I'm State Senator Daniel Jones representing the 10th district and I had the opportunity to cheer the safe storage
committee this summer and I just want to discuss it this here and some of the findings that we have on my safe storage
a study committee. And I also want to emphasize the importance of this body this
year taking action. There have been a lot of suggestions, particularly members
at a house, on what we can do as a body. But one thing that I do know is doing
nothing is not an option. So I am glad to have Heather and the groups that
and moms demand action joining us today
for this press conference.
The question that we had our aesthetic committee
is what can Georgia do?
And I just wanna share with you two things
that I think are critical and others will share the same
in terms of what we can do as a legislative body
and what we can do in our great state.
We've heard somebody remarks by Governor,
we heard some remarks by Lieutenant Governor
and we've also heard remarks by our speaker
and even our superintendent of schools.
Governor Kim says he wants to give money to the school system.
Well, I'm going to show our governor a way
that he can spend that money so that it will benefit Georgia,
certainly as it pertains to reducing the number of pediatric
deaths in our great state.
One of the things that we highlighted
in the study committee is that Georgia has the eighth highest rate of unintentional
students by children in the United States.
And I hope that kind of syncs in with members that are present here today.
And it should also be stated that Georgia, that the highest incident of pediatric deaths
in Georgia is caused by unintentional gun shootings.
To me, those numbers are just staggering and really unacceptable and Georgia can do better.
And I said Georgia can do better because it's two things that I'm asking our great state
to do during this legislative session.
Here with me is bills that we are filing today and these are bills that should address
A lot of the concerns as it pertains to children gaining access to guns, and I would also
share that members here today will share other ideas that we plan to introduce as well.
The first bill that I want to talk to you about is a bill that deals basically with creating
a statewide database.
Governor Kimson has remarks that he's on spending excess of $20 million.
The priority and our opinion should be the vote in some of that money on creating a state-wide
database where the rules are being promulgated by DOE, our Department of Education so that
we can identify those kids within our school systems and there's 180 of them in our great
state that need essential services and that kids can be identified that have problems
in a particular school system to ensure that those problems do not carry forth into any
other school system in our great state.
To me, that is just the bare minimum that Georgia should do as it retains to gun safety.
The other issue that I would like to discuss deals with creating a statewide ZAR position,
and of course this position would be subject to funding.
So I'm calling on Governor Kim and I'd like to say to the body to allocate funds to
fund a statewide ZAR position. This is not anything new as it pertains to gun safety.
As a matter of fact, the states of Texas has been doing this well over 20 years. North
Carolina, Utah, and even other red states have a position very similar to this in their
legislative branch. And even in North Carolina, they have a position similar to this underneath
the Department of Juvenile Justice.
That's why we're here today.
This person, this ZARC, as I call it,
will have responsibilities to disseminate information
through all of our schools, K through 12.
This person will have the responsibility
of working with industry and defining best practices.
And this person will have the responsibility
of working with the legislatures to ensure
that as we move forward, that we are focusing on those issues
that is critical in ensuring the safety of our kids throughout our school system.
So those are the two bills that I plan to introduce and I'm going to ask if other members
of our group will join me in discussing some of the issues that's critical, that we
deem critical to providing for the safety and care of children in our school system.
Thank you so much, Senator Jones, and thank you for your leadership on the study committee
this summer.
And thank you to the leaders of our senate for appointing this study committee to talk
about this difficult issue.
Our state is particularly in Barrow County, of course, but parents all across our state
and schoolchildren all across our state are still grappling
with the fallout from the tragic mass shooting
at Appalachia High School last year.
And so far, we've heard a lot of discussion
about additional funds to harden public schools.
And that discussion needs to be had.
But one thing that must be pointed out
is that all the hardening in the world
would not have stopped the tragedy at Appalachia High.
You can make it a fortress, a school of fortress,
and the young middle schooler who brought a gun to school
and ultimately died after shooting herself
at her middle school in Cobb County just this year in 2025.
All the hardening in the world isn't gonna stop that y'all.
Most of these shootings are sadly done by people
who are a part of the community
and they are expected to be in the building.
And it just gets more and more glaring
with every single tragedy, the refusal
to talk about other parts of the equation
that are necessary for any solutions.
And so I commend Senator Jones for putting the issue
of the very, very easy access to guns
that we have here in our state.
We have one of the weakest states in terms of gun laws.
When it is extremely easy to get guns,
there will be lots of guns around in the community
and people's homes on the street.
And you will have more shootings, accidental, or on purpose.
And you will have more deaths.
And we have to talk about that side of it.
And guess what?
Georgians know.
Georgians do not believe the Republicans
when they're like, well, I guess we better put some more,
you know, some more locks on the doors.
I think Georgians know that we have to be honest
about what has caused our gun violence crisis
and talk about all parts of what we need to do to address it.
I've got a couple of bills that I want to add
to Senator Jones's package.
I have followed them all before.
One is a safe storage around Miners Bill
that will require locking up guns around children
And with a misdemeanor penalty, if one knows or should have known
that their gun could be easily accessed by a minor and a tragedy
ensues, another is, and this one's more complex.
So I won't go on and on if you want more details come find me.
But in Georgia, we essentially throw people out
of the Nick's database.
We stop submitting their names to the Nick's database
after five years after an involuntary commitment
for mental health purposes,
from someone who has been adjudicated
a danger to themselves or others.
That is not a safe practice,
to just simply stop sending the names.
Also it conflicts, it is against federal law
because having been involuntarily committed
due to being a danger to oneself or others
is a bar for gun ownership
unless you've been through a hearing process.
So this legislation, which is almost made
to the finish line many times working with the GBI and others would simply set up that
hearing process as opposed to summarily just not submitting the names anymore without
further inquiry from folks who may be a danger to themselves or others. We also will have
one again as a caucus that would close our domestic violence, loophole wherein misdemeanor
domestic violence, convicts are still a lot, a legally capable holding guns here in Georgia
which we know is incredibly dangerous and domestic violence being a huge
problem and cause of death and most typically it is with a weapon so those are
the three bills I want to highlight real quick for you all and thank you I think
Georgians are ready for a change as far as this how we talk about the gun
issue it started over the summer with the study committee that Senator Jones
were actually able to chair that was a big deal to actually have a Senate
study committee actually look at this particular issue of safe storage.
And it's continuing now with these bills that we have here, and quite frankly, these
bills that are here that are firmly supported by the Democratic Caucus is one that covers
so many different issues.
And that's exactly how it should be, whether we're talking about safe storage, whether
we're talking about creating a czar, it basically covers a lot of different areas as far
as gun safety is concerned.
As a former prosecutor, I'm extremely interested in the fact that now we would actually be able
to help domestic violence survivors as far as their abusers have an access to weapons
that is also going to be something that we're going to be pushing hard for, all of these
bills are part of a general package that actually is going to keep Georgia safe.
And I believe that Georgia's are ready for a change.
They're tired of not talking about this issue.
That was shown with that study committee in the support that that study committee had
and they ready to do some action.
So the Georgia Democratic caucus is ready to get going and ready to do some action on
this particular issue.
And we think we've got some good bills here that can pass, and even if they do not pass this particular year, we're going to get them done next year, but we're going to push hard.
There's no doubt about it. We're going to be pushing hard to get this legislation passed because it's to protect the state, our citizens and to protect Georgia's. Thank you so much.
I just want to thank Senator Jones for his leadership on this issue.
As a former high school principal, I just want to give a little more perspective as to the
importance of the bill in which schools will communicate with each other.
As a high school principal, we all know that it's important to get information about our
students' academics, but also it's even more critically important to ensure that we
are getting information as to issues and concerns that schools have had with their students.
It is critically important for all parents to know that their children are in safe environments,
And as a former educator who had a student bring a gun to school, have an information
shared between schools is critically important and can't just stop at academics.
So these, I know it's become a term that is used a lot, but truly common sense reforms
to ensure that our children are safe in our schools.
We all want to know that our children are safe and our educators are safe.
So I'm very excited to support these bills and I know that we can do more in the state
because our parents are demanding that we do more
to protect our students and our teachers
and our school buildings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm State Senator Gail Davenport
and we just have to do something
about these school students
and something about gun violence.
You can go anywhere and just buy a gun.
And so my mother and my sister were both retired teachers
And they were there to teach children, not to police and to make sure that people did not
bring guns to school.
We have to put force legislation and to make sure that we stop this gun violence.
You know, when I was years ago, when I was working the night shift right here in Atlanta, Georgia,
I was attacked from behind and the gentleman pulled a gun out and it just scared me.
Now we have so many persons that I lived,
but we have so many seniors now who called every day
and afraid to go to the grocery store, afraid to get out.
So we have gun violence all around.
So we're gonna do something about this gun violence
and stop it right now.
So I pulled Senator Jones, he made your Jones
for having the study committee and fighting for
the stopping gun violence here in the state of Georgia
and across this nation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello, my name is Heather Hallett,
and I am the organizer for Georgia Majority for Gun Safety.
We are a coalition of all the various advocacy groups
in the state of Georgia who are advocating for changes
to Georgia Law to promote responsible culture of gun ownership here in Georgia and promote
gun safety.
Want to thank Senator Jones so much for initiating the Safe Storage Study Committee over the summer.
And the bottom line is that the majority of Georgians, and we are a coalition of Democrats,
Republicans, gun owners, people who don't own guns, lots of doctors and clinicians, parents,
regular people, the majority of people in Georgia support common sense legislation like
child access prevention laws.
We know that safe storage saves lives and there are bipartisan actions that we can take
in the state to promote a culture of responsible gun ownership.
I applaud Senator Jones again on advocating for funding
to promote things like safe storage education.
Firearms are the number one cause of death
in children and teens in Georgia.
And there are bipartisan actions that we can take.
And I just applaud all of the legislators
who are up here in taking action and welcome
the rest of the legislature to join the majority of Georgians who know that there are things
that we can do to solve this problem.
That concludes our press conference.
Are there any questions that our group can answer?
Please join them.
Yes.
I'm sorry I can't hear you.
Can you come a little bit closer please?
That's an excellent question, by the way.
The question was, how do you address the privacy concerns with children from parents when
they had privacy, and that data may be shared when they go to another school system?
I would simply say that when a child transfers to another school system, there's already
a package that follows them.
As part of that package, the income in school system is obliged to accept that child.
And I don't see any privacy concerns that should be addressed or could even possibly be
that big of a concern when it comes to a child needing medical attention, needing quality
care that they may have received at their previous school system.
And I would hope that the parents would expect that their child will continue to receive
that same quality of care at the incoming school system.
So I do not see that as a private concern.
I see it more as a safety concern.
And as I've already said, there's a lot of data in our school system that follows children
when they transfer already.
Thank you.
Well, I can tell you the Republicans that I've spoken with have expressed an interest in
the two bills that I've introduced.
I'm not going to call any names because when you have those tenuous relationships and
that tepid support, I'm certainly not going to do anything to discourage any
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle from joining with us in this
discussion and certainly joining with us and helping us promote this
legislation. Our goal is the past legislation. That's what our goal is and as
our minority leaders already mentioned, our minority chair, we're willing to
work with anybody and we will continue to do that in working with anyone that
has an interest in this, and I pray that all of the legislators in this great body already
should have an interest considering the trauma, if you will, that Georgia has its experience
as it pertains to school students.
I think I saw a statistic recently that already in January, it has been well over 18 high
school students across the country, the numbers are going up, they're certainly not going
down.
a lot that we can do. It's not going to cost the state that much money. And as I mentioned earlier,
this is kind of the low hanging fruit. This is the bare minimum. But certainly, we're always going
to push to do more. Oh, I'm very confident. It's really those that are serving with me. They
They will tell you that it's never ever easy for a legislator,
particularly a Democrat and a legislator that's in a minority to pass legislation up here.
But I think my track record and that of those that stand with me speaks for itself.
We have passed legislation last year.
I passed Senate Bill 10 that Governor Kim signing a law that was embraced.
Keep in mind, it's not the legislation.
It should be ideals that drive a consensus in its body.
I think we've done a good job between the study committee and the press conferences that
we've had in presenting ideas that should drive a consensus in its body.
And I'm asking all of my colleagues, not just the Democratic colleagues, but the Republicans
as well, to look at this idea and base your decision on supporting it or not supporting
on the merits of what you see.
And I can share with you that every Republican I've shared this idea with regarding the
The database in the czar, which is not new to politics in the country, have its press
support for.
Somebody else want to join in, please.
I'm sorry, could you repeat the.
You know, incentives are, the question is why, why, why have it, you know, be, be a criminal
charge?
And here's, here's the answer, incentives are great and not as another thing that, that
should be discussed.
But one of the problems we have that I believe a number of our senators referred to is the
sort of culture created that we have created here in Georgia of permissiveness and of not
having in the forefront a discussion that these are extremely dangerous objects that you
don't just treat like you might treat something else.
You would expect that everyone would do that, but I can tell you that that's certainly
not the case.
And when you don't have a charge that results, you know, and obviously someone, if their
child has shot themselves to death accidentally because they got their hands on a weapon which
of course happens hundreds of times across the country and has happened many times here in
Georgia just in the last few years obviously they're probably devastated but by not saying that
is not something that you are legally allowed to do under our state's code by that not being there
That sends a message. That sends a message like it's just fine to leave your gun lying around kids.
So that, to me, is one of the reasons that it is important to have it stated in Georgia code
that it is not legal to leave a gun around, around minors.
And that is not to say that other ways to get at that problem don't have merit.
But I do believe that part of what our laws do is they represent our values as a society,
and if those laws are so at counter purposes with the way you want people to behave,
then you need to look at that piece of it too. And while I'm on that topic,
let me just add that, you know, in Georgia, it was not illegal for the Appalachian
shooter's father to give his 14-year-old an AR-15. Again, something that really is a bit
counterintuitive, but when it's perfectly legal, why would you expect people to not do it?
Same logic goes with the safe storage, and thank you for the question.
Thank you. Can we do it? We have time for one more question, by the way. Yes, ma'am?
Let me just ask if you would get with Senator Parent, so she can answer that question for you, and let me conclude this press conference.
I thank everyone for being here today, even the members on the other side of the aisle with us.
Please introduce yourself.
I'm representative of the State House.
Come on up, Representative.
I ask Representative House to ask you a lot to join us.
She had a conflict with there's some legislation
they've already introduced in the House as well, please.
Thank you.
I'm representative of the State House of District 52.
And Representative Ow and I have both filed
legislation over the last three terms probably.
I know she has pediatric safe storage as well.
I will be dropping the red flag bill again this year.
A lot of these things could go in tandem,
I truly believe, monitoring the kids' school records
as they transfer those things showing up
and then being able to go law enforcement
or family members to alert schools
and to remove guns from the homes.
Those are important.
And then I'll also be filing another bill
about domestic folks being convicted of domestic violence,
not being able to have guns.
To me, that's common sense.
The U.S. Supreme Court has passed it,
but the states need to file it as well.
So I love being able to work with the Senate
on these important common sense gun safety bills.
These are not crazy.
I personally, my family has guns locked up at home.
I'm not anti-gun, but we have to begin to find ways
to protect our kids and to protect our communities.
Thank you.
Thank you all for attending and this concludes our press conference.
Moms of action, I appreciate you guys, Heather. Thank you, thank you all for being here and been part of this press conference today.
Thank you.
