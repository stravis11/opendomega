TRANSCRIPT
----------
Mr. Clark, will you ring the bell, please?
House will come back to order.
will come to order here for momentarily. I understand we have the sound issues fixed
with room 341. Of course, if a tree falls in a room with no one in it, maybe you guess
you can't hear it. Okay. I have a couple of announcements for you. A couple of
announcements. First of all, the Senate has not agreed to our adjournment resolution.
They are, they have set a rules calendar for-
Just so y'all will know, there will be a rules meeting at 345.
That was the other one. Obviously we don't have the sound problem fixed for 341.
So as of right this minute, we will be in session tomorrow, subject to a motion by the majority
leader as to time, and I'm well aware that it's Sunday's Father's Day, and you know,
that was one of the reasons that somebody in the Senate said three or four weeks ago
So we couldn't come in at a time we recommended because we had to enjoy Father's Day.
So I guess whether we enjoyed or not now has it been determined.
So right now plan to be here tomorrow and help us get the word out.
Secondly there will be a rules committee meeting in room 341 at 345 and then the clerk's
office, we'll need some time to assemble the work that whatever they prepare.
Okay, I'm advised that there were committees that had scheduled meetings this afternoon.
Clerk's office is going to need about 30 minutes at least to get things ready.
So I'm going to encourage any committees that want to meet, need to meet, to meet now
over the next hour and use this time wisely and then we will be at ease, it will be in
recess till 4.30 and then we'll take up a supplemental rules calendar. So rules committee
meet at 3.45 and we will be in recess till 4.30 and committee chairs are
encouraged to meet over the next hour.
