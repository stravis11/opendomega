Thank you Mr. President. I'm bringing to you ladies and gentlemen HB one

Let me tell you how I know that. I went spoke to the local
Cattleman's Association and when I got there we had a presentation on
Children Cover Your Years on Bull Seaman and as I'm hearing this program I noticed that the veterinarian giving the program was from Auburn, Alabama.
Auburn, Alabama. We couldn't get some eye from Georgia. You know why we couldn't get some
eye from Georgia? Because there ain't none. So, this bill just simply enhances the veterinarian

Senator Jones of the 10th and others offered the following amendment number one to amend House Bill 222 by placing lines one and two with to amend Title 17 of the
Efficiency of Georgia annotated to a criminal procedure, just to revise certain bond holding requirements to require the inclusion by inserting between line six and seven Title 17 of the Efficiency of Georgia
and for other purposes, Mr. President, I can please see your order.
Break it down to the center for the 20th.
Center for the 42nd, what purpose do you rise?
As unanimous consent to excuse the center for the 19th, for business outside the chamber.
Without objection, sir, for the 19th, is it excused?
Mr. President and colleagues, most of the legislation that I bring to you is
it comes from concerns or concerns,
Most of the legislation that I bring to you is comes from concerns or ideas from my constituents
trying to solve problems they've run into or good ideas they have and that's what House Bill 222 is.
Representative Blackman and I had a court clerk suggest to us that when she's dealing with bonds
that they needed additional contact information for the principal and the
surety of it just make their life easier and be better for all the parties
involved so all this bill does is adds to currently they are required to
provide a mailing address of the principal and surety this would make
additional information be provided the full name of the principal and surety
email address and a phone number. That's all the bill does. It's good common
sense legislation and I ask for your favorable vote. Thank you very much. I yield
the well. Seniors yielded.
I would like to introduce our
council.
And as his microphone to my
Thank you, Mr. President.
First of all, I want to thank the senator from the 20th for bringing this piece of legislation forward.
It is very important that we get as much information from the surety and the individual being bonded out so that we can ensure that they make it to all their court hearings and other things.
Well, all the amendment does is a couple of years ago we did a piece of legislation that
allowed bail funds to be a part of Title 17 in Georgia.
What this does is lower the cap a little bit to give more opportunities for not only the
bail funds to get into it, but for anybody else because our ultimate goal is that our
jail is only housed the most violent individuals in Georgia and I think this is a step in the
right direction.
Thank you, Mr. President.
All right, I'm really I really
feel the way.
Thank you, Mr. President, I would do a point of order a motion to strike the amendment
whichever is most appropriate pursuant to rule 7.6 of the Senate rules that this amendment
is in the nature of a floor substitute because the amendment is more than one half the length
by words of the document which it amends, Mr. President.
So, what is, give me your official motion, then, Senator.
The motion is to strike the amendment under Rule 7-1.6
because it's in the nature of a floor sub-2,
the specific reason is not lines, but there are more than half,
whether the number of words in the amendment is more than half the number
of words in the underlying legislation, Mr. President.
All right, let me pull, let me pull, let's pull that code station, Sandra, hold on.
please come by.
Stand by, center.
I'll ask for unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.
There's a question with draw the amendment objection out of Jackson.
The amendment is withdrawn.
You see that you see that bipartisan working together right there.
I'll tell you what I mean love is in the air.
Tell you what, thankful for the senator from the 14.
All right, did any other senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Chair here is none, previous question is ordered.

of the bill?
Chair here is none, and the report of the committee is agreed to.

and I recognize Senator from the third,
home house bill 235.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take HB 235
off the table.
Secretary Reed, the caption.
House bill 235, represent of Townsend,
the 177, 179th, and others,
between town and act to amend.
Article 1 of chapter 1 to title 20,
the official good of George Anteville,
to General Provisions, wealth of his education,
so as to require employers,
a school employee to provide leaves of absence
for the donation of bone marrow and organs,
for standards and conditions for granting such leads and absence and for other purposes.
Mr. President, I can please see you order.
Is there objection?
That objection.
Secretary, finish the caption.
House Bill 235, where I was in the town of the 179th and I found out there's built between
10 and 9 to men, Article 1 of Chapter 1 of Title 20, the OCGA, the led to John Provezhens,
well, it's education, so it's the required employers of school employees to write leads
to absence for the donation to bone marrow and organs, driver standards and conditions
for granting such leads to abstinence,
right for penalty for not compliance,
right for definitions, right for short tiles,
right for related matters and tribulations.
We're people looking lots and for other purposes.
Mr. President, thank you for that education youth.
I'd recommend that this bill do pass.
Mr. President, please submit it to
our Hickman Chairman, Mr. President,
and I complete the order.
Senator from the third.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I bring you HB-235.
This is a bill about living organization.
Organization is a selfless and honorable and heroic act.
I can tell you that we have at least one member in this body
who has donated a kidney to a family member.
And I know that we have at least one member in the house
who is friend of mine who has done the same thing.
This is called the Georgia Supporting Living Donor Educators Act,
HB-235 seeks to clean up an oversight in the law
by aligning public school and post-secondary employee benefits.
What's offered to state employees is basically it's a clean up bill.
235 would provide leave allowances to public school
and post-secondary employees.
post-secondary employees would be any person employed,
not less than half time in the university system,
excluding emergency or attempts.
And it would provide leave allowances
to those folks who donate organs and bone marrow.
It would provide 30 days leave for organ donation
and seven days for donating bone marrow.
State employees already have this,
let these leave allowances. This leave would not be deducted from annual or sick leave, and
count service for calculating retirement benefits. Employees must furnish an official statement from
their doctor to take advantage of this leave benefit. It must do so within seven days before taking
leave. Each employee class, teachers, public school employees, postsecondary employees are defined
in the bill but generally as I said include just full-time employees that take state benefits
and the bill benefit could not be waived by school districts in part of a strategic waver
contract and the reason for this bill what brought this bill up is there was a teacher in Georgia
who had to donate a kidney to her daughter after a medical emergency educator the educator attempted
to take advantage of the 30-day leave, given the state employees, thinking it would apply
to her and was shocked when her school district claimed that it did not. Even though she tried
to align the surgery in her recovery with the holidays, she was ultimately forced to,
she was ultimately forced to take up all of her accumulated sick days and it ended up
cost in our five thousand dollars and we understand that the district was just
doing just following the law but here we make the law and we can correct this. I
asked for favorable consideration of this and would be glad to answer any
questions. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. Greg
going to send it from the 56.
Senators a couple of years ago, you were kind enough to vote for the giving the gift of
life act. The giving the gift of life act that we passed will ultimately save many, many
lives in the state of Georgia. What we learned during that time is there was a 62-to-1 return
on investment. Not only were we able to save lives, we saved the significant amount of
tax dollars. This will do the exact same thing for those working on our school system.
So there's not too often a time that we can work on a bill together, that we can say
it will save lives, it will do the right thing, and save money all in the same breaths.
So thank you to the center for the third and for Representative Townsend who brought
this forward who is a former educator and an organ donor as I am. Thank you. I yield
well. Right, the center's yielded. Would you like to go to the well?
Inter inquiry. Station inquiry. Is it not true that under the leadership of a former chairman
of the Health Committee on the House side, we once had as a part of the encouragement
for organ donation we would give a $5 deduction on a driver's license if you
signed to be an organ donor. Isn't it true that that might be yet another
incentive that we could place to increase organ donation on our state you
know. Going forward that that sounds like something to be good to take up
all season. Thank you. Is the other senator wish to speak for against the
measure? Chair here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being
ordered? Chair here's none. Previous question is ordered. Is there objection to
agreeing to the board committee which is favourable to the past of the bill?
Chair here's none. The board committee is agreed to. Is there objection to making
a question being ordered? Chair here's none. The main question is ordered.
Questions on the past of the bill. All those in favour of the bill. But yeah,
Who knows?
It's all under the machine.
You

Senator from the 45th on the past of the bill, the A's are 54 and the A's are zero.
This bill has received requisite constitutional majority is there for pass.
Now, Senator from the 45th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I ask for unanimous consent for HB360 to be elevated from the table.
Secretary, read the caption.
House Bill 360, Robert's Interestation,
and we'll have earned fourth in others.
The Bill's Maintain on Active Men,
Article 2, Chapter 7, Title 4A.
The official go to George Ante,
loyalty to the income tax imposition,
rate computation exemptions, and credit.
So, it's the rise in tax rate
for the rehabilitation of historic structures.
The authorize the credit to be claiming
the taxable year of the year.
The certificate of occupancy is obtained
for certain pre-approved rehabilitation.
It's right for lay matters for people
looking at laws and other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Is there objection?
Hearing none, Secretary, finish the cap.
House Bill 360 by the representative of the administration, 104th and others,
Bill Tuminton and act to a manner equal to Chapter 7 Title 4A,
the OCGA, led to income tax, imposition rate,
computation, exemptions, and credits.
That's the revised tech fair for the rehabilitation of historic structures to authorize
credits to be claimed in the text of the year, the year certificate of occupancies obtained
for certain pre-approved rehabilitation of rather purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Economic Development and Tourism recommends
that this bill do pass, so that it will be submitted, Senator Beech, Chairman.
Mr. President, Senator Dulles, on the 27th and others offered the following amendment.
Number one to amend House Bill 360,
bear replacing on line three,
the credit with a reduced credit
by deleting inserting one on line 13
by replacing inserting 2027, 2028 or 2029 on lines 15 and 16
with inserting 2027 or 2028 by placing lines 19 through 24
with the following honor before July 1st, 2026 provided.
However, that any taxpayer that claims tax credits
pursuant to the sub-second and tax your 2026
should only be allowed to claim such credits
in an amount and for other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the go-order.
We're going to ask Senator from the 45th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I bring HB360 before you today.
This bill we have debated at great length.
I think everybody in the chamber understands what the bill does has to do with our historical
tax credits and the senator from the 27th has a friendly amendment that I think will help
and ease some of the concerns within the chamber.
With that, Mr. President, I yield well.
Senator from 27th, would you like to speak to your amendment?
Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues.
I want to highlight for you what we've changed on this bill.
I will inflow it full disclosure to tell you I voted against this bill the first time it
came to the floor.
I had a number of concerns and I'm going to start with each one of my concerns and tell
you how we address them in the amendment.
First of all, I was concerned that this was a credit that was just done for one project
or one area and that is I understand it was done not because the author wanted to
have done that way because DOR had advised them in that direction but we've had a conversation
with DOR and then we've also talked to the bill sponsor and we are replacing lines 19
24 in the file in the bill and what that does is it removes the requirement that this
be within a 10 mile radius of cabbage town. So the statewide piece of this is now in place.
I was concerned with pulling three years of credits forward so we are changing it so
that you can only pull forward years 2027 in 2028. I was also concerned that the state
would be pulling money forward in a disadvantage to a revenue shortfall in the budget without
any sort of financial benefit to the state.
So what we're doing is we're saying that if you pull
forward 20, 27 tax credits, you do so at $0.90 on the dollar.
If you pull forward 20, 28 tax credits,
you do so at $0.85 on the dollar.
As you all know, for the money that we hold in the reserves,
we do overnight swaps, a number of other things,
and we're earning four and a half to five and a half percent.
We have a fixed amount of money on these credits.
these credits will be paid out.
So if we don't pass this bill,
they'll be paid out in 27,
and they'll be paid out in 2028,
and they'll be paid out at full value, at dollar for dollar.
This allows us for the 27s to earn 10% out of our money,
and it allows us for the 28s to earn 15% both of which would
be higher than if we just kind of had the money
in the reserve fund and did not use them.
So with that, Mr. President, I hope that that clears up
what the amendment does,
I was really happy to answer any questions.
You do have one question, Senator.
We're going to have a second from 38.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Mr. Chairman, do you?
I do.
I'm sorry.
I just missed your explanation for line three
of the amendment where we're replacing the three years
with the two.
Can you just explain that one more time?
So I was trying to get you to the bill, but I wasn't able to.
So the original version of the bill
was going to allow an entity to pull forward 27 or 29 tax
credits.
This makes it so they can only pull forward any credits they have for 20s 27 in 2028.
I'm glad you're answering your question because I forgot about one other change.
The CEO now needs to be completed by July 1st of 2026.
So in the original version of the bill, you know, we talked a lot about the World Cup or the sponsor talked about the World Cup.
And we actually are changing the CEO completion date for the project.
We're moving that up from December 31st to July 31st
so that it is indeed done by the World Cup.
I think the other mechanically what happens with that
is since these projects take a while to develop
it's gonna make a lot less projects available
both by the 2029 change
than also moving the completion date up by six months.
Thank you, I think those are important changes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Right now it's the Senator from the 55th.
with the gentleman here I will thank you sir exactly who benefits from the
changes that you have proposed and who benefited prior to these changes can you
tell this honorable body who benefits for those changes so two main reasons why
I made these changes in working with the House sponsor and the Senate
sponsor one was to the state benefits the taxpayers of the state of Georgia if we
wait until 27 or 2028 for these credits to be claimed, they will cost us a hundred
cents on the dollar. We are going to earn money by allowing them to move them
forward, either ten cents or fifteen cents to pay on the year that they move
forward. Secondly, by changing this from being tied to a geographic region
within ten miles of cabbage town, we make this statewide. Any other historic
tax credit benefactors who may want to forego the ten or fifteen cents on the
dollar to get them moved forward, they will be eligible as well. Part of the
argument senator if you remember is that people were concerned with this
project being able to jump to the front of the line and this makes it so that
every person in the state who's been pre-approved for credits is on equal footing.
Thank you, Mr. President.
With the sender yield.
Yes, sir.
So your amendment makes this statewide and not just within the 10 mile radius.
Is that correct?
Correct.
Okay, so 2026 is the triggering mechanism. What if a person just
Didn't take advantage of the 2026. Would they still just fall in line with their normal
27 28 and 29 tax credits? Yes
So should they either not be complete or that you may have
Developers who will say we don't want to pay 10% to be able to pull forward a year because we can go borrow against this money at 5% and arbitrage that
They will still be able to collect that's my point we these tax credits get maxed out
And so we will pay these credits out in 27 or 28 if we pay them out in 26
We'll do so to reduce to rate which is why my interest in this amendment is why I believe this improves the bill
Do you think people will take advantage of that Senator? I certainly believe we know some projects that will
Whether there will be projects outside of the original 10-mile radius or not. I genuinely do not know. Okay. Thank you
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well.
We recognize the senator from 36,
the bill.
Mr. President, colleagues, regarding House Bill 360 there's probably a small demographic
of people that really follow these historic renovation tax credits and this bill has
kind of put it before all of us.
I want to point out that historic renovation tax credits are a good thing.
And we did a study on several years back led by the Finance Committee Vice Chair.
It was proven that the state makes money.
The state comes out on top by having a tax credit for historic preservation and renovation.
And it was actually almost, for every $1 state expenditure, the state recognized
close to $4 coming in from all of the activity of the preservation and these commercial historic
tax credits.
We also have residential historic tax credits now.
What has happened is that this has incented, this tax credit is not unimportant.
important. And in sense gives the incentive to launch and complete historic restoration
and renovation that could otherwise not possibly not happen. The problem is, and I'm voting
for this bill today, the problem that I think we need to tackle going forward is we need
to look at the level of historic and preservation tax credits.
It's capped at 30 million per year.
And there was a bill that came out of ways and means to raise the cap from 30 million to
50 million that did not ever get over here to this side.
I would have liked to have seen that in this bill.
But I say to you, we need to understand that tax credit, understand its value, and see
that statewide there are pressing needs for investment in historic preservation.
Do you know, it's my information I've been told that Florida, South Carolina, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Texas all have much higher levels of investment in historic preservation
and renovation, and we have needs all over the state.
I know the senator from the 46 spoke up about needs in his,
the city of Athens, the home of the university
for these tax credits to be available.
So right now, the big news is we don't have enough,
we're not investing enough in these tax credits,
which one, bring back properties, preserve properties,
preserve the treasures that we have all across our state of historic buildings and I know
that the representative Penny Hausten from Nashville in the house. This was something
that she dedicated herself to for her small town to have Main Street renovation of historic
old buildings so it's applicable and a plus in tiny little communities and in great
big cities like Atlanta where they're these properties that are crying out for preservation
and investment and so I say to you as I cast my vote for this bill which has been altered
somewhat by the amendment that the senators presented the well prior to my coming to
the well. This is not unimportant and I am supporting this bill and urging many, many more
of us to heed the call that we need to catch up with the other states on what we invest
in historic preservation. If we don't, it crumbles, it's gone, and it never comes back.
And we have a state that's just full of historic structures that we need to be
treasuring and renovating and we can do that.
And I did the author of the bill from the house who's worked very hard on this bill and
worked with all of the stakeholders on it.
And has told me that he is happy to roll up his sleeves and work with us going forward
to see that we have historic tax credits that are a plus.
Not reducing it, not reducing what's there, expanding it, and meeting the needs that we
have all across our state.
And I know there are people all across this room that can bring their testimony about
what happened with a great restoration or renovation that was done in their district
with the benefit of these tax credits.
I have made my point, I hope my point has been heard.
We have a lot to try to understand, get our arms around on this historic preservation
tax credits.
But they play an important role and they generate revenue for the state, good people.
They generate revenue for the state and not a dime of state money goes out until the
work is done, until money's been expended and then this tax credit is provided after
going through a lot of hoops to get to that point.
So if there are no questions, I'll yield the well.
Happy to yield to questions.
But that is my perspective on supporting House Bill 360.
Senator, you have no questions.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
We have a late arriving amendment here.
Secretary, read the amendment.
Mr. President, Senator Chiller, the 19th,
over the following amendment number two to Men House Bill 360
where we're placing online three,
the credit with reduced credits by inserting after 2026
on the line 19, the following provided however,
that any taxpayer that claims tax credits pursuant
to the subsection in tax year 2026
shall only be allowed to claim such credits
in an amount A not to exceed 90% in the amount
otherwise allowed pursuant to code section.
If such credit was pre-approved in tax year 2027,
B not to exceed 80% in the amount otherwise allowed pursuant
to this code section, if such credit
or was pre-approved for Texture 208 or and for other purposes.
Mr. President, I request you order.
We're going to the center from the 19th to speak to the amendment.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Members of the Senate, all my amendment does is in keeping
with what the senator from the, I believe the 27th was doing.
Instead of taking just 10% the first year down,
5% the second year down, it takes 10% down
on that tax credit the first year,
20% down on the second year.
I think that's more in line
with what you're seeing interest rates doing currently.
It's not a 5% interest rate world anymore.
It's more of a 7% interest rate,
and this is kind of in the middle.
The argument can clearly be made
while it's 10% the first year,
5% the second year,
so it averages out to be seven, fair argument.
But again, you are getting tax credits on a project
that we think's already probably being built to begin with.
So I would ask for you to consider,
if we're going to grant this for something
we believe's already happening,
we should walk it down 10% in the first year.
If you're gonna pull it forward two years, 20%,
if you're pulling it forward for two years.
That's it.
If there's any questions, happy to answer them.
And everyone votes your conscience.
You have no question, Senator.
I recognize the senator from the 21st, speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senators, I rise to support House Bill 360, and I put this jacket back on because this
bill is about dollars.
about economic development. It's about money. And, you know, we talk a lot about the World Cup,
and I want to thank the Senate from the 27th by moving that date so this historic area that they're
talking about, and I know it's statewide now, will be done in a much faster time. But we have to
look at this as a 30-year play. Let me tell you what, we have something called the World Congress
center that's a thriving convention business.
It's 1.8 million square feet of convention space.
And that's a very competitive business.
We compete with Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, and Las Vegas.
And we don't really have a lot of nightlife here in Atlanta.
You go to moans or chops, and after 9 o'clock,
there's not a lot of places to go.
We need music.
We need nighttime activity.
These folks are going to develop that area.
It's going to be a destination place along with
Centennial Yards.
We're going to revitalize that area,
and it's going to be about dollars.
So anyway, please vote for this,
and let's do some economic development in these buildings.
Let me tell you another story.
My wife and I, we opened a restaurant
about 20 years ago down in downtown Alphoretta,
and the building was built in about 1915, 1920.
And when you go and do electrical work,
you think it's going to cost you about $5,000,
cost 15 every time you open up a different door there's another skeleton that pops out
because these buildings are not up to code and you've got to you got to put money into
that so we need to help these folks renovate these buildings like the senator from the
36th set or they're just going to crumble away and we got to save our history and do economic
development mr. President if there are no questions I'll yield the well you do have one
question yes recognize senator from the 47th yes sir thank you mr. President
Would the senator yield yes as my friend from the 26 says
What is it all about the money? It's all about the money just like the senator from the 26 says and we got to we got to make sure
We keep Georgia the number one place to do business and especially with our historic building so please vote. Yes, I yield the wellness
Treasure has spoken
I think Mr. President I'm going to be brief but I do want to speak to the two amendments
that we got on this bill and I want to I'm going to commend the senator and the 27th
for his work with the parties, with the stakeholders, with the leadership over in the house to
to come up with the terms that are in amendment number one,
I support the terms of amendment number one.
Not only is it good for the bigger picture,
I think it's also good for the relations,
but also the mathematics work out so that what's reflected
here is one where although this is better for the state
to do this than the bills originally drafted, it's fair.
I think amendment number two is one
that quite frankly is a bit punitive,
and I think one thing we need to understand
is that these credits have already been granted.
They're coming in the future.
They've been granted to the applicant
who is now the anticipated recipient.
So they're going to get the money.
Their receipt of these tax credits in the future years
is not going to impact others
because of the way they're staged.
And so I think and appreciate Senator from the 27th.
And I appreciate Senator from the 45th
for bringing this bill.
But in particular, this carefully crafted compromise
that we've got with amendment number one is fair
to everybody, it's fair for the state.
And I think it continues to send a good message
that the money man who was up here before me
tries to tell us about, which is that Georgia
is a great place for economic development.
And I think my senator friend from the 26,
I don't know if he agrees with this or not,
but maybe he does, he does, okay, I understand.
But with that, I urge your support for a minimum number one,
let's pass 360, while this deals with an Atlanta project,
and I know those of us that live outside Atlanta,
sometimes envy all the economic development in Atlanta,
but the truth is, as our capital city Atlanta goes,
so goes the economic temperature and conditions
for the rest of us around the state.
So we're all in this together.
Let's vote for amendment number one
and pass Senate Bill, excuse me,
pass House Bill 360, I would yield the well.
Senator from the 13th, are you for this thing or against it?
Huh?
You're for it?
Well, you know, there is this thing called overselling something.
All right.
He can talk something to death, and also, and he gets no votes.
Senator Dickson, would you like to close?
I'm still in front of the 45th.
He'd like to close debate.
Senator Ways.
All right.
So, we've got, we've got Senator from the 27th or you want to be recognized?
Parliamentary inquiry.
Statue inquiry.
What happens if both amendments pass, given that they have, is it,
if amendment two passes and then amendment one passes, given they have
contradictory subject matters at whichever one passes last?
It is of the chair's opinion that if Amendment 1 does pass it, then it will basically
We've got amendment two.
Thank you.
On the adoption of amendment one,
is there objection to amendment one?

So it's required that the same employees health insurance plan include high deductible
health plans and further purposes.
Mr. President, I complete the order.
Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues, I have a simple bill here.
What it does is it requires the state to provide its employees with at least two high deductible
health plans.
What it also does is it requires a state to provide its employees at pre-tax, pre-tax
deduction for health savings accounts. And if that sounds familiar, we passed a very
similar bill two years ago and it passed unanimously from this chamber. So this is a similar
to a bill that has already been adopted by this body. And with that, Mr. President, I'll
yield for any questions.
Thank you so much, I'll yield the
well.

The term is defined in rules promulgated by the commission, Mr. President, that completes the order.
I get on the same for the 23rd.
Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues, I bring you House Bill 399.
This addresses problems with the management of residential single-family homes and duplexes
which are owned by institutional investors.
This has become quite a challenging environment.
I'd like to acknowledge that there are a high percentage
of homes in the metropolitan Atlanta area
that are investor-owned in the Incident District 10.
There are 4,901 homes owned by investor group.
That's 49.9, 49.2% of all single-family homes
available in Senate District 10. In Senate District 43, it's 39. In Senate District 30, it's 28.
In Senate District 45, it's 31. In Senate District 28, it's 26. So, in many of our districts,
more than 25% of single-family residential rental property is owned by institutional investors.
This bill just requires that that investor group have a broker that is a
resident of Georgia or if they're not a resident of Georgia, that broker is not
a resident of Georgia, then they employ a property manager who resides in
Georgia to make sure that they can deal with tenant communications, tenant
coordination, repairs, maintenance, and those types of challenges. The amendment is a
friendly amendment. It adds in section 2 online 47. It adds the ability for an owner's
family member. So as the family member of the owner also satisfied the exception. You'll
Notice that section two deals with exceptions to the requirement to have in-state property management or property brokerage,
but this would just allow this family to continue to own and operate their property.
I'm happy to accept any questions, or I'm happy to yield the well.
You have no questions, sir.
