All members, all members, if you're pleased, come to the floor. All members come to the floor. We'll see if we can get going here. I think rules are still meeting. We'll see you next time. The hour convening having arrived. All members, all members will please come to the floor and take this seats. Clerk, will you ring the bell? We're going to dispense with the roll call at this time. Our rules committee is still meeting. So members, I'll ask you all to come to the floor and take your seats. All members come to the floor and take your seats. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors? Will you close those doors and keep them locked? Please, and you can just keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. I enjoyed meeting our chaplain this morning, and I'm sure you're going to enjoy his message today. Our chaplain this morning, we will be introduced by the lady from the 51st House District, Representative Esther Panich. Representative Panich. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Shalom, y'all. Come on. Shalom, y'all. Thank you. Rabbi Adam Star has served as the Rabbi and Spiritual Leader of Congregation or Hatara in Atlanta since 2008. Under his leadership, the congregation has grown in membership and built a brand new state-of-the-art synagogue, the first Orthodox synagogue in the world, constructed from the ground up, according to environmentally sustainable standards. Rabbi Star received his rabbinical ordination from the Rabbi Isaac El-Khlanan Theological Seminary at Yashiva University in New York. He has served as the executive committee of the rabbinical council of America and is a past president of the Atlanta rabbinical association. While Rabbi Star is not my congregational Rabbi, he is a friend and a teacher. And he also was the one who put up the Mizzosa on my office door post. A Mizzosa is a parchment inscribed with Hebrew verses. Come by and visit, and I'll be happy to show you the Mizzosa. Please welcome Rabbi Adam Star. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shalom. Good morning, esteemed representatives. It is an honor to stand before you today as the chaplain of the day and to open this session with words of prayer and inspiration. Thank you to my dear friend, Representative Esther Panic, for this special honor and invitation. As you will soon hear Esther's strong and courageous leadership carries on the legacy of her biblical namesake, Queen Esther. In just a couple weeks time, Jewish people around the world will be reading the whole maghilla from the scroll of Esther and celebrating the joyous holiday we call Purim. The Purim story recalls a time when the Jewish people scattered throughout the Persian Empire faced an existential threat. Haman, the King's advisor, devised a genocidal plan to annihilate the Jewish people simply because they were different. He cast lots or Purim to determine the date of their destruction, believing that fate was on his side. But fate was not the deciding force. Courage was our heroine, Queen Esther, who had hidden her Jewish identity, was called upon to risk her own safety and life by outing herself as a Jew, to plead to her husband, King Ahashveroch, for her people's survival. She was initially hesitant, but her cousin Mordechai urged her with these powerful words that ring so true today. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will perish from the Jews from another... Relief and deliverance will arise from the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows if it was for such a time as this that you attained royalty upon hearing this, Esther spoke up with courage and moral clarity, thereby saving the Jewish people from genocidal annihilation. This verse reminds us that there are moments in history when silence is not an option, when injustice threatens the vulnerable, when evil seeks to destroy, we are called to act with moral courage. Today, this lesson resonates very deeply. The story of Pura reminds us that hatred against any people left unchecked can lead to violence and death. It is a call to all of us to stand up against bigotry in any form. But today, I speak on behalf of my people and your Jewish constituents, we are not okay. We have been reeling since October 7th, 2023, with the brutal murders, rape and abductions of our Israeli brethren by the blood-filled hands of Hamas. Those painful wounds were reopened this week with the return of the dead bodies of the Bebos family, of mother Shiri, and her young children, children, queer age 4, and Ariel, who was less than a year old, who were brutally murdered with bare hands by Hamas, returned to be buried by their father Yardin, who was just released a couple weeks ago after 500 years, 500 days of being hostage, being held hostage in Gaza. And there are still 59 innocent hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza, including American citizens, brutally torn from their families enduring unimaginable anguish. We are also witnessing a frightening rise in anti-Semitism across the world, even here in Georgia, and especially across college campuses in this very country. We cannot be silent. Their plight is a painful reminder, our plight is a plain painful reminder that hatred and violence still exist in our world. Like Esther, we must raise our voices on their behalf, and I implore you to let your Jewish constituents hear your voice in our time of pain. As the Georgia homegrown hero and prophetic voice of Dr. King taught the world and I quote, In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. Your voice means so much to us. More than you can ever imagine. Please rise and let us pray. Almighty God, source of justice and mercy, we turn to you in these halls of law and justice. Grant wisdom and strength to the leaders gathered here that they may govern with compassion and a steadfast commitment to righteousness. May they, like the biblical hero Esther, recognize the power of their positions to bring hope and healing to those in need. May we never be silent in the face of evil. May we stand together, people of all faiths and all backgrounds united against bigotry and intolerance and hatred. May you make the world a better place by best serving the people you are here to represent. Bless this great state of Georgia and all who labor to uphold the values of freedom, dignity and justice. In the face of darkness, may we be bearers of light. In the presence of hatred, may we stand for love and peace. May we each recognize that like Queen Esther, perhaps we have been placed in this place and position for such a time as this. And let us say, Amen. We will now turn and recite the pledge of the legions to the United States of America. We will lead the legions to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands when nation under God, indivisible, with the legity and justice for all. Thank you very much. Thanks for your effort and your patience. Good message. Members, you can join Rabbi Star in the south any room for a photo and greet him and thank him for being with us today. We appreciate your message, Rabbi. Do our keep you from being open to doors. You have been in the position of the United States of America. Members, our doctor of the day is Dr. Catherine West.

House Bill 307 by Representative Ballard the 147th and others being titled act to amend Part three, Mark 6, Chapter two, Title 20 of the Fiscal Court of Georgia and Interim Relating Educational Programs under the Quality Based Education Act. So it was to include provisions for students significantly at risk of not achieving great level reading proficiency. This bill emits for the committee on Education Act. Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Rules Committee Substitute. I want you to give the ladies going to be in the well your attention. The lady from Warner Robbins knows a little bit about this subject matter. We appreciate her leadership here. So with that I'm going to recognize Representative Bethany Ballard to present House Bill 307. Representative Ballard. Thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 307 is a continuation of this body's hard bipartisan work and strong commitment to improving literacy that we began in 2023 with the passage of House Bill 538. We are continuing to head in the right direction but more work is needed to ensure that our children and all our children read proficiently. This bill removes outdated language regarding programs that do not align with our new science of reading standards, defines characteristics of dyslexia and dyslexia and creates the structure and composition of the Literacy Coach Coordination Committee. To ensure our state's literacy coaches get quality and uniform training. That's the bill Mr. Speaker and I will stand for any questions. The lady has a question if you are yield to your left representative Rice is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Representative Ballard is it not true that early identification and intervention for students with reading difficulties can significantly improve their academic outcomes? Absolutely. When we identify these children in kindergarten or first grade they might need this much help to get on grade level. When we wait till third or fourth grade they need this much. So it's imperative we identify them early. Good question. Good answer. You have one more question from a gentleman who knows a little bit about education. Chairman Irwin to your right. Thank you Mr. Speaker and does the general lady yield? I yield. Is it not true that ensuring educators receive the necessary training to identify and support students with reading difficulties will lead to a better educational outcome for this entire state including all of our citizens? Absolutely. Great bill. Thank you. Thank you so much. Lady here for one more. One more. The Rips and D Barnes is recognized up to your left up the center aisle. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true that when children are fed a nurse meal that they help some read better and perform academically in school? The lady knows of that of which she speaks. Thanks for this bill. Thank you. Lady has one more. One more and then I'm going get out of here. One more. Rips and D's sale cocks to your right straight up center aisle. Is recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I yield. Is it a true representative? Mallard that this will also contribute to Georgia's economic success by fostering a more skilled and workforce and educated workforce? Absolutely. Children cannot be successful in school or in life without reading proficiently. And with that Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and I would appreciate your favorable consideration. The lady is yielded the well. Thank you for your presentation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none of the previous questions is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Here none of the committee's substitutes are drawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute all by the committee on rules? Here none of the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none of the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is Chairman Hilton rise? Parliament, in quay. State, in quay. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that under your leadership Chairman Irwin and Representative Ballard, we have taken significant strides in literacy and House Bill 307 is yet another step toward making movement to make sure that every child in our state reads as they should. Is that not true? I think General Manose of what he speaks is a team effort. This house is behind literacy and I think the vote on the board clearly demonstrates the quality of this bill and the dedication of this house to literacy in our state. Have all members voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 307, the yeas are 166. The nays are zero. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the House Bill 423-423? The House Bill 423, by Representative Wade of the 9th and others to be entitled to amend Article 12 of Chapter 3, Title 38, and Part 4 of Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 46 of the official go to George Annotated relating emergency communications authority and emergency telephone number 911 system. This bill I refer to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security that committee recommends a disbile due pass. Governor's floor leader, Representative Will Wade is recognized to present the bill. Representative Wade. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to request your favorable support of House Bill 423. This is what has deemed the next gen 911 bill. This is a bill that came out of a study committee that was going to help improve public safety and our overall 56 year old system when 911 was originally introduced in our state. And while some of our communities, very few of them are currently utilizing this technology to help improve and be in a 21st century service level for our citizens, whether it be folks in rural Georgia, suburban Georgia, or in our urban centers, all across our state, we see a great need to utilize current technology. This current bill will amend the purpose and duties and responsibilities of our agency, GIMA Homeland Security, to include curing, implementing and overseeing the next gen 911 service. It will amend the responsibilities of our executive director and representation from information technology, cybersecurity, geographic information systems, commonly known as GIS, and also to the G-Caborda directors. This is going to be critical to help maintain better public safety service delivery and help lives of all Georgians all across the state. With that, Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to answer any questions. And again, I ask for your favor, consideration for this very important agency legislation. Thank you, Representative Wade. You do have several questions. Representative Hefner, to your left about midways back, ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Neal. I certainly do. Sir, thank you so much for bringing this bill. This particular type of legislation would have offered much needed support during the time of Hurricane Helene. When in the Augusta area, we had a complete blackout. There was no land lines and no cellular lines. Our GEMA and FEMA all had problems communicating with the police and the fire department. So this bill circumvents the current system and helps us to have a more adequate process online. Is that correct? That is correct. You know what you speak. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much, sir, for bringing this bill. Thank you. Gentlemen, here for another question. I'll give it for one more question, sir. Representative Neal is recognized for a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Is it not true that this bill will modernize George's emergency response system by implementing next generation 9-1-1 and ensuring faster, more efficient, and accurate emergency responses? The gentleman knows exactly what she speaks. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for this bill. Thank you. All right. If there are no further questions, Mr. Speaker, I look for your favor. You have a couple other questions. That's your choice. I'll one more. One more. I'll take a question from Representative Sanchez. General's recognized to your right. Thank you for bringing this important bill. Does the gentleman yield? I yield. Just a quick question. So is there a language already in the bill about making sure that the location access that these new services provide will only be used for when that note 9-1-1-1 services are being used, like specifically narrowly for those cases? So this is specifically for 9-1-1 usage. That is correct. And so do you yield for further questions? Sure. So when they have access to the location of an individual that will only be used for the specific 9-1-1 case, correct? That is correct. And that would be initiated by the actual person that isn't making that connection to 9-1-1. It is not reversible. Great. Thank you for this great bill. Thank you very much. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield and appreciate your favorable consideration. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? The gentleman's yielded the well. Hearing none of the previous questions ordered, is any objection to agreeing to report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is representative Reese Rice? Parliamentary, angry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry, sir. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that since the implementation of 9-1-1, we have become better responding to the emergencies. And this bill here is going to help us keep up with the times, in addition to systems like 2-1-1 that help with non-emergency situations, doing natural disasters and other trying times for Georgians. I can totally agree with the gentleman. He knows what he speaks. Thank you for the question. Have all members now voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the pass to House Bill 423, then the A's are 163, the nasa zero. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 475? House Bill 475, I represent a gamble with 15th and others to be entitled to amend the Code Section 48740. 0.26, the official go to Georgia and it's related to income tax credits for film gaming, video or digital production. This bill, I'm for the committee on creative arts and entertainment. That committee recommends a dis bill to do pass. We're representing Matthew Gamble, is recognized to present the bill, the gentleman from Carter's bill. You have to gentlemen, your attention please. Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I rise to present to you House Bill 475 today. And what I want to make sure you understand is that this is simply a Department of Economic Development bill that will clean up, clarify and confirm some things as it relates to our film tax credit. This is not an expansion of that. It has nothing to do with that, but we're updating some terminology like the word laser disk is no longer relevant in this credit. So we will be deleting that and then televised in front of commercial advertisements is somewhat of an outdated terminology because not all commercials are televised as they once were when this was originally proposed. We're also clarifying and adding definitions for subscription based platforms, free advertiser supported streaming because those are some new things that are now part of the film industry as well. And then the main thing that this does is if someone applies for the film tax credit and is denied by the Department of Economic Development, they can appeal to an administrative court. And we have to pay for legal fees in defending ourselves as the state in the promulgation of that film tax credit. And so this would create a loser pay scenario where if they appeal and they are ultimately denied in that appeal, they were responsible for paying those attorneys fees. So that is the essence of House Bill 475, just a simple cleanup bill from the Department. And I would ask for your favorable consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen has a question representing Ramon to your left. Yes. Does it gentlemen the yield? I yield. So I don't know if it's because I'm millennial, but we were just wondering what is a laser disk? So a laser disk. For those of us that lived through the 90s, a laser disk was a really big deal. And I don't really see a lot of those out there anymore, but at the time, if you had a laser disk player in the 90s, you had something really special. It would have been like a high definition, 5K, but at the time that was a big deal. We're deleting that terminology because it is an antiquated technology no longer used. So that's what a laser disk is, but I appreciate the question. With that Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, is yield the well? Is any objection to the previous question being ordered here in none of the previous questions ordered? Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The hearing none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shout out this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk. Will you lock the machine? Will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. All members vote this so, Mr. Clerk. Will you lock the machine? All the passage of House Bill 475, the yeas are 161, the nays are two. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 495-495? House Bill 495, I represent Tickie the 134th and others to be entitled. I'm an act to amend Title 20, the official go to Georgia and the State of Related Education, so as to repeal Chapter 18. This bill, I refer to the Committee on Act Culture and Consumer Affairs, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee substitute. Jim Linton, Newsella, representing Mark Robert Dickie, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and distinguished House members. I bring you the SB 495 Georgia Center for rural prosperity and innovation. Georgia's blessed to have the Center for rural prosperity, which was organized six years ago. The rural center exists to build and exist rural communities and businesses to help them prosper. You know, 120 out of 159 counties are considered rural. Many are plagued by population loss, insufficient access to health care, quality education and infrastructure and lack of employment opportunities. And so this center serves as a center for information and research to help with best practices in those communities. The goal is to reconnect the state's rural and urban people in places. This leverage $425 million of investment in those communities. So this bill simply moves this great center from A back over to the Georgia Department of Agriculture. That's really all it does. It keeps its same budget, the budget line in our budget, no change in board or any other responsibilities. It's just better for long term stability and efficiency and just better lines there. So that is what we're asking you to do. It's to simply move this from under USG over to the Department of Agriculture. I'll be happy to take any questions, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, I think he has a question, but I just wanted to thank him for bringing this bill. This center has done a lot of good work working for rural Georgia. And I think this is a good move and we appreciate you bringing it up. For what? See, you're going to yield for a couple of questions. Is it good for a couple of questions? You do have a couple of questions. I'll take one of two. Representative Osteen has her button, master's, ladies recognized. Mr. Speaker, is it not true House Bill 495 will help to bolster rural? Representative, I don't know the answer to your question. I'll go and tell you now. I think Chairman Dickie made that. How you yield? Chairman Dickie, is it not true House Bill 495 will help to bolster rural prosperity across the state? It absolutely true. Thank you for that. I knew the answer to that one. I'm taking sure it is one more. You got one, you'll take one more? I'll take one more. Representative Joe Campbell is recognized to, there he is right to your right. I'm sorry. I was looking for the back, Representative Campbell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does Jim and you? I do. Is it not true that transferring the center for rural prosperity and innovation to the Department of Ag will allow for better coordination of resources and expertise to support George's rural communities? Yes, sir. With that, Mr. Speaker reminds me of a quote by a great philosopher, Contamas Carlisle, it says, the main business is not to see what lies dimly in the distance, but to do what clearly is at hand. So I ask you members to pass this bill this morning, vote affirmative, and thank you for your consideration. Great bill, great sit at your and a great philosopher, Carlisle was. No doubt about that. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Hearing none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the Committee has agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. Representative Osteen, did you have a problem in your inquiry? Did you have an inquiry? You must inadvertently hit your button, I guess, so we won't recognize you then. Have all members now voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 495, the yeas are 167, the nays are zero. This bill, however you see, the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. You need to watch your neighbors over there. I thank you, Dean. And good luck with that, with that group. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 6666? House Bill 66, by the way, if Steven's the only 64th and others, we'll be talking to an act to amend chapter 5c, a total of 48. The 50th, George annotated, relating to title, advalorem, tax on motor vehicles, so to expand the definition of a rental motor vehicle. Mr. Bill, I'm in for the Committee on Ways and Means, that committee recommends a dispelled do pass by Committee substitute. The Dean of the Chattam County delegation, Representative Ron Stevens, is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the House Bill 66 relates to the TAVT and how the tax is paid when purchasing certain vehicles. Currently, we've got some heavily modified vehicles that basically have a chassis that's made specifically for the movie industry. They're rented out once they're made. All this bill does is it moves them to a motor coach titling provision so that it gives them the opportunity to pay half of the tax now and then half of the tax within one year. This is exactly the way the motor coach division works. It's something that will help these folks stay in business as they begin to rent these vehicles. And it does not reduce at all the amount of TAVT that's due. Mr. Speaker, that's what it does, and I'll answer any questions if there are any. Gentlemen, has no questions. You the well. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here he none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the past to the bill? Here he none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass, all in favor of the past to the bill. Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 66, the yeas are 164, the nays are two. This bill, Henry C. the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 377377? House Bill 377, my reps, I do not have to elaborate on the 123rd, and others being titled, act to amend some part one and part four of Article II, Chapter II, Title VIII of the fiscal day, George Anitator relating the general provisions for manufactured or mobile homes, so if the required were limited exceptions to circumstances under which manufactured home shall become real property. This bill, ever further, the Committee on Banks and Banking, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. And gentlemen, from the granite capital of the world. Isn't that right? The Albertan Georgia, Representative Leverich is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I have House Bill 377. This is a bill that will encourage the availability of credit for workforce housing within the state. It has to do with manufactured housing. What I call a mobile home, sometimes a trailer, but everybody in the business, their head explodes and use that term. This basically has to do with a manner by which you can surrender the title to a manufactured home after it's located on real estate. This bill will simplify that process. It will hope it is thought that it would encourage the presence of lenders in that space so that folks can get loans for these and it will streamline the process of converting a loan which is based on the status of the mobile home as personal property into a loan, like a mortgage loan which is based on it being converted to real estate. This has to do with a existing process in the law where you surrender that title and file a certificate of permanent location. This just tries to streamline that and encourage it because it protects the status of any lenders as if it's converted. So again, it's the idea is it will encourage the availability of credit in this kind of marketplace. So we're hoping it will help with workforce housing in the state. And that's basically the bill. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to answer any questions. You have a question to you, Leopold. Fry has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it gentlemen you? Absolutely, yes sir. Isn't it true that I'm sure it could use this legislation about a year ago when I was trying to get an abandoned trailer off my property. And I could not move it because we could not find the title to it. And we had to go through about a three or four month process before I could even enter the building because the trailer is treated like a vehicle, not a house. And this helps it be treated like a house. As we are fond of saying in this building, the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Thank you sir, appreciate you. Thank you. Gentlemen, here for one more. Yes sir. Representative Wade.

You're right in the back has a question. Does it look at you? Yes sir, I'll yield. Is it not true that House Bill 377 simplifies the tiling process for manufactured homeowners which will reduce bureaucratic delays and also will add to the real property tax base for local counties and cities? I am truly impressed by the level of knowledge and understanding the gentleman displays. Well I was going to vote yes now I have to reconsider. Thank you. And surprised. Well yes a little bit miss Speaker but he impressed me today. Gentlemen, I have a question. Questions on the yield the well and ask your favour consideration House Bill 377.

Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Have no rise. Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that as the former motor vehicle director for Richmond County it is a relief to have this measure in place for constituents who would normally have to go get a bonded title and pay the expenses in order to be able to get the title for this vehicle? I'm sure it will make life easier but we want you to stay here. We don't want you to go back there and assume that responsibility again. So the lady knows what she speaks on this question. Thank you for the question. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 377, the Yays are 166, the Nays are 0.

Was vetoed by the Governor due to a fiscal note.

It makes it lets the employees have a ability to pre-tax contributions to a high deductible savings account if they have a high deductible insurance plan. At this time I will consider your favourable consideration. Thank you. At least I didn't amend my amendment this year. You're getting better at me too. We're both the working progress.

My dear colleagues, I rise before you respectfully to ask for your favorable consideration for House Bill 373.

Members we're moving on with the rules calendar now of course we're on House Bill 240 as the clerk just read the caption. Representative no Williams is recognized to present the will bill representative Williams. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members this bill should sound familiar to you from last year it was a trigger leads bill. It passed out of this house unanimously. The data slow death on day 40 across the hall. Basically this is a consumer protection act when you're getting alone a mortgage loan. Basically what trigger leads are they're generated when a lender pulls a consumer credit report through trans union, aquifax, experience and then they sell those consumer information to other lenders. This bill helps to do is to stop unwanted solicitation when someone applies for a loan. They still can use their current mortgage or their vendor but this just stops the companies from selling to other companies and then you getting those inundated with taxes and emails and text messages trying to get you to switch. And a lot of times people's credit is ruined. There's a lot of fraud and deception and we had a lot of bankers calling I'm warning this past this year. It comes 100% by the mortgage bankers association. It's a great bill for the consumers and it's a great bill for the state of Georgia. With that Mr. Speaker I'll yield for any questions. gentleman has a question to you right representative Martin. Is that a nice work question. gentleman yield for a question. I certainly do. I could have come down to speak on your bill and support it but I'll ask you this question. Isn't it true that what you are doing here is in fact stopping fraudulent actors in the process because you and I have talked isn't true that I am aware of cases where people not only get these trigger leads and communicate with the loan originator, the customer as if they are the original broker that the gentleman the citizen went to and this could also cut out that as a potential for unscrupulous folks that would take that. Isn't that true. Yes sir that is correct. It will help stop harassment, deception and fraud and predatory lending and the gentleman knows of what he speaks. gentleman yield for one more from representative Wade. Yes sir. To your right in the back. Representative Wade, did you have a question. Yes sir gentleman yield. Sure. Is it not true the House Bill 240 will enhance consumer protection and reduce confusion among potential home buyers in the buying process as well as homeowners in the refinance process. As a banker I know you know what you speak and I appreciate you asking that question. Thank you sir. Appreciate your support on House Bill 240. Mr. Speaker I will yield the well. Thank you sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. The gentleman is yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered.

This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read a caption of House Bill 303. House Bill 303. I will read a gillier to the 160 second and others to be entitled. The next gentleman chapter 33, a total 50 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to state flag seals and other symbols. So it's to provide replacement of a monument to honor the original 33. This bill that referred to the committee on state properties that committee recommends to disbue due pass. Representative Gilly already is recognized to present the bill from any Carl Gillyard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise at a pinnacle moment to present House Bill 303. My brothers and sisters in 1868 there were 33 courageous men. 25 of them were AME ministers. 33 original members of the House in the Senate. They were African American Republicans. They were courageous Americans. The original 33 stood up so that we can sit down. This bill is a bill that commemorates 33 great Americans. Let me just briefly say their names. Ellie Barnes, James Ward Porter, Henry McNeil Turner, William Gilford, William Henry Harrison, Thomas M. Allen, Thomas Beard, Edwin Belcher, George H. Clawer, Abraham Coby, Romulus Moore, John T. Coulston, Madison Davis, Monday Floyd, F. H. Fyrell, Samuel Gardner, William A. Golden, my great great great cousin, Elysees L. Houston, James M. Sims, Philip Joyner, George Linder, Philip Lumpkin, Peter O'Neill, Alfred Richardson, Alexander Stone, Abraham Smith, John Warren, Samuel Williams, Tunis Campbell Jr., Malcolm Clayburn, Reverend Tunis Campbell Sr., Aaron Bradley, and Mr. George Wallace. They were the original 33. They were not allowed to serve in this general assembly. In the 1870, they petitioned to come back and serve. Unfortunately, 14 of them were lynched. I want to thank the Dean of this house. I want to thank the State Properties Committee for having the posture to do what is right to salute 33 great Americans. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you on today for having the chairman of the rules coming. I want to thank you for having the posture to salute 33 original members of this United States of America. We ask today that this bill only simplifies to have 33 names that were not allowed to be inside of the walls of this Capitol to be able to be placing their names. Today I ask for your fable consideration of House Bill 303 to salute these great Americans. Mr. Speaker and members of this great body, I yield the well unless you have any questions. Gentlemen has no questions, but we do have some speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. Gentlemen, as you are the well, Representative, I would also like to thank you for your recognize to speak to the bill, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On colleagues, today I want to talk about House Bill 303. This is a bill close to my heart because it's about 100 and 33 very important, extraordinary people. These were the first African American legislators elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1868. Just three years after the Civil War, imagine the courage it took for these men like Tunis Campbell and Rick McNeil Turner and Philip Joyner to step forward to serve in a time when this cause of slavery was still raw and the promise of equality was very, very fragile. They were elected by their communities, but that same year their service was cut short because they were expelled from the General Assembly simply because of the color of their skin. This story is one of resilience and hope, but also one of injustice for over 150 years of their contributions have been overlooked. Their sacrifices for gotten HB303 is going to change that. It simply calls for a monument to honor the original 33. It last attribute to their courage and a reminder of the progress we've made and the work still to be done. This monument isn't just about the past, it is about the future. It's about teaching our children the importance of representation, justice, inequality.

It's about saying we see you, we honor you, and your legacy matters. And let's be clear, this monument is going to be funded through private donors, not taxpayer dollars. It's a community effort to write a historical wrong and celebrate the pioneers who picked the way for so many of us like myself. So I ask you to join me in supporting HB303, let us honor the original 33, not just for what they endured, but for what they achieved. Let's ensure their story is remembered, their sacrifices acknowledged, and their legacy celebrated. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield. Thank you. The gentleman is you to the well. Representative Holly is recognized to, Representative Holly is recognized to speak to the bill. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. I'm just saying words to this moment today. I thought it best to remember the earlier eloquence of a time in which those members, who themselves were members, spoke their own truth. At this time, I would like to give voice to words that were spoken in the chamber of the House, not particularly in this building, but in the House that is in Millageville, of which my ancestor helped to build. Spoke this Henry McNeil Turner, founder of the Georgia Republican Party. Mr. Speaker, before proceeding to argue this question, opponents and intrinsic merits, I wish the members of this House to understand the position that I take. I hope that I am a member of this body, therefore Sir Ajao, neither fawn or cringed before any party, nor stooped to beg them for my rights. Some of my colored fellow members and the course that their remarks took occasion to appeal to the sympathies of members of the opposite side and to eulogize their character of amenity. It reminds me very much, Sir, of slaves begging under the lash. I am here to demand my rights and to hurl thunderbolts at the men who would dare to cross the threshold of my manhood. I claim the rights of a man. Am I not a man because I happen to be of a darker hue than honorable gentleman around me? Let me see whether I am not. I want to convince the House today that I am entitled to my seat here. Am I a man? Have I a soul to save as have you? Because God saw it fit to make some red, some white, and some black, and some brown, or we to sit here in judgment upon what God has seen fit to do. If you deny me the right of my constituents to have representation here, because it is a privilege, then Sir, I will show you that I have asked many privileges as the widest man on this floor. If I am not permitted to occupy a seat here for the purpose of representing my constituents, I want to know how white men can be permitted to do so. Never so help me, God. Shall I be a political slave. I am not now speaking for those colored men who sit with me in this House. Nor do I say that they endorse my sentiments, but assisting Mr. Lincoln, that is the President. To take me out a servile slavery did not intend to put me in my race into political slavery. If they did, let them take away my ballot. I do not want it, and shall not have it. I don't want to be a mere tool of that sort. I have been a slave long enough already. The colored men who are unable to express themselves with all the clearness and dignity and force of rhetorical eloquence are laughed at and derisioned by the democracy of this country. It reminds me very much of the man who looked at himself in a mirror imagining that he was addressing another person and exclaiming, my God, how ugly are you? These gentlemen do not consider for a moment the dreadful hardships with which these people have endured, and especially those who in any way are endeavored to acquire an education. You may expel us gentlemen, but I firmly believe that you will someday resent it. The black man cannot protect the country if the country does not protect him, and if tomorrow a war should arise, I would not raise a musket to defend a country where my man who is denied. The fashionable way in Georgia, when hard work is to be done, is for the white man at that time to sit at ease while the black man does the work. But I will say this much to the colored men of Georgia as I should be killed in this campaign. I may have no opportunity of telling them at any other time. Never lift a finger, nor raise a hand in defense of Georgia until Georgia acknowledges that you are men, and invest you with the rights pertaining to manhood. Pay your taxes, however, obey all orders from your employers. Take good counsel from friends. Work faithfully, earn and honest living, and by your conduct you can be good citizens. You may expel us gentlemen by your votes, but today while you do it, remember that there is a just God in heaven whose all-seeing eye beholds alike the acts of the oppressor and the oppressed, and who despite the machinations of the wicked never fails to vindicate the course of justice and the sanctity of his own handy words. I've concluded with him in the Emeagwali's speech, let's honor him by showing him that the Georgia that exists today is not the one of the past because we can honor the blessings of our past by recognizing much greater truths today. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed, will vote no, and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted?

And last but not least, to the impeccable and the amazing coach, Buffy Burson. She has just done phenomenal for that program. So way to go, Nighthawks. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck, ladies. We'll have a few more. Bring it home. We'd love to have them down. Representative Ramon is recognized for an afternoon order. Ladies recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And colleagues, Ramadan, Mubarak. I know it feels like it's starting earlier. That's because it is Ramadan is starting this weekend. So for those who are going to be observing, including myself, that means abstaining from food and yes, water. I will say that was definitely a record breaking question asking timing. So thank you to the gentleman that did earlier. But during this time, your constituents who are observing will be obviously fasting from food and water, but also engaging in more time doing prayers and being with family and friends. I would also like to invite any of you that are interested in fasting with me. You're welcome too. I would love to have you. So thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Representative Bell. You're recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Bell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise to honor our promenade, Dennis of Black History Month. Dr. Roy Charles Bell, a promenade, and Lancer, Dennis and civil rights activists, helped open the doors. So African Americans could have proper access in health care at Grady Hospital. In 1962, he sued Grady in a federal case that led to the Atlanta Hospital and others nationwide to provide equal care. Bell versus Fulton DeCap Hospital Authority, he segregated hospitals in the state of Georgia and across the country. Bell moved Dr. Bell moved to Atlanta after finishing dental school at Howard University. He was welcomed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who opened the, Dr. Martin King, Jr., who was the cousin of the dentist's wife, Clarice Mary Jetta White and other civil rights leaders. He joined the efforts to end Jim Crow. Dr. Bell was one of the first African American dentist to practice in Atlanta and did so from 1959 to 1979. He served as the, he also served on the commission of human rights in Fair Housing and Sacramento from 1981 to 1983. And the dental consultant from in Rockville, Maryland from 1983 to 2003 after returning to this city. During the civil rights movement, Dr. Bell served as the special projects coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He processes a command among other issues, the Pay and Road Barricade, that was erected to keep African Americans from moving to the white neighborhoods in Southwest Atlanta. He works in discrimination and practices of his profession. To, he fouled a lawsuit in 1964, they led to the end of this segregation of the Georgia Dental Association and subsequently the American Dental Association. He wasn't the first blackness to join the organization, but in 1968 he was accepted into the fold. He and other civil rights leaders were invited to the White House to serve as the citation for President Lyndon B. Johnson for the efforts. In 1996, the Georgia State Senate passed a resolution to commend him on the desegregation work. He earned a law degree from Woodford Wilson College in 1990, excuse me, in the mid 1970s. He will forever be remembered as a father and a visionary and civil rights activist who dared to join, who dared to stand against Jim Crow. Dr. Bell was mentioned in the 16th chapter of Dr. King's autobiography. It's devoted to the all-beening movement, the terrible jail conditions and the visitors that called on the civil rights leader. Soon, the Reverend in Walker came over to Dr. Roy Charles Bill from Atlanta in Lourdes Still and a writer from the Jet Magazine. He instructed Ralph's teeth and said he would be arranged for the chief preacher to get us some food packages. I told him that we needed this because we were starved on, that we were starved on the jailhouse food. Additionally, Dr. Bell survived his relatives who are here today to join us. Avery Bell Sanders is in our audience. Please stand. Thanks for your time. You're the will. Representative Parsons is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Chairman Parsons. Thank you, thank you, Speaker. I am rising up here to speak to take a black history moment. Today is the, I thought the day was the last day. It actually ends tomorrow, well, March the first. But I rise in honor of a gentleman named Grant Gray. I know him as Coach Gray. He was born in Pennsylvania. He became a basketball star up there. And then later, he moved down and later after high school and in college, he moved down to West Virginia. And played there at West Virginia State College where I would eventually go to school. College at, it was segregated until about 1962, something like that. And I started there in 1965. But Coach Gray, like a lot of coaches, told great stories. And one story in particular, I remember, I remember a lot of them, the one in particular, I think of. And this is the story. I think there's a lesson in it, probably more than one lesson. He said when he was a kid, growing up in the depression, hard times, family cutting by shoes, there was some government agency that provided, started providing some shoes for children. They had molded rubber souls. So his parents got him a pair of those shoes. They just were kid in school. So he walks to school the first day, he has him snow on the ground. He didn't know, or it didn't really care as a kid, but on the bottom of that the soul of that shoe, it was imprinted in the rubber. It was in there the symbol of the federal agency that provided the shoes and the name of the agency. So some of the other kids, they saw that imprint in the snow as he was walking by and said, look at Gray, his parents cutting by him shoes, they must be broke. Well that hurt a little guy's feelings of course, but he had warm graphite. But the thing the story is, he said by the end of the winter, every kid had those same shoes and everyone that were making the same imprint in the snow. So I honor Coach Gray. He was a great coach. He had coach basketball for a long time. He had a stroke and he was confined to wheelchair and the college then moved him over to coaching football. He had a great record in basketball and he had a very good record in football and I just raced on our coach Gray and Gray. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Who represented Treyah now wants you to give this gentleman your attention. He's going to make himself look good right here. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to take this moment. Members of the assembly to you wish my mom a happy birthday today. She's a two year strong fighting lung cancer. But I also want to take this moment because her and I have been reminiscing about the last 50 years since she arrived in America and the Vietnam War will celebrate commemorate its 58th anniversary on April 30th. So thank you to the members in this assembly who fought in that war. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Happy birthday to you mom. And best of luck with her health challenges as well.

But this, my moment in Black history is the Temptations, or an American vocal group from Detroit, Michigan, who released a series of successful singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960s and the 1970s featuring five male vocalists and dancers. Oldest William who we actually had here last year doing session, Elbridge Al Bryant and Melvin Franklin and Eddie Kendrick's and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin who was the lead vocalist on a number of groups, biggest hits including My Girl, talking about My Girl, Ain't Too Proud The Big 1966 and I wish you would reign 1967 over the course of their career.
