you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I'm going to go ahead. On our members of the Georgia House, the representatives, and to our speaker of the Georgia House, I want to thank you for your dedication to our people within the state of Georgia. As I go to the Word of the Lord, the Word says, whatever you do, work at it with your whole heart. As working for the Lord and not for human masters, the King James version would say, do all things heartily as unto the Lord and not pleasing men. And what that means to us is that we have a great work to be diligent to have a time of devotion and certainly to be dedicated to the divine direction. We are called to work with dedication and commitment in our hearts. This gives us our sense of purpose. And as I was studying my devotion, numbers came up to mine. One of those numbers was the number six, which represents work and it also represents man. And as I was thinking through it, there was a chapter in Nehemiah. It was the sixth chapter. And it dealt with the assessment of how we must look at the things around us and be diligent in our work. The man Nehemiah worked very diligently to make sure and to make certain that the wall that had been broken was rebuilt. He took a time to assess the damage. And there's some damage that had to be dealt with. And he did this by going from diligence to devotion. He went to God. He began to talk to him and he gave him his directives. And when you get directives from God, it seems like you're going to have help from the sidelines, but God gave help from the inside. And I say you're going to get some inside help. When any person knows anything about God's prayers, we say we pray back to God. We say to what God said to us, this is what he did. And when Nehemiah did it as was stated in Colossians 3, the scripture says that he not only had an assessment, he got an assortment of helpers. And then assortment of helpers worked together on one assignment. And that was to get the wall back up again. With that mindset, their devotion, like that of a teacher, spends extra time ensuring every student understands showing them how to be committed and working beyond their duties. I would say to us, keep working. Stay diligent. Stay devoted. And lastly, be dedicated. Dedicated like a medical doctor, searching for a cure driven by a vision for the Oath of your future. Much like the farmer, you are house of representatives. You labor to cultivate policies that nourish our state. And with that devotion of dedicated teaching and dedicated working, you are working to help us understand how you craft laws and enlighten the uplift. When I think through this, I think about how God is representing all things in everything he says and does, and all things represent him and how they live and how they come together. So with that thought in mind, as we carry out our duties with diligence, devotion and dedication, let us remember our work as we work in the house. I think about the work that Nelma had to do. The book says that after he did all those things within 52 days, everything had to be completed. And though he was taunted, tempted and tried by those who were sitting on the sidelines, every day they came back, every day they came with another thing. But after all these things, he says, I'm doing a great work and I cannot come down. House of representatives, you're doing a great work. Keep on doing what God has called you to do and don't come down. At this time, I want to pray.

with you and as we stand to pray. Heavenly Father, we gather today with gratitude for the privilege of serving the people of Georgia. As we care at our duties, God us to work with diligence, ensuring our actions reflect care and thoughtfulness. In stealing us devotion to our principles, to the welfare of those we represent, grant us dedication so our efforts are unwavering and focused on creating a better tomorrow. May the legacy we leave be one of compassion, integrity, and progress, ensuring that the future generations look upon our work with pride and hope. In the name of Jesus we pray, we seek your wisdom, strength and unity. Amen. Let us look to the flag. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Bishop, thank you for making the journey from Wakecross. Making the journey from Wakecross and thank you for serving your congregations, but also thanks for serving the people of Wakecross's mayor.

House Resolution 407 by reps of a year to the 150 second Barton of the fifth gamble, 15 persons to 44th, curl the 118th and others, a resolution, recognizing and commending meag power on its 50th anniversary. I'm going to recognize a former mayor. I remember this House and some distinguished folks who do a lot for our state. Dr. Singh, bill or curator is recognized to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my privilege to recognize and command meag power on its 50th anniversary. Meag or the municipal elected authority of Georgia was created by an act of the General Assembly on March 18, 1975. For 50 years, meag power has remained steadfast in its mission to serve the needs, the electric needs of 49 participants, cities in Georgia, or communities in Georgia. This foster economic growth, energy security, and enhancing the quality of life for millions of Georgians. The participants very, very greatly in size and character. You have large communities like Marietta, to small communities like Brinson near the Florida line with just several hundred folks. Meag has demonstrated exceptional leadership in the delivery of reliable and affordable power. Meag has a diverse energy portfolio that includes nuclear, coal, gas, and hydroelectric. Meag is a proud owner of 22 percent of plant vocal and vocal units 3 and 4. The plant vocal expansion has contributed to the Georgia being a leader in the energy sector all over the US. One of the reasons that folks are looking to Georgia to come do business. Through the five decades, meag power has earned a reputation for excellence in governance, operational efficiency, and physical responsibility. Meag's contingency success is a testament to the leadership of its management employees and participant communities who have made public power real asset in Georgia. I have personally seen being a former mayor and meag board member of the value of being a meag community. Today we have with us President and CEO Jim Fuller, Senior Vice President Steve Jackson, and we have some board members with us, and they volunteer their time and do a great job, former House member, and Mayor of Marietta, Steve Thundertomlin, Tim Houston, Aquarth Alderman, Greg Thompson, Council member, and Monroe, and Eric Wilson Mayor for SAI. And then we've got a great group up in the gallery also. Let's give these folks a hand. I'm going to the chairman one for a second before he leaves up here.

Representative Derek Jackson is first chairman Bonner in Representative Bill. Representative Derek Jackson is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Jackson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. Today I rise about an issue that's at the heart of our nation's values and our commitment to those who have served unsolvable. The proposed 87,000 federal job cuts within the VA predominantly affected military veterans which comprise one third of agency employees. This threatens to undermine the very foundation of honor, respect and gratitude that we owe our veterans. The Veterans Administration is not just another government agency. It is the lifeline for millions of men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting our freedoms. These veterans have faced unimaginable challenges and hardships and upon their return they deserve our unwavering support. The VA provides health care, benefits and essential services that help veterans reintegrate into civilian life. The proposed job cuts within the VA can jeopardize the quality of care and services that our veterans desperately need and rightfully deserve. Reduced staffing levels within an ever-lipply lead to longer waiting times, decreased access to specialized care and declined the overall quality of services. This is simply unacceptable. Our veterans have already sacrificed too much and they should not have to face additional hurdles to access the care and support they need. One of the most commendable aspects of the VA is the employment of military veterans. Veterans working with the VA bring a unique perspective, empathy, understanding that they cannot replicate. They have walked in the same booths and faced similar struggles and their presence within the agency is invaluable. We have a moral and ethical obligation to stand by our veterans, to honor their service and to ensure that they receive the best possible care and support. This is not a matter of politics, it is a matter of principle and with that, Mr. Speaker, are you the well? Is there any representative Bail here? Chairman Bonner has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I just wanted to take a moment to just speak about how proud we are to have one of our former colleagues, one of our former congressmen, Doug Collins, as our new Secretary of the Veterans Administration. I have been in communication with Secretary Collins and I am happy to report that he is doing an incredible job for us. While it is true that we will be finding some efficiencies within the veteran and administration, the sole purpose of finding these efficiencies is to do one thing and that is to serve our veterans better. I know like many of you you have had interactions with veterans in your community and oftentimes those interactions with the veterans administration is less than positive. What we are attempting to do is to streamline that administration so that we can be more responsive to our veterans, we can get more benefits faster to our veterans so that they get the health coverage they need, the medical benefits they have deserved and they have earned in a way that is more efficient. Right now it is taking claims sometimes upwards of three to five years to adjudicate. That is unacceptable and I think we can all agree that there is plenty of opportunities within that Veterans Administration to find efficiencies and that is solely what we are trying to do and I am here to congratulate Secretary Doug Collins on that effort. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise to stand on the side of justice. It has become before you today. I have come before you today heavy in the heart but with the righteous fire that cannot be extinguished. It is time to call out evil for what it is. It is time to call out the name of wickedness that has slithered into our streets, masquerading and law and order and it is time for us to unite as people of conscience against those who seek to brutalize the most vulnerable against us. I am here to offer my deepest condolences to the victims and to cadem in the strongest possible terms to the disgraceful actions of Da Vinci Barcello who is in so-called sweet armor frontline enforcement. As for some of those who may call safe but let it be clear there is nothing safe about armed visual anties who prowl our streets terrorizing our homies destroying what little they do have and trampling on the dignity of human life. This past weekend these so-called cowards descended upon the sacred grounds near Ebenezer Baptist Church a place that stands as a beacon of hope, justice and a church that the great Dr. Martin Luther King himself preached the gospel of love and nonviolence and what do they do? They slashed and destroyed tents of those who have nowhere else to go. They left men, women and children exposed to the elements robbing them of not just only shelter but the very humanity they have. What kind of person leads such an operation? What kind of person rises their hand against the poor and calls to justice? What kind of coward finds satisfaction in kicking the already downtrodden? To Da Vinci Barcello and the safe visual anties hear me and hear me will. Your actions are not righteous acts. They are not just acts. They are acts of cruelty and they are in a front to everything that is good, holy and just. They are not just on the side. You do not stand on the side of the law in order but on the side of fear and oppression. You are not protectors. You are our prosecutors. And history will remember you as such. The Bible warns us against such wickedness. Proverbs 14, 1431 tells us whoever oppresses the poor, whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt to their maker. But whoever is kind to the needy under God. You claim to be enforces of order but truth but you deny that very God that condemns us to love our neighbor, to lift up the downtrodden and to show mercy. We are, we will not stand highly by while we turn our streets into hunting grounds for those without a voice. We will not be silent while we disagree. The legacy of a church built on the foundation of civil rights and moral courage. And we will not let them stand unanswered. This visual antivirus must end. Those responsible must be held accountable. And the homeless brothers and sisters we see you, we love you and we stand with you. And we will not let this injustice go unchallenged. Dr. King once said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The actions of safe are threats to not only just the homeless but to the very fabric of our state, the morals and our humanity. Let us stand firm in the face of hate and let us send a clear message to save. To anyone who dares to follow this path, you, your reign, a tear must end now. I now ask you for a brief moment of silence for the victims of those who suffer this in cities act. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker, you at the will. Members, we have a former member of this house on the floor of the Jane Kid from over in Athens. It's good to see you. Good to have you back, Jane. Come on up.
