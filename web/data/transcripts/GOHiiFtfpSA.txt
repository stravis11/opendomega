ad valorem taxation of property so to
revise the language required to be
included in the notices of current
assessments
miss bill i'm referring to the committee
on ways and means that committee
recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes
chairman martin to present the bill
thank you
mr speaker ladies and gentlemen uh every
year from our local taxing jurisdictions
we get out of the lorem tax notices
and depending on the type property you
have property you have you have ways
that you can appeal that
if we pass this bill what this does is
then it enables the taxpayer to have
another option if you're the owner of
tangible personal property which would
be machinery in your manufacturing plant
in excess of two hundred thousand
dollars you will be given an option to
appeal that to a hearing officer with
appeal to the supr uh superior court
today you do not have that option you
either have to go to the board of
equalization or to arbitration and that
slows down the courts because typically
three homeowners don't know the details
about uh
the complexity that may be in this type
of tangible personal property so mr
speaker what this aims to do is give
taxpayers more options for appeal smooth
out the process and help counties get
their tax digest right sooner with that
as a house favorable consideration for
this taxpayer friendly measure if there
are no questions i'll yield the well

house district chairman england to
present the bill
thank you mr chairman good afternoon
everyone
that was as bad as the good morning was
this morning for the speaker good
afternoon everyone
that's that's a little better
that's a little better sounds like your
lunch might be putting you to sleep so
if it does that's all right because i'm
about to otherwise
so
well um
we are here to take up house bill 911
which will be the fy 23 spending plan
for our state
as always and i would be remiss if i
didn't an awful lot of thank yous are
are needed here today
thank you to our subcommittees and
subcommittee
chairs that have spent hours upon hours
upon hours working on this budget you
have before you this afternoon
thank you to the governor's office and
opb for their work on sharing
information and helping us understand
what it was that they had done in their
initial par portions of the budget
but
certainly not least
is our house budget and research office
staff
and i like it that they're coming in in
a parade here now
but
y'all
you all know
and have seen
these young folks
scattered around this capitol every day
and
the work that they continuously do
throughout the year
and would it not be for them we would
not be able to have this budget laying
on your desk
that is grammatically and numerically
correct
and
just the the hours that they spend on it
martha and christine
are constantly running all of the rest
of the crew is constantly running and
that's exactly what they're doing right
now is running to get over here
you can see who the younger and faster
ones are i guess
or maybe they were just closer in the
building but
yes i know i'll pay for that later i'm
sure
the 30.2 billion dollar budget that you
see in front of you today
represents a 10.8 percent increase over
last year
and what a difference a year makes
i'm not going to take a whole lot of
time here on the front end to talk about
the economy or the usual contextual
information
that we share to introduce a budget
because i cannot wait to walk you
through
the end product of your work
you can look at the size of this
document tell that the members of the
subcommittees worked as teams to
construct a deliberate and thoughtful
plan
for funding the future
our future our state's future
as we walk through the budget i have
four key thing
themes that i want you to remember
trust funds
this is the premier budget reflecting
the nine dedicated revenue streams put
into the new budget structure via house
bill 511 from last year
the agricultural trust fund the
hazardous waste trust fund the fireworks
trust fund the solid waste trust fund
the state children's trust fund the
georgia transit trust fund the
transportation trust fund and the trauma
care trust fund
along with the wildlife endowment trust
funds are presented with transparent
earnings and where they are statutorily
required to be spent
just look at the revenue cover page of
your tracking document on page 37 and
the governors of the governor's budget
book
to access that information easily
and and
historically but also for your reference
today
education education is always our number
one priority
k-12 appropriations sets an all-time
record level of state funding at
11.8
billion dollars
11.8 billion dollars
for the most important investment this
state has
qbe is fully funded and teachers and
cert certificated personnel get the last
installment of their promised five
thousand dollar raises at a cost of two
hundred ninety one point seven million
dollars which together with nearly two
twenty million in an increase in pre-k
teachers gives us an investment of over
300 million in this one item alone
in higher education we addressed
affordability and provided enhancements
for scholarship amounts as well as
funding on just under 230 million to the
university's teaching formula
as tuition to replace operating funds
derived from student fees initiated over
a decade ago
salary increases
nearly every single program in this
budget including includes the first cola
for including a first cola for state
retirees in 14 years
puts forth an increase to address the
literally hours of testimony regarding
state workforce needs and the
competition to retain its staff
the five thousand dollar cola
lifts the entire workforce and accounts
for roughly six hundred and ten million
dollars and in the house version as a co
is accompanied by an additional targeted
increases where turnover is crippling
our ability to perform the very core
services that a state should provide
our correctional officers in the
department of juvenile justice and
department of corrections
leave at a rate that sometimes reaches
90 percent
in that same vein behavioral health
staff at our state hospitals nurses and
aides
who care for those with mental health
issues and criminal histories
have a collective turnover rate of just
over 50 percent
which directly impedes the number of
beds that we can provide to allow for
treatment
we've asked public health nurses
to be our front line in the coved army
to go into homes and clinics to provide
safety net care but but because the
demand for nurses is so high
compensation competition from private
entities has spiked an irresistible
opportunity for them to leave
and while the increases of these types
of jobs have significant emotional
appeal there are areas of state
government where the turnover affects
our ability to operate at the uppermost
level of efficiency
and the need to stem the turnover in
these positions appeals to our sense of
fiscal responsibility
for example this body wanted
transparency in spending is just as we
noted a while ago
with the trust funds but we need our
auditors to help guarantee that the
department is paying anywhere from 12 to
33 percent below other state and local
governments
the house version deliberately targets
market raises to higher turnover jobs
and we've added almost 28.7 million for
correctional officers 16.3 million for
public health nurses 20.2 million for
behavioral health nurses and aids and
adjustments for state auditors epd
engineers death investigator specialist
and metro atlanta troopers and more
the growing magnitude of this issue
compelled us to request a market study
or salary market study through the human
resources division of the department of
administrative services on line 12.5.2
salaries as a recruitment retention tool
are fortified by enhancements to the
state's benefit package
about 154 million to provide retirement
and leave adjustments
in total the house version of the fy23
budget uses a third of all new funding
to reinvest in taxpaying georgians who
are
our workforce
major policy investments are included
law enforcement in addition to the
salaries we discussed this document
embodies the criminal justice reform
package that we've been working on and
expands access and success of the
accountability court model
on your desk under chairman's hitch
chairman hitchens card you have a
summary
necessary and helpful because the
comprehensive and visionary approach we
are taking to strengthen these
successful components across our entire
law enforcement spectrum
direct investments of over 65 million
that will have indirect savings in
investigation and evidence processing
times
accurate evidence officer training and
counseling and the list goes on
our efforts to delineate the proper
placement of persons involved in legal
and correctional systems because of
behavioral health issues
is part of that vision and having
appropriate and quality placement and
treatment options go hand in hand with
lasting positive outcomes
so it brings me to behavioral health as
we emerge from the years
of the us department of justice
oversight and building our
infrastructure the need continues to
grow
and thankfully the stigma is starting to
shrink yes we are stringing the pearls
together
for legally related
far legally related interactions and
behavioral health but there is a high
demand for all of us to have access to
services
for some it may be one time for others
it may be a lifetime
the second summary on your desk under
chair lady dempsey's card is a road map
of the new funding
that in some instances blends with law
enforcement but is comprehensive and
addressed in multiple agencies and
totals nearly 100 million dollars in the
ongoing stabilization
and
striving to expand capacity for access
to for services to all georgians
so if you will take out your tracking
document and you'll find on your desk as
i mentioned just a second ago
the
kind of briefs from chairman hitchens
and from
chair lady dempsey you'll also find a
very helpful graphic as it relates to
transportation funding
and i strongly recommend that
and and actually it's one of the the
best ways i've seen to understand how
our transportation funding formula works
in the state and you'll also find under
my card
a copy of the budget highlight so
i just want to make sure that you know
that those things are already on your
desks so if you will take out the
tracking document we'll run through it
so under the georgia senate there are no
changes
under the georgia house representative
you'll see the annualization of the
colas for our employees
also the 40 hours of earned annual leave
to allow our employees to take that and
adjustments to the employment employee
retirement system so there'll be state
changes that are common throughout the
document i will not
note each one of those as i come to
those
so under the joint offices of the
general assembly
you'll see one addition there
3.1.6 for legislative operations an
increase in price there for our lexus
nexus contract
to allow accessibility for us to be able
to look at code and for our constituents
to be able to look at code
under 3.1.7 just removing some one-time
funds there
moving on to audits and accounts and
i'll remind you again that under audits
and accounts audits and accounts is
actually a sort of a branch of the
general assembly so we have to make all
the changes there the governor
loads what they send to them but
otherwise any changes we load
then moving on to
uh 4.1.8 you'll see that one actually
moves over in just a second to line
4.3.1
the reduction of some one-time funds at
4.1.9
and then just asking for ongoing work
and utilizing existing funds at 4.1.10
for an audit of the spending of the arp
dollars across the state
4.3.1 you'll see the item that was moved
from earlier under the court of appeals
again the statewide changes and things
that we have to add or delete there
because the governor and the governor's
office opb cannot
5.1.4 you'll see an increase in funds
for per diem adjustments
as our per diem increases with the
general assembly their their per diem is
is tied to ours so we have to do an
increase there eliminating funds for the
one-time development of the case
management system there's a reduction
there
and you'll look over at 5.2.6 and 5.2.7
true up at 5.2.6 in relation to the cola
and on 5.2.7 just saying no to that
additional
judicial assistant
under judicial counsel section 6.
restoration at 6.4.1 of some operating
funds that we'd had to reduce in
previous years
moving on then
to juvenile courts no changes there
prosecuting attorneys
you'll see it eight point two point
twelve thirteen and fourteen
funds for one additional assistant d.a
in the three circuits that are being
created this year
at 8.2.10
you'll see four additional assistant
da's for the juvenile courts and the
bill forsyth chattahoochee northern and
and patula
judicial circuits that's part of our
house law enforcement package
i'll also note that at 8.2.6 and 8.2.7
are two additions there that are part of
the leo package as well
you'll see some
eliminations of funds on things that
were put in before they were aware that
the five thousand dollar cola was going
out so we've made those true adjustments
there
8.3.10 still under prosecuting attorneys
you'll see an adjustment for the payroll
specialist position and then elimination
of the funds
for our prosecutor position that's not
needed just at this time under superior
courts
you'll see a few changes at 9.1.4
9.2.5 and a couple of other places those
are replaced because of the 5 000 cola
so they were not necessary at
9.3.16 you'll see where we're bringing
the law clerks up to a fifty thousand
dollar uh rate or pay rate and
the five thousand dollar cola was
already included prior so it allowed for
a reduction there of added funds
under the supreme court
at 10.1.9
you'll see an adjustment there for the
trooper that is assigned to the superior
court to incorporate the five thousand
dollar colas for them
and then you'll see a couple of other
adjustments
and at 10.1.3 we're seeing just one
position instead of two
under state accounting office
most of the state accounting office and
department of administrative services
doeas
are
funded through state funds
so those are considered other funds and
so it makes a little tricky when you do
a a cola like we've done
for all state employees
and so we're kind of having to back into
the door just a little bit different
than we do in other state agencies
because typically this would be spread
throughout all agencies and so what
you'll see here in sao
is the spread within sao instead of
through all other agencies under the
state board of accountancy at 11.6.4
you'll see the addition for one new
auditor that is needed there
section 12 again
under department of administrative
services
under 12.2.2
are the two compensation resolutions
that we passed out of our committee
yesterday
and if those are actual fine final
passage then we will fund those when we
get together for conference or if the
senate passes the budget or passes them
before they get to the budget may be
added then
12.3.2 you'll see an addition for the
georgia aviation authority
to cover uh some travel
then under section 13 department of ag
most of what you see here are true ups
uh
13.1.3 you'll see an addition uh to do
away with the austerity reduction at the
athens and tifton vet labs
but you'll see also true ups at 1321
1327 1331
moving on to 1341
is also adjustments at 1351 you'll see
an increase from maintenance cost at the
poultry vet diagnostic lab
and then down at the soil and water
conservation committee at 1376
and 1377 those two items kind of go
together because it pertains to the
soil and water conservation commission
but you'll see that we're adding
additional funds for each of the
conservation districts around the state
and then adding some regional managers
and technical specialists so
any land disturbance activity of over
one acre in size in the state of georgia
has to have an erosion a sediment
control plan for it
and so the georgia soil and water
conservation commission and those local
districts are in charge of making sure
that those plans are submitted and
approved and so
we need to make sure that they're able
to do that job banking has no changes
under section 15 department of
behavioral health
a lot of work went in here and as i
mentioned in my opening comments about
uh a lot of the things that we're doing
for behavioral health you're going to
see mo a lot of those manifest
themselves here within this budget
at 1528 though is one kind of outside of
that realm as it deals with the now in
comp waivers
we're adding an additional to the
governor's 100 proposed in his budget
we're adding an additional 225 slots
and an additional administrative
position to help manage those slots
for those needed across the state
so we're very happy about that chair
lady dempsey and her subcommittee were
very passionate about making that happen
as well
to 10
deals with our our developmental
disability providers many of you heard
from those folks early on about needing
a rate increase we passed an actual five
percent rate increase for them last year
it had been tied up at cms awaiting
approval we did find out a day before
yesterday that original five percent has
been approved and so we're adding one
additional percent
there as well
15 to 11
just telling the department to use some
of the arp money that they have for a
rate study
at 15 2.12 a 5 increase for non-waiver
family support
at 15 213 i mentioned the behavioral
health nurses and aids and so this is
the first entry that you see where we're
doing a substantial
increase in pay for those individuals
and you'll see that several other times
within this section of the budget but i
want to point it out to you there and
you'll see it in three or four other
locations
moving on down to 15-14
with the
coming extension of the national public
health emergency it allows us to capture
some funds that we would normally have
state funds that we normally have in
programs because that's being extended
for another 90 days and so what we're
doing in dbhd is saying to use those
dollars and plow those back in to direct
services to individuals through that
language item
1535 is the addition of 15 forensic peer
monitors
excuse me mentors
to help provide for transition and
re-entry to support services 15-4-1
is just a true up
then moving on to 15-4-10
we agree and completely and totally
support the assisted outpatient
treatment programs but realize that
those cannot be stood up on the first
day
so what we've done here is just account
for knowing that they're going to have
to do a staggered implementation on
those going forward
the housing voucher program at 15 412
you'll see an increase to about 500
total housing vouchers and then a
program manager at the line just below
that
and then you'll see it 15 4 14 15
16 17 18 19
20
are all increases related to either the
health behavioral health plan or the law
enforcement package here in the house
15 421 deals with the georgia crisis and
access line that goes live on july the
16th making sure that it's fully stood
up and operational
22 are the nurses 23 is a new 18 bed
medical psychiatric unit it with our
partner grady memorial hospital
then the behavioral health rate study
that i mentioned a while ago is at 15
424
and then recognition of the extension of
the public health emergency at 15 425
moving on to child adolescent
developmental disabilities
at 1564 you'll see in addition to a very
special partner that we have in the
state called extra special people or esp
to expand their services to more
communities in our state
the additional help for our nurses and
health aides and then
1566 is another partner that we have in
the savannah area the matthew reardon
center for autism that provides services
outside of the metro area
especially in that southeast georgia
corner
at 1584
you'll see an additional five a little
over 5.6 million dollars for the georgia
apex program we're continuing to grow
that program and get these services into
every school building in the state
at 1596-1597
many of you have heard i know from your
special attorney generals assistant
attorney generals dealing with defects
and other areas of the state's budget
and as well as the paralegals that help
them
needing an increase in pay in order to
to be able to get folks to do that work
so you'll see the first entry here
you'll see additional entries when we
get over to human services in a little
bit where it goes into defects and elder
services
to take that rate to 77.50 an hour and
for the lawyers and 40 an hour for the
paralegals
and in 1598
just putting the infrastructure in place
to handle the national opioid settlement
going on over 1510-6 you'll see a slight
reduction on the capital maintenance we
funded 2 million of that in the amended
budget so we've just reduced to two
million here
so it'll be still a total of five
million dollars that they will have
for that help
fifteen ten seven again those nurses and
aides that i mentioned earlier
under the department of community
affairs section 16
back toward the back of it you'll see
one a reduction of one-time funds at
1610-6
as it relates to a food bank program
with the roll out of the georgia grown
food bank initiative in the department
of ag this funding was no longer
necessary so we're we're shifting over
to it
under the georgia environmental finance
authority
you'll see in addition there for the
resource conservation and development
councils the rcnds across the state
and then also the georgia rural water
association at 1612-2
as it relates to the emergency response
they help provide under natural
disasters here in the state as well
and then at greta you'll see a true up
on the five thousand dollar cola under
department of community health
chairman uh
parish and his team have done an
incredible job here and you'll see many
of the behavioral health pieces
throughout this portion of the document
as well
but if you look first at seventeen one
seven and one eight those deal with two
of the enterprise systems that they are
standing up to modernize the record
keeping as it relates to
medicaid in the state of georgia
1719
is part of the behavioral health package
and it's a study on the reimbursement
rates for medical
for the
mental health providers and then at 17
110 a language item
again establishing
the tracking and analysis that is
necessary to track the pay purity issues
dealing with insurance
moving on under to
care access and improvement
you'll see a reduction at 1745 but an ad
back at 1746
just doing this to keep
keep the record keeping straight
reduction of 500 000 but an addition of
500 000 for federally qualified health
centers this would add two of those one
in the coastal fqhc that will serve
mcintosh and glenn counties and then
south central that will service irwin
ben hill coffee berry and atkinson cook
and lowndes counties
these will be concentrating on
behavioral health as well
then at 1747
some additional help for ahex across the
state that provide much needed training
and then an expansion of the rn re-entry
program at 1748.
moving on down to hfrd healthcare
regulation
facility regulation at 1754 just a
reduction in funds there to
meet what their expected or projected
expenditures will be
under age blind and disabled medicaid
you'll see a truing up of some numbers
there at 1771 and 72 the recognition of
the extension of the public health
emergency
just a correction on the rs means cost
report at 1776.
then down at 17710 you'll see a rate
increase for our ltch long-term acute
care hospitals
and in patient rehab facilities our irfs
across the state we have 11 l-techs and
5 irfs across the state that treat a
very high acuity patient and so they
were needing some help with increased
cost as well
17-7-11 just taking the nursing home
cost report to the 2020 cost report
which is the latest audited report there
17-7-12 a 5 rate increase for mechanical
ventilators
one of those items is very
specialized but it's not covered under
the cost report
then moving on down to 17-7-13
you'll see a rate increase there for
home and community based services you'll
see another increase at 17 714
that deals with reimbursement rates for
medical nutrition therapy and you'll see
a couple other ads related to that at 17
15 and 1795
and then at 17
7 excuse me i'm sorry i told you wrong
on those two references on 17 7 15 that
you'll also see that at 8 15 and 9 5 as
it deals with a ten percent rate
increase for two dental extraction codes
and a seven percent increase for
seventeen other dental restorative codes
seventeen eight one you'll see a
reduction there based on the public
health emergency extension and at 1782.
something i do want to mention and and
that chairman parish had pointed out in
his subcommittee meeting is at 1786
you'll see it's not a change but i just
want to recognize something the governor
has done here in his original budget and
that's to eliminate the attestation
period for providers
on all 108 procedure codes and what that
is is when a new doctor goes in to start
practicing there is a time period that
it takes for them to at the state
and during that time they do not get
paid by medicaid and what we're doing is
backing up and saying from day one they
will be reimbursed and the facilities
will be reimbursed going forward
1783
just adding there to include hiv
patients within the benefits of medicaid
again 17 814 the medical nutrition
therapy
17 8 15 the dental codes and then
another one at 17 816
another 11 15 waiver to remove the
five-year waiting period for lawful
permanent residents to be covered under
our state medicaid program
17-8-17 an adjustment in an increase in
ob-gyn codes and then 17-8-18
is starting us down the path of going to
value-based purchasing for our providers
it's a quality driver and offers
incentives to increase quality in their
treatment across the state
1794 again the medical nutrition therapy
9-5 the dental
piece 9-6 once again relates to the
value-based purchasing
on down at 1711 4 you'll see
the implementation of behavioral health
care workforce database
at 400 000 there under workforce at 1712
2 you'll see where we've increased the
new residency slots now to 199 slots
from the first proposed 136 slots
1712 3 you'll see that moved actually
over into public health here in just a
few minutes
new residency program to help archibald
medical center stand that up at 17-12-4
you'll see
a provision for
additional fellowship positions at
augusta university in gynecology
oncology public health
focused medicine and rural primary care
1725
and then at 1712-6 just doing a
statewide assessment on the dental
workforce we're finding an issue as it
relates to medicaid and finding enough
providers across the state that do
dental health care
that will take medicaid so we're just
trying to find out who will and who
won't and if there's somebody we can
talk to to get more to take
those patients on
17 12 7 and 12 8 you'll see
us telling them to utilize existing
funds then providing a bump there
for those residency programs that we've
established 1712-9
the capitation funds increasing those
for seven residency slots in emory
and then under mercer you'll see funds
there at 17
13 2
and just saying to repurpose some funds
that are already there for an
accelerated track program and crew
including the forensic pathology piece
that we'll talk about more here in just
a few minutes
under morehouse at 1741
you'll see a two million dollar ad there
to help them
get started on setting up their new
nursing program which will be a 15-month
highly intensive program to put more
nurses in the pipeline
and then an addition at 14-2
to
help support their child and adolescent
psychology and psychiat psychiatric
residency programs
under physicians for rural areas at 17
15 1
you'll see an addition of funds
for the loan repayment program this will
cover seven physicians one pa and 20
more aprns
1761 another partner we have in medical
education of course has been the
philadelphia college of osteopathic
medicine or p-com
they expanded to moultrie a few years
ago and that program continues to do
very well and so we're trying to do our
part to kind of hold up our end of the
deal by helping them with the expansion
cost as they add more students to their
programs
under drugs and narcotics at 17-18-4
you'll see funds for a data management
system and then two additional agents or
investigators in 18.5
department of community supervision
there are no changes department of
corrections
so in the mended budget you'll you'll
recall that uh as we talked about it on
wednesday we've done an additional two
thousand dollars uh the senate had
brought to us a package to look at the
high turnover rates and so we've done an
additional two thousand dollars to the
base pay for our correctional officers
so you'll see that entered here already
into uh the 23 budget and that will be
on top of the five thousand dollar cola
that they'll be receiving but you'll see
that at night
19.2.7
3.7
4.6
and you'll also see that at 19 8.10
backing up to 197.1
you'll see an increase there for the per
diem rates to expressly provide for a
salary adjustment for the correctional
officers only within our partners at the
private prisons
now
i know that there's some angst about
this issue
and
including myself but however we need to
remember
number one this is a contract with the
state to provide a service to help us
house those individuals that need to be
housed number two
this will go to this corrections
officers only let me give you an idea of
where these corrections officers live
and it will help you understand that in
many of these cities
these
facilities are the largest employer in
these facilities folkston alamo nichols
and millen
and this will be handled through an
amendment to the contract so we can make
sure that those funds are going to those
officers to those families to those
people that are living and working in
those communities and spending money in
those communities as well
in
19.8.9
you'll see an adjustment there as it
relates to the transportation hubs it's
a revised plan from the department of
corrections that we're addressing there
and then the additional salary increase
at 19.9.6
under the department of defense there
are no changes
under the department of driver services
you'll see at 21.2.6
a reduction in the reduction
of
on to help complete the construction of
a testing pad and carousel at one of
their facilities in southeast georgia
and then down at 21.2.8 just the
removal of one-time funds there as it
relates to an id program that they were
doing
under decal
you'll also see those statewide changes
that i'd mentioned earlier as it relates
to the to the five thousand dollar cola
under economic development section 23
if you'll go on down to
23.9.5
and
here in economic development it's where
we're able to nurture a lot of the
partnerships we have around the state
and at under tourism at
23.9.5 the national infantry museum down
at columbus
they're looking to
do some refurbishments but also some
expansions of those things that they do
so very well if you've not been there i
highly recommend a visit
to the national
infantry museum it is one of those
things that will stay with you for the
rest of your life but adding to those
exhibits and allowing them to further
attract folks in so that
all of us can pay the proper respect to
those that have served for us
23 9.6 you'll see an addition
for security expenses associated with
our bid for the fifa world cup and then
at 23 9.7 our friends and partners at
the mlk junior
center for non-violent social change
we've partnered with them now for
several years
and just helping them with some one-time
expenses for improvements based on the
number of people that they have come
through there they have about a million
visitors a year through there it's quite
impressive
under aggies or undereducation section
24 under ag education you'll see some
adjustments there ag education in the
state of georgia is going through an
incredible growth phase there's been
some incredible leaders and friends of
mine that have been there over the last
15 or 20 years that have done some
incredible things to help educate young
people
not only how to grow their food but
where their food and fiber comes from
and so we're we're doing some additions
there that you'll see to help go forward
and and help fund those programs and
also at 2418 i'll just highlight one of
those uh there'll be 21 new extended day
extended year programs which is where
the the teachers actually
go with the students after the school
day and help them with their projects
24.3.7 under central office you'll see
an addition there for
our friends at the american association
of adaptive sports
then an elimination at 24.3.8 of some
one-time funding
i true up an adjustment
for house bill 403 from the 2017 session
at 24.4.7
you'll see a true up in the number at
24.8.6 under g nets for actuals
at
24.11.5 chairman jones and his
subcommittee and and
sarah and several folks on our staff
have been working with the residential
treatment facility friends
trying to get them a funding formula
that works for them as i explained
yesterday we count qb numbers twice a
year
well at an rtf on the count day there
might be only four or five students
there but the very next day there may be
25 more show up or they're only going to
get counted or paid for the five that
were there on that day so what we're
trying to do is give them more
predictability and allow them to be
ready to receive those students when
they need to receive those students and
so my hat's off to chairman jones
because that was i know that was not an
easy task at all
24 11 8 you'll see an increase for
feminine hygiene going into the fifth
grade there
and then you'll see a reduction in funds
for the closure of one of the
residential treatment facilities at
24-11-9
under school nutrition
you'll see a couple of additions there
one of those is a 5.4 salary increase
for for those professionals along with
an increase for the school nutrition
funding program there under preschool
disabilities you'll see a couple of true
ups there at twenty four thirteen two
and thirteen three true up again at
twenty four
1 true up again at 24 15 1
and then another true up as it relates
to local 5 ml share 24 16 1.
under qbe
you'll see several other formula true
ups as it goes through there based on
either changes we've made in legislation
our changes in student accounts
since opb originally had the budget but
one thing i want to point out to you
there at 2417-9
and at
let me find it 2417 3 you'll see a move
of some funds from the school nurse
program out of the qbe program
it was put there it's not part of the qb
formula but it was put there originally
years ago and i'll show you where those
come back up in just a second
then at the reese's at 2418 you'll see
increasements in funds there based on
enrollment growth replacement of
austerity reductions
mental health contractual services and
then a 5.4 percent increase for for
their employees
that
are non-certificated so moving on to
section news section 24.20 you'll see
there where we're putting the school
nurse program as a standalone program in
the budget
and we're doing that for transparency so
everybody always knows where it's at so
we can all see it and you'll see it
24.20.3
of course the 5.4 increase for those
nurses as well
again just like public health nurses
those school nurses have been on the
front line of this coveted battle
now for the last two years
coming up almost exactly two years i
guess
under technology and career education
you'll see an adjustment at 24.23.7
as it relates to the extended day
extended year program for those
technology and career
education employees under ers
and i know that uh
we've all gotten many emails from our
retired employees in our state and we're
thankful that throughout this budget you
will see
it's kind of hard to see but it's in
there
where the adjustment is being made to
get them to the position of being able
to do a cola for the first time in 14
years
and so you'll see note kind of a note
about that language item at
25.4.2
recognize the 118 million dollars that
has spread across the entire budget at
25.3.2 you'll see where we raised the ps
ers retirement system from a 1575 per
year service up to 16 per year service
so that's that's your bus drivers and
those folks that don't fall under any of
the other retirement plans that is their
retirement plan
under the state forestry commission you
have several things here that are all
sort of tied together
there was an audit done of how they
functioned
a couple of years ago and they
identified several opportunities for
efficiencies and areas of savings
so what we're doing is putting a person
in there to manage
uh kind of the p's and q's on a lot of
these areas but also you'll see it
26.1.7
2.6
and at 3.7
part of a employee development and
retention plan that they've been working
on now for several years 26.3.6
just the replacement of where they were
using some federal funds when we got
into the tight in fy 21 and had to make
reductions they shifted some people over
to federal funds and so we're shifting
them back to state funds now where they
should be
section 27 offices of the governor
under the governor's office planning and
budget section 27 you'll see where we're
pulling out the office of health and
strategy and coordination and putting it
into its own separate program you'll see
that move at 27.3.7
and then you'll see it re-enter it
27.4.2.
also
language item at 4.3 dealing with all
payer claims database and then
recognizing the one analyst that's going
to be needed for the collection
reporting of nursing and hospital data
and then moving on to 27.4.5
5 is actually just a language item
in dealing with aggregating and
consolidating all of that hospital data
as well
under gma at
27.6.5 you'll see increase in funds for
their career retention plan as part of
the law enforcement package of this body
moving on to the governor's office of
student achievement
you'll see a couple of reductions there
but again just in the name of
transparency and allowing everybody to
be able to see things better we've
broken out the governor's honors program
and the governor's school leadership
academy into their own two separate
programs at 27 nine and twenty seven ten
under the offensive child advocate at
twenty seven eleven four you'll see the
addition of two investigative positions
there
to expand or to investigate any of those
things dealing or related to children
under human services
under after-school care just the
recognition of being able to use some
federal funds and pull back some of the
state funds under that program at 2836
it's in addition there for services to
at-risk girls
many of you in middle georgia in the
macon area are very familiar with
the pace center and what they're doing
with many of these young females and
we're looking to make sure that that's
something that we can replicate across
the state
under child support services you'll see
the the first entry there 28 4.6 and 4.7
as it relates to the sags on
child support services and also the
paralegals under that program as well
taking them to the 77.50 rate for the
attorneys and 40 an hour for the
paralegals
moving on under child welfare services
an ad there to our casas our court
appointed special advocates
very active in our communities they're
they're kind of the backbone in many
ways as it comes to child welfare
services
as they engage into the court system and
so what this will do will allow them to
expand their capacity to be in every
county in the state now i'm i'm very
happy about that 28 5 10 and 11 again
the sags and the paralegals
at
28.77 you'll see a move
right there down
into the elder uh
in community living services i'll talk
about that just in a second
sags again at 2886 and 2887
on to 2895 and 2896.
i noted i noted just a second ago a move
out of the administration into this
program as it relates to alzheimer's
thank you to all of you that are here
wearing purple today most of y'all know
that that's kind of my tradition when i
present the budget
then i wear purple in honor of my mother
this year is a little stronger because
it's in honor of my mother-in-law too we
lost her back in january to alzheimer's
and so
folks talk a lot of times about legacies
and what you you know what you're going
to leave behind and if there's anything
that i hope is my legacy is what we've
done to expand
services for alzheimer's patients across
this state
[Applause]
so within elder and community living
services
you'll see an addition there at 28.95
for the dementia care specialist program
they'll work with all the triple a's
across our state our area aging area
councils on aging
it's 2896 you'll see the georgia memory
net program and the addition of
an additional hub to be located out into
the state
so these families and these patients
have services closer to them
than having to drive from south georgia
to atlanta to see
the top of the line folks at emory emory
has been an incredible incredible
incredible partner with us
in this program
we've established sites across the state
we'll be establishing more sites across
the state and the addition of three
million dollars there helps us stand up
one more
site and also helps us expand the
telemedicine capabilities within that
program
at 28.97 you'll see uh
more funds for the non-medicaid home and
community-based services in addition
there
and then at 28-12-4
another one of those things that has
been a priority of this house is dealing
with our foster children and what you'll
see there is an addition to the clothing
allowance for these children of 275
dollars in addition to what they already
get for these families they're hosting
these children in their homes and trying
to make sure that they're clothed and
adequately clothed to go to school and
participate in activities across the
state
under family connection at 28 18 1
our friends at family connection again
another one of those entities that's in
every one of our our communities across
the state are restoring the cut from
21 but also making a slight addition
there for a program that they're going
to be rolling out as it relates to
mental health as well
remaining on in community services
moving on down to the vocational
rehabilitation agency at 28 23.7
there was some cash put in for some
maintenance and repairs that that they
need on some of their facilities however
we have found that they have about 9.5
million dollars in outstanding are
existing bond balances that they can
spend for those improvements you'll see
some additions then for independent
living services for the commission on
deaf and hard of hearing and then at 28
23 10 an addition to allow them to open
back up those priority service
categories that they had to close down
as we came up short on cash a couple of
years ago
during the dip with covet and then a
restoration of funds for the georgia
radio reading service at 28 23 11.
moving on to the office insurance
commissioner
you'll see it 29.4.7
just the recognition of the fees that
they collect within that office those
fees are used for investigative services
in many different ways whether it be
elevators or hazardous materials
compliance with manufacturer housing
carnival rides they have to do all of
those inspections so what we're doing is
allowing them to keep the vast majority
about 3.8 million dollars in those fees
and then pulling back about 383 000
dollars in state funds that that are
above what they're needing for those
positions
and then at 29.4.8 part of the
behavioral health package is the
imper the inspector that they will need
to have in place as it relates to mental
health parity with the insurance
companies
under gbi
at 30.1 30.1.6
throughout gbi we'll be adding
an additional 67 positions in the crime
labs medical examiner's office
uh investigative divisions and all of
that
and so they're needing some additional
help as it relates to human resources
with the increased workload that those
individuals will bring with them at
30.1.7 you'll see an ad there of 1.1
million for capital maintenance and
repairs at their headquarters
then moving over to 30.3.6
you'll see six additional positions
on top of what the governor had already
recommended for those medical examiner
offices
to address their workload and then the
death investigator specialist you'll see
in addition there that we've added
30.3.8
and trying to put some parity in there
as it relates to 25 of their employees
and then increasing about 207 crime lab
scientists
30.3.9
again part of the law enforcement
package as it relates to trying to get
through the backlog
of chemistry and firearm cases
then moving down to 30.4.7
just annualizing four positions we had
added in the amended budget for uh
elections investigations and then
dealing with the gang task force adding
15 additional
special agents and six criminal
investigators and one
help desk analyst
there and again part of the law
enforcement package
30.5.7
you'll see the local first responder
grants to help local communities
be able to equip their law enforcement
personnel
then under the cjcc the accountability
courts you'll see some additions there
most of those editions all deal or all
of those editions all deal with a law
enforcement package but your first one
at
30.6.6 also deals with the mental health
package as it addresses the expansion of
the mental health accountability courts
and court managers but you'll also see
that those other items tie directly to
things related to either things that law
enforcement run into our mental health
professionals run into
under juvenile justice section 31
you'll see throughout it also an
additional two thousand dollars on top
of the five thousand dollar cola for
those jcos
again in testimony from the commissioner
we found that they have a 90
percent turnover rate within those cos
he came to see me the other day he was
happy he was talking about the great
improvement they had made on their their
retention
and i said well
you're at 90 percent
he said yeah but we were at 97
and i said i got you i understand
completely
at
31.3.9 and also at
31.411
you'll see a reduction in funds there
those two items were funded in the
amended budget with cash but you'll also
see the two thousand dollar adjustment
for those individuals as well
moving into the department of labor
the labor budget is a little smaller
than what it had been and and it's
because of really one move that's being
made
as it relates to the workforce
investment act
and moving that under the department of
technical and well under tcsg
technical college system of georgia
so that we can better align those
delivery of services to the end users
but also better align those services to
the needs of employers
these individuals its envision will be
co-located in the department of labor
offices across the state as employees of
the tcsg system
but when those individuals come in and
find they're lacking
one certificate or a little bit of
training here there to be able to apply
for either this job at fourteen dollars
an hour or this job at twenty three
dollars an hour
all they need to do is one more
certification or one more little bit of
education it will allow them to be
instantly plugged into the technical
college system to get that additional
certification
you'll see a slight reduction at 32.2.1
uh dealing with the
chief labor labor officer
bill being vetoed last year and then
you'll see also throughout the
department of labor the understanding
that until they get to october 1st
those employees on the 5 000 cola do
need to be covered with state funds
until they can renegotiate those federal
contracts because the vast majority of
their people are funded with federal
funds
under the department of law you'll see
an addition there of six more
excuse me three more positions
in the uh human trafficking division
bringing that to six total
moving on down under natural resources
section 34
34.2.6 those funds come out here but
they do go back in under parks and
recreation i'll show you that item in
just a second
34.2.7 just recognizing as a language
item
those sags that we'd mentioned earlier
that they sometimes use for enforcement
of voting under the influence laws in
the state
moving on under environmental protection
you'll see it
34.3.6 another small group of
individuals that we had to make sure
could get to the new federal fiscal year
with a five thousand dollar cola
then at 34.3.7
you'll see an adjustment there
again a parity issue but a retention
issue a huge retention issue in epd
as it relates to environmental
compliance specialists and their
engineers trying to get them up to a
market salary there
34.6.5 you'll see the addition of 22
game wardens that we had to eliminate in
the 21 budget due to cuts but at
34.6.6 you'll see the recognition of in
the inflated gasoline prices
right now that are projected to go into
november and so what we're doing there
is putting 750 000 to buy
gasoline and diesel fuel for those so
they can stay in the road you'll see a
similar addition on the department of
public safety for our state patrol here
in a little bit as well
34.7.6 we had a bill just a little bit
earlier representative lim had as
related to the council of american
indian concerns
some additional funding for their
activities as well as the per diem that
are paid to their volunteer members
there 34.7
0.7 is the 10.55 million coming back in
as it relates to facility improvements
there and the expansion of use of these
facilities across the state during the
code pandemic and again
folks started coming because of covid
but they've continued to come because
they realized what a hidden gem these
parks are
34.7.8
the sam shortline is our only state
rolling
state park as the railroad that runs
down there they took a heavy hit
during the pandemic when they had to
shut down so we're trying to alleviate
some of the issues they're having and
make sure that they can maintain a safe
operation
under pardons and paroles no changes
under section 36 state properties
commission you'll see just one little
change there
the two peachtree migration plan we
funded that in the amended budget so
it's not necessary to fund it in the big
budget
under public defenders
another bill that chairman gunner had
just a little bit ago
deals with the public defenders and
getting them on some parity
with the assistant public defenders and
the assistant district attorneys but
you'll see at 37 2.6 7 and 8 just
annualization there of the new
judgeships that were created at
37.2.9 10 and 11
the funds added in for the three new jet
ships we have created this year
and then public defense juvenile
assistant public defenders at 37.2.12
and then at 2.13 and 14 deal with the
parity issue as well
37 215 you'll see an ad there for three
new conflict offices and this is part of
what we've heard from law enforcement
around the state and it's also included
as part of the law enforcement package
that this this house and this general
assembly are working on this year
moving on section 38
department of public health
you'll see the transfer from dch i
mentioned earlier at 38.1.5
and then 38 1.6 the expansion to help
support the expansion services for the
sickle cell foundation
for the testing and the work that they
do across our state
i mentioned the public health nurses in
my opening comments as well at 38 3.7
you'll see the first entry of the
increase in in helping our front line
uh covent army as it relates to the
public health nurses at 38 3.7 38
thirty eight 4.7
point four and then we'll see it again
just a minute in grants to uh county
offices i do wanna back up it though and
mention at 38.4.6
as it relates to mcintosh county the
ambulance provider that they had there
is pulling out it had been a contract
provider
their citizens will be left without
ambulance coverage and so we're trying
to get them stood back up and operating
38 10.4 something that chair lady
dempsey's been working on of course is
dealing with lead testing for our young
children
and so you'll see here the addition for
the funds for the lead inspectors and
the testing machines to support house
bill 1355.
3810-5 again dealing with the public
health nurses
and then 38-11-5 as it relates to those
nurses directly located in the counties
to deal with the recruitment and
retention needs there
38-11-6 just allowing some
input input for grants for improved
infrastructure and support in those
counties as well
department of public safety section 39
capitol police services 3921 and two two
you'll see the five thousand dollar cola
and an additional one thousand dollar
salary supplement for those individuals
because they're used here within the uh
285 to help combat crime as well
39.4.7
is to annualize the 10 salary supplement
to troop c that does patrol within 285
and then
at
39.4.8 you'll see the addition of 10
additional swat unit troopers and 10
additional nighthawk dui
troopers
something that i didn't realize until
until chairman hitchens said it the
other day but gbi or excuse me state
patrol covers 105 counties in the state
with swat
i just assumed that every county or
every city had some type of cooperative
agreement internally within the county
to cover swat but there are 105 counties
that this georgia state patrol and their
swat unit provides that coverage for
those
39.4.9 again the recognition of
increasing fuel prices there
39.5.7 deals with the 10 salary
supplement under the motor carrier
compliance division
then under the officer public safety
officer support program at
39.6.7 another piece of law enforcement
package
adding two peer counselors and one
social worker
to that program to help these officers
that suffer from ptsd or have had a bad
event that they need some help with
under the firefighter standards and
training council at 3976 and 77 dealing
with their testing database and the it
support for their program
under the public health public safety
training center at 3998
you'll see a reduction in funds there
that was actually funded in the amended
budget as well
moving on to the public service
commission at section 40
you'll see the annualization of costs
for the e-filing system at
40.1.7 and then under utilities
regulation at 40.3.4
you'll see the eight new positions
needed there with a lot of the projects
that they have going on across the state
section 41 university system
if you'll move over first at 41.4.4
under the enterprise innovation
institute or ei squared
you'll see additional fundings for some
match money
under the atdc
to help with
startups and leverage private funding
there
it's about a one-to-one match or a four
to one match it's a considerable match
that's added there
removing some one-time funds at 41.8.4
for a program that that dealing with
cyber training rural coding that did not
get stood up
we'll keep evaluating that going forward
under gtri the georgia tech research
institute at 41.10.6
helping them as they look to stand up
stem programs around the state primarily
in rural counties that science
technology and engineering engineering
and mathematics programs we all know
that many of the small school systems do
not have the resources they need to
expand on that and so gtri has been kind
enough to offer that up as something
that they would be glad to help with
moving on to
41132 under the medical college
augusta university
our our state's medical school there
we'd added funds last year for a
one-time foundation grant
but they're continuing to expand their
three plus program which gets medical
students in and out
of their residency in three years
and so what we've done there is said no
to the cut
added an additional 4.8 million to bring
that total to 10 million dollars in
recognition of the growth of that
program under public libraries at 4114 7
you'll see an increase in the
per capita grant from 40 cents to 50
cents per capita or an increase of 10
cents
there
moving on to 41 41-15-4
you'll see that is a move from the
teaching program at 41-18-15
saying yes we support the program it
actually belongs here in this program
under special funding initiatives
instead of under the teaching program
also under special funding initiatives
you'll find a program that chairman
knight has been working on now for about
two years maybe three years actually i
guess as it relates to aviation career
pathways
middle georgia state university has done
an incredible job in the program that
they have between macon and eastman and
growing that program
and so what we're doing here and in the
bond package is recognition of that and
that expansion of those programs to get
more of those individuals through the
program and into the pipeline earning
very good salaries going forward
at 41 18 1 you'll see a slight
adjustment there it's just a true up 41
18 3 again just to true up
now when we get to 41 18 8
you'll see that we have said yes in
language but no on funding
this program and a couple of other
programs i'll point out here in just a
minute are actually a unit programs and
in the university system there's an a
unit budget and a b unit budget the
special funding initiatives
the land grant mission at the university
of georgia and at fort valley state fall
under the b unit
but under the a unit are the typical
instruct instruction programs and so
those actually reside in the a unit that
the board of regents actually approves
and says yes we will stand up this
program
we've never funded those these type
programs in the teaching formula here
and so what we're seeing is yes we're
fine with you going on and doing that
but we'll fund it when the time comes in
the correct place
in in the future
moving on at 41 1810 again a merit-based
scholarship program again
not the place that this belongs uh we're
not saying you know we don't agree with
it we're just saying that it is not to
be created in this particular spot 41 18
3 and 18 14 again a couple of items that
relate back to that a unit issue that i
mentioned a minute ago 41 1815 is the
one that got moved back into sfi and at
4118 7
university of georgia small business
development center sbdc
they're needing they're continuing to
work with more and more
nationalities of folks that are coming
through the program so they were needing
some help with some additional
multilingual professionals to help them
service those individuals that they
service
and then under georgia military college
at 41.23 you'll see some adjustments
there are formula true ups for actual
counts
there department of revenue section 42
no changes
moving on to section 43
is secretary of state you'll see one
recognition of
other funds there for the fees that they
collect
where they've added some additional
personnel and we're just saying
recognize those funds here
at that particular place at 43.5
another language item as it relates to
the board of nursing on collecting the
data that we'd mentioned back under the
governor's office of health strategy and
coordination
earlier
moving on to student finance
section 44.
you'll see at
44.1.8 in the commission administration
you'll see the addition of some
personnel to help administer some of the
new programs that we've added so
throughout the law enforcement package
and the behavioral health package you'll
see
several things that we have added and
we've not only added them in this budget
but we've added them over the last
several budgets especially under the
service council alone program
so it takes people to administer these
programs and we've been remiss and not
funding those
in the past
at 44 2.1 you'll see it true up there as
it relates to dual enrollment under the
engineering scholarship at
44.3.1 another true up
under hope ged at 44 6.1 a change in the
methodology on the payment as it relates
to the ged test
we've been
funding that upon a 500 grant per
participant at the completion of the
program what we're doing here is
actually going to pay for the test on
the front end that's the big expense
they have to come up with
so that's allowed for us to capture a
little bit of a savings there under hope
scholarships private schools you'll see
an increase of six percent there
and then under public schools you'll see
a true up at 44 9.1
there under service council loans
i'd mentioned that a little bit ago
and you'll see a
ad there at 4415 1 as it relates to the
law enforcement package gbi
related to the full-time examiner
medical examiner positions trying to
increase that package to be able to
attract those individuals
the national guard scholarship at true
up in the formula 15-2
and then part of the law enforcement
package on service council loans for
local and state law enforcement officers
to be able to pursue
degrees in criminal justice or other
relevant social science fields for 1.4
million at 44 15 4 you'll see just the
recognition of the 10 million that we've
put in in the amended budget
for the
behavioral health professions
student council loan program there under
tegs or tuition equalization grants at
44161
you'll see a bump there from eight
hundred fifty dollars to nine hundred
dollars for those students
under teachers retirement there's no
changes under the technical college
system
uh you'll see a few changes there
if you look at forty six 46.4.1
you'll see a reduction we made there for
a program that's not up and running just
yet
we'll continue to
monitor that and do what we need to do
should it get up and running
46.6.10 the dual achievement program
pilot
an adjustment or true up on what the
actuals have been in that program at
46.611
a recognition of the high cost
instructional programs that tcsg does
from truck driving
uh to welding several other high cost
programs
that the tuition is just not enough to
cover what we're doing is saying we're
going to come in and help cover that at
46 612
again part of what chairman knight has
been working on for several years as it
relates to aviation programs
these will be those folks that that work
on airplanes and make sure that
airplanes are are running and operating
the way they're supposed to
and so just kind of bolstering those
programs at several institutions across
the state
now when i get to transportation i told
you yesterday in the full committee
i've got a cheat sheet that
chairman perkle has provided for the
mine spaghetti that the transportation
funding formula is
i'm going to read it off because i can't
explain it any better than what it reads
right here on this piece of paper
so i'll start with program additions to
the g dot budget include an investment
of 10 million dollars to airport aid at
47.1.2
we've restored 1 million
and at
47.1.5 we've increased funding by 9
million so it's 10 million dollars total
we've also added 10 million dollars to
state on rail lines at 47.12.12.
in the balance of the transportation
budget we ensure dedicated fees were
used for the purpose for which they were
intended transportation trust funds
including the hotel motel tax ev and
heavy vehicle
are used to fund the atl greta certa
debt service and transit
to accommodate the source and use of
funds directive we also utilized fund
swaps throughout the transportation
budget
trust fund dollars were replaced with
state general funds at 47.1.3
47.10.6 and 12.8 and put into debt
service
similarly trust fund dollars were
replaced with motor fuels at 47.3.2
the bulk of this swap is found in the
increase of 14 million in capital
construction at 47.2.1
and the balance in the recruitment
retention adjustments at 47.4.25
9.2 11.2 13.214.2
trust fund dollars were replaced with
state general funds at the adjustment
at the adjustment to recruitment and
retention in portsmouth waterway at
47.10.8 and in rail at
47.12.11 while adjustment to retention
and transit at
47.15.10 utilizes both trust funds
while we're looking at the transit
program we did another fun swap but for
a different reason
house bill 511 provided a cap of 10
percent of the transportation fund trust
funds were being used for transit the
number was 1.2 million dollars over the
cap and so that adjustment is reflected
at
47.15.7 and 15.8
you'll see additional true ups at
47.6.3 and 6.4 to accurately reflect the
base budget for the newly established
programs as shown in rail at forty seven
twelve five and transit at fifteen five
forty seven dot six dot one and thirteen
dot ones are true ups to reflect
positions left out of the five thousand
dollar cola
so there you have that
um
again i refer you back to the sheet that
uh our analyst abby day created the
little bubble graph that's on your desk
for the probably the best explanation
i've ever seen of how transportation
dollars are used in the state of georgia
moving on to department of veterans
services section 48
you'll see it 48.2.4 just the
recognition that there remains one
million dollars in the base
for the new veterans cemetery at augusta
a new groundskeeper position at the
cemetery at glenville and a name change
or name correction from veterans
cemetery to veterans cemeteries at
48.2.6
and then 48.4.6
is the addition of a suicide prevention
and outreach person to specialize in
veterans mental health issues
section 49 workers compensation board
there are no changes there and of course
all of you have already flipped to
section 50 as it relates to bonds so i
won't go over those
mr
chairman if you're still awake back
there
and i and i wouldn't blame you if you
fell asleep during that but if you're
still awake back there
that concludes the walk-through of the
tracking sheet and i'll be glad to
attempt to answer any questions that
that folks may have i'll take a few
i know
everybody's wanting to get home in front
of this weather that's moving in later
this afternoon so i won't take but just
a few
mr chairman that may have been one of
your finest efforts
i can assure you that i've heard several
of them
[Applause]
thank you
mr chairman that was that was kind of a
joke but it turned out not to be it
turned out pretty good didn't it
mr chairman i i will i want to make two
observations
i don't think
in fact i know
there's not been a penny in that budget
since you've been chairman of this
committee that you did not know where it
came from and where it went to and how
it was spent so
as a steward of the absolute as a
steward of the people's money of this
state
i thank you
the other thing that
really was riveting to me as you were
speaking
river no this really was now y'all
several of you all were dozing
i saw you and i'm sorry if i had a
button i'd have shocked your chair and
woke me up but i didn't mr speaker you
may think about that
the house budget office and all the
people here that you brag on all the
time is this the first time they've
heard this budget because they were
glued on your every word i mean
they were they were doing a critique to
see where i messed up
well i want to i want to compliment them
they encourage y'all may have encouraged
why he spoke so long
[Applause]
mr chairman i just uh while you catch
your breath and and answer a couple of
questions if you will
you mentioned the word legacy of early
on in this presentation
and i don't know of another
appropriations chair in this general
assembly in the history of it will leave
a final legacy than you will when you
leave this place
uh how you manage with passion the
people's money as we just alluded to and
how you've managed and dealt with the
members the public who come before you
and this staff is exceptional and it
speaks to the man you are and the
beliefs you have
the last thing i would say
even maybe more important than that it's
compassion you've had and you have for
the people of this state as a pastor
said this morning
you care and love your neighbor and you
cared about them in your time here and i
know you will continue to do that with
that mr chairman i'm going to
recognize a couple of members if you
will
for there's a couple of questions that
we have
with that i'm going to recognize the
gentleman from the 168th house district
down on the coast
representative williams for a question
thank you mr leader
the gentleman yield absolutely will you
yield twice
well it depends
before before i ask the question that uh
rose to answer let me echo the majority
leader in saying
that you have always been a gentleman
you have been more accessible
than any appropriations chairman i've
served with over the 20 years i've been
here
you didn't always give the answer i
wanted
but you were honest with your answer and
thank you and certainly your staff for
their accessibility my question is
concerning
private prisons
i just want to ask it's 100
of the money
that has been mentioned for them
going to salaries to ensure parity and
help reduce the turnover yes sir that
that is certainly what we're doing here
in that edition it goes into the pockets
of those ceos that are working in those
facilities that live in those four
communities that i mentioned earlier so
that they can take care of their
families and raise their families buy
food to put on their table it goes into
their pocket yes sir with one quick
follow-up
thank you too
it's not something that flies above the
radar but thank you for the money for
the prevention of suicide among veterans
in this state yes absolutely
mr chairman would you take another
question one more
maybe a couple more minutes
i'll encourage the members to be quick
i'd recognize the gentleman from the
155th who's already helped you chairman
perkle for a question
thank you mr chairman will the gentleman
yield yes sir
is it not true that this budget provides
flexibility
uh to meet the federal matching
requirements related to the
infrastructure bill
and also provides clarity in being
compliant with the state-owned
short-line railroads absolutely it does
and
you know somebody smarter than us and
before us decided that it was a wise
investment to invest in those
state-owned short-line railroads and we
have an obligation as a state to
continue to make sure that they're
maintained into a level that's safe
efficient and affordable to those
needing to use them cross them or have
anything to do with them yes sir well
the gentleman for the yield yes sir
is it not further true that it has been
an honor and a privilege to observe the
dedication
the compassion and hard work of the
chairman
uh and to see lived out the motto of
this state
wisdom
justice
and moderation
is that not true my friend well i'll let
every member decide on their own on that
one thank you mr chair thank you
mr chairman i'd like for you to take one
more maybe yes sir okay so lady in the
back from the house district 139
representative bentley has a question to
your left to the strawberry queen yes
ma'am yes sir thank you mr leader with
the gentleman yield yes ma'am
thank you chairman uh england for your
work on this budget i know you put a lot
of
hours in and i certainly appreciate that
uh but for a point of clarity i need a
better understanding of
the raises
for state employees is something about a
a dollar amount that would be given on
april 1st i'm not really certain about
that but can you help me to understand
what's going to happen on april 1st as
it relates to state employees and this
in this 5 000 raise i just need to be
really clear on that sure absolutely
within the amended budget if you recall
the 5 000 raise is handled kind of two
ways
and and it's it's all kind of about
logistics and how that happens so
and what the state employees will see on
april 1st
or thereabouts very close to that will
be a one-time payment of thirty seven
hundred and fifty dollars
and then from april 1st on appearing in
their paycheck divided evenly from there
until june 30th will be an additional
1250
which overall amounts to a 5 000 race in
this current fiscal year so when you get
to july 1 and doing it that way coming
to july 1
then there will be no change in their
paycheck the 5 000 then will be built in
through this budget through the
paychecks all of next year so it it
we're doing it in a way that that
doesn't spike their paychecks for the
last quarter but puts them where they're
going to be going forward so they don't
get to june 30th and all of a sudden see
their paycheck drop because there was
five thousand dollars trying to be
pushed out in one quarter it'll be done
in a in a one-time payment and then the
other 1250 dollars will then be
allocated to them over that remaining
three months
thank you uh mr chairman i'm going to
call time on this last question
if you'll take it one more from
representative david not chairman david
knight from the 130 house district you
see the airplane man yes
there's
does a gentleman yield yes sir i do
first of all to my friend i want to say
thank you um
good times and bad times the state has
gone through but it has gone through it
with a steadfast hand
and that's to you my friend who has led
this state through
those good times and bad times and
that's a rough position
on both sides of it but you've done it
you've done it fairly and you've done it
with all georgians in mind so i want to
say thank you for that thank you and
we're a better state for it
but
i've had if you'll let me just i've had
some really good partners in the foxhole
yourself included
late senator jack hill in the senate the
current chairman blake tillery in the
senate as we went through the pandemic
last year all of you and many of you
that are
chairman of other committees now that
have been sub-committee chairs have been
in the foxhole with us with our staff
and it's uh
we couldn't do our i couldn't do my job
i couldn't do this job it hadn't been
for folks like you and the others thank
you your kind
this gentleman for a serious question
yes
isn't it true that this year
in regards to higher education this is a
very historic budget yes and we have
done some great things
uh in regards to removing the the
special initiative fees
we've done some great things as far as
resetting the hope scholarship so that
better aligns with
tuition fluctuations and getting
everybody up to that ninety percent
level
and isn't it true that this is going to
save
literally tens of thousands of students
anywhere from
uh you know hundreds of dollars up to
you know two and three thousand dollars
a year in higher education it will and
you know i i mentioned it a little bit
and
i'm glad you asked that question because
i don't know that folks understand the
importance of what is being done there
in making sure that funding formula is
fully funded those special special
institutional fees have been in place
since i think 2008 am i correct
um
do
are a considerable cost burden to
families so those will be going away
the university system had worked with us
and worked with opv over the fall to
make sure that if we were able to do
this that those things would go away and
so
when i got the phone call that everybody
had gotten to the right place on that
back in the fall that was a pretty happy
day so i'm glad to see it
mr chairman i appreciate it i know that
again a lot of folks need to go a long
ways to get home before the weather hits
but
again thank you to everyone for your
hard work in this
we've we may not have gotten everything
that you wanted but we tried to get some
of what you wanted within this document
mr chairman i'd just yield the well at
this time and ask everyone's favorable
consideration on house bill 911 thank
you thank you mr chairman the gentleman
has yielded the well we do have another
speaker
the lady from the 105th
representative mcleod speak to the bill
thank you mr leader
good afternoon everyone
i want to thank everyone that worked on
this budget and i want to thank chairman
england for always answering my question
and i had a few
um and i also want to thank the biden
administration for the funds that have
come back down to the state of georgia
fed from the federal government
i remember my first day in session in
2019 and the speaker stated our most
important job in this house is to pass a
budget for the state of georgia
the budget lays out our priorities
the budget has
the head has some really good stuff in
it like
mental health funding maternal mater
mortality
and sickle cell and so much more
but the largest budget item is education
it is a disservice
to our children our teachers and our
parents to state that we have fully
funded the quality basic education
formula
since the last time it was updated was
1985
and we are now in 2022.
i offered i've offered a pilot program
in hb 71 to look at this formula so we
can really truly address all the issues
that our students and our teachers are
feeling are facing in public schools
in this budget there is an increase in
the private prisons funds it went from
127 million dollars to about 140 million
dollars
this ensures that
we have a thriving school-to-prison
pipeline with nice warm bodies
let's talk about the number one state to
do business
but it's not the number one state
for employees and workers
the callousness of this
of this what happened with the labor
commissioner
showed poor leadership during a pandemic
and our constituents felt the blunt of
the dereliction of duty by the labor
commissioner
many lost their homes couldn't afford
food and medicine because
they lost their jobs due to no fault of
their own
and got no relief from unemployment
i am still getting calls from people who
are still waiting
decisions are are being made to strip
the power from the next labor
commissioner because of the failure of
his his or her present predecessor
staff furniture equipment
workforce development are all being
moved to the technical college system
hb
1331 has the appearance of streamlining
but if you look closer it doesn't allow
for the new commissioner to have his or
her input
in this constitutional office
i'll end here
where i began
our budget is about our priorities
the priorities we invest
the priorities we the parties should
always be about the people who invest
their money in our government
the taxpayer
i yield the wealth
the lady has yielded the well
the chair now recognizes chairman
england for a motion

house bill 1069
house bill 1069 by representative
williamson of the 115th to be a taliban
act to amend chapter 3 title 3070
official quota george annotated relay
and examination treatment for mental
illness so as to provide for the
licensure of adult mental health
programs this bill having referred to
the committee on health and human
services that committee recommends that
this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative
williamson
to present the bill
thank you mr speaker members of the
house it's a rather anomaly for me today
to stand before you with a bill in front
of me in front of you for your
consideration that doesn't deal with
finances uh is the principal subject
matter but what is what this bill does
is it addresses an anomaly we have in
our licensing system for adult
residential
psychiatric treatment centers
currently under state law unlike the
federal government which has a sort of a
category or licensure for these kind of
centers our adult residential
psychiatric treatment centers
are
forced to go under the licensure of
personal care homes personal care homes
are problematic for this kind of service
because problem personal care homes
typically address end-of-life issues or
later in life mobility issues cognitive
issues things of that nature
under your in a personal care home you
can have visitors whomever you want to
see anytime you want to see them you can
have packages delivered that might not
be in a residential psychiatric
treatment care facility might not be
is um
help
could be harmful to to people seeking
to get well for mental illnesses and and
such as that
so it also uh importantly in a personal
care home
health care providers cannot administer
medication so for example someone having
a psychotic event they can't come into
the residences and administer the much
needed medication they have to transport
them to an emergency room at a much
higher cost so this bill in essence
finds the correct licensure
for this uh
medical
it provides a seamless continuum of care
throughout the res the psychiatric
community
and
and it does it in a cheaper manner than
the
workaround method we're using now
mr speaker i'll be happy to answer any
questions if not i yield the weld and
ask for the body's favorable
consideration
you have a couple of questions if you
care to yiel
do you yield yes sir yield chair
recognizes representative gilligan
to your right for a
question thank you mr speaker does the
gentleman yield i'll be happy to well
thank you um i do have a question as you
know i tend to vote against licensing
boards i think i think this gentlelady's
correct on that remark
now i i know where the no button is but
i do have a question
when i'm going through this
it seems to me that this licensing board
would actually make for more competition
and make it better for the consumer to
find the care that they need am i
reading this correctly that's absolutely
100 correct it'll foster more
opportunities for georgians to find the
mental health care that they need at a
local level that's a great question
thank you from that mr speaker i'll be
happy to yield the well and ask for the
bodies of favorable consideration
gentlemen has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered
the chair hears none the previous

clerk will read the caption to house
bill 1388
house bill 1388 by representative
burchett of the 176th to be entitled an
act to amend code section
913-142 the official quota george
annotator relating the requirements of
an official legal organ
supposed to provide an alternative
procedure for the designation of the
official legal organ this beloved
referred to the committee on judiciary
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes chairman burchette to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker
um thank you uh colleagues for allowing
me to present to you house bill 1388 uh
what this bill does is uh um gives some
flexibility in
um assigning the legal organ when
your newspaper shuts down 10 times so
far in the state of georgia illegal
organ has just completely shut down it
happened in my district twice and in
that case
the code as written now
it's fairly strict in
the guidelines of how to become a legal
organ
you have to have a paid
subscription you can't have 75 percent
more or more in advertising in the
newspaper well in in our case
that would mean that the only legal
organ would be a legal org in a county
over that doesn't have any subscription
in our county
which is not the underlying intent of a
legal organ to give notice and when it
happened in
our situation we were without a legal
organ for entirety of a month which
means that many of you with local
legislation
couldn't couldn't do that if it happened
to you
in in your district what this allows for
is that
in the event that you
your legal organ shuts down you can
qualify as an intermediate legal organ
if you do not meet the 75 percent uh
advertising requirement or if you do not
meet the paid
subscription
uh element of the current code and
that's the
adjust of the bill i'd ask you for a
favorable vote and hope you can do that
i appreciate that
and that's all i have mr mr speaker do
you yield for a question for a question
yes sir chair recognizes representative
sainz to your right for a question thank

not only
our particular issue there but for
issues in many rural communities in
upholding enterprises and newspapers are
included in that yes sir i believe that
to be true thank you

house bill 1384 by representative
jenkins 132nd to be entitled back to
event code section 8223
of the official georgia annotator
related amendment and revision of codes
generally so to require the department
to amend the georgia state minimum
standard codes to authorize certain uses
of ungraded lumber this bill hasn't
referred to the committee on agriculture
and consumer affairs that committee
recommends that this bill
do pass chair recognizes representative
jenkins to present the bill
greetings mr speaker members of the
house
house bill 1384 modifies the georgia
building codes to allow ungraded lumber
to be used for structural purposes and
uninhabited and residential outbuildings
the use of ungraded lumber will have
will allow farmers and homeowners to
have access to lower cost structures and
help small business owners who own and
operate these small mills
gain access to the marketplace
this bill should create a larger market
for urban wood and unmarketable timber
that typically winds up in landfills and
being burned is rubble
to um
[Music]
i guess to speak to this uh
just talk a little bit about lumber
grading what this does is this
allows ungraded lumber to be used in
these structures essentially lumber
grading allows
the
lumber to be produced with known
qualities it allows it to be sold
be purchased in large quantities and
bought site unseen
obviously in these type applications
that's a lot less important with
typically lumber that's produced on on
someone's own property
in uh in looking for solution to this or
several other states have already
addressed this issue we looked at uh
north carolina new hampshire
new york and wisconsin
in working on this bill this was vetted
through the georgia department of
agriculture the georgia forestry
commission the warrenell school of
forestry
the georgia forestry association and the
georgia association of realtors have
expressed support for this bill
and
pending your questions
questions if you care to yield i yield
chair recognizes representative jasmine
clark to your left for a question
thank you mr speaker does the gentleman
yield i yield
could you uh expound upon the type of
uninhabited dwellings that this ungraded
lumber would be used for i just want to
clarify exactly what type of structures
this is being used for
right uh in general an uninhabited
uninhabited dwelling would be something
someone doesn't sleep in uh it would be
a barn an out building uh
not something that would have a bedroom
that that someone would actually use as
a residence does the gentleman further
yield i further yield so would it be a
place like where you might keep animals
or where you might store things where
the integrity of the wood might still
be necessary
well
yes integrity of wood is necessary but
that integrity can be assured without
the formal uh grading by a
private lumber grading organization
we'll still have building inspectors uh
the carpenters that that actually erect
the structure uh will also do that
thank you
do you further you i further yield
chair recognizes
chairman burchette to your left for a
question
i'm sorry to your right
thank you mr speaker does the gentleman

hospital 1331 by president meeks the
179th to be entitled act to amend title
34 the fiscal code of george antenna
relating to labor and industrial
relations so as to change certain
provisions relating to the state
employment service in the employment
security administration fund mr lam
referred to the committee on industry
and labor that committee recommends that
this bill
do pass
chair recognizes
representative meeks to present the bill
thank you mr speaker ladies and
gentlemen it's pleasure to bring to you
house bill 13
31
33 it's an important number in a
work of literature that i happen to be
reading these days and it's no
coincidence of the number of that uh of
that bill
as legislators and our duty as a whole
it is important that we
work
and move in the right direction house
bill 1333 is a bill that does exactly
that
just as a drop of water does not rest
where it lie where it lands
neither does the legislation that that
we pass here the way
and what we pass here on this floor
ripples across our economy ripples
across the families of georgia and
impacts every single individual who may
be seeking um employment uh due to uh
pandemic and changes in their work in
their workplace the workforce in the
workforce and innovate in the workforce
innovation and opportunity act was a
four title
federal program
two of those uh funding two the funding
for two of those titles currently reside
within the jurisdiction of tcsg one
within the department of labor and then
one within the georgia vocational
rehabilitation services
what this bill does is moves title iii
funding from department of labor to tcsg
as we know and
during this past couple of years
unemployment services has been extremely
important to georgians and the
department of
labor and
department and tcsg both
have duplicative services in this area
so it's very important to streamline
this program to make sure that the
residents of georgia and those who are
seeking employment services
get the best opportunities to find
training as it was mentioned earlier by
chairman england and
being directed to those businesses who
have opportunities available for for the
unemployed
so mr speaker that is the bill
the hour is late and i'm very well aware
that
speech is silver and silence is golden
so with that i'll yield for a question
you have a number of questions
yes sir mr speaker
so let's see how much knowledge you have
acquired
chair uh recognizes representative
fleming to your left for a question
thank you mr speaker to the gentleman in
the well
i appreciate your explanation of the
bill i do think it's important i was
trying to follow some of the things you
were talking about initially
in your discussion
given the fact that labor is such an
important issue that we're facing in
society today could you
talk a little bit expound a little bit
about how your legislation
relates to that theory of doing the duty
that lies nearest could you talk about
that a little bit please
yes sir i appreciate the opportunity and
doing the duty that lies nearest the the
duty right now is is making sure that we
get the funds to
tcsg that they may better implement the
programs that affect georgians across
the state
do you further yield yes mr speaker
chair recognizes chairman estration to
your left for a question thank you mr
speaker will the gentleman yield for
several questions yes sir
representative meeks
i know you and i have discussed uh
house bill
133-1 before and
in our previous conversations we talked
about
what will not work except in silence
what is that
i only thought
and
we've also talked about what is the
unanswerable question
who am i
representative have you spent time
silently thinking about who you are
i have
and how has your consideration in you
caring house bill 1331 help to inform
you about that
doing the duty that lies nearest and
working for not ourselves but for others
thank you thank you mr speaker i'll
yield the well
[Music]
the gentleman has wisely yielded the
well
we have other members who wish to be
heard on the bill the chair recognizes
representative bode to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker i appreciate the
opportunity to speak
to
hb
one
three three one first and foremost i
would say that
the speaker was absolutely correct uh
the georgia department of labor has had
many challenges that we have all had to
deal with and help our constituents to
deal with
especially during these two years of the
pandemic however
i would be voting yes for this
legislation
only before for one reason i'm going to
be voting no
is that this legislation does not have a
sunset
being that it does not have a sunset
this bill
will affect
general assemblies and also the
department of labor
the commissioner
and two perpetuity
now i just want to give an example
of the reason why we need
a sunset
we have elections coming up
all of us in this room are going to have
to run for the re-election we're going
to have every statewide constitutional
officer up for re-election
including the governor including the
labor commissioner and so with that
being said why does the labor
commissioner
of future
generations of future years have to
suffer because this current labor
commissioner did not perform his
constitutional duties
and i recall
last year
sb
152
bipartisan piece of legislation
that pretty much every member in this
chamber voted for
that was the labor chief officer bill
basically our oversight bill
an oversight bill to have the general
assembly
and also the governor's office
to have this current labor commissioner
to report every monday on how many
claims
are being filed
how many claims are being paid out how
many appeals have been filed how many
appeals have been heard
every monday this general assembly and
this speaker of the house would have
gotten a report
but
the governor vetoed that legislation
and the reason why the governor stated
it was an overstep of this general
assembly
to basically
have
the
constitutional officer which is the
department of labor commissioner report
to the general assembly
it's a violation of separation of powers
executive branch
legislative branch
so i'm trying to find out what changed
within a year
i'm trying to find out why
on page 3 of sb156
line
48
section h
this code section
shall stand repealed on december 31st
2022
unless continued in effect
by the general assembly prior to that
date
why does this legislation not have a
sunset
i would vote for this bill if the sunset
was december the 31st
2022
this bill
will take away some serious powers from
a constitutional officer
one of those powers is to operate the
career centers across this state
the one-stop shops
that power will be a codified and taken
away
from the department of labor
commissioner
also the department of labor
commissioner will have to basically
transfer any funds that goes into
the
unemployment security administration
fund
on line 50 have the money deposited to
the department of labor commissioner and
whenever the governor's destiny who is a
political appointee and not an elected
official
transfer the money into
that
destiny's
account
so
we have a federal act
that states traditionally across the
state
across this country
traditionally the department of labor
commission is the one to distribute
these federal funds
the governor's designee is not
elected by the citizens of this state
the gun governor designee has to answer
only to one person the governor and not
the citizens of the state of georgia
so i'm going to ask you to vote no
because this is not bad policy at all we
need to have some coverage over this
department of labor and this labor
commissioner because we all had to pick
up the phone and figure out how can we
help our constituents when no one from
the department of labor would pick up
the phone and ask the call of the
constituents of this state
and we're still answering those calls
today republican and democrat but i'm
just asking that we're fair to the next
labor commissioner and allow that person
to do their job and prove themselves
worthy based upon the citizens of the
state that vote them into office i would
vote yes if you had a sunset of december
31st 2022 but i'll be voting no because
you don't mr speaker i would yield the
well with no questions
is there any
is there any objection
to the previous question being ordered
the chair here is none the previous
question is ordered
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair here's none the report of the
committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass
all those in favor of the passage of the
bill will vote i those opposed will vote
no
and the clerk will unlock the machines
have all members voted
have all members voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machines
on the passage of house bill 1331
the eyes are 90 the nazir 59 the chair

the bill having received a requisite
constitutional majority is therefore

what purpose does representative cannon
rise to make a motion state your motion

chair recognizes representative lot to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker
colleagues each person in this chamber
and nearly all georgians are being
painfully affected by devastatingly high
gas prices
these skyrocketing gas prices are making
work and family commutes extremely
difficult for georgia families
today georgia has recorded its highest
ever average price per gallon at 429 a
gallon
december of 2020 gas was two dollars and
three cents per gallon
and the price has been climbing ever
since
now reaching this record high
i am honored to stand here today on
behalf of our governor to present hb 304
hb 304 suspends state collections of
motor fuel taxes
through may 31st of 2022
and will be effective upon governor
kemp's signature
this suspension covers gasoline diesel
aviation gasoline liquefied petroleum
and special fuels such as compressed
natural gas
georgia has suspended a gas tax in the
past and it is critical that we consider
this action again today
this body has an opportunity to save
georgians near 157 million dollars each
month at the pumps
i would ask each of you to join the
efforts of governor kemp and speaker
ralston
in providing some much needed relief to
georgia citizens
mr speaker i yield for questions
you have a question if you care to heal
i will yield
chair recognizes representative park
to your left for a question thank you mr
speaker does the general leader yield i
do yes sir so i just had a question on
line 16
why is the date may 31st of 2022
put in here
is that arbitrary is there a specific
reason or purpose for it
so the period was a short time
period and then the governor has the
opportunity to do an executive order
beyond that if it's necessary
uh which we would then as a body have to
ratify when we return to session
thank you does the general any further
you i do yes sir so just to clarify
especially in light of the uncertainty
that we are experiencing
there will be flexibility provided to
the governor to ensure that he does have
the ability to
lower or remove the the gas tax yes sir
that's correct thank you
thank you mr speaker i asked for your
favorable consideration on this bill and
i yield the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute
the chair here is known the committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill
the chair here's none the report of the
committee is agreed to

chair recognizes representative cannon
to your left for a question thank you do
you yield yes ma'am how does this bill
work in conjunction with the other
measure that we passed about the
clothing allotment for the year for
those who are in these services
well those were for foster children so
i'm not sure they're obviously receiving
services from dfax
those services kind of
change whenever a child is 18 and
independent
i know they provide rent for apartments
they obviously wouldn't do that for a 10
year old so i'm not sure about the
availability the array of services that
defects are offering those 18 to 21 year
olds but i'll be more than happy to find
it for you
you have no further questions thank you

directors and embalmers so as to provide
for reinstatement of a lapse funeral
director's license under certain
conditions this bill i've referred to
the committee on regulated industries
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative gamble
to present the bill
well thank you mr speaker members of the
house we have a bill before you that
will absolutely affect the funeral
business in our state
this bill does something that our
funeral directors have asked for
and that is to allow a funeral director
who has a lapsed license to simply renew
their license
now if they renew the license they have
to complete all the continuing education
that's currently required to meet the
satisfaction with the funeral service
board and they have to pay all the fees
associated with what they would have
paid had they continued to keep their
license renewed it also removes the
limitation of being able to apply for
apprenticeship
twice and it just removes that
altogether so that there is no limit
this is a good bill and i would ask for
this body's favorable consideration and
mr speaker i'm happy to entertain any
questions at this point

all right

was reconsidered
previously
by this body
and is back on the general calendar and
is called at this time the clerk will

to house resolution or the caption to
house resolution 594.
house resolution 594 by reverend smith
the 70th proposing an amendment to the
constitution of the state of georgia so
as to provide the county and municipal
governing authorities shall be
authorized to grant temporary tax relief
to property severely damaged or
destroyed as a result of a disaster
this bill has referred to the committee
on ways and means a committee recommends
that this resolution be adopted by
committee substitute
chair recognizes the
chair
of the natural resources and environment
committee chairman lynn smith
to present the resolution
thank you mr speaker members of the
house
i don't know how many of you this
morning were very moved by the sermon we
had today from reverend russell bart
and um he talked about the greatest
commandment which is love the lord thy
god with all their hearts all mind and
spirit but he spent most of his very
excellent preaching time on love your
neighbor
and he was pointed out to us and at
times we get very confused about where
priorities should be
and as tornadoes drop quickly out of the
heavens i'm hoping today from his talk
to us this morning we're going to create
manna today instead of a tornado we have
some members who've already left because
of the fear of the storm
but we have an opportunity now i hope
to make a decision not for ourselves but
going forward for those who might face
the same catastrophe that my community
faced
and our delegation stood before you and
explained to you how
how devastating it was so let me recap
for you
the description of the bill
house resolution 594 would allow
temporary property tax relief for
disaster damaged properties which are
located within a nationally declared
disaster area
this bill came about because speaking to
local city officials county officials
they were lamenting the fact that a
property owner who lost a house at the
end of march paid property tax on
something they didn't have to the end of
the year
i was told it could not be changed it
could not be done with the help of the
ways and means committee we did present
to you an idea concept and it almost had
the votes it needed the first time we
voted like just a few votes so i hope
this evening that the spirit we hear is
not partisan but
more manna from heaven thank you mr
speaker i yield the well
you have a question
do you have a question
okay
do you yield for a question
it's up to you
yes mr speaker i yield for a question
depends upon where it came from though
let's not start that now
chair recognizes representative donahoe
to your left for a question
does the gentlelady yield yes i yield
thank you and i appreciate your heart
and that was a great message this
morning wanted to kind of let you know
that we we have to be here and help each
other's neighbors but when is the
temporary what is the date or temporary
mean
and so this is in fact temporary but
it's also permissive
and so the action will be created by a
general bill if this constitutional
amendment passes and then your local
governments
faced with this type of disaster would
meet they're not obligated to any
restrictions we place upon them it is in
their determination what that county or
community can afford to do to help give
relief to the impacted victims
thank you
speaker i yield the well before the next
storm no further questions
is there any objection to the previous
question
being ordered the chair here's none the
previous question is ordered
is there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute
the chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the adoption of the
resolution
the chair here is none the report of the
committee has agreed to shall this
resolution
now be adopted
all those in favor of adopting house
resolution
594 will vote i
those opposed will vote no
and the clerk will unlock the machines
have all members voted
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the adoption of house resolution 594
the eyes are 150
the nays are zero
this resolution having received the
requisite constitutional majority
is therefore passed
clerk will read the caption to house
bill 1358.
house bill 1358 by representative
ballinger the 23rd and others to be
entitled to an act to amend article one
of chapter three title twelve the
official quote of george annotated
relating to general provisions regarding
parks historic areas memorials and
recreation so to revise provisions of
law regarding the use of possession of
any handgun this bill i refer to the
committee on public safety and homeland
security that committee recommends this
bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes chairman mandy
ballinger
to present the bill
thank you mr speaker
liberty
freedom a lot of these things get
bandied around here at the house
this bill 1358 the chairman meadows bill
act
is to
allow people to get the government out
of their way
um
you know we live in precarious times
there's evil in the world we need to
protect ourselves
and this bill allows us to do so without
having to pay money to the government to
do it
all of our other
constitutional rights assured to us
don't require a fee
to the government to exercise
we can say what we want we can assemble
we can worship as we please
all of these rights
none of them we have to pay for
but
this bill gets the government out of our
way and allows us to do what we need to
do in these precarious times
these are law-abiding citizens
there are a lot of federal prohibitors
out there obviously we can't change
those
but those law-abiding citizens need to
be able to exercise a fundamental
constitutional right
without interference or payment
to the government
mr speaker the hour i know is very late
people are very tired so that's the end
of my remarks
and i'm not going to yield for questions
i don't think anybody here is going to
be persuaded one way or the other by my
answer
or anything else
if anybody has any legitimate questions
about the bill i'm happy to answer those
come see me over there a lot of people
have signed up to speak so we have
plenty of time to answer those
individual questions and i'll be more
than happy to do that
mr speaker i yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
rules committee limited debate to 30
minutes to each side
i'll let you all allocate that between
yourselves
chair recognizes representative
hutchinson to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker
it's my first time in the well for a
speech so
here we
go i'd like to start by saying that i
am a concealed carry permit holder
i want to repeat that
i
am a concealed carry permit holder
is there seems to be a misconception
that you cannot advocate for gun safety
and be a gun owner at the same time
i can see lots of my colleagues who i
know
have concealed carry permits
but they can also get they can also
advocate for gun safety
i'll be honest i am a city girl
i was born and raised in the suburbs of
new orleans
before we had to worry about carjackings
there was no there was no
reason for us to have a gun
none my dad his city boy same thing
his parents did not have guns he didn't
have guns he didn't need one he was in a
place with safety
my mother's family on the other hand
lives in rural louisiana
the mississippi river is in their
backyard
the gulf of mexico is about three blocks
away in the front
tons of critters
my grandfather shot shot everything that
was moving in his yard
except for his grandchildren
thankfully
we never had we never had guns in my
house and i chose not to have a gun when
my kids were little because of the
statistic
that if we had a gun in the house we
were more likely to shoot each other
than we were to someone breaking into my
house
but
in 2020 i was watching
a presidential debate
and during that debate
it was told to people with some of the
worst behavior
to stand back
and stand by
stand back
but stand by
i immediately grabbed my computer
and bought a gun online
i live one country block away
from academy sports i bought the gun
online i got an email that said your
gun's ready for pickup
walked down the street picked up the gun
no problems
but the salesperson said
what happened last night
i said i don't know what happened last
night he said i don't know either but we
ran out of guns last night
we sold out of guns last night
so i wasn't the only one who thought
that is a bad omen to stand back and
stand by
but i also in the same day signed up me
my husband and my two kids
for gun safety classes
not
gun
target track pr practice not
going to the the shooting range in
practice we had sit down classes with my
entire
family
now you fast forward to today
and i'm an empty nester
now usually when i say that i do a
cartwheel but since i'm wearing a dress
i'm not going to
my kids are both in school in the uk
the biggest reason why they're in school
in the uk is because it's cheaper and
you can ask me about that later but
another reason why they're in the uk
is
i do not have to worry about my kids
getting shot in the uk
the u.s
has
gun
deaths a hundred times
more than they have in the uk
even the police do not have guns
i am the mother of a black 18 year old
child
he's still a child to me
i don't have to worry about him getting
shot in the uk people ask me don't you
miss your kids they're so far away
no because they're safer there they are
safer in the uk than they are in
snowville
that's a big deal for me
i'm not losing sleep
about my kids in the uk because even the
cops don't have guns
now
when i was a new candidate i went to all
the new candidate trainings
one of those trainings it was you know
several days and i connected with this
lady there
and you know we were going had meals
together we were in groups together and
at the end of that training we had to
give our stump speech
now
my stump speech was
mediocre at best
but her stump speech she started with
i am the mother
of jordan davis
and it had to be a couple of weeks
before that
that i watched the movie or the
documentary three and a half minute ten
three and a half minutes ten ten bullets
and that is the documentary of jordan
davis's
murder as a mom
that documentary was gut-wrenching
gut-wrenching and it was fresh in my
mind so when she got up and she said i'm
the mother
of jordan davis
that was her only child who was murdered
that day
i lost it i just
i was so overwhelmed by emotion that day
that she wound up comforting me
it was her child that died but she
comforted me because i was so emotional
that day when she said that
and
as a mother
that is the worst possible thing
that can happen to me something happens
to my kids that's why they're in the uk
and that's why i feel good about them
being in the uk and i would be afraid if
my 18 year old black son were here
so i don't really care about the it's
not the gun it's the person or this is
our unfettered constitutional right
i thought voting was an unfettered
constitutional right but we got all
kinds of hoops we got to jump through
now
the fact is our kids are dying
they're dying
and i know that this is a bipartisan
goal
to make georgia safe enough
for my kids to come here
and me not lose sleep
thinking my 21 year old black girl and
my 20 18 year old black boy is out
in the line of fire
and i know that that's a bipartisan goal
and for that i ask you to vote no to
this measure to keep our kids and our
neighbors and our families safe
thank you mr speaker and i yield a well
chair recognizes representative roberts
to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker
colleagues i'm also going to start with
uh i'm pro-second amendment
when i was about 10 years old a man was
selling cleaning products door-to-door
and he tried to force his way into our
home
luckily a neighbor had called just
before to warn us but i remember my mom
going and buying a gun almost
immediately afterwards going to the
sheriff's office to train
and get her permit i believe we should
be able to protect our families
that said
like the majority of americans and
georgians i believe in common sense
regulations such as background checks
permit-less carry would allow people to
carry guns
openly or concealed without a weapons
carry license or criminal history check
thereby dismantling georgia's system of
responsible gun ownership
it would also deprive
law enforcement
of this vital
check which
seems completely inconsistent to me
because all of us in this chamber
support law enforcement
now i know the response is going to be
but criminals don't apply
for
carry permits
well i have some statistics from kevin
holder the executive director of council
of probate judges now all counties
report the total number of applications
processed but the law doesn't require
them to report denials so these numbers
are probably under reported in 2018
2654 applications were denied and 11
counties didn't report including three
of our largest
in 2019 2854
permits were denied 11 counties still
not reporting
in 2020
5292 denials with four counties not
reporting including gwinnett which has
over a million people
guess what the number one reason is for
a denial
criminal history mental health history
is also another one that a judge can
deny a permit on
so let that settle in more than 5 000
applicants likely with criminal or
mental health histories were denied a
carry license
the other thing just like representative
hutchinson talked about
i have a daughter graduating from high
school and
one of the reasons that i am supporting
her uh going to trinity college in
dublin ireland is because it has always
terrified me
that you can carry guns on college
campuses and now we are removing
in light of increased mental health
we're all seeing the mental health
numbers skyrocket
and we all know on college campuses we
have excessive drinking so again we're
relaxing
the minimal restrictions
we have
and and so
i feel safer with her going to college
in ireland
i know y'all are tired i know you've
heard these i know it's not going to
change your vote but i got to tell you i
have constituents
who are terrified for their children for
their families
i will never forget in
early february 2018
when brigid my daughter came home from
middle school
describing for the first time an active
shooter drill
she talked about how scary it was
to have to crawl on a shelf in a closet
and sit in the dark for what felt like
forever
made me start thinking about what kind
of drills i did as a child
i'm from dalton georgia
we did tornado drills in the south right
my dad's job moved us to california so
middle school and high school we did
earthquake drills
but it makes my stomach turn that our
children
are sitting in dark spaces
fearing for their lives that a shooter
is going to take them out i i just i
can't even handle it in
two week that was early february 2018
two weeks later i found myself
sobbing on the sofa again as the
parkland instant
you know was on the screen of my tv
and i got angry
because i realized it had been six years
since we watched babies
being killed at sandy hook and not a
damn thing had changed
i signed up to run for office two weeks
later
and guess what y'all
nothing has still changed instead you're
wanting to relax what little check we
have and why what for
because it's inconvenient for law
abiding citizens to fill out a form
oh my goodness
i just told you statistics
that more than 5 000 people were denied
permits likely because of criminal
history and mental health
so i got to ask you
i mean we don't know how many people we
kept safe by denying those permits
but i gotta ask you if you thought
filling out that little piece of paper
might stop
a
non-law-abiding citizen or somebody with
a mental health history
from hurting one child in the state
wouldn't he just
prioritize filling out the paper instead
of the inconvenience
i'm sorry when did we become this
society that it's
all about we're so self-centered it's my
freedom my rights my my my
this filling out a paper
is just inconvenient
it's a common sense check that keeps our
law enforcement safe and could keep our
families safe
so if you have
any i plead with you please say no to
this bill
chair recognizes representative wilson
to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker
colleagues before we take this vote i
have some tough questions to ask
why is it that we will not listen to law
enforcement on this issue
why is it that the people in this room
think that they know better than our law
enforcement officers our sworn deputies
on how to keep our communities safe
with this bill we're not being
proactive in preventing gun violence
we're being reactive
for political gain
that's all this is
over the last couple years
during the pandemic we had an uptick in
violent crimes
in communities that i live in
and it was covered all over the news and
we had multiple hearings under the gold
dome
to address this
were those hearings just for show
we had law enforcement officers chiefs
of police that were asked what can we do
what can we as lawmakers do
to make our streets safer to make your
jobs
safer
do something about all the guns
that's what they said
do anything
require a lock box in the car
don't make us
don't force us to resell the firearms
that we confiscate
help us do anything to limit the number
of guns
but this is an election year
in fact my memory
is long enough to remember the governor
promising when he ran in 2018
but this bill could not be more
misguided
because let's be clear
this is an extreme
policy position
we're saying you need a license to drive
a car
but not to have a gun
how does that make any sense
i won't belabor the point here because
i think this year especially we've all
witnessed the pressures that the
majority party is under
pressure to cater
to far right activists that are so
disconnected from reality
they cannot be reasoned with
almost every session
you give them a nibble of what they want
but this is a whole lot more than just a
nibble
so even if you won't vote against this
measure
i just want you to think seriously about
the consequences
of us being unable to know that firearms
in this state are in safe hands
it is going to mean more crime
more shootings
more guns equal more shootings
it's it's not complicated it's very
simple in fact
if that is the manufactured crisis that
you want to happen so that you can
continue to take political advantage of
it
then i guess it may make sense
but i certainly don't agree with it and
we know for a fact the majority of
georgians the vast majority of georgians
do not agree with it
so for the sake of our communities i ask
that you vote no
thank you mr speaker
okay we have others that wish to speak
and so the chair recognizes
chairman setzler
to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker ladies and
gentlemen the house i rise today in
support of hb
1358 which when you break it down
is a common sense bill
it's a common sense bill and i'm sad to
see that members of the minority party
are trying to make accusations this is
being done for political gain
they make they make reference to
election year these kinds of things
but if we boil down the circumstance
about someone having the
ability to exercise their basic right to
self-defense
the basic right to defend themselves
we find that weapons carry licenses when
it really comes down to it only do one
thing
weapons carry licenses only prevent
law-abiding citizens
from being able to defend themselves
when they really really need to
lawbreakers
don't need a weapons carry permit
they're going to break the law they're
going to perpetrate violence and crime
like sandy hook and charleston south
carolina some of the things that were
alluded to earlier those violent crimes
were not perpetrated
by law-abiding citizens they were they
were perpetrated by killers
intent on killing others and breaking
the law
the reference was made to the mentally
unstable mentally unstable people who
were intent on using firearms to create
terror do so
by breaking the law
the only impact that weapons carry
permits have
is if someone is in need to defend
themselves
to prevent them from doing it because
law-abiding citizens who follow the law
who would otherwise
need a permit
to carry a firearm to defend themselves
would be inhibited from doing it as a
law-abiding citizen
so as i talked to folks and as folks
here in georgia are listening to this
this debate let's boil it down
to what this is really about
my mom's a very very small lady she's uh
4 foot 11
and has always been
a person a very slight build not super
athletic and i can imagine
if we were in downtown atlanta and my
mom is a young mom there's moms out
there all across georgia and all across
the metro area that would look much like
a very petite lady imagine her pushing
a baby stroller down the street in metro
atlanta
imagine to their horror hypothetically
we can imagine this though that someone
were to jump out and and try to snatch
your child
i mean if someone were to snatch the
child of that person
a big athletic man and jump in a truck
or a van and drive away does she have
the ability to defend herself and her
child with her own hands
of course not
she is physically being dominated by
somebody who's athletically
just overwhelming to her
i know a good friend who actually served
with us in this general assembly that
had trained a
constituent of his
who never thought that she would need a
firearm but three months after she had
decided to carry one was actually
downtown in linux mall and she was
loading christmas presents into the back
of her car and a man came up behind her
and said ma'am i'm going to take your
purse from you and was going to take her
purse
having availed herself of the
opportunity to carry a firearm she was
turned and pulled up on him the man kind
of freaked out didn't expect this petite
young lady to be carrying a firearm and
withdrew immediately and she was saved
and she saved herself
without firing a shot
but by having that equalizer
friends people who don't have the
ability to carry that equalizer with
them expose themselves to dangers that
we can only think about
in horror
and the reason hb 1358 is so important
friends is because many people when
threats present themselves don't have
time to go down to the probate court
judge's office get their fingerprints
get things sent back to them go through
the process and have that
have a permit sent to them in a period
of weeks in fact in many counties in my
county in particular there was during
covid there was a process you had to
register online you had to schedule an
appointment it was a really really long
and drawn out process
but whether it's a long and drawn out
process in your county or whether it's
something that happens in one or two or
three weeks if a threat is made on your
life
that's an anti that's not anticipated if
for the first time in your life
you
whether you're a big strong athletic
male or a small slight petite woman like
my mom and family members if a threat is
made on your life that you know you
can't defend yourselves you're terrified
otherwise rendered
fearful to stay in your house
you don't have time
to go get a concealed carry permit you
don't have time to get a weapons carry
permit and wait the weeks it takes to
get that in friends if you're a person
like many of our george many georgians
when you need to defend yourselves
against potential aggressors you don't
have weeks to wait
when seconds count
ladies and gentlemen the house 1358 is a
common sense bill because in spite of
all the the images created by the
minority party and challenging this
common sense tells us
law breakers
don't need a permit the only thing that
that is only people that are inhibited
by this weapon carry license is
law-abiding citizens
who follow the law and would otherwise
need to defend themselves
nothing in this law requires georgians
to carry firearm if you as a georgian
don't want to carry a firearm don't
carry one
but if you as a georgian feel the need
to or if you feel you don't feel the
need to today but the time comes in
which you do your family
is threatened or you feel a threat that
emerges very quickly
this bill provides you the ability to
protect yourself
provide the equalizer that's essential
to preserve you and your family
and i think it's it's a good common
sense law that we can all support
and be proud of and without mr speaker i
yield the will
chair recognizes chairman heath clark
to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker um
this is something i don't do a lot you
know i've been here for eight years and
it's very rare for me to get in the well
to speak to somebody else's bill but i'm
here today to speak in support
of this bill
and i know
i know there's people
that are good people honest people
caring people that we're just going to
disagree on this legislation
but i just want to explain
why i'm supporting this bill and why i
would try to urge some of the people who
might be on the fence
to support this
first of all this bill does not change
who can carry or where you can carry
it simply says if you meet all of the
qualifications that the state has laid
out
to to be able to carry a firearm in this
state
that you can carry that firearm without
having to ask permission
and pay what is essentially a tax
that is
that's the bill the state has laid out
all the requirements
to qualify to carry a firearm
and if you meet those qualifications you
can carry
in fact most people what we know in
other states 16 other states have passed
this legislation as of yesterday
and most people in those states
still apply for a license
why is that reciprocity in other states
and expedited gun purchases when you
show up at a licensed firearm dealer
with a georgia weapons carry license
they know that you have a valid
background check
and so you're able to receive that
firearm
in a more expedient way if you do not
have a georgia weapons carry license and
you go
to purchase a firearm they have to run a
background check on you
that is that's the federal law
you know there's a lot of talk out there
about gun show loopholes and all of that
there is no such thing that is a
misconception
that there is no such thing as a gun
show loophole
the people at a gun show are federally
licensed firearm dealers and in order
for them to sell a firearm they have to
have a background you have to have a
background check
so
most people would still elect to receive
the georgia weapons carry license so
that they can expedite their gun
purchases and have reciprocity in other
states
so
you know it was mentioned earlier about
we're being proactive and and not
reactive and that's not totally true
either
one thing that we've seen through covid
i believe one lady was speaking about um
purchasing a firearm and they showed up
at academy and they were talking about
all the guns being sold out and that was
something that happened during coven
and we saw that
but what wasn't talked about a whole lot
was the the significant
delays
in people being able to receive their
georgia weapons carry license when the
courts were shut down during covid
that has not been publicized that has
not been talked about and that
is an infringement upon the second
amendment
you could go purchase a firearm
but you cannot possess and carry that
firearm outside of your house or car
because the courts of this state did not
process and there's still a huge backlog
we're talking longer than six months
in some cases to receive that georgia
weapons carry license so that is an
infringement upon the right of that
person to be able to carry and exercise
their second amendment right
what good is owning a gun if you can't a
firearm
if you can't carry it to protect
yourself and the purpose that people
have purchased those firearms to begin
with
i know one one speaker mentioned voting
and how we have to jump through
loopholes to vote i would disagree with
that but let's compare the two
[Music]
currently hold on currently
to go vote you show up
and you present your license and
validate who you are
and then you're given
a card and you go into the booth and you
vote
you cast your ballot you go
put it and then you take the paper you
put it at the machine it can't it cast
your ballot for you
compare that to
what we do with with with guns
you go
to a store you present your your license
to validate who you are and they do a
background check and see if that's who
you are and they validate that
but in order to carry that firearm
you have to go
and then
fill out more paperwork
get a license
a concealed carry license
and then you can carry and pay a 75 fee
if we're going to really compare the two
that would essentially be we need to
start charging a poll tax again
and make people pay
to to practice the right the fundamental
right of voting and i would disagree
with that just like i disagree
with forcing people to pay
a tax
to carry their firearm and so like i
said mr speaker 16 states have already
put this into practice
a lot of the concerns we've heard have
not been
played out in those states
and i would just urge people if you're
on the fence right now still on the
fence about this
again this bill doesn't change who can
carry or where you can carry
it just simply says if you meet the
qualifications that we have laid out for
you to exercise your second amendment
right that you can do so
and that's that's the bill mr speaker
and i would just urge people to vote in
favor of this legislation thank you and
i yield the will
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered
the chair hears none the previous
question is ordered
we have a minority report and then we
have the chairman's time
20 minutes for the minority report and
20 minutes for the chairs time
the chair recognizes what purpose does
the minority caucus whip rise thank you
mr speaker i move that we table house
bill 1358
gentlemen has moved that uh house bill
1358 be tabled all those in
favor of the motion will vote i
those opposed to tabling will vote no
and the clerk will unlock the machine
[Music]
of all members voted
have all members voted
if so
the clerk
will lock the machines on the
gentleman's motion
the eyes are 52 the nays are 91 the
motion fails we go on now to the
minority report and the chair recognizes
representative holly
for the minority report
gentlemen
suspend
all right this house will come to
order house will come to order
we have a minority report and chairman's
time
they're entitled to your respect
gentlemen may proceed
thank you mr speaker
something as i sat here
and i remember
actually i have to even say this because
i've never spoken to a bill from the
well before
i'm just thankful to god for allowing
for me to be here in this place
i used to work
within walking distance down that way
four judges
included
judge kimberly warden who i know was
looking down from heaven right now
and i'm just happy i'm here and
hopefully i can make you proud
i come to you today i rise to
[Music]
ask you to join me in voting no for this
bill
um much to like my colleague from
the 35th
came here and i'm able to speak about
how it was so important for us to look
at law-abiding citizens
but then at the same breath said that
those same law-abiding citizens would
find it too cumbersome to go before a
constitutional officer in a probate
court and get an approval through a
permit
we look at line 68 of the bill
and it tries its best to define
lawful weapons carrier
but no matter how you define it
there are only just carriers
just as there are only citizens and not
law abiding citizens
which are citizens
jails all across georgia are filled with
folks who thought
they were law abiding citizens until
they were not
we all tell ourselves that we're going
to obey each law
until someone we love
gets harmed
maybe a daughter of yours maybe a niece
something happens to them and then all
of a sudden
you just might snap
you might do something that's outside of
what the law will allow
then all bets are off
you know when i when i was writing those
domestic violence warrants the little
pink warrants
i always bear in mind the fact that just
with that pin
the ability to enforce that law
is necessary just to defend the lives of
those not only who are at the hands of
those who are violent
but also those who are going to be
responding to that violence
the ones who are going to protect us
the georgia commission on family
violence reports that a whopping 84
of the family related
deaths
this year
come at the hands of someone who was
holding a gun
does that sit with us right now
84
literally we're looking at the fact that
when it comes to law abiding
it's what we all hope for
but
each of us has the right to either
choose yes we're going to do right or
choose against it
however those americans who are dealing
with severe stress
very deep pains for which they have
sought help or maybe have not sought
help
making the right choice is not so
clearly black and white as it may be for
the lawmakers in this room
ask any prosecutor will tell you the
criminal offenses in the georgia code
describe acts which a person's
culpability
to commit that crime must be determined
in order for those charges to stick
a person's mindset
along with the review of the
circumstances leading up to their
actions can determine the extent of the
danger imposed
on themselves or others
now yes much has been discussed this
legislative session in the way of mental
health from counseling to special living
facilities to peer groups that help
folks
who are
unfortunately trauma bonding in their
time of anguish
and these are really great benefits i
don't make any effort here to diminish
them because they do have value
but when folks with severe
mental issues
and deeply painful experiences
you can just go drive down to their
local gun shop heck they can get in go
online right now and be able to purchase
a gun
without so much as telling a georgia
licensed physician or counselor for
screening or to ask permission to help
keep other americans safe
then won't it be our legislature who has
failed them
we're putting our own communities at
risk
now please i i don't want you to get
twisted
i have a very very healthy appreciation
for our second amendment rights i mean
we could talk days upon days between
browning and gatling and
i even like how it serves and i know
that's not even a gun
but
the problem still is
is that
we still have a very
very precarious situation that we're
leaving our law enforcement officers in
the men and women that i used to have to
take in their warrants from local folks
to even the gbi
and we're not even just talking about
the measures to keep folks safe with the
permit
let's talk about training
the fact that those same courthouses are
worked at walk a little further up
you'll find georgia post
that's right
peace officers there's this training
standards the standards of training
it's necessary to be able to not only
have that permit but also to be able to
know how to use that firearm
and yet there is nothing in this bill
that is stating that it's going to be
necessary for people to even be able to
know how to use that firearm
and that's really the tough part about
this
look we know
it's an election year
and so many here have been pressured i
mean we're all here
we
put up a big black fence around this
place you think you're secure
but you know good and well
that there's law enforcement officers
from our georgia capitol police
to those who are in our local
communities
i wanted to highlight for you even today
up here unfortunately we're not showing
him
but even four officers
that we found even in 2021
who were unfortunately gunned down
trying to serve the
public our colleagues from the 171st
district
the 31st the 149th and the 75th
certainly have heard about captain
justin bedwell
certainly know the sacrifices of sheriff
lena marshall
they know corporal dylan harrison and
certainly for those in clayton county
know officer henry lackson
i know
for those residents who live with me in
henry county we certainly know the
sacrifice of officer paraman's messiah
these are people who kiss their families
their wives goodbye
hug their children get out here
and hopefully we can keep them safe by
just asking for a small
document
a paper to be approved of by a
constitutional officer a judge
a judge who was sworn to the duty of
protecting the public
we respected those constitutional
officers here enough to give them a pay
raise
but are we
still so bold
not to listen to the cries
of those family members
who have lost an officer that they lent
to us
when soon as they let after their house
and here today
there's a bill
that the georgia sheriff's association
does not want us to pass
here is a bill
that the georgia association for the
chiefs of police
us
not to go through with
and yet here today
are we really going to allow
for an election
to cause us to turn our backs on the men
and the women
who have come to us to try to protect
our communities
i really don't think this is the time
for us to take up these matters
this is something that
if we're not going to table it
here's what i would suggest you do
because the public is not aware fully of
what goes on here
if you believe
that this measure is causing you to do
as my colleague
from the from the uh
warner robins area suggested that it's
that you're on the fence
this is probably a time
where a local law enforcement officer
who knows you that you talk to
someone that you have long trusted for
their opinion
this might be the time that they call
you on your phone and you will need to
take that call to understand what their
concerns are for this measure
and how it will put their lives in
jeopardy
so that's all here
i think we all are very clear about
what's going to happen in this place
but i must say
[Music]
i really wish god would be with the
officers who come to their next traffic
stop
because they have you to thank for the
next actions from here
that's all
chair recognizes representative mclaren
for the balance of the minority report
thank you mr speaker
sometimes i think
some folks in here probably think with
the amount of you know flailing around i
do that i don't love this building i
love this building
i love this building for the people in
it a lot of times i'll stop by the
minority leader's desk and i'll me i say
man this building
and the minority leader will save this
building
and then i'll walk away and that's the
whole conversation but i promise you i
treasure my relationships
with you
in this place and i look up listening to
my colleague and i look at the ornate
decorations and i think about legacy and
listen i'm getting nostalgia because i'm
leaving and so what you know it's that
quote from gladiator when a man sees his
end he wants to know that there was some
purpose to his time and special rules
you know what i mean i mean that's the
kind of sentiment that i'm bringing to
you right now
um so let's talk about legacy because i
feel qualified after a couple years to
speak even just a little bit
about legacy and this bill is steeped
in legacy it comes from a very specific
place a very specific identity of a
former state representative
and that former state representative
is matt gertler
this is matt gertler's bill
this is his old hb2 constitutional carry
some version of it and do you remember
what a pariah he was when he was in this
body he came up to this well for a
morning order i mean literally any air
you gave this guy he'd come up and be
like have y'all heard about
constitutional carry
if you haven't we'll dedicate another
minute of the time for colton moore to
come up and tell you the same thing
hb2 y'all what do you think the number
one email you all got in the 2019-2020
term was
right answer
hb2 constitutional carry brought to you
by matt gertler one of my favorite
members of the house just because of his
energy man i called him a liberty robot
because that's what he was
he was like you know vote no i mean he
50 of the time he voted no unlike every
bill including the good ones
and why did he do it because he had this
calculus that liberty was simple
liberty's not complicated liberty is
easy to protect vote no boom go home get
reelected right
i had a game this is not a joke well it
is a joke but it's not this is what i'm
saying is true i had a game show i
played with myself imagine like you know
game show network like why did girler
vote no and so i would like see his no
vote it'd be like one or two no votes
and i think to myself okay i'm gonna go
up to him and i'm gonna guess the reason
he voted no
and sometimes it was really fun i mean
he had that one with the um the cable
bill
cable service for military folks right
you go overseas you're like serving your
country
and and the good people in the
republican party and georgia state
legislature said we're gonna let those
people out of their cable contracts
early like that's the least thing we can
do for active duty military and kirtland
was like nah man no you're stuck in that
cable contract right and so i went up to
him later and i was like hey gert i got
this little game i play where i try to
guess why you voted no tell me why you
voted no
i said is it because freedom of contract
right we don't want the government to
interfere with freedom of contract he
goes easy and he walked off
so he was the liberty robot
he
is who this is about
that type of thinking that there's no
nuance to liberty
that freedom is an absolute
and this house
not only blocked him but took pride in
blocking him no sir
representative matt gertler you are not
going to you're not even going to get
the slightest bit of air we'll give you
morning order time but you will never
pass a bill you're always on the wrong
side of this chamber and everything you
stand for is not what we in the majority
stand for i mean he you could not have
been more of a pariah than matt gertler
the the just the rousing celebration
when his replacement came and i love his
replacement
but but this house was like overjoyed
when it got rid of gerd
but here we are passing his bill
so what changed
what changed you know the very first
words out of the author's mouth where we
bent you know
freedom and liberty or words we banned
year round don't care about freedom in
2019
do you care about liberty in 2020
or just figured out this year
that matt gerler was right the whole
time
[Applause]
you know when i first joined the house a
member house leadership said to me with
great gravity that i appreciated that i
still appreciate when i look at the
ceiling and i think about the honor of
being here that some people just want to
burn this building down and they don't
care
i think about my no votes on a local
calendar it actually kind of sucks
because i get emails from your
constituents saying you voted no on our
local bill why do you care because i'm
making a protest obviously
because you didn't care about what our
local governments wanted to do so why
should we care about yours man
but i care about this institution and
that member of house leadership said to
me some people just want to burn the
building down and girl is one of those
people i guess that sentiment holds when
there's only a handful of people that
you say it about when the rest of us are
steady-handed and civilized but i guess
if the whole majority in the whole house
wants to finally burn it down together
then it's not burning it down anymore
apparently
every democrat who spoke from the well
tonight flipped one of your seats
on the message that the public doesn't
want stuff like this
go through the list
we hold formerly republican districts
where people with
certain demographics whatever
believe that they need representatives
who are not going to buy into this drift
right bs
to appeal to the base
it's not an accident that we came up
here to deliver this message
the majority party has made the
calculation that the short-term boost
they get for the base
outweighs long-term damage to the brand
and public policy consequences that is
what you own tonight
and let me tell you something
matt gertler's no longer here
y'all took him out
one of somebody posted an ocean's 11 gif
of like we did our work we got rid of
the guys that were on the other side and
now we can sail off into the sunset
we're so happy
celebration all around
but even though matt gertler's not here
even though he's in dc working for
thomas massey helping him put you know
assault rifles and christmas cards or
whatever
his idea is on the house floor on a
friday night
and even though matt gertler's not here
tonight
former state representative matt gertler
tonight
wins
mr speaker i yield well
[Applause]
we're going on now to the chairman's
time
chair recognizes
chairman jay collins
the chair
of the public safety and homeland
security committee
thank you mr speaker
i won't take much of the chairman's time
here this evening
but i do find it very ironic that some
of the people in this chamber now who
wanted to
defund the police a few years ago were
asking us to trust the police i find
that to be a very rich irony
here late in the evening
you know when i came into this house i
had a lot of people back home in my
district
who were pushing me on constitutional
carry
and if you'll think back about it you
know i haven't been one of those people
who stood down here in the well or
advocated in the hall for for
constitutional carry
but for me
personally my mind on constitutional
carry was changed just a few years ago
because see when i go home at night
i drive about 35 miles west
into a little community called
villarrecra georgia
and when i turned on the tv
and i saw our capital city let's talk
about burning
let's talk about our capital city
burning down with rioting and protesting
let's talk about that
let's talk about our capital city
burning
and public safety officials
couldn't get post-certified officers
couldn't get police officers to come do
their job because they didn't have their
back
let's talk about burning down
the capital city
30 miles from my home
and then let's talk about all the people
that reached out to legislators and said
you know
i've never had to have a reason to carry
a gun but now that i want to
my magistrate my probate court is shut
down
i can't carry a gun
and they're burning down these
neighborhoods right around us
we're seeing violent crime
so yeah my mind was changed about
constitutional carry
you know one of the things i've heard
this evening is we've heard a lot of
rhetoric and we've heard a lot of drama
dramatization about
what this is going to do and what that's
going to do and i like looking up at
this capital ceiling as well
but i read a book with my little girl
it's called chicken little
the sky is not falling here ladies and
gentlemen
the sky is not falling
no state that has adopted constitutional
carry has had to repeal constitutional
carry because they seem blood in the
streets
no state that's adopted constitutional
carry has come back and said you know
we made a terrible mistake
let's put the car in reverse
no state has done that as a matter of
fact i believe some of the people that
are going to come up here and speak to
the balance of the chairman's time
may allude to some of that
but ladies and gentlemen i'm with you
about burning down the building
that changed my idea about what
constitutional care meant to me and my
family 30 miles west when we saw
the absence of public safety during
rioting and looting
and mr chairman or mr speaker i'm going
to yield the balance of the chairman's
time
to two speakers
chair recognizes
chairman ballinger
for a portion of the chairman's time
thank you mr speaker curiously nobody
came and asked me any questions
but there were some falsehoods that were
told up here and i feel the incumbent
to clarify to clarify them
our sheriffs the georgia association of
the sheriff's association here in
georgia i texted their executive
director they are neutral on this
position on this bill
the chiefs of police they are also
neutral on this bill
as for it being gertler's bill
that's not gertler's name up there
that's mine i signed this bill this bill
is mine
their permit less carry has been filed
seven or eight times in the last six
seven years by various members of this
body but that's my name up there and
this bill is mine
this does not do away background checks
you have to have a background check to
even buy a gun
only people that beat the current permit
requires requirements will be able to
exercise permit less carry
y'all there's evil in the world
our courts have ruled that our hands
hands
are deadly weapons
should we chop everybody's hands off
give us all little hooks
cars knives fertilizers ied
all of those things people use to hurt
others
there's evil
we need to protect ourselves
we do listen to our law enforcement
officers but we do need to
not neglect our personal responsibility
driving is a privilege not a right so
says our courts
it is not in the constitution you have
the right to ride your horse anywhere
you have the right to ride the carriage
or car anywhere that's not in the
constitution
our leaders in congress have not had a
constitutional amendment
to add driving a car therefore you
should have a license and prove that you
can exercise that privilege
safely on our streets
you know i'll close with this some
people say why do you carry a gun
and i say because the law enforcement
officer is too heavy i yield the well
chair recognizes for the remainder
of the chairman's time
chairman alan powell
thank you mr speaker and ladies and
gentlemen and uh before i say anything i
want to thank
my dear friend representative ballinger
for carrying this bill today
i'm going to talk about a number of
things and first i want to get a couple
of things off my chest and i heard some
of the opposition speak
and there was a lot of miscellaneous
information i think it was portrayed no
the sheriffs
and the chiefs
obviously haven't said anything
in opposition as a matter of fact i had
a group of these sheriffs from northeast
georgia here today
and none of them said anything to me
because i already knew their positions
they believe in the second amendment
or as a lot of the law enforcement
people will tell you that the best
friend the law enforcement officer has
in an emergency is a law-abiding citizen
with a weapon that knows how to use it
to back them up
and that's something we've always said
but i heard some of the other comments i
heard a former member being
being referenced and how he was run out
of here well i don't think he was run
out i think he resigned any or he didn't
resign but he ran for congress if i
remember correctly
so a lot of the sensationalism that's
been said is you know quite frankly
misinformation and i understand it's an
emotional issue to some people
some people are just adamantly opposed
to it but i want to talk a little bit
about the history when i was elected
to the general assembly
it was a different day
than it is today
when i was elected 32 years ago
you you either didn't need a permit
didn't have a permit or you had what was
recognized
as a pistol toter's license
you went to the probate judge whatever
county you lived in you gave them five
dollars
if the probate judge recognized that you
were a
good citizen or
you might have been convicted of
bootlegging or something that was
considered an honorable profession in
the day
but as long as you hadn't shot anybody
other than your wife's lover then you
were
given a license at that time
but i remember when i was elected the
first
i remember that the first bill that i
ever passed in this body
was a second amendment bill because at
that time
you could carry a weapon in your vehicle
but you had to keep it locked in the
glove compartment or in the trunk well
guess what kind of good that would have
done and i finally it was like pulling
teeth
but we got it moved to the compartment
or
somewhere under the seat so you could
get to it if you ever needed it because
a gun that you can't get to an unloaded
gun
really doesn't serve the purpose
for what it is and i'll
pause right here to tell you
that your weapons and your rights to
have a weapon
means that that is a weapon for your
protection or for your sporting ability
it's a defensive weapon it's not an
offensive weapon
if it's an offensive weapon then you are
violating the law
but it's a defensive weapon for your
protection
but i remember a few years later we went
on and we had a good member in here from
his name was curtis jenkins and he and i
when the brady act was passed in
washington
we had an opportunity then that we
stepped up the
weapons permitting license
and we passed that law and curtis he
later went on to other issues and other
fame and
hopefully fortune by getting out of the
legislature
but we passed that bill on the heels of
the brady act
and that was to require
a background check
because that background check then put
us in compliance with the federal law
and even circumvented the intent of the
brady act
so that if you wanted to get a weapon
you didn't have to wait
several days or weeks or whatever
because you'd already been background
checked
well from that point on there was a
little bit of a little bit of
legislation passed here and there
nothing outstanding
and then i don't know a few years ago
representative jaspers and
representative ballinger came along
and we had a guy by the name of for
those of you who don't remember
john mattis
or the huckleberry is a lot of folks
affectionately knew him as
and we came forth with house bill 60.
and that was a bill that we really got
into
the weeds about concealed weapon permits
and
we passed that bill
and somewhere over in my office if you
ever come by over my office you'll see a
picture on the back of my wall over
there
it's a picture that the new york times
and the la times
put on the front page of their paper
and had a picture of me and i think it
was representative jasper's backside was
showing
and it had in there on the front page of
these two
esteemed papers that there will be blood
in the streets in georgia because of
these dangerous individuals
well folks that was about eight years
ago
and the only blood in the streets that i
know of today
comes
from criminals people perpetrating
criminal activities
we're living in a different society
you know
i'm going to read the constitution in a
minute but i'm going to give you another
little tidbit of this
but you know
people have always had weapons
they've always had weapons because this
country was founded
in the blood of
rebellion it was founded in the blood of
rebellion
and that's always been something that
our
people have always relished
i don't think that there's times in this
country that people actually wanted to
carry a weapon but they carried a weapon
and usually the bad guys were always
dispatched in some shape form or fashion
but i hear all of this talk this
anti-talk
but i want to
i just want to read a couple of things
to you and i'll give you another little
tidbit of history maybe to answer what
some of the earlier comments have been
made
if you read your constitution on the
second amendment
provides for a well-regulated militia
bearing being necessary to the security
of a free state
the right of the people to keep and bear
arms shall not be infringed
you know if you believe in the law of
the land
if you believe in all of those things
that so many of you
on the opposition party or those who may
be a little bit left of the folks that
like to i always love to hear that
saying i'm second amendments but
but what
you need to read
your rights shall not be infringed on
now i want to read you the georgia
constitution
and this is an old this is an old
language that's been in there and it
deals with the arms right to keep and
bear the right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed
but the general assembly shall have the
power to prescribe the manner in which
arms may be born
same language a little bit of a version
difference on the general assembly's
duty
so
for the last 100 or so 150 years
as general assemblies meet they decide
in which manner they'll be born but they
still keep in mind
that the rights of the people shall not
be infringed on ladies and gentlemen
they should
i can talk about crime i chaired public
safety i've been involved for
30 years 32 years in public safety in
this state and in the legislative arena
and i'm quite frankly taken back
with the level of crime that i see today
i see what law enforcement officers
what they have to deal with
i know why people need
to be armed but they're not mandated to
be armed
if they want to be armed and exercise
their rights they can do it
but i will tell you whether it is a
concealed weapon permit that is current
or permit less carry
it's all the same
because if you look at the statistics
it's not those people who have a
permitted license
that are creating harm they're creating
criminal activity
and it won't change
you're still going to see the same
criminals
the ones who get their weapons a
different way by breaking into your
houses or breaking into your cars
i will submit to you ladies and
gentlemen again
you won't see brook blood roll in the
streets with this
you'll see the same
action you always will
i have even told people my personal
advice to them is because of the con
current concealed weapon law
that you need to keep that if you have
one
because it's worth it for two fronts one
is it if you go to another state
then you'll have reciprocity if that
state doesn't recognize
our laws
so you'll still have that right
more importantly you will have already
met the prescription of the federal laws
on going to a licensed gun dealer
to buy a weapon
this is what the second amendments will
do
i would encourage everybody here to
remember this
because this is your family it's your
right to protect yourself ladies and
gentlemen
my thanks to the lady
my thanks to the so many of the members
in this house that have
that have supported this but i do want
to leave one parting thought to you
on something
i kept hearing the sailing point in here
was about the right or the left or the
extremism and such as that
let me tell you something there are
those of us who have been here that
we've been second amendments all along
and i want to tell you and i want to
tell some of the folks out there that
continue to put out misinformation about
second amendments in the georgia general
assembly or at least weighs this house
you know we've got several groups in
this state that are strong second
amendments
we've always been strong second
amendments but quite frankly there's a
little thing about political power and
influence runs downhill
we live in a state
unfortunately i've seen the
the
power and the influence of the
legislature wane over the whole 30 years
i've been here
it's always been usurped by the power of
the executive office
it's because we're a part-time
legislator and the governor is there but
we never had a governor
that promoted
permit less carry or that term
constitutional care
so for the naysayers out there in radio
land
they can hear what i'm saying
there's a lot of members of this house
it's always been
second amendment strong
but if you don't have a governor that
says it he'll support the bill we're not
going to pass a bill that he's going to
veto that'd be crazy
so we now have a governor who has said
that he will support permit less carry
that's the difference ladies and
gentlemen and let's move on to the next
step
and i would encourage you
to cast your green vote on this board
don't say i'm second amendment but
because we know what that means
stand up and support your constitution
ladies and gentlemen mr speaker thank
you for the time and i will yield this
well
there any objection to withdrawing the
committee substitute
the chair here's nun the committee
substitute
is withdrawn
is there any objection to adopting
the substitute offered by the committee
on rules
the chair here's none the rules
committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair here has known the
report of the committee has agreed to
shall this bill now pass
all those in favor of the passage of the
bill will vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will
unlock the machines
what purpose does representative mccloud
rise
parliamentary inquiry inquiry
is it true that if we were really
confident that guns done don't kill
people then we would demand that the
metal detectors be removed from the
capitol
well i think that addresses itself to
the judgment of each and every member
what purpose
represent does
chairman petrie rise
parliamentary inquiry
mr speaker is not true that according to
the cdc almost every major study on
defense of gun use has found that
americans use their firearms defensively
about 1.7 million times annually
the gentleman so states i'm sure he
sincerely believes that to be true
what purpose does representative derrick
jackson rise parliamentary inquiry
inquiry
mr speaker is it not true the reason why
we have a fence around this building is
because what took place on january 6
when insurrectionists
when ins
may i finish
may i finish
allow the gentleman to finish his
parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
speaker
is it not true the reason why we have a
fence around this building it's because
what took place on january 6 is not
because of the criminal activity that
took place in atlanta
i think the offense was planned in
advance of both of those events uh
representative
one more parliamentary inquiry and then
we're going to
lock the machines what purpose
does chairman tarvin rise
baltimore into inquiry state your
inquiry mr speaker is it not true that
this fence was planned in 2018 or 19 due
to fine white powder uh
on the statues out here and all around
the capitol and it was for to keep
people out of here at night not to
protect us in the daytime
i believe that to be true i know it was
planned a number of years ago
all right if all members voted
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine on
the passage of house bill 1358
the eyes are 94. the nays are 57.
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed what purpose does
representative cannon rise to make a
motion state your motion i'd like to
move that
on the next legislative day this bill
will be reconsidered by
are you making a motion that you're
serving notice
of your intent to ask for
reconsideration on the next legislation
yes i am
so that's so noted
and it will be on the next legislative
day's calendar
clerk will read the caption to house
bill 839
house bill 839 by representative thomas
the 39th to be entitled an act to
incorporate the city of mapleton this
bill ever referred to the committee on
governmental affairs that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
chair recognizes representative erica
thomas
to present the bill
thank you mr speaker
i know that the hour is late and so i'm
not going to tarry long on this bill
but it is very important that i speak
for the citizens of my district
hb
839 is the proposal of the city hood of
mableton
mableton cityhood would give us local
control over vital elements of committee
committee community building excuse me
such as zoning community development and
that in turn will give the community
greater autonomy over what happens in
our community
people believe right now that mabelton
is already a city
i've had so many people come to me and
and think that it is already a city
and my people
want to bring local control closer to
their district
at this moment um we have a county
commissioner that is over
our unincorporated
part of
of cobb county which means that that is
one
commissioner to 186
000 people
this bill would bring it closer to us
putting one
city council member to 13 000 people
cityhood would give mableton residents
closer to their government like i said
before in this bill the mayor
would be duly elected by the citizens it
would be six city council members which
would make it a weak mayor and the mayor
is also duly elected
by the people
now
a feasibility study that was presented
three years ago which get which which
was able to give
the citizens of mableton three years to
do about 16 different town halls we also
did a study on
our website
the south cobb alliance's website
letting people give their opinion on
what services they wanted and of course
they said they wanted sanitation
and waste management they wanted zoning
they wanted economic development they
wanted
community development and that is what
we wanted to give them the feasibility
study was presented by the university of
georgia's carl vinson institute
and
the study said that we would have a
surplus of 3233.64
which would make us in the black
the last thing that i will say on this
bill is that
we are state representatives and i think
that is so important that representative
name and that we let
the people be able to
pick this at the ballot be able to go to
the ballot and say whether they want the
city hood or whether they don't want the
city hood and that is exactly what this
bill is doing
um mr speaker i think that i explained
it is to in a great extent
and i would ask that everyone in this
chamber would vote in favor of the city
of mableton and what you are voting for
is saying that
i want the people to be able to vote
for whether or not they would like the
city of mableton even though they
believe that the city is already a city
i
will yield for questions well like two
questions mr speaker
and i'm not going to ask
thank you i was going to ask who it was
but i didn't want to do that to you
i'll yield the chair recognizes
representative ridley
to your right for a question
yield yes i you i think you made a good
argument and uh thank you
you made a great argument by the way um
i guess i was just curious the arguments
you've made is that kind of the same
thing that people in buckhead are
wanting
and would you agree with that or or how
would you feel about that issue well
thank you so much mr really i don't
represent the people of buckhead so i
don't know what they want
okay and so i would say that my bill is
not what they want it's a different
jurisdiction it's different people and
so i can't speak for them because i
don't really know them
any more questions because i'm going to
yield the well right at that point
because people are
some of the people want it and some of
them don't want it and i'm for the
people how about you we're for the
people by the people with that mr
speaker i yield the wealth lady has
yielded the well
we have one
member who wishes to be heard on the
bill chair recognizes chairman setzlor
to speak to the bill
mr speaker i'd like to thank
representative thomas for leadership on
this we have four city hood efforts in
cobb county mableton is one of them we
have lost mountain east cobb vitings and
mabelton i appreciate her consistency
and leadership that cityhood
is a great tool in cobb county where
every citizen and unincorporated cub
has
one elected official per one per 86
thousand people 186 000 people this
cityhood effort is wise it's thoughtful
and i would ask for strong bipartisan
support for the city of mapleton thank
you
so
