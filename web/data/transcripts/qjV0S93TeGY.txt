I have the great honor this morning to introduce to you my pastor, our chaplain of the day, Jay Williams. Now I will tell you just no surprise to me that Jay Williams grew up and became a minister because he grew up with Matt Hatchett if that explains anything to you down in Dublin. A lot of things are explained when you look to the root cause. But first I'd like to introduce my church family, then at Ms. Pachurch in rural Effingham County. I just mentioned Jay. I want to introduce his wife Mindy, who's here with us today and his daughters. Annabel and Lily Grace. Hey, Lily Grace. Good morning. And Lily Grace sings, Jesus loves me every Sunday for us at our Sunday school, but when we open our Sunday school and she has a beautiful voice, you know when you have a preacher in your church, many times they are just that, a preacher. But I know that we all at times in our lives really need a pastor. And I'll tell you that Jay Williams, he fits both of those roles. He brings a great message, but his real strength is that he is a pastor. He's ministered to our church and his proven, our church is growing. Jay's ministry over the years has been very powerful to a number of people, young people, older people. He's ministered to all ages, all across South Georgia. Jay Williams is at a church that was founded in 1859. And he's carrying on the tradition of men and women who've passed her that church. And I'm so very proud that he's been able to be there for my family and times of joy and times of sorrow. I'm very much looking forward to his message today, my pastor, the pastor Jay Williams. Pastor, it's an honor to be with you today. Can we start with the word of prayer? Father God, you are the creator and the sustainer of all that we know and see. This morning, I give you thanks so much for the speaker of this house and all who are willing to serve the people of Georgia as our representatives and leaders. In Romans 13, in your word, it calls these women and men before me, your sermons. It says that they are called, charged and empowered by you to keep those under their authority safe. Father, I know that that's not without personal cost and great weight. Lord, in a dog eat dog world where it seems like in recent times the tug of war for resources, position and advantage has become more and more heated, their job has become infinitely more difficult. For that reason this morning, I want to heed the words that you spoke to Timothy through Paul the Apostle. You said we should pray for those in authority that we may live in peace. Father, give them all wisdom, protect them and their families and buy your Holy Spirit, lead and guide them into all truth so that we may live peaceful, quiet lives and all godliness and holiness. Father, fulfill your agenda here so that this blessed state of Georgia may be a testimony to your goodness and guidance in Jesus' name, amen. I was told in order to keep global warming at bay that I was to keep my words to five minutes. Well, don't laugh. I heard that the politicians were the next to receive that rule. But in an attempt to comply with that, I decided to keep my words to five minutes. The first 20 minutes of this devotional will be done in American Sign Language. I do want to start with a little story. There was a family that had moved to a new place, a new house and a new town. And they decided on the first night that they were in their new house to have a family safety meeting so that they could know what to do in case of an emergency. Well, they called the family together and one of the kids said, I know what I'm going to do in case of an emergency. I'm going to go next door. The neighbors have a really nice dog and pet and them makes me so happy. Another child chimed in and said, I'm going to run out the back door to my playhouse back there. It's so familiar and I'm so comfortable there. And then another kid said, no, no, no, I'm going to run out the front door and there's a climb in tree out there and it's a really good climb in tree and it's my safe place. And they began to bicker and fuss about where they should meet when there's an emergency. And finally, the mother put her foot down and said, now stop. If the house catches fire in order to make sure everybody's safe, we have to find one place that everybody will meet up. Speaker and distinguished representatives, you and I know that it's only a matter of time before this house is on fire, ablaze with a passion of individual perspectives. My question is, when this house is on fire, where's the one place that you're going to meet up? I'm reminded of a story of a servant of God who was also called to keep those under him safe. His name was Joshua. And Joshua 513 reads like this. Now, when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, are you Democrat or Republican? Now, it says, are you for us or are you for our enemies? Come on. Neither he replied, but as Commander of the Army of the Lord, I have now come. And then Joshua fell face down on the ground in reverence and asked him, what message does my Lord have for his servant? The Commander of the Lord's Army replied, take off your sandals for the place where you're now standing, it's holy. And Joshua did so. The safest place to meet together, when the house is on fire is in prayer and humility to someone greater than the house, to meet in a place that is right and holy and just, and to appeal to the one who knows all the variables because God created it all. You see, Joshua fell to his face and said, what message does my Lord have for his servant? In AA, in the 12 steps, it says it's something like this, we have to first admit that there's a fire. I mean, that there's a problem and that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity. Does it ever get crazy in here? No, no. When there's a fire in the house and it's getting a little bit crazy, where are you going to meet up?

Where are you going to meet up? And I could hear somebody say, you know, but anybody can say that they speak for God. And many of us are guilty of saying that God's on our side and we do so without consulting Him or without consulting His Word thoroughly. At home I have a picture of a Nazi belt buckle. I wanted to bring it this morning and show it to you, but I did not want a picture snapped of it being on the screen of this great house. On that belt buckle is a symbol and an inscription. And the inscription says, God is with us. This was worn by a group of people who had dismissed the Old Testament and did not revered the New Testament. And we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God was not with them because they did not seek to be with God. The only thing they sought was their own agenda. And the house is on fire when we look for a place that is holy to meet. Oh, that this great house would continue to meet in prayer and then it would continue a bipartisan pursuit of God's agenda as it studies the scriptures that so shaped our great nation. And when there's a fire in the house, may it meet at the tree of truth so that those who live underneath your authority might not get specifically what they want, but they may live peaceful quiet lives in all godliness. Let me just say this, that the hope of a peaceful quiet life in all godliness does not rest on your shoulders alone. But if this house can find a common place to meet when it's on fire, then there's hope for Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta, Columbus, and all of the valued towns in rural Georgia and north rural Georgia. You're our representatives. You're our leaders. And our prayers are with you. I pray this morning that God is with you. But more than that, I pray that you're with God. Let's pray. Father, give this body the grace that only you can to do what you've called them to do and accomplish the task with which they've been entrusted. Give them your heart for your people and empower them to lead well and for the safety of the family. When the house is ablaze with personal perspective, may they find a holy common meeting place in Jesus' name. Amen. If you would please join me in the play. In the play. I pledge allegiance to the play. If you remain standing, we have a special treat, not yet. Boy, that was in mid-sentence, there wasn't. You've got to take a deep breath. You're ready now. The Jane Redding-Morero, wife of the President of Georgia Southern, Dr. Kyle Morello, and a renowned soprano known all over this world, not only here in America. We'll now, along with Steve Hine, the director of the Center for Wildlife Education, we'll bring forward freedom. A Southern bald eagle will be a part of our celebration to honor our country as we hear from our first lady, Georgia Southern Jane Morello. As she brings us a couple of selections, first will be our national anthem, and then you're going to sing, he has the whole world. He's got the whole world. Here she is, without any further ado. Thank you. Dr. Jane Morello. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, or the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that the flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, or the land of the free and the home of the brave? That was awesome. You may be seated. Jane. Freedom is such a treasure to us at Georgia Southern along with Steve Heine and our wonderful wildlife center. I shared briefly and I won't talk too long. The first time I met Steve and Freedom, they asked me to sing the national anthem at the Savannah bananas of baseball game, and Steve said, I just want you to know they stood right behind me that sometimes Freedom likes to sing. And I was like, oh, that'll be fine. And I started and he went, and sang with me the entire time. So it was an extra special rendition for me of the national anthem. My second piece is, as Speaker Burns said, he's got the whole world in his hands. And I've heard other people sing it where they say he's got the whole world in his hand, just one hand. But this, the lyrics for this is hands. And in a world where we need more unity, we need more peace, we need more hope, and we need more love for one another. I hope this song will encourage you. And thank you, Speaker Burns, for this wonderful honor to be here today. And Dale. Here's got the whole world in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got all the power in his hands. He's got all the power in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got you in me, brother. In his hands. He's got you in me, sisters. In his hands. He's got the little baby. In his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. He's got the mother and father in his hands. He's got the stars in the moon right in his hands. He's got everybody in his hands. He's got the whole world in his hands. Men. Thank you, Jane. We are certainly blessed. George is blessed by your talent and by your humbleness of known Jane and Kyle for a number of years. And be quite frank with you, I never knew she possessed that sort of talent. She's just a good human being, a great Georgian, and we love you and we appreciate you. And certainly continue to support your husband. He needs all the help he can get. Thank you all so much. At this time, we'll ask the doorkeepers. We'll unlock the doors. And I'm going to ask if you will bear with me a minute. Members, we're going to take a couple of photos with my pastor and then with Jane. And then we'll ask them to go out into the south any room. And if you would like to have a photo made with freedom or with a pastor or with Morerose, that'll be a great time to do it then. So if you will, bear with me just for a minute. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You and I was chairman Tarvan, the chairman of the committee on information and audits. Mr. Speaker, your committee on information and audits has read the journals from the previous legislative day and found it correct. And I would also like to say that I never thought I'd miss my chairman Uncle Don Hogan as bad as I do today. And I want to leave you with something to think about. Perhaps are at their safest when they're in the harbor, but that's not what they were built for. Absolutely. Thank you, chairman Tarvan. And we do miss chairman Hogan, but you will serve admirably, if you will, in his base. And so thank you.
