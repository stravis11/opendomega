It is now time for the morning devotion.
All senators, please take your seats and

the doorkeepers secure the chamber at
this time.
I now recognize the senator from the
39th to lead us in our pledge and
introduce our pastor of the day.
Senator.
>> Thank you, Mr. President, please join me
in saying the pledge to the flag,
American flag. I pledge allegiance to
the flag of the United States of

it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.
>> And now, the Georgia flag.
>> I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag
and the principles for which it stands.
Wisdom, justice, moderation, and
courage.
All right.
>> Good morning, colleagues. It is my proud
honor to introduce our pastor of the
day, Pastor Pete Peterson.
Pastor Peterson has attended Community
Bible Church in Stockbridge for more
than 16 years, where he currently serves
as executive pastor of the church and as
pastor of schools for a community
Christian school. Pastor Peterson is a
retired US Army officer with a
distinguished career spanning more than
23 years. He earned numerous military
awards for outstanding achievement,
including the Bronze Star, and several
meritorious service medals. His
international military assignments
include Germany, Korea, Kuwait, and
Iraq. Pastor Peterson holds a master's
degree in military arts and science from
the command and general staff college
and a master's degree in education from
Central Michigan University. Most
recently, Pastor Peterson was selected
by Governor Brian Kemp in 2022 to serve
on the Georgia Veteran Service Board. He
met his wife Anita while they were both
serving as soldiers in Germany. They
have been married now for 39 years. They
have two adult children, both military
veterans, and three grandchildren. And
colleagues, it is especially fitting
that Pastor Peterson is with us today
because today marks the 85th birthday of
the United Service Organizations, the
USO, founded on February 4th, 1941
during World War II by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide morale,
recreation, and support services to our
service members and their families.
Pastor Peterson's life of service,
leadership, and care for military
families reflects that same mission.
Side note, I will be honoring the USO's
85th birthday here in the chamber later
this month. And I also invite you to
join us this afternoon at 2:30 at the
USO at Hartzfield Jackson Atlanta
International Airport, the busiest USO
in the world, for a cake cutting
ceremony recognizing the men and women
who've served and defended our nation
for more than 250 years in so many
roles. And now, please give a warm
Senate welcome to Pastor Peterson. All
right.
>> Come on. We can do better than that,
right? I hope. Can we just a little bit
better? Thank you. Thank you for that
unsolicited.
For God so loved the world that he gave
his only begotten son that whosoever
believes in him should not perish but
have everlasting
life. Can y'all help me say that? For
God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son that whosoever
believes in him should not perish but
have everlasting
life. And my question to you this
morning is when was the last time
somebody told you that they love you?
Just look around. When's the last time
somebody actually told you that they
loved you? And if you haven't heard it
for a while, I just want to say today
that I love you in Jesus name. Matter of
fact, look at your neighbor. Say,
"Neighbor,
I love you in Jesus name."
All right. Very good.
So, I want to thank Senator Halpern for
the invitation and that amazing
introduction. Uh, Mr. President, and to
the rest of this esteemed chamber. Thank
you for what you do here at the Capitol.
We pray that the Lord will bless you
with the wisdom, the compassion, uh, and
the love to help all Georgians to live a
secure, stable, and prosperous life. So
today, I started out the session by
declaring John 3:16. And and and why did
I do that? Now, I know most of you've
heard that John 3:16 at church. I know I
heard it at Sunday school because my
grandmother Johnny Lee Levit down in
Dawson, Georgia, Terrell County, she
would religiously come and abduct my
brother and me from our home and take us
to church against our will. It was a
hostage situation. We did not want to
go, but she still took us to Bulerand
Baptist Church. But I thank God now
looking back over all those years that
my grandmother wanted to make sure that
her grandbs had a relationship with the
Lord Jesus Christ more than she wanted
to be popular with us cuz I want to let
you know she was not popular with us.
Okay? Just want to let you know that.
But I started out talking about John
3:16 and it's to remind everyone that
this is one of the most lifechanging
uh transformative scriptures in the
Bible. This scripture lets each one of
us know that God loves us so much that
he sent his son Jesus Christ to pave the
way to heaven. And this is not just a
touchyfey
love that fades when I blow it. It's the
type of love that we call agape love. It
is unconditional.
It is longsuffering and it is enduring.
Now, it's not enough just to know John
3:16 and that God sent Jesus to rescue
mankind. We have to personally accept
him. Somebody say personally. All right,
somebody say person. Awesome. Now, as a
20-year-old soldier in Hano, West
Germany, Third Armored Division, one
Friday night, I was sitting in the back
of the church and the pastor gave the
altar call and I found out that my
destination was not heaven. So I was no
longer comfortable with that. So what I
did, I walked down to the altar and
said, "I want Jesus in my heart." And
let me tell you this, that significantly
changed the trajectory of my life. And I
have not been the same. Not just because
I got an assurance of a heavenly home,
but more than that, it changed my heart
to the point that the love of God
started pouring out of me and it started
affecting those around me. Now, I don't
know about you, but when I grew up in my
household, we never really hugged each
other. We never said we love you. We
never kissed each other. We were not the
Brady Bunch. We were not the Cosby Show.
We were the Petersons. Now, I know that
my mom and dad loved us because they fed
us, they clothed us, and they nurtured
us. But it just was not our tradition.
And uh I want to let you know that as I
did grow up, I got a chance to leave and
leave Dawson, Georgia, and get ready to
fly out to Germany. And I remember that
my my mom, as our 19-year-old, she took
me to the Albany bus station. I was
getting on that to go to Charleston,
South Carolina to fly out to Germany. I
wanted to tell my mom that I loved her,
but I didn't. I wanted to hug her, but I
didn't. She wanted to do the same thing,
but she didn't because that was not our
tradition.
And it was 28 months later that I saw my
mom again. And by that time, the love of
God had been shared abroad in my heart.
And when I got home, I sat in my mom's
lap. I gave her the biggest kiss I
could. And I told her that I loved her.
And we started a legacy of love. So that
now my kids, my grandkids, we all say
that we love you. We all hug each other
and we all kiss each other. Okay, now
Pete, you're sitting here talking about
love in the Senate chamber. How's that
going to help me? I am so glad that you
asked that. I asked earlier, when was
the last time somebody told you that
they loved you? And I know that as
elected officials and you're taking care
of the business of the people, you need
to know that somebody loves you.
somebody uh has your back and you have
family members that you can also love.
Just know that love reciprocates.
If you spread love when you need it,
you can get it back when you need it the
most. Okay.
Again, why do we need to know this? Has
anybody ever had a difference of opinion
with anybody in the chamber here?
>> No. There you go. That's what I thought.
But the thing is, showing love and
letting love shed abroad in our heart,
we can still be civil to each other
because we know that we have a God that
really, really, really loves us. So, I
keep talking about this legacy of love.
And this is one of the things I want to
talk about that the Lord sent Jesus his
very best to redeem us. His love builds
bridges and tears down walls if we let
it.
I did ask, when was the last time
somebody told you that they loved you?
Now, when was the last time you told
somebody that you loved them? And if
it's been a while, I want to make sure
that you go out and tell them. Please
remember that your heavenly father loves
you so much that he cared to send his
very best to rescue you. Now, as we
stand for our prayer, as we stand,
I remember a hymn by Joseph Scriven, and
it says, "What a friend we have in
Jesus. All our sins and grief to bear.
What a privilege it is to carry
everything to God in prayer." Can y'all
join me in saying that? Look at your
neighbor. Say, "Neighbor,
>> what a friend we have in Jesus.
>> All our sins and griefs to bear.
>> All our sins. What a privilege it is
what a privilege it is
>> to carry everything
>> to God in prayer.
>> God pray.
>> Let us pray. Lord, you're good and your
mercy endures forever. Thank you for
being our God. Thank you for being our
friend. Today we ask that you would
bless these senators to faithfully serve
you and the citizens of Jo Georgia. give
them the wisdom, courage, and compassion
to be blessings to their constituents so
that we can live quiet and peaceable
lives. It's in Jesus name we pray and we
thank God. Amen. Amen. And amen. God
bless you.
Just remind everybody we have the state
of judiciary today. So we'll be walking
across at about 10:40.
10:40. So in about 9 minutes from now. I
know. Get excited. Senator, it's going
to be fun.
Senator from the 52nd.
Senator from 52.
You got the doc of the day. Come on up
here, Doc.
Thank you, Mr. President. I actually
don't have the doctor today, but since
the center of the 42nd isn't in here,
I'll introduce him. Um he uh
Jean McDas is an attending and assistant
professor in the department of emergency
medicine at Emory University Hospital
background in social biological sciences
and he's been active in organized
medicine since 2010.
He and I both do watch the pit. So uh um
it it can be realistic at times. And u
with that I'll let him say a few words
to us. We appreciate his work in the ER
and um working at Emery where as you
know I did my anesthesia at.
>> All right.
>> Thanks S. It's a true pleasure. So my
name is again Shami Doss. I'm an ER doc
at Emory over on main campus. So if you
ever need anything, please don't ever
hesitate to come and reach out and find
us. Uh we are here to serve you. Uh the
doctor of the day program is a privilege
for us. So, it's an honor for me to be
here and I hope if you have any issues,
I've already treated a couple of your
colleagues today. Uh please don't
hesitate to stop by the medical aid
station. The one thing I do want to
state is that it's so important that the
work you do today uh and do here this
session because as you know, healthc
care is one of the major issues that our
patients are facing on a day-to-day
basis and access to care is one of those
big challenges. So, anything you can do
to improve healthcare access would be
great for all Georgians in our uh
prosperity. Thank you.
>> Dr. I am here. This is this this is
Senator your guest here.
Are there any unanimous consents?
Does any senator wish to rise on a point
of personal privilege?
>> I know the senator from the first
was wanting to be first.
>> All right, I recognize S from the 12th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues,
I rise to defend my professional
and political integrity
and that of my seat, Senate District 12.
Senate Bill 171 was presented in the
education committee on yesterday.
And let me make this perfectly clear.
For 22 years, I have strongly advocated
for quality
education
in the state of Georgia,
for quality educators
in the state of Georgia,
and most certainly quality educational
leaders
in the state of Georgia.
And for 22 years,
we have failed our children miserably
with peacemeal educational policies and
billions of dollars.
During the discussion of SB 171,
it was inferred
falsely
of me speaking for minority students
only.
I did not say that. I did not use the
word minority student.
When constituents in district 12 have
issues,
need help or assistance,
they do not care
about party affiliations.
They don't care what color the senator
is. They don't care how many degrees one
mayo hold.
They only want to be served.
So as we legislate,
please remember as I was taught from a
child until now
to respect all individuals. And when I
made the pledge
to be a state senator, it was for
everybody in my district, regardless to
who they are and where they live.
And I respectfully request that we do
not infer
or make inferences as to what
and how we feel.
Every piece of legislation that I'm
looking at, that I'm signing on to is
for the good of District 12 and the
state of Georgia. every child, every
adult citizen.
So I would would respectfully ask that
we not categorize individuals based on
what we think and how we feel.
It's insensitive.
It's demeaning
and it's not true. Thank you colleagues
for listening. Thank you, Mr. uh
President. I yield the well.
>> Thank you, Senator.
One of the finest senators in this room
from Albany, Georgia. She's a good lady.
Okay. Um
we're going to Majority Leader is
getting ready to make a motion. We're
going to get ready to head over to the
House for the state of judic judiciary.
Uh recognize the majority leader for a
motion.
>> Mr. President, I move that the Senate
stand in recess pursuant to SR 645 for
the purpose of convening a joint session
to hear the address an address from the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and
that upon delusion disillusion
of the joint session the Senate stand
adjourned till 10:00 a.m. Thursday,
February 5th.
>> All right, Secretary, read the caption.
The rules committee will meet upon
adjourment in room 450 of the capital.
The public safety committee has been
cancelled. The agricultural and consumer
affairs committee will meet at 2 p.m. in
room 307 of clob. The finance committee
will meet at 3 p.m. in mezzanine 1. The
health and human services committee will
meet at 4 p.m. in room 450 of the
capital. Mr. President, that completes
the order.
>> All right. So, we'll uh
after this motion passes, we will line
up back there and then we'll walk over
for the stages of the state of for the
judiciary. So, uh the majority leader
has moved. All those in favor of the
motion signify by saying I.
>> Oh, wow. Y'all are lively today. Wow.
All right. All those opposed, no.
>> All right. We are journ. And let's head
over to and see our friends across the
hall.
