TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for being here on short notice. My name is Josh McQuarran.
I serve in the state Senate for North Fulton County. We're here today because the Board of
Immigration Appeals, which is an executive agency under the Trump administration, has issued an
order to deport journalist Mario Guevara today with no notice, with no explanation, except that
13 years ago, Mario Guevara had a deportation order that has been paused since then. Since then,
He has been legally in the United States doing journalism spending time with his family
and just being a citizen without a criminal record. And he was arrested on some trumped-up charges
that have since been dropped in June and was put into ice detention at that time and has remained
in ice detention awaiting his opportunity to clear his name and go back to living as a productive
and responsible citizen in the United States where he has been for decades. Today with no warning
The Board of Immigration Appeals decided that it would dredge up that 13-year-old order and send
Mr. Guevara out of the country. The Board of Immigration Appeals decided to do this,
notwithstanding that Mario Guevara has an active case in federal court where he's seeking
habeas relief. To try to prove, again, that he's entitled to stay in the United States under
the same rules and practices that he has been for decades, ignoring that that federal court
proceeding was happening, the BIA proceeded anyway, and his lawyers are currently scrambling
to figure out what the BIA ruling was even all about in terms of what its legal basis was,
or why it's happening right now. So I want to make something very clear for anybody who's
listening. This is not just a court in the traditional sense. It's not the judiciary
with Senate confirmed judges. This is an executive agency, the Board of Immigration Appeals,
with judges that are appointed by other executive officials responsible to the Trump administration,
who have made this decision. So make no mistake. This is not an isolated incident. This is not the
result of a court proceeding. This is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to silence
and chill journalists from just doing their jobs and not just journalists to silence the speech
of people in media, people of influence, who are speaking out across the country about some of
the overreaches of this administration. When Mario Guevara was arrested, he was reporting on ice
and ICE operations in the Metro Atlanta area.
And so again, this is one journalist,
and this is a journalist who is not a U.S. citizen,
but he's part of a much bigger picture.
We know that late-night hosts are Trump's latest target.
Trump has made it very obvious
that he wants to go after late-night hosts
and remove their FCC licenses if they disagree with him.
We should understand Mario Guevara's detention
and deportation and intimidation
as part of this larger picture of the Trump administration
taking actions against free speech in this country
and creating one of the most dangerous environments
for free speech that we've ever seen in American history.
I'm honored today to be joined by Richard Griffiths,
who is a representative of the Georgia First Amendment
Foundation, who himself was an immigrant journalist,
and I'm honored to have him here today to speak
about his experience in the United States as a journalist.
I came to this country in 1974.
I still have my reporter's notebooks that I still use,
were 43 years as a reporter.
I was never asked in the nine years I was here on a visa,
where are you from?
What are you doing here?
I was always welcome to do the reporting.
So this today for me is personal.
To see someone thrown out of the country
for doing their job, working as a journalist
is incredibly dispiriting and it's part of a pattern.
We have seen journalists attacked at 60 minutes.
We've seen them attacked at ABC News.
We've seen journalism attacked to the New York Times.
Today, thankfully, a judge threw out the order against the New York Times.
But it is a pattern of assault on a free and independent press in this country.
Baroness Mistake, this is just one small piece of it.
And a person who was doing his job at that rally
was stopped on pretext if you look at the video, arrested,
taken to jail, the charges never could fly and all the charges were dropped
but he was still put into detention and today we learn he's being deported.
this is an outrage. We as Americans have to think about the institutions that protect us.
Those institutions include a free and robust press and independent judiciary. In this case,
the independent judiciary was not allowed to weigh in on how this journalist would be treated,
And that is a very sad day for our country.
In conclusion, the status of the situation right now, I mean, you know, we came to the capital
here to get the message out about this at about 4 p.m. earlier this afternoon was when Mario
Guevara received the order that was issued today. His deportation could happen at any time.
So we scrambled to start getting the message out because we want the public to know
that this is happening so fast and what we've seen from the administration in other cases of
deportations under the Trump administration's new mass deportation policy is they try to hike
the ball so to speak as quickly as they can so that lawyers and judges cannot get involved. We've
seen the Trump administration move people who are detained by ICE to different federal districts
across the country so that they're out of the access of the judges and lawyers who are working
with them when they first got detained.
So we fully expect that if ICE could, they would deport Mario Guevara immediately.
And that's why there's an emergency hearing being held right now.
As we speak, it started at 4 p.m. in federal court.
The ACLU, other organizations in conjunction with the Georgia First Amendment Foundation,
the Committee to Protect Journalists, the UGA Clinic for First Amendment issues.
Those forces and other local attorneys are working together to try to get a temporary
restraining order from the federal court.
I know they're seeking that relief, again, literally as we speak, to try and stop this
deportation so that the federal court proceedings that Mr. Griffiths refer to have a chance
to play out so that he has a chance to show that these criminal charges were bogus, that
there is no legal reason to deport him, and that he belongs in the United States.
Again, this is just one man and it's just one journalist, but he represents the front line
against Trump administration's attacks on free speech across the board.
Again, this was a week when we saw the attack on late-night hosts in general and Trump
who is emboldened by that has given comments to press where he said, well, if anybody
does negative coverage of me, I guess we should just remove their FCC, excuse me, revoke
their FCC licenses.
So he's being open about his intentions, and we should understand this action by the
BIA and ICE, both executive agencies, as part and parcel of that strategy to chill speech.
We'd be happy to answer any questions.
So that's what's so perplexing to the attorneys working on this case, because the appeal that
What was in front of the BIA up until now had to do with his release on bond, right?
If you remember the press conference we held just a few weeks ago, a month into his detention,
the question was, could he be released pending further immigration proceedings to determine
whether he could stay in the country valid?
So everybody's understanding until today was that the BIA was going to rule on the bond
issue, but what ended up happening was the BIA made its own decision to reach back into
the files. I mean, you can imagine like at your workplace, you got a Manila folder file
cabinet that's 13 years old, they went back and reached and found some legal basis that
they could hang their hat on to issue an order for his immediate removal. So that's why I
raised the point that the BIA is an executive agency. This is not some independent court,
like we're talking about the federal court proceedings that we're having right now as
an independent court. The BIA is an arm of the Trump administration, with judges that
are appointed by the Trump administration. So, you know, they're dressing this up in a lot of
legal ease, but the simple reality of it is that the Trump administration wants this guy gone
just like they want anybody gone who is potentially providing critical coverage of the administration.
Well, politics still matters, and Trump is still looking at opinion polls.
I say this a lot.
If you live in a country where an authoritarian gets 70-80% approval for the stuff he wants
to do, you're in trouble.
But Donald Trump is not getting that level of approval.
He's getting 30, 40 percent at best for some of these policies that he's forcing down
the throats of Americans.
So it's really critical that we show up on days like today to speak to the public and
declare with one voice, this is not okay.
We don't want this broadside assault on free speech in this country.
Now we're here at the state level.
The Georgia First Amendment Foundation represented.
I'm a state senator, but look at JB Pritzker and Illinois.
There may be a reason why Trump doesn't send the National Guard in Illinois because the
The people of Chicago, the people, you know, in the streets of Chicago and Illinois more
broadly, but also the administration at the state level were very good at pushing back
in the public sphere, narratively, against what Trump was trying to do and Trump realized
how unpopular his decision was.
So I want everybody listening to realize, your voice matters.
If you don't like what's happening in your administration, if you think that we should
be protecting free speech and that somebody should be saying something, you are the one
to say it.
And that's why we're here today because we want the Trump administration.
We want the BIA.
We want ICE to know that Mario Guevara has the support of the public because he did
nothing wrong.
He was a lawful resident of the United States for decades.
And this is pure politics.
It is pure malice by the administration to choose this opportunity to dredge up a 13-year
order to try to get rid of him now.
This man was a legal working journalist looking at what the government did.
He was showing the public what the government was doing.
And here we have the government, apparently, taking retribution against him for doing
that work.
That should scare all of us.
So one way to resist the administration's harmful attacks on speech is to speak more.
You know, there are Supreme Court cases precedent in this country that say the remedy to bad
speech or incomplete speech is more speech.
You know, this country has a strong legacy of protecting the First Amendment and inviting
to participate in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's murder, we've had a renewed conversation
about just what it means to have an open dialogue about public debate.
And I think what we're seeing from the administration today is exactly counter to that first
amendment tradition in this country of open free debate.
We're seeing the government cracking down on individual speakers.
And so the first best act of resistance that any young person can make to this administration
doing that is to raise your voice.
We all have social media, we're all producers of content and information now if we want
to be.
Find your voice, put a video online, join with your friends, join a club, join Facebook
groups if that's all you can do for now, and make it known as loudly as possible that
we don't support what's happening and that we're not going to lie down.
He's not that powerful.
I mean, he's the president and his administrative agencies can mess with people like we're
seeing today, but he wants to be a dictator and he has said that out loud, but he doesn't
have to be one.
So enough people say, we don't like that.
Again, if the public opinion stays low enough,
then he won't be one.
But it takes all of us to make that known.
And public opinion is only shaped
when people speak up and shape it.
Anything else?
We appreciate everybody's time today.
I'll be around.
We'll book you around for a couple of minutes.
I know.
Answer more questions.
Yeah.
OK, thank you.
All right, thanks.
Appreciate it.
