Good morning, Plurton-Ranged Bell.
Good morning, the hour of convening having arrived, all members, all members will please
take their seats.
We've had the ringing of the bell, so...
Well, good morning.
We're going to have the morning row call.
All members present will please vote green
to signify their presence in the chamber.
And the clerk will unlock the machines.
They have.
have all members voted, have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines.
For keepers, please close the doors and keep them closed.
Well again, good morning.
We're going to pause just for a minute and bring you up to speed on the events of yesterday,
which was a great day as we swore in the Constitutional Office of the Governor.
And certainly then we had some tragedy in our state in this area.
As we go about our business of the day, I want to reflect this morning, I want us to
pause and reflect on severe weather that impacted our state last late yesterday afternoon
last night.
Thus far, we have four confirmed tornadoes that hit North and Middle Georgia, as I think
we all know damage was widespread.
The storm is confirmed to have claimed the lives of a five-year-old child in the
makin' area and a Walker County employee who was clearing debris. If you're
rise with me and let's make it have a moment of silence as we reflect on those
folks' reimpact and certainly those families that have suffered this loss.
Now despite this horrific news, we are thankful for all the first responders across the state,
but in this area.
We are always thankful for our first responders who have immediately went to work.
I want to commend Governor Kemp for declaring a state of emergency.
Thanks also to the men and women at Jema, the State Patrol, DOT, DNR, and all of the other
state agencies that have worked throughout the night.
Our members and impacted areas are in the districts they serve today, as they should
be.
and Governor Kemp will visit those areas later today.
I will join Governor Kemp at a press conference shortly to discuss our state's response.
Again, we pray for those impacted by the storms and will support our fellow Georgians in any
way we can.
Thank y'all and we should all keep them as I know we will in our prayers as we support them.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, at which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 73rd House District
representing Josh Bonner.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This morning is my honor to introduce Chaplain of the Day and my friend Pastor Ken Smith.
He's joined today by his son, Adam, who's in the chamber with us.
And Pastor Ken, along with his wife, Teresa, shepherd new beginning Baptist Church in
Sonnoi.
The mission statement of his church says they are committed to sharing God's love, fulfilling
the great commission and helping people understand the gospel.
And having spent some time in worship in his church, that's exactly what they do.
Pastor Ken is a good man and is a great asset to his community.
And we are so thankful that he was able to join us today, and with that, Pastor Ken.
Good morning.
Thank you, Speaker Burns, and to the members of this chamber, it's a great honor for me
to be able to join you today and speak, and also join you in condolences to the families
and friends who also love ones and the storm.
I also want to thank all the public servants that work so hard through the night to provide
help and comfort for those who are affected by the storm and they are truly our heroes
during a time like this.
Georgia is a great state to live in when you agree with that.
I heard you couldn't clap but you could say a man and it is a great state to live in.
And I believe the secret is out about Georgia.
There are many people that are coming to live in this state.
It's home to the back-to-back national champion, Georgia Bulldogs.
My grandchildren wanted to remind me when I was here to say, go dogs or go dogs.
It's also home to some of the greatest universities in the world.
Home of Chick-fil-A, Coca-Cola Delta, the birthplace of Martin Luther King, Jr., and we could
go on and on.
And obviously our leadership has done some great things in leading this state, and obviously
there's some great citizens that live in the state of Georgia, and I'm proud to be a citizen
of this state.
For my devotion, I need you to travel back with me if you would in the 1969.
I was born at Georgia Baptist Hospital in 1964.
We lived near Lakewood at the Fairgrounds, but in 1969, I went into first grade in
Jones-Bertle at a school called Lee Street Elementary School. Some of you may be familiar
with that school and know where it was. My teacher was Mrs. Ham in the first grade and
it was under direction of Mrs. Ham that I learned to read, write, I learned how to add
and subtract, I learned manners, and also learned what my favorite subject was under
Ms. Ham's leadership, and that was recess.
On the first day of school, Ms. Ham said there's three things that I'm going to teach you
this year, and three things that you're going to learn, and I'm not going to be debatable.
I'm not going to give any room on these three things, and as she was saying that, and you
have to understand, back in the later, later 60s and the early 70s, parents and the school
had a different way of looking at bringing up children and so as she was saying that there's
these three things that you will learn she was slowly reaching into the desk of her the drawer
of her desk and pulling out a paddle a wooden paddle and laying it on top of the desk and some
of you probably remember that I'm getting a few avians already Josh and and she gently laid that
on the desk in my mind as a first grader it looked like it was six foot long and I believe
that's really where my conversion started because she scared the devil out of me that morning.
She said there's three things you're going to learn about in this class and here's the
first one is she said without without any leeway you're going to learn to respect me and
to respect other people and I'm like yeah I got that I got that at home 100 time other
and I father, I could do that.
I can respect people, I understand that.
I'm good there.
And then she says, secondly, she said,
you're gonna learn how to be kind to people.
And I'm like, yeah, I got that too.
I know how to be kind.
Yeah, my brother, me and him getting a fight,
mama makes us hug each other, say we're sorry,
and treat each other with kindness, share our toys.
I can handle that.
I've got that.
And as she said, third of all, she said,
you're gonna learn civility.
And first grade, I was like civility.
Oh my God.
What is that?
I'm seeing the paddle.
There's no leeway on this.
Civility, I don't know what civility is.
In the first grade, I'm in panic mode like,
maybe I won't be civility and I'll be punished for that.
And I was, you know, really alarmed about what I should do.
And then Rebecca, as I learned later,
her name was Rebecca, raised her hand.
Thank God she did.
And she said, Mrs. Ham, what does that mean?
What does civility mean?
And Ms. Ham said, it's the golden rule.
You treat others the way that you expect them to treat you.
And I don't know if you know that,
but in the scripture in God's holy word,
and as in fallible word, God laid that out
in Matthew chapter 7 and verse 12,
that he expects us to treat others the way
that we would like to be treated.
And then Ms. Ham went farther to say this.
She said this, when you treat other people with kindness, when you're polite to other
people, when you're courteous to other people.
And they're in first grade, imagine this, they're in a first grade classroom at Lee Street
Elementary School in Jonesboro, Georgia.
I learned how to be civil to other people, civil to my classmates.
I learned how to say things like this, please.
I learned how to say thank you.
I learned how to say I'm sorry.
I learned how to say excuse me.
I learned pretty quickly how to raise my hand
and wait to be called on before I spoke.
And I even learned to say yes, ma'am, in first grade.
Is it just me or to also the members of this hall
feel like there's a lack of civility in public life now?
that there's a whole lot of name calling,
a whole lot of smearing, a whole lot of screaming,
a whole lot of finger pointing,
that people have actually lost civility
and they're ruthless in their interactions with each other.
And all of this is unnecessary.
We don't have to act like that.
We can still follow the golden rule.
And here's the thing about it
that I would like to say to you also,
is unfortunately we live in a culture
that glamorizes bad behavior,
uncivilized behavior, if you will.
Because if you're rude enough, vulgar enough,
loud enough, you can become a rock star.
And even in politics, you can be a hero for your party,
or even a leader in your party
if sometimes you display bad behavior or your uncivilized.
I have eight grandchildren and I'm proud of and boy I could take a lot of time to talk
about them but five of them live near me and I called them all together because I was
so excited about coming here and I don't know if you can know this but I'm really nervous
about being here too and I was just super excited and telling them about the opportunity
that I had to come to the state capital and speak to the representatives today and my
oldest granddaughter Susan the sixth grade she said you better be careful Paul Paul when
you go up there. And I'm like, why? She said, if you say the wrong thing, you could be
canceled. I said, canceled. What do you mean I could be canceled? She said, if you
say something, somebody doesn't like, they'll just make you disappear. Maybe some of you
We're familiar with that term.
Disappear.
I don't want to disappear.
Obviously, at this point, I hadn't said anything
y'all wanted to prove it because I hadn't disappeared yet.
But in a strange country that we live in,
where you can have an opposing point of view,
and other people just want to make you disappear
or silence you at all cost, no matter what it is.
My youngest grandson's three, and he said this to me.
He said, Paul, Paul, you go up there and say anything you want to say,
because if they make you disappear, don't you worry.
We will find you.
And I want to remind the members of this House,
the distinguished members of this House,
that this country survives, thrives,
off of healthy debate.
That where people can have opposing opinions,
see things differently.
But at that, destroy us, it makes us better.
Because God reminds us in His Word that iron sharpens iron,
that you can have two opposing points of view.
And we don't have to hate each other
or try to make each other disappear or silence the other side.
But we can learn from each other.
That that healthy debate causes us to be better people,
stronger people, sharper people.
Jesus said it like this, be you kind, tenderhearted,
forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
had forgiven us.
So how do you do that, Pastor Ken?
How do we act in a civil way?
How do we reach out and how do we embrace open debate?
How can we have opposing opinions,
being different parties yet still get along
where we have to understand what God did for us?
that we have this all-powerful, omnipotent, holy, perfect God.
And then we're all part of this fallen race.
And that Jesus Christ came into the world in hung and across.
And when he was hanging on the cross,
he became the mediator between God and man.
That he reached up to our creator
and grabbed the hand of a holy God.
And then he also reached down to Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ reached down his hand to the fallen creation.
and he reconciled the two sides, brought us together,
and that you and I have pieced through
the sacrifice of his cross.
Yes, we can live, civilize,
but only if we recognize, if God did that for me,
I can do it for others.
May we stand in prayer.
Our most kind and gracious Heavenly Father,
the creator and sustainer of the earth
And the fullness thereof, we call upon you this day
and ask that your favor may rest upon this state.
That your favor may rest upon this body of representatives
that we stand before today.
And we specifically pray for each representative.
As your word, it monises us to do as Christians.
We pray for them that you would give them wisdom and peace
and guide them with your presence.
May your face shine upon them,
and may you help them to be able to prosper in your ways.
We ask you also this day to comfort those
who have been affected by this storm.
May you give them peace during this time
and hope for the future.
Give the communities the strength of God to come together
and to be able to rebuild our communities better
stronger and greater than they were. We ask for your guidance. May your favor rest upon us this
day. Lead us not in the temptation but deliver us from evil. For Thine Lord is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever. And we ask all this in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
Do our keepers will please, excuse me, do our keepers will unlock the doors.

It's really a true honor for me to let you know that the Doctor of Day today is Dr. Brett

So first on our list is Leader Beverly.
Mr. Leader, good to hear from you this morning.
Do you have two minutes, sir?
Thank you.
That shouldn't be counted toward my time.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today, I'd rise and ask for your favorable consideration for two bills that the Georgia House Democratic
caucus is going to drop today.
It's LC520184 and LC520183.
For the past 10 years or more,
Georgia is certainly the leadership
in the Georgia House Democratic Caucus has come to you
and asked for us as a crew to expand
and extend Medicaid coverage to all working Georgians.
It is past time.
This year, we're asking you those on the Republican side
and certainly Democrats to please consider the kid
who works at Target who doesn't have health insurance,
that are families that are going to be unwind
from Medicaid this year on April 1st.
Unwinding Medicaid means this.
This year, there are multiple people in Georgia,
about 500,000 who have to requalify
for Medicaid extension benefits.
Those people may be kicked off of the roles
through no fault they're owned.
They may have moved on COVID.
There are things that are going on in their lives.
We're in a transition.
If we don't put money into a system
to educate people around the state of Georgia
that this is going to happen,
you will have 500,000 joiners right now
who are currently enrolled that will be kicked off.
So I'm asking you to favorably consider that.
The second thing is we currently receive
72% federal funding for Medicaid.
If we weren't to extend it, it goes to 90%.
The difference between that number 17, 72 and 90,
is $3 billion that we leave on the table right now.
What I would ask for your favor will consideration
that clerk has the bill,
don't let political theater get in the way of good actors
in the general assembly.
Thank y'all, Mrs. Speaker, you're the well.
Thank you, Mr. Leader.
Chair, now recognize representing Bernal
for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today is Founders Day for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Incorporated, and the members you see standing
up here and a couple more. Our members of that sorority, our sorority is based on working
for education, for health, and so today is our Founders' Day. And so thank you very
much, Mr. Speaker. And we will be having Georgia days at the State Capitol on February 22nd.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Representative Drenner for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, even though it's afternoon.
I want to say congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker and to Governor Camp.
I'd also like to say to Madam Speaker, congratulations,
in my 22 years of service.
I would never have dreamed of a woman being speaker,
and I just wanted to say it one time publicly, thank you.
I'd also like to applaud all the new members,
and welcome you to the house,
and I look forward to meeting and working with all of you.
Really, today the reason that I rise,
and let me just say, I did not speak to the preacher before.
I drafted my remarks, okay.
I rise today to take a moment out of our day to pay tribute
and wish my mother a very happy 85th birthday.
As I thought about what I would say,
first I would like for all of us to take a moment
and acknowledge that each and every member has experienced
or is experiencing the loss of someone they love.
Losing people we love is by far the most difficult experience that anyone left living can endure.
We lost Speaker Rostin last week. My cousin Susie was buried last week.
My friend and fellow West Virginian chairman Parsons lost his mom a few years ago.
And his words still resonate with me as I speak today.
He said, enjoy them while you can because when they are gone, it's too late.
Today, I'm celebrating my mother, June Laverne Watson, who was born in Boone County, West Virginia,
and was number eight in a family of 11.
She is now the oldest of her remaining siblings.
She spent 57 years of her life in public service, working for the City of Charleston, serving
in various capacities most notable as the first affirmative action director and for
the State Board of Risk.
She did have the pleasure of working for now Senator Joe Manchin, who was then the governor.
She may not agree now with some of his actions, but she will be the first to say that he
is health was Virginia.
At 77, she retired, and for multiple years,
I had the pleasure of working face-to-face with her
during the legislative session.
To have the opportunity to work with one of your parents
is a rare gift, one in which I will be forever grateful for.
She taught me so many things growing up,
to believe in God, to be truthful,
and to follow the golden rule.
Not the one that says he who has the gold makes the rules.
The other one, which is so important today,
more than ever.
The golden rule is my favorite parable for living.
Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.
The latest time has expired.
Happy birthday, mom.
Even though I won't be there, I love you.
And here's to many more.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Representative Willis
for an evening order.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
Thank you, House.
I am Representative Willis.
I stand with my sisters today before you
to acknowledge Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority
and Incorporated's forthcoming Founders Day
that will always take place on January 15th.
I first like to acknowledge our sister Greeks
and congratulate Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority Incorporated on their founders day to day.
It was a cold day in 1908
on the campus of Howard University,
where 16 college trained women
created the blueprint for Black sorority life,
the architecture, the archetype, the assembly.
I want you to think for a moment,
what type of women were assembled at Howard University
in Washington, D.C. in 1908.
And how the best and brightest of us
can create something that matters 100 years later and beyond.
Therefore, in honor of 115 years of sisterhood and service
to global communities and the edification of women and girls,
we stand together as the Alpha Kappa Alpha women
of the Georgia House, cultivating and encouraging
perpetual service to all mankind.
I'll leave you with a quote from our illustrious founder,
Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, and I hope that this may apply to our session.
To my mind, we should all be too busy for petty things.
Too big for smallness, too intelligent to not see what happens when we stoop to them.
And so we thank each and every one of you and the acknowledgement of the sisterhood that
has been created and the importance of unity.
Scripture states where two are more gathered, I am with you and we are with you in this
house.
I yield back the well. Chair recognizes representative Cameron for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. First, I'm meeting knowledge. Representative Monahan for
Notifying me of the death of one of our residents of Lafayette, Georgia, who was killed in a tragic accident yesterday
Thank you
Sean Kernack. He was a foreman with G dot
He was tragically killed doing his job
He was valued member of our community. He was originally from North, Tonto, Wanda, New York
He leaves behind a daughter and many family members and significant other and
We value G dot all of us do we work with him
We don't realize sometimes how dangerous the work they do is, and my condolences go out to Commissioner McMurray and the members of the G dot staff.
So I'd like to have a moment of silence in his letter.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dickie for an afternoon order.
I don't know a little lot of them, thank you Madam Speaker, out to that devotion this morning
on civility reminding me that I have a very important date tomorrow, I've got an anniversary
and a very important one and I just want to tell my high school sweetheart Cindy happy anniversary
for putting up with me for 45 years.
And I just appreciate her for her love and support,
and most of all, her advice.
Didn't realize after 45 years,
how little I knew sometimes.
So, but thank you, Cindy, I love you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Mitchell
for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
On your desk, I've been tasked to bring to your notice.
There's a flyer for the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Celebration of Service.
You're welcome to join us.
It will begin as soon as we get out of here this morning.
The governor and the speaker are part of the program.
And we look forward to you being there as well.
been asked to remind you the bills that the leader has mentioned are available here with
the clerk for you to sign if you are so inclined. Thank you so much Madam Speaker.
Before the House comes back to order next week we will have several birthdays that I'd
like to recognize. The first is on Wednesday, January 18th Scotty Long. We'll have in the
