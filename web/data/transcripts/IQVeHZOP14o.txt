Senators Tillery of the 19th and Walker
of the 20th offered the following
amendment to a to House Bill 557
by amending line 14 to read as follows
43-1-36.1
that completes the order Mr President
without objection I recognized senator
from the 20th speak to the measure
thank you Mr President
we've heard two recurring themes this
session
Workforce and Health Care access
and House Bill 557 attempts to address
the issues we're having in both of those
areas
I've said from this well before that
every business owner every industry I
talked to in my district complains of
Workforce shortages I'm sure you're here
you've heard that from your constituents
also
part of the uh one of the areas where
the workforce shortages are are the most
acute is in the health care Arena
the governor appointed a health care
Workforce Commission
because of the concern of this and to
try to make recommendations to address
the issue
and his one of the recommend or the
recommendation
for healthcare Workforce are focused on
strategies that maximize our existing
Workforce optimize our education system
and attract new workers
I've I've brought a bill in the past
before to
give a limited expansion of ability for
advanced practice registered nurses to
administer scheduled two narcotics
and I'm bringing it to you again today
this bill is a compromise it includes
physician assistance and aprns and it
does does several things first of all
wanted to let you know that
aprns on the AP audience Georgia and
Oklahoma
are the only states that prohibit aprms
from any sort of schedule 2 prescribing
however Oklahoma does allow crnas to
administer schedule twos
and for PA physician assistants George
and Kentucky are the only states with a
blanket prohibition
and many of our counties there is only a
physician Assistance or APRN present in
the medical facility in that county
of course they're working under the
direction of a of an MD
but they're oftentimes the only person
there
so what this bill does
under certain conditions
it allows aprns and
physician assistants provide adult
patients patients over 18 or over
with a five day a limited five-day
course
of certain schedule 2 medications which
are spelled out on the bill and it's
hydrocodone
and oxycodone or a compound of those
and it has to be in an emergency
situation
five days it's got to be an emergency
situation
only to an adult and it has to be part
of their
protocol agreement with the physician
that they work under
it also expedites the post-initial
licensure procedure for aprns and PAs at
the composite Medical Board
so aprns and are licensed by the nursing
board
but their protocol agreement with the
physician they work with has to be
approved by the composite Medical Board
once they're initially licensed in their
initial protocol agreement is approved
this bill would call for any any changes
like let's say that physician retires
and they go to work under another
physician
as long as the the protocol agreement is
reasonably similar
when they send in their application to
work with a new physician it would be
deemed approved
and it's the same same streamline for
the physician assist assistance
and then the third thing that the the
bill does is it allows aprns and
physician assistance to
provide a
parking permit for people with
disabilities
uh now we have
so that's kind of the original part of
house bill 557.
you'll see on your desk
now three amendments
I agree with Amendment one it's a
friendly Amendment but I think I'll let
the senator the chair chairman of our
finance committee explain
this amendment that's that's his
Amendment but I'm supportive of it
Amendment two I was asked to consider
adding language
from a bill that didn't make it across
and I'm agreeable with that and what
amendment two would do is you know we've
of course been through a pandemic and
we've asked a lot of our medical
providers and they've been under a heavy
heavy workload and a lot of stress
amendment 2 would provide or allow for
these medical providers to seek mental
health counseling
without jeopardizing their license
so they they could be confidentially
seek counseling for stress mental health
depression those kind of things
that's what amendment 2 does and then
Amendment 2A thankfully my smart seat
mate our esteemed Appropriations chair
realize that
we had a little I guess you'd call it a
scrivener's era
and that is correcting that's if if he
had not caught that basically Amendment
one and Amendment two would kind of
offset each other and
that would be that's not what we were
trying to do so be happy to try to
answer any questions if there are any
but I'll also be happy to yield the well
no questions awesome thank you all
please vote green
all right
good job
sir I recognize the senator from the
52nd speaks Amendment one
thank you Mr President I don't think
I've offered an amendment for a couple
of years so I rarely often a member but
when I do
it's for a reason
um there is a
let's say a hospital closed in
a city like Atlanta
I know that doesn't happen too often but
let's say they closed they give 30 days
notice and we're going to shut down and
another hospital we're going to close
down
and then they say
to the employees there
that we they have under contract well
we've got to know compete with you
so you can't go to work for Piedmont or
Grady or Emory or north side
because we've got a nonca people wait a
minute my place is completely closed
well we got places in other parts of the
state but you can't live where you live
and go to work at these places even
though we're shutting the place down
um I also learned that there's no
non-competes for lawyers in the state of
Georgia because I guess they write the
laws so that they have that taken care
of so I've
I want an amendment to address that type
of situation there's other situations
where somebody comes in and buys a group
out and says
we're cutting your pay in half
well I don't want to work there anymore
then I'm going to go work somewhere else
oh no you've got a non-compete
you have to stay here
there are situations where oh but they
would let you take care of the
non-compete for four million dollars and
you'd get out of it that way
situation where somebody comes in and
says
we've uh we're going to cut your pay but
also
we've got facilities in Georgia outside
of Georgia and we reserve the right to
move you
to one of those other facilities
at whatever pay we determine
I mean that doesn't even sound like
America to me
so I don't know how we got in this
situation
had a conversation with Piedmont
Hospital
last week and never worked for Piedmont
Hospital but I guess they got a lot of
respect for them because they told me
we don't have a single non-compete
we don't believe in non-competes We
Believe
if we take care of our doctors and
nurses they'll want to stay with us and
so we're opposed to non-competes
now I'm not trying to eliminate all
non-competes I think we maybe should but
in this particular Bill I'm saying you
close a place down
you can't hold them to working there
you come in and take over and you change
their pay
significantly and you can't say
you know no you can't go to work
anywhere else We've Got You Under This
slavery it sounds like to me
so that's what these amendments do they
address some things that really are
quite shocking to me of what happened
out of this
there's no questions our Guild will
you got no questions
recognize the senator from the 49th
what purpose you rise I ask for
unanimous consent to excuse the senator

Bill 196 a bill to be entitled an act to
amend chapter 2 of Title II of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to the Department of
Agriculture so as to provide for the
study of the regulation of the
production distribution and use of
medical cannabis that completes the
order Mr President
that objection and recognized senator
from the 46th speaks of the measure
thank you Mr President Senators it's my
pleasure to be with you this afternoon
to present the committee substitute to
house bill 196.
it seems to have become somewhat of an
annual tradition here in the legislature
as we review the medical marijuana laws
this is a journey that we started five
or six years ago heck maybe longer than
that one of you may recall Allen Peak
had this legislation none of us had even
heard of medical marijuana and we began
to be educated and we passed bills to
allow people to possess it then we
realized they couldn't couldn't get it
here from out of state so we ultimately
came up with the system
the medical cannabis commission that
would license producers to manufacture
and produce and sell medical cabinets
cannabis products for all the many
different ailments that have been
identified that can be helped by this
you know in many ways we have failed in
this endeavor because here we are I was
talking to the rules chairman this
morning it was four or six years ago
when we first we can't even agree when
on on that simple fact when we started
this when we we passed the bill
and it took years and years and years
for the commission to get organized to
get its rules and regulations together
to take applications to grade those and
then award licenses
not issue them but award them
and in the meantime all of these
children with seizures and all the
people with other conditions that
there's pretty strong evidence that
medical marijuana products can help have
been sitting there waiting
and all the time the frustration has
boiled within this body and within our
citizenry as to when are we finally
going to do something about this
well finally the the licenses were
awarded
and the next thing you knew there were
many disgruntled unhappy applicants for
licenses that were rejected
that filed legal challenges
the two class one licenses which are the
largest producers had their challenges
dismissed and they have been in the
process of manufacturing these low THC
oil products and CBD products and other
marijuana-based products
to get them to the shelves
the four class four licenses that were
awarded are still tied up in court from
nine different uh protesters we'll call
them applicants that did not receive
licenses that have filed a variety of
lawsuits
some of those claims are in the court of
appeals as we speak and we expect an
opinion will be issued later this spring
probably out of we're out of session and
maybe it resolves it you know maybe they
dismiss those appeals and the four class
two licensees are awarded their licenses
and will help ramp up the production
maybe they'll they win those protests
because they have a lot of
very strong arguments that they were
unhappy with the process
it was not transparent
didn't follow the open procedures open
records acts of our state or the
administrative procedures Act
we're not totally forthcoming even when
the house regulated Industries committee
asked to get to the bottom of it last
year was just told sorry that's
confidential we can't give you that
information which just fed the paranoia
of the licensed applicants that didn't
get there their licenses at least tell
them why what was their score what were
they fairly scored how did they compare
to the other applicants that were
awarded licenses
and it's been extraordinarily
frustrating in response the house passed
this bill
the bottom line of this bill it cleans
up a lot of the procedures
but it attempted to Grant licenses to
the nine protesters
so that we would go from having two
class ones and four class twos to a
total of at least 16 licenses 15
licenses get my math straight on that
Senate regulated Industries committee
sympathize with the plight but feel like
that approach does nothing but reward
the protesters that spent the money to
hire attorneys and litigate the issue
and it ignored the valid complaints of
the other 60 some odd applicants that
lost maybe justly maybe unjustly but
they didn't hire attorneys and appeal it
so this does not Grant any new producer
licenses
but we're going to address the
underlying problems with the commission
not going in specific order in the bill
but what it will do is require the
commission
to follow the administrative procedures
act going forward
it will require them to follow the open
records laws like all other government
agencies are required to do
with exceptions for the privacy laws
that in certain circumstances data and
information would not be revealed
would not give new licenses at this time
for producers
but it would Grant new dispensary
licenses
to the producers that have been awarded
licenses if they have a dispensary at
their production facility they will be
able to dispense the products
and we'll also be able to dispense the
products of the other licensees so you
wouldn't have to just sell your product
you could sell all your different
competitors products as well many of
these products are directed at specific
medical problems and so that makes sense
to get access to our citizens
on the bright side I'm told by the
commission that by mid-april just a
couple of weeks from now these other
dispensary licenses will be issued
and we're told by the two class one
license holders who are in the process
of manufacturing the product that it
will be on the shelves by the first of
June or early June of this year so
there's relief insight for those
patients that have been waiting
patiently or impatiently for the last
four or five years to see product be
available to them
we have also taken into account the
concerns of some of the unsuccessful
applicants and people that have pushed
for many years that maybe we need more
licenses the more the merrier you know
there's a balancing act of some type
here and I have always cautioned for
restraint let's make sure what we know
what we're doing let's get it going and
then let's leave that open in the future
if we need to increase the number of
licenses that we grant for production
and manufacture of these products
right now there are 26 000 Georgians
that are on the patient registry they
are qualified to receive these
medications once they hit the shelves
there have been a lot of estimates that
that number will greatly increase over
the years as this becomes more available
prescribed More Often by physicians and
and found to be more helpful to people
with these conditions
a couple of years ago when we looked at
this issue the estimates were that that
list will probably go to 75 or 85 000
People based on the population of
Georgia and based on the percentage of
people in other states that end up being
on their patient registries
you're not always comparing Apples to
Apples or oranges to oranges because of
different populations different laws
different conditions that are covered
but it would not be surprising for there
to be several hundred thousand Georgians
on these patient registry list
in the future
so this bill builds in the potential for
future licenses once our patient
registry hits 250 000 patients
and then every 50 000 increase going
forward from there there could be
additional licenses issued
the other thing that's been frustrated
for many of us is how this has gotten
bogged down in court
I'm a lawyer
and I don't understand all the appeals I
am not sure even I understand what the
legal arguments are on a lot of these
lawsuits
they're complex they're complicated
and they are filed in different courts
and so we may have a situation with
different results based on your Venue
Where You Are
a brilliant part of this
legislation was to send all appeals in
the future to the Statewide business
Court
which will be able to develop a
specialization in that area and give
rapid accurate just outcomes to these
appeals if there are any future appeals
in the future
our good friend former Senator Bill
Hamrick is now the chief judge in that
Statewide business court so those those
matters will be in good hands going
forward if they're further legal
disputes which unfortunately in this
Society
they're going to be legal disputes
now how are we going to keep this clean
in the future and make it more efficient
other than just the administrative
procedures act and open records
we have decided and this is in the very
first section of the law
to allow the Department of Agriculture
to do a thorough comprehensive review of
the issues and problems that we're
dealing with with medical marijuana in
its production its distribution and its
use
and to come back and give
recommendations to the governor
lieutenant governor and the speaker by
December 1st of this year
tell us a plan going forward is this
commission working does he have
suggestions or ways to improve it would
the Department of Agriculture like to
regulate this going forward in the
future
there is some interest there
and many of you are aware that the
Department of Agriculture currently
regulates and licenses the growing of
hemp
now hemp is just a different strain of
the Cannabis sativa plant marijuana and
hemp are brothers or sisters they're the
same strangest really differing mostly
by the THC content in the plant
so there's a certain symmetry there a
certain
history ability expertise in the
department of agricultural to take a
good look at it and report back to us it
is my expectation
that by the end of the year this
litigation should be resolved
may not but I I hope and expect that it
is
and that we don't have to worry about
that but let's say the appeals succeed
and we toss out these licenses and have
to start again this will give us to be
fully advised knowledgeable informed on
the subject matter to decide which way
to go next session
I would urge all of you to
support this compromise I know there are
a lot of people that are not happy that
didn't get their way or all of their way
in some of this but I think it
comprehensively addresses it in a way
that we can be proud of and we can get
it right going forward Mr President with
that unless there are any questions I
would yield the well you do have a
question Senator Senator from 32nd
thank you well Senator Yale I yield
thank you um I'm just trying to get
clarity on the numbers in other words
there's 26 000 people on the registry
that have cards
do you have any information about how
many licenses it actually takes to
provide enough THC oil for those
patients yes we we had a number of
hearings in regulated Industries on this
issue not just this year but in past as
this bill has come through there
traditionally
put it this way the two class one
license holders that have already been
issued
and are already in the process of
producing the THC oil in the and the
products each claim they can provide
enough product to treat 300 000 patients
and that's two of them so that's six
hundred thousand in each of the class
two licenses will be able to do about
half as much again so we believe once
these all six licensees get actively
producing that it's well enough for over
a million patients
but it's it's interesting to have that
competition because by having six
producers they can specialize in
different types of conditions that they
may be developing products for and it
also generates price competition between
them so what what we would want to
happen going forward is if if it's
demonstrated that these license holders
are not able to keep up with the demand
and adequately Supply then new licenses
could be expended extended in the future
thank you Senator would you further
yield for one more be glad to yield um
I missed
but
the sorry misspoke the THC commission
cameras commission whatever we're
calling it is it currently
administratively attached to the
Secretary of State's office and you're
looking to move it to the Department of
Agriculture no no it's separate it's
independent
so we're not looking at moving it
anywhere we're just deciding whether or
not go keep it uh
open for business going future or to
shut it down and reconstitute a division
on the Department of Agriculture to take
over those duties thank you thank you
uh recognize senator from the 30th for
question
thank you Mr President Senator yield I
yield just one quick question uh these
dispensaries can we charge sales tax on
their product
I think you can but I don't know
I'm sorry I don't know if that's deemed
a medical product maybe one of the
doctors could could answer that better
than I can what classification is THC on
the federal level it's a schedule one
drug thank you
you have no further questions so thank
you Mr President I yield the will break
it down a senator from the 28 speak to
the measure
thank you Mr President uh I rise today
to speak in favor of HP 196.
um the senator from the 46th and I have
been
on opposite ends of this issue really
since my time here but
um there is a few things in this bill
that he's captured that I'm in full
support of and just wanted to touch on
those with you guys number one and
probably one of the most important
things we're doing in this bill is going
and putting in a trigger for the
licenses meaning the tying those number
of licenses to the number of patients on
the registry that is something back five
years ago when we did the study
committee which I co-chaired with then
representative Michael Gravely we
actually made that recommendation coming
out of the study committee and it did
not make it into into the final version
and so coming back and doing this now we
we may not totally agree on you know
where that trigger should be but at
least it's there and so that part of
this bill is very important because as
one of those steps that helps take a
little bit of the politics out of this
and get it into really into a common
sense bracket which doesn't always
common sense and government don't always
go together so when we can mesh the two
I think that's important
number two having a dispensary at the
production facility is very important
because if you remember when we issued
the production license is the way the
way it was drafted was we were pushing
them into rural Georgia so when we talk
about access for Rural patients it's
important that they'd be able to have a
dispensary in these rural areas because
um sure just
uh
supply and demand most of your
dispensaries are going to want to
attract to your more metropolitan areas
so that's a very important piece and
then number three I've also support the
business Court
this process that we're in right now
is really has hindered the fact that
we're in the courts we should have had
medicine on the shelves a year ago and
we could have been had it not been for
the court cases so if we can kick this
into a business court and get it done a
lot quicker again we're going to be able
to get patient get that medicine in
these patients hands much faster so
again while I don't think this is
perfect it is certainly a step in the
right direction and urge your favorable
consideration thank you

the official code of Georgia annotated

Commission generally selling and other
Trade Practices and motor fuel attacks
that completes the order Mr President
majority leaders speak to the motion
thank you Mr President senators
SB 146 is a bill we've already passed
out of the Senate it's gone over to the
house we made some small changes to the
language a mirror companion bill has
already passed the Senate regulated
Industries committee and is on the table
for your consideration today or
Wednesday I'll go over the changes
quickly that were made to the bill and
then I'll ask for questions as you
recall the bill the underlying Bill
deals with three sections one is it
allows for the sale of electricity for
electric vehicles to be sold by kilowatt
hours and not time
the second portion of the bill deals
with the permitting the inspections and
the regulations that are applied to the
EV industry and it will be authorized to
be enforced by the Department of
Agriculture through the leadership of
the AG commissioner and section three of
the bill deals with the taxes that
pertain to the replacement of the Lost
motor fuel tax by the fact that these
cars are propelled by electricity and
not motor fuel
specific changes that were made by the
house are on line 76 where we made a
modification to the definition of
digital Network which is just a slight
altercation that was suggested
by the Legislative Council the intent
should remain the same as the previous
version line 88 the definition of
residence was altered somewhat given
more time to look at this exemption
legislative Council recommended the
change it ensures that the power source
is on the same piece of property as a
vehicle that is being charged it also
worked on definitions dealing with
multi-family if you have the charging
stations at a an apartment complex for
people who would be living there as
permanent tenants people who live there
for 30 days or longer
lines 248 as that an electric vehicle
charging station inspector who is
directly or indirectly interested in the
manufacturer or the vending of an EV
charging station shall be disqualified
from providing the inspector Services
until their interest no longer exist
it's basically a conflict of interest
clause for anyone working for the
Department of Agriculture lines 318 of
the bill strikes the sunset on the
Consumer Price Index inflation measure
for motor fuel tax
line 341 consolidates the gallonage
equivalence ceiling to 11 kilowatt hours
per hour that is a maximum rate that
they could charge as a conversion from
11 kilowatts compared to the gallon of
gasoline
lines 342 includes the hydrogen gallon
gallonage equivalent floor that was in
representative Jasper's Bill and House
Bill 406 it just mirrors that language
and the last change that was made by the
house is on line 437 which eliminates
the CPI index inflation measure for the
annual fee on electric hydrogen and
propane fueled Vehicles Mr President
I'll plan I'm happy to take any
questions or I'll yield and ask for your
favorable consideration for SB 146.
we're going to have senator from the
19th
thank you Mr President Senator eugiel
yes sir Senator first I want to thank
you for your work on this I know you
spent a lot of time working on electric
vehicles generally I didn't see the
Electric Vehicle Commission in this bill
is it in here the electric vehicle the
commission that we passed around no
that's a separate bill it was not
included in this bill ever since we are
now in a position back and forth between
the house and the Senate would you
consider it a friendly Amendment if for
an amendment to add the EV commission to
this map I'm assuming that bill is still
alive and well in the in the house going
back and forth so I would prefer to keep
it separate if possible okay thank you
considering the time that we have to to
make that Amendment thank you thank you
recognize the center from the 37th
I think Mr President just gentleman you
I do I appreciate your work on this as
well this is an important subject matter
for us I was a little confused on line
341 yes
um
it was my belief that the the
electricity equivalent of 11 kilowatt
hours
would be framed as not less than 11
kilowatt hours
because what that does that would have
the effect of capping the tax rate
if it's not more than 11 kilowatt hours
that'll have the effect to allow the tax
rate on consumers to rise that that may
be something that was missing this
process I know we spoke about that yeah
so the 11 kilowatts would be the
denominator in the equation in the
conversion so you take the the gas tax
on a gallon of gasoline let's say it's
30 cents to equate that to the kilowatt
hour you would divide the 30 cents by
the 11. so by changing that from 9 to 11
it actually lowers the tax rate for the
electric car because the denominator
gets larger and not smaller it was my
understanding of the agreement was
um it it's just gentleman further yield
yes sir I do it was my understanding
that the 11 kilowatt hours was going to
be the minimum to the gentleman's point
if it was raised from 11 to 12 or 13 or
14 that would have the effect of
moderating and bringing down the tax
rate on consumers and not more than 11
cents would allow the tax rate to rise
on consumers and I think I I was just
asking is that intended and with a
gentleman consider a friendly amendment
to address I think it I think the intent
is to do what it says and that is to
allow for that rate to be raised from 9
to 11 not to be a floor not to be a
ceiling but to be a floor But as time
goes on and inflation Rises the dollar
value of a dollar will continue to
decrease so if the gasoline tax goes up
to 35 cents per gallon then that rate
would also go up with the electric car
so it would create parity what we're
trying to do is to make sure that the
people driving a gasoline-powered car is
is paying the same rate as person that
is driving an electric car and vice
versa so as to allow for those two get
tax rates to be basically parallel to
one another
thank you
you have no question Senator thank you
very much I appreciate your favorable
consideration
recognize the senator from the six speak
to the measure
colleagues I
rise briefly to appreciate the majority
leader for for the work on this bill and
to also highlight something that was
brought up by the senator from the 37th
but also others related to the bill
which is that there's still work to be
done I appreciate the fact that this
bill doesn't go into an effect until
2025 but I do think that there are some
things that we need to think about
related to
um
EV drivers and the fact that at this
point we have one of the highest
registration fees in the country and
this tax as currently written would be
the highest tax on EV drivers in the
country which
you know if if the intent is to Target
out-of-state drivers uh driving through
Georgia makes perfect sense but it would
also uh impact uh residents who live
here and who are helping to make uh
Georgia the EV capital of the country uh
these very workers would be driving EV
vehicles and paying the highest taxes in
the country which doesn't seem to make
sense in addition to that the bill does
require Employers in Georgia to retrofit
their Chargers
to to meet the requirements of this law
which would not only cost the employers
money but would
affect an employee benefit that many
employers use which is to allow
employees to charge while they're at
work this bill would actually prohibit
that which is concerning and something I
think that that in in uh
if if we are truly concerned about uh
about consumers and particularly about
these out-of-state drivers then we want
to make sure that in-state employees
that are working for Georgia companies
aren't impacted by this uh in fact the
Georgia Chamber letter uh talked about
how this bill targets consumers uh but
the but the indirect or the direct
Fallout from some of these Provisions is
that it will also impact Georgia
employees which I know we all don't want
and I've had this brief conversation
with the majority leader and we've
certainly agreed that there is work to
be done particularly in the future on
this bill so I just wanted to highlight
the fact that there's still work to be
done
and while I appreciate the effort that
has been done here let's continue to
work on making sure that Georgia is the
electric vehicle capital of the world
I yield the well
does any other Senator wish to speak for

order Mr President
recognize senator from the 40 seat
thank you Mr President senators
you know I have a speech we all do that
I give to chambers of commerces and
Civic clubs that I say one of the things
that is so gratifying and stimulating
about this job is it's like going to
several different seminars a week
so today I've already talked about
domestic terrorism on our critical
infrastructure we've talked about
medical marijuana and now we're back in
the world of law in the Civil Practice
Act how do we handle depositions of
high-ranking government officials or
corporate officials
you may remember this bill was before us
previously
Senate Bill 200 it was amended on the
floor to the point where it was fairly
well obliterated of having any
meaningful impact and it was ultimately
placed on the table where it died of
peaceful death there before crossover
day
this bill
is a bill from the center center from
the 19th bill that's in the back
starting at part two
and that dealt with
false advertising for Legal Services
basically I will not speak to that piece
of the bill I voted for it in the Senate
I'm fine with it as it came back from
the house unless the senator from the
19th has problems if they made any
changes to that part
my problem is they put on this in the
first few pages part one basically Pages
two
and three and a little bit on the top of
page four what was originally house bill
530.
and house bill 530 was assigned to the
Senate regulated Industries committee
where we vetted it
we looked at it and even though it was
completely more supportive of the
plaintiff's bar than the original SB 200
was to protect businesses
to keep our state the number one place
to do business in the country
this one was not nearly as favorable to
business but was favorable to the
plaintiff's bar
as we vetted it we changed two words in
this bill
just two words from the house version
and I'll tell you what those were
and now they have taken their original
Bill to avoid that
minor tweak and put it on another Senate
Bill thinking they could slide it by us
in the agree disagree process
thank goodness
that we had a little time over the
weekend to look at our rules calendar
remember we met in mid-session on
Thursday and so I had time to know what
was coming today
to catch this being tucked onto a
completely unrelated bill
so let's review again the issue in case
you don't remember from the last time we
handled this back in ancient history
feels like it doesn't it crossover day
what this bill was in response to
attempts by plaintiff's lawyers to take
depositions questing them under oath of
corporate presidents or high-ranking
government officials which some of us in
this room have been deposed in
connection with some recent litigation
and realized sometimes you're being
asked questions that you don't know
anything about
just because you're a member of this
organization or you're a high government
official or you're a high corporate
official doesn't mean you know half you
have any personal knowledge of the
issues involved in the lawsuit
many states have something they refer to
as the Apex Doctrine think about the
Christmas tree the Apex is the top when
you're taking depositions from people at
the top
they don't necessarily have information
or knowledge about the issues that are
in dispute like the design of an
automobile which was this General Motors
case that sort of generated this
discussion in the state of Georgia
recently
or whatever type of manufacturing
organization you may if you're the
president of a pharmaceutical
organization you don't know who did the
clinical trials and exactly how they
turned out you've got scientists and
chemists and other clinical Specialists
that are finding that information out
for you
well these states that have an apex
Doctrine some of them have them by
Statute
and SB 200 that failed here on crossover
day was based on Florida's statute
Florida's a very business friendly State
and I think they're thriving because of
that they got no income tax they have a
very uh ambitious governor who has just
passed an enormous tort reform package
there
to grade acclaim
and they have an apex Doctrine and
statute that protects their corporations
from being harassed by depositions
having to set aside their schedule to
answer questions and be embarrassed and
try to be leveraged into settlements
other states don't have it in a code
but the courts have created the doctrine
through their judicial opinions and we
refer to that as the common law versus
statutory law
Georgia has neither up until today
and this is an attempt to codify an Apex
Doctrine to perfect protect High
government officials High corporate
officials from being harassed in
depositions on subject matters that they
have no personal information about
now
I have an amendment here that that
essentially
reinserts the Senate regulated
Industries substitute putting those two
words or basically taking them back out
of the house version
and those two words are unique
and complex
the basis of this Apex Doctrine is if
the person being deposed being
questioned does not have personal unique
knowledge about the subject matter in
the lawsuit
that they can claim I'm not the right
person for you to depose and ask for the
court to give them a protective order
under the house version in addition to
them having to have that unique personal
knowledge
the corporate official or the government
official has to show that they have a
unique schedule
and that they are working for a large
and complex organization
all we did in the Senate side was say
you shouldn't have to have a unique
calendar
if you've got uh
stressful steady problematic calendar
that ought to be enough it doesn't have
to be unique like you're the only
corporate president in America that has
this type of schedule
and it doesn't have to be a complex
organization you're working for if it's
a large corporation or a large business
and you have a busy schedule and you
don't have unique knowledge of the
information you shouldn't have to be
submitted to a deposition and so you
would still have the obligation the
burden of going to court and say asking
for a protective order please protect me
don't make me have to go to this
deposition and explain your burden of
proof why that you don't have personal
knowledge about it unique knowledge
about the subject matter and that you
have a busy hectic type schedule even
though it might not be a unique schedule
I had this amendment that puts those
words back basically takes those words
back out only in the scheduling part
and it also makes it clear that this new
law that's aimed at corporate officials
and high government officials does not
undermine the existing Georgia law
which allows you to seek a protective
order if something is annoying harassing
unduly burdensome in a series of other
things I wanted to make sure that by
creating protections for high corporate
officials we didn't raise the bar for
everybody else also to be protected from
abusive Discovery techniques
I hope that explains it I really
I mean sometimes I just just want to
pull my hair out how
us attorneys will Dibble and argue and
fuss and fight over a couple of words
our rules chairman was in the regulated
Industries committee and made I wish I'd
written it down maybe we could have had
the puppet lady do it he said something
like really is that all they're arguing
about this is obvious you know you can't
make somebody have to prove they have a
unique schedule to be able to get the
benefits and be protected from this
harassment I'll point out you will have
on your desk the letter of support from
the Georgia Chamber of Commerce this is
an important issue to them this is a
scorecard issue for them
and all all the other business
organizations in the state are to the
point
where they're getting afraid to do
business here because the deck seems so
stacked against them this site selection
magazine that says we're the best place
to to do business it doesn't take into
account the legal environment
or the judicial system it looks at the
Economic Development support the tax
benefits the workforce
let's don't let our state get to the
point where business are fearful to do
business here because they're subjected
to unnecessary litigation unfair
litigation tactics
let's let them know how important
business is to us and trial lawyers Can
You Stand Down on two words complex and
unique it doesn't undermine your
abilities but it keeps you from making
the bill meaningless by making it so
hard to utilize that it doesn't help any
Corporation
Mr President I'm happy to take any
questions there may be you do have a
couple questions Senator Senator from
the 17th
as Senator yield I yield
Senator if you'll look at your Amendment
online three of your Amendment
yes well you're adding the word large I
have two questions on this first you're
adding the word large after any
but looking at line 51 of the bill
there's actually two innies there
correct
yes
so is your Amendment not in order when
it comes to what it's saying is it's
putting it in both places
okay so if we read it as you're saying
that then it'll say organization
includes any large governmental entity
and any large other large organization
yeah I think it should say any other
large organization public or private if
you remember doesn't say that right
I'd have to check the Legislative
Council that's the intent let me see
well the other issue is you said you
know it says
after any and after other
correct but if you put large after both
anys which doesn't say that but it
doesn't say which any you're not putting
it after both Denny's you're putting it
after the first Indian after the second
other
well the further yield yes the problem
is remember doesn't say that your
Amendment says you're going to put the
word large after any and he's written in
two places
so you remember so you're not correct or
it can read it as it's written and the
sentence will then say organization
includes any large governmental entity
any other large other large organization
correct that's the way it should read
I think that's the way it
and that's what you want to put in code
I'm sure the code folks will straighten
it and make it brighter that's the way I
read it I can see how you could could
see here we go do you want to try to do
another amendment if there's an
amendment a I'd be receptive to it you
think you can clarify that
you asking me yeah do you think you can
clarify that with Amendment 1A if not
I'm happy to do that while we're well
I'm not going to write your Amendment
for you Senator rather to go back to the
bill that's passed by the house
see what I can do
recognize senator from 36.
thank you Mr President does the senator
I yield
is it accurate to say it seems to me
common sense to say isn't true that most
anybody getting sued and getting deposed
is not crazy about that process and
rather not do it in most cases most of
the time most of the time
and and it's hard to understand why the
people at the Pinnacle in their
corporations
uh shouldn't be willing to stand for a
deposition the reason is they don't want
to be asked about things they don't have
any personal knowledge about and it's
unreasonable to expect that a corporate
president is going to have finite Duty
information about the duties of every
person in a ten thousand member
organization that's why this only
applies to large organizations and only
if you don't have unique personal
knowledge about it that's what's
unreasonable is to question people that
you know don't know the answers and
aren't expected to know the answers to
these detailed questions about perhaps
the design of a product or the uh
compounds in a in a pharmaceutical
product
but isn't it true that we've often
learned upon uh with say some of these
large cases say with the tobacco
industry
uh as the depositions and as the the
legal case moves forward and you get a
person in a high place on a corporation
on record in a deposition uh you can
learn things that you would not be privy
to otherwise for example that uh that
yes we hired a firm to spread uh
thoughts uh uh information and and uh
use a rigged survey and a rig you know
bogus science and that's how we came up
with this allegation that that tobacco
doesn't harm your health that's just an
example of a very large corporation
facing a lawsuit so it just would seem
to me that this could provide blanket
coverage for accountability at the
highest levels of a corporation if you
cannot get to them with a a cursory
review and maybe due to the limited
comments I gave I could see where you
would think that but this bill
anticipates that and down in lines
54-57
the burden shifts back if I were to say
I don't want you to oppose me
and you were then able to show the court
I have exhausted all other means of
Discovery and it's been inadequate to
give me these answers I need and say
that person that's trying to get
protection does have unique knowledge of
one or more matters related to the
subject matter then you can get the
deposition so that's all you got to do
if it turns out that there is something
unique that that person knows and that
you can't find it out any other way you
explain that to the judge and then
you're allowed to go forward with the
deposition and it even gives the judge
the ability to restrict the questions to
those areas and to balance the interest
of both parties and that's all we're
trying to do here let's don't be unduly
burdensome on a corporation if they
don't if the person doesn't have the
knowledge and it's easy for the
plaintiff to find that information from
asking the people that do if they can
show the court I can't figure this out
any other method I can find out and by
golly I got proof that that person does
have some knowledge about it then the
judge is going to allow the deposition
to go forward but isn't it true that
what you just described is like getting
through the eye of a needle no yeah
what you just that process you describe
it creates a barrier to accessing that
top person in the corporation and you
don't necessarily know as the plaintiff
that's seeking that information the
plaintiff's attorneys
you've created a barrier to their
getting access to what information that
could be vital just it just seems to me
highly protective uh and tilted kind of
tilts the playing fields maybe so and
you know
we're down to I think we got eight
lawyers in this room
and out of us very few actually litigate
cases
and it wouldn't be obvious to you but to
those of us that are in that jungle
fighting for a living all the time we
recognize there are other methods that
you can use
and one of those the attorneys will know
is called a 30 B6 notice of a deposition
where you can ask the corporation
here's what I want to know about who
designed this product who did the safety
testing on it you know who made the
decision whether or not to make the
recall you can ask to depose the person
that has the knowledge that you want to
know and you can make them designate you
a corporate official that can answer
those questions so you don't necessarily
start with the person at the Top If You
know the information you need there are
other Provisions in the Civil Practice
Act that allow you to ask for the person
that the corporation has to tell you I'm
not going to give you a guy that's going
to Stonewall you I'm going to give you
the guy that knows what you want to know
that's how you get around this and if
you don't accept that and you think well
you know what I think this President
might have some particular knowledge
about it then you ask to take their
deposition and if they come back and go
to court and hire lawyers and take the
effort to say we want a protective order
under this law that we're trying to pass
today they have to swear they have to
show I don't have unique knowledge about
these issues in the lawsuit and this is
unduly burden some on me because I've
got a hectic schedule and I'm working in
a very large corporation can't be
expected to know this and what the house
wants to do is to make you say in
addition to that you have to show that
you've got some type of unique schedule
that nobody else in America's Got and
that you're in a very complex
organization it doesn't protect the
other folks which it's but it seems to
me isn't it true that that this is an
unlevel playing field when you put when
you take that when you take that unique
uh the language out of the current law
and that's that's the concern that that
many would have about people in high
places being being protected by this
language that you're attempted to
imagine I know and I'm sure you've been
lobbied on that and that's why I'm glad
you're able to be open-minded and listen
to me explain how it really works
because Georgia has been designated as
the number one judicial hell hole in
America
if your corporation these rules that
you're talking about a Level Playing
Field are not level they are tilted
against the defendant against big
corporations and you know what when they
say judicial hellhole they don't mean we
got judges that are horrible
it's the legal laws that these judges
are enforcing that make it the hell hole
and that's what we're trying to
straighten out is balance this playing
field up so we're not harassing
corporations that we're then asking to
come here and hire our citizens and give
us jobs final question if you will yield
isn't it true that if we are reportedly
for nine or ten years now the greatest
state in the in the country to do
business in that if if we did in fact
have a Judicial hell hole we wouldn't be
drawing all these corporations to come
here invest and build plants and hire
people as they are doing today isn't
that true the reason for that is because
site selection magazine that gives those
ratings will tell you the judicial
environment is not even a factor that's
measured in deciding and we ought to be
grateful to God that it's not because we
wouldn't be number one in the country
we'd be far down the list and we
wouldn't be nearly as appealing to these
businesses by by our other Economic
Development incentives our tax
incentives that we do our Workforce that
we use our transportation system that
makes it appealing they don't even put
in that calculus what our judicial
system is like and what these civil
practice laws that we've passed and
these laws of evidence we passed and
these different tort laws that we pass
how they impact that system and these
nuclear verdicts that we keep seeing
these gigantic verdicts that people look
at them and say how can that be fair for
CVS to be held liable for somebody
getting shot in their parking lot not
even in their store doing business why
would a CVS open up in a place like
Buckhead that's unsafe I don't know they
got about 1200 sites I think in Georgia
so you watch them close I can tell you
the the
store about just a very few blocks from
my house shut down for that reason
I think I've had enough taken enough of
your time Senator and I appreciate the
dialogue thank you
you have no more questions Senator thank
you you're the well
secretary read the amendment
Senator Hatcher from the 50th offered
the following amendment number 1A by
amending Amendment one to add this bill
shall become effective when signed by
the governor uh Mr President I can
switch the order
recognize senator from the 50s to speak
to the amendment
thank you Mr President this amendment is
just to make sure that that portion of
the bill does have an effective date so
thank you I yield the well
right
recognize the senator from the 19th
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President
um
a lot of stuff has been said so I hope I
can help you Wade through it and provide
a simple course that just gets you to
the end of this bill for today
Senate Bill 74 began as a lawyer
advertising bill heard the senator from
the 646th who's my good friend say a lot
of things that I think are true
he said some things that talked about
where we stand currently with our
judicial system
and I think attorney advertising has
gotten to a point where the puffery the
stuff you're allowed to say like I'm the
best Senator or you're the best Senator
this protected speech by the U.S
Constitution has led to falsity
it's not true when the guys stand on top
of trucks and say you know they're the
strong arm what does that even mean
and that falsity has now led to a belief
in our legal system that's been has
perverted the way that I think folks
think about our legal system
that's all Senate Bill 74 was meant to
address was attorney advertising and
simply say if you're going to advertise
about something as important as our
Judicial System we think you ought to
tell the truth
and if you don't tell the truth you can
be sued for it and you can't just be
sued for it you can be sued in a class
action for it we think that protecting
the Integrity of the legal system is
that important
when it went over to the house it did
get a few amendments one we didn't make
it very clear if the penalty the 500
penalty was per advertisement or it was
per the number of people who saw it and
that's kind of confusing because if
you're if it's a billboard that says
this and you go down I-75 is it 500
times the 2 million people that passed
it that day or is it 500 per the
billboard and the house fixed that and I
appreciate that
they also added on what you've heard the
senator from the 46th referred to as the
Apex Doctrine why is it called the Apex
Doctrine because the Apex is the
Pinnacle right the top
and it's a an agreement that I think
defense and plaintiff's attorneys agreed
on that said hey
it really isn't fair to drag the top
person of a company in the CEO for Coke
and ask him why the can exploded in
McRae Georgia
not know that answer
but what the Apex Doctrine as it came
over from the house said was hey
if that CEO wants to be protected he can
then say I have no specific knowledge
about the Coke can in McRae Georgia I
don't know what the temperature was in
McRae Georgia that day have no idea
about the aluminum they got from
wherever they did to make it
and therefore I should have a protective
order that protects me from having to
talk about that Coke can
the burden then goes over to the
plaintiff the person who said Mr CEO you
should know something about that coke
can in McRae and the plaintiff has to
show two things on lines 58
um sorry 60 and 61 and 62.
that they have no other way of knowing
what happened to that coke can that day
what the temperature was of the aluminum
used
and that that person who they want to
depose has specific unique knowledge of
getting it
the version the house passed protects
the Apex of Corporations from having to
show up if they don't know anything
the senator from the 46th said the
reason we want this amendment is because
people don't want to be drug into court
to be CEOs don't want to be drugged into
court to be asked about things they
don't have no knowledge about well
they're protected from that already in
this bill look at line 64. you see first
of all if they bring that order and the
party can't show that they have specific
knowledge anyway they're protected then
there's a catch-all afterwards that says
to the extent that the party seeking the
protective order shows that an officer
lacks unit unique personal knowledge of
some but fewer than all relevant matters
then the court May limit the scope of
the deposition accordingly there's
already a second fallback scope measure
in this bill
we were told that this was what was
added on was the sentence language but
that would be Senate Bill 200 it never
passed this body it didn't make it out
of the conversations in other rooms
we were told that this building that we
have a Judicial hell hole and then the
senator one of the other Senators
brought up that were number one for
doing business and I do disagree with
the senator from the 46th that if all
these things were included we'd be way
down the list I think the governor and
this body and the body across the hall
have done an amazing job of champion
Georgia and I do not subscribe to the
notion that we're anything except number
one for recruiting business
there was a mention of nuclear verdicts
well why would we not pass this as it is
to protect those CEOs to protecting
those situations
and last but certainly not least
the reason why I would ask you to oppose
this amendment is the exact same reason
that I didn't put an amendment on the
last bill of the senator from the 51st
I asked him should I put an amendment on
about EVS the EV study committee that we
cared a lot about and he said no I think
that's moving somewhere else
but the other part of that is this if we
put an amendment on right here what
happens
it has to go back across the hall and
get voted on again
we're now in the last 36 hours of
session and we have a chance to reject
this amendment and pass this bill that
does substantially what the senator from
the 46th is asking and it's done we know
it's over and it doesn't go back from
the across the hall for ties up in games
that just fell on day 40 for waiting for
another year
so how do we get there well that's where
I need your help
there's an emotion to agree as amended
if you open up your Senate Rule Book
You'll see in special orders that a
motion to agree is amended takes
precedence over a motion to agree that's
why even though this is my bill and I
move to agree the senator from the 46th
amendment to agree is amended he got to
speak first
so for my motion to agree to finish this
issue and cap cap it off and be done to
have a chance we have to vote down the
motion to agree as amended and that's
what I'm going to ask you to do and then
I'm going to ask the president if I can
make a motion to agree immediately
thereafter and then ask you to agree to
the bill the house version the house
substitute to the Senate Bill 74 and
then we will be done you will have
passed the Apex Doctrine and there will
be a tort Reform Bill that makes it
through both Chambers this year that's
what I ask you for I hope you'll follow
me on Mr President I'll yield for
questions
you have no questions Senator thank you
so much I yield the well and I guess ask
again that you vote down the amendment
and that you wait on me then to make a
motion to agree soon
ER from the eighth would you what
purpose do you rise the senator yielded
I was just going to ask him if he could
draw a diagram for me to keep up with
all the heavens like he just said
I can shorten it he said his stuff's
good and the other stuff's bad
[Laughter]
Indian that's just what he this is what
he said
senator from the six you'd like to speak
senator from the 18th
okay posture we're in right now is
the amendment which is in order
is on the is this a senator from the
50th on his Amendment 1A
is their objection to Amendment and then
we will ask the
of course Okay so
1A senator from the 46 objects to
Amendment 1A
and Senator you can go ahead and close
debate now if you like with your
objection
thank you Mr President
well I may have seen it all now
I've got the governor's floor leader
trying to kill this bill to protect
business in Georgia
and the governor
High government officials because the
senator
from the 50th knows full well that our
rules only allow you to amend an
amendment once and by adding this silly
Amendment only changing the effective
date of this bill he prevents me from
fixing the glitch that our Judiciary
chairman showed if it's even a potential
glitch
so yes I am against 1A
the effect of that would be that now a
governor could only ask for a protective
order if somebody's harassing him in a
six or eight hour deposition on some
subject matter he knows nothing about
unless he can show that he has a unique
schedule now what the heck does that
mean something different from every
other governor in the country
something what is unique is one of a
kind right
he's making our governor and all of our
department heads have to go show that
they have a schedule that nobody else
has
or else they're not even eligible to
bring this motion
not only do they not have knowledge but
they can't even ask for protection
unless they can show that they have a
unique schedule and they are the head of
a large and complex organization
think about that at any level of
government and in any levels of business
you are this is only available to the
high ranking officers which we have
defined as people that have these
extensive schedules that are unique
and hard for them to find the time
to be sitting down giving a deposition
a high-ranking officer
according to this house version
means somebody that has unique and
extensive scheduling demands or
responsibilities
so how do you prove that to the judge
I don't know if he's bringing this in
his capacity as the governor it's floor
leader or as a private plaintiff's
attorney
but this amendment 1A gets the bill
because it tries to keep and that's what
everybody here is trying to do
they're trying to make it that gum near
impossible for a government official
including a lot of us in this room or a
high corporate official to get
protection from the court
I ask you to reject this let's pass the
the bill with these tiny changes
they're getting 95 percent of what they
wanted across the hall every other
word's left fine
except these two works of who it applies
to they're they're essentially making an
exception that swallows the hole where
nobody can take advantage of this unless
they can approve the court that there's
something about their schedule that
isn't just extensive but it's Unique
it's a one-of-a-kind thing and it
doesn't tell who it's Unique as to other
human beings other corporate officers
other government officials other people
at your same position
it is built to kill the protections that
the bill was intended to do stick with
our business community on this
Chamber of Commerce and all the the
businesses that support this and want to
be able to continue doing business in
Georgia vote against amendment 1A
vote for Amendment 1B that fixes the
potential glitch I'm not sure it even is
the the order of where you put large
after other or after any
and support amend this agree as amended
by Amendment one thank you I yield the
will
all right we have a late arriving
Amendment or Amendment 1B
Amendment 1B secretary read the caption
Kaiser the 46 offers the following
Amendment 1B amend Amendment one to the
house committee on Judiciary substitute
to SB 74 by replacing line three with
the following by adding large after
includes any and after any other online
51.
yeah
um
all right so now we're in the posture uh
we're going to take up Amendment 1A
authored by the senator from the 50th uh
and there is objection from 1A senator
for the 46 objected to 1A uh all those
in favor of 1A will vote yay all those
opposed nay secretary unlock the machine
I'll recognize the senator from the 46.
Senator uh I mean Mr President this
amendment does not identify
what bill it is what it's amending 1A it
doesn't identify it by
the Senate bill it doesn't identify it
by the
LC number this is a defective Amendment
1A
Senator the vote has already started
on the passage of the amendment the yeas
are 34 and the Nays are 20. and this
amendment has passed for we centered
from the 46 what purpose you rise motion
reconsider on the grounds that it's an
inappropriate Amendment it doesn't uh
State exactly what we're amending there
doesn't identify it clearly
and for general purposes to reconsider
that vote
all right Senators asked for a motion to
reconsider his objection
object from the center for the 19th all
those in favor of motion to reconsider
will vote yay all those opposed nay
secretary unlock the machine
all in the motion to reconsider the
years are 15 the 40 the Nays are 40 and
the motion to reconsider has failed
all right so now we're on the senator
from the 46 base motion of agreeing to
amend
all those in favor of the Senator's
position from the 46 will vote yay all
those opposed nay secretary will unlock
the machine
senator from the 14th what purpose do
you write Mr President uh parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry isn't that
true that this is the most that any
human beings have ever discussed the
Apex Doctrine
I think the senator knows what he speaks
on the original motion by the senator
from 46 the yeas are 11 and the Nays are
45 and that motion has failed now we go
to the the author of the bill senator
from the 19th to uh now his motion will
be in order so Senator thank you Mr
President I move that the Senate agree
to the house substitute to SB 74. all
right Senators move that he agrees as a
substitute from the house substitute uh
is their objection
there is objection would you like to
speak to the bill senator
thank you for sticking with me this far
I just ask you vote green one more time
thank you a lot
recognize the senator from 31st you like
to speak
foreign
I know everybody's having fun with this
bill in this room but at the end of the
day this bill does not help Georgia and
we could talk about the economy what's
going on I'm sure and somebody in here
will chastise me about citing the State
of Florida you know in terms of them
doing real tort reform and I'm sure
there's going to be trial orders coming
from Florida Crossing that southern line
down there the senator from the 13th
District coming over here filing more
lawsuits so we we can do what we want at
the end of the day but this is
ridiculous vote red thank you Mr
President
Senators yield of the whale senator from
17th you still only speak senator from
the 18th you'd like to speak
thank you Mr President
um
so why are we here
why are we what are we talking about
what is the issue what are we trying to
fix what is the problem
well we've gotten down this path and
we've talked about all these procedural
issues and stay with me on this one and
let's do it on that one and what's going
on over the house and we've lost sight
of what this bill
is fundamentally about and what we ought
to be trying to fix
okay
and it's simply this
that there are times that lawyers
inappropriately use the rules of civil
procedure
to make
people that are at the head of an
organization be it a CEO or a governor
or someone in charge of a governmental
entity
sit for a deposition when they don't
know anything about the fundamentals of
the issues in the lawsuit
now why would they do that
what would a lawyer do that
well follow me with just a little bit of
math here there's 365 days in a year
so what do we work maybe about 300 days
a year
and if you're a Apex person if you're a
CEO of a large corporation
take one of the Big Mac automobile
manufacturers
how many lawsuits do you think they have
about
their product liability
and go on down the line
a whole lot more than 300
. so what's one of the things you could
do to put pressure on a company
to put pressure on the company
to settle with you at rates that aren't
reflective of what the case is really
about you've just harassed and haranged
them enough they're gonna pay more
than what the case ought to pay
or what the justice system would
otherwise provide
how many suits do you think pick any one
of the automobile manufacturers do they
have pending at any one time
several hundred couple of thousand
so it doesn't take much math to see that
crafty council could actually tie up the
presidents of companies every day
working day of the year just for the
purpose of having to sit for in federal
court you can have to sit up seven hours
for a deposition
that's what we're trying to prohibit why
because folks that is fundamental and
I'm going to use a non-lawyer word that
just ain't Fair
it's not fair to make folks sit for
those depositions when they don't know
anything about it I'm not going to get
into the yan yan back and forth about
the wording of this or the procedure of
this I think we lost sight of what the
bill is trying to do what is the Apex
Doctrine trying to establish what is it
trying to protect
and it is just a recalibration in making
sure that when lawyers use the federal
rules of civil procedure or the Georgia
rules of civil procedure to take a
deposition
that the person you're deposing
has information about the matter that
you've sued on yeah there's a lot of
legal words and we can peel that back
but that's fundamentally what this is
about
and if not
those people in those positions ought
not to have to sit for a seven hour
deposition
that's taking them away from their real
job
and lawyers that do plaintiff's work and
I do plaintiff's work sometimes
ought not to have to be able or ought
not to be able to compel them to sit for
a deposition just because I know if I
can harass him enough or her enough
maybe they're just going to decide to
pay money
that's fundamentally what this is about
and unfortunately I think what we're
left with was 74.
as it came over
and as a senator from the 31st spoke to
the bill that you've got to vote on 74
doesn't help the fundamental inequity
and unfairness of what I just described
and that's what the center from the 46
has tried to do
and I don't have any reason to believe
anybody wants to waste any more time on
this but if you if you do Wonder go back
and look at the regulated Industries
discussion that was had with the house
member that came over and presented this
were the words unique and whatever the
other words were were debated for about
30 minutes it got nonsensical
so who's really trying to be fair here
and come up with a common sense
yardstick by which we judge when people
that are in charge of organizations
ought to have to sit
and I think that the bill that was
worked on did unfortunately this one
does not
and that's what I don't want us to lose
sight of because that's why we're here
that's the problem we're trying to fix
and this one doesn't do that
I'm happy to answer any questions Mr
President otherwise I'll deal the well
one question Senator uh senator from the
17th
as Senator yield sure I'll be happy to
Senator sir you opposed to passing
Senate Bill 74 as passed in the house
as I understand the bill 74 which this
was not my bill and I didn't spend the
time probably not as much as you did Mr
chairman
but as I understand I think the author I
think the center from the 46 and the
center from the 31st spoke to why this
bill doesn't accomplish what's needed to
have a functioning balanced Apex
Doctrine under Georgia law would you
further yield sure wouldn't you agree
that the language in this bill is
something that we know their support for
on the earth side of this building and
that the language that was presented a
minute ago is obviously not supported by
this body at this time and does not have
support across the other side of the
building as well the problem Senator is
that just because we know that they're
going to support something on the other
side if it doesn't in fact address the
problem if it isn't a fair approach to a
solution that's no reason to vote on
something in this chamber just because
we know that they'll pass it do you
further yield sure so it's your position
that the language we have in front of us
with this bill even though it has
everything that you're just speaking of
with the exception of the two words
unique and and you would rather not
support this and have nothing at all
Senator that's a mischaracterization
this does not have everything in it that
I would want to have in a bill but this
is not my bill I'm not the sponsor of
this and so I can't speak to the details
of that but I will tell you that I don't
think this bill as presented for us to
vote on in totality does what an apex
policy Doctrine ought to have in it
do you further you sure wouldn't it be
better to pass a compromise bill that I
think no one really loves but at least
puts the Apec docs Vape Peck stocks in
our code versus passing nothing at all
except for this the problem and the
concern is that this bill actually can
take us backwards because if it creates
a paradigm where this is your only
recourse
and you don't have the other recourses
that are normally available in the Civil
Practice Act no
and that's the difference
thank you Mr President I yield the well
okay Senators yielded the well
would you like to speak senator
parliamentary choir
State your inquiry
is it not true I was gonna well I was
going to ask the senator from the 18th
at the end of the day is it not true
that this is all about politics and
making a bill look like maybe something
that's totally not such just putting
lipstick on a pick so somebody can get a
political win out in the hallway
Senator is passionate about what he
speaks
Senator would you like to close
thank you Mr President
I know it's kind of gotten silly at this
point but I I don't think this Topic's
silly
we heard a couple of things just now
about having to sit in federal court for
depositions well the Civil Practice Act
doesn't apply to Federal Court
doesn't matter
what this bill actually says
is that if you are a high-ranking
official in a government entity
or any other public or private
organization
you can say and try to show good calls
for why you shouldn't be deposed
by saying you lack unique personal
knowledge
on the subject matter involved in the
pending action
after that happens
I said the plaintiff's attorney but I
guess it could work both ways
the plaintiff's attorney though then
gets to say no I've gone every other
place I can to find this information and
you're the only one that has it
and you actually are the one that has it
now I can depose you
how is that not sensible
this is the middle ground I'd ask you to
vote Green close this issue completely
it does not have to go back across the
hall and we can debate the next issue
thank you Mr President I yield the book
Senator has yielded
senator from 46 would you like to speak
no I had a question but he yielded
the senator has closed the debate
question is on the SB 74 the senator for
the 19th has moved that we agreed to the
house substitute
we've had lots of debate on this already
so I think it's time to vote on the
underlying issue
those who are in favor of the senator
from the 19's position without yay and
those who opposed nay secretary unlock
the machine
all in the motion the Azar 44 and the
Nays are 12 and this motion has
prevailed
foreign
moving on to
recognize the senator from the 20th
thank you Mr President I asked for
unanimous consent to remove Senate Bill
106 from the table Senators asked that

the motion
thank you Mr President
earlier in the session I came down here
and talked we talked about our ranking
in this nation as far as maternal and
infant mortality
and our lack of OB gyns and many of our
counties
and we wanted to try to address that
with some inexpensive remote monitoring
such as a non-stress test
uh you all supported that measure
virtually unanimously it might have been
unanimous I can't remember but strong
support for that the bill crossed over
and in the meantime I had an opportunity
to continue working with the Department
of Community Health
and they asked me to change some of the
language it would still accomplish
exactly what Our intention was and then
I was also met with the Department of
Public Health and they wanted to partner
with us on this bill to do some home
visits in rural communities with
pregnant mothers and they would be able
to then train the mothers on how to use
the this equipment and how to access the
Telehealth so it was good timing they
were already looking into doing that so
we're going to have a real good effort
to Pilot this program and see if we
can't get improved results with some
Telehealth telemedicine opportunities to
help our mothers and have Healthy Babies

there are any Mr President you have no

has made a few changes to make it a
little more narrowly tailored towards
law enforcement on uh when we're talking
specifically about the websites and
that's all it does so this bill is

section relative to risk assessment
classification as sexually dangerous
predator and electronic monitoring that
completes the order Mr President
recognize senator from the 56 speak to
the bill
I'm assuming there's no objection to
taking it off the table hearing none
senator from 56 you got the well
thank you Mr President
I have served in this Senate chamber for
quite some time now
less than some of you but
more than most of you
and in only a few occasions can I tell
you that we're going to do something
that's so meaningful
and so powerful
to honor someone their memory and their
legacy
as well as the great work that has been
done by their family
House Bill 188
is known as mariam's law
and its legislation ensure that
Georgians are protected from our most
dangerous sexual predators
the need for this legislation originates
from the 2019 Supreme Court decision
Park first state that ruled that
unconstitutional for sheriffs to
continue monitoring dangerous dangerous
sexual predators after they completed
their probation sentences
following this decision this body
studied the issue with a senate study
committee on protection from sexual
predators
and many of you made recommendations
that came a part of this very bill
since that time
both myself representative Sainz and so
many others
got connected with the family
who has a deep personal interest in this
policy change and why it was made into
Miriam's law
you see in 2021
Miriam
a 27 year old woman was kidnapped from
her doorsteps after returning home from
work right here in Atlanta
and was murdered
the murderer who is currently awaiting
trial for her death
had multiple prior sexual felonies
including
attempted rape of a minor
I want to take a moment to recognize
Miriam's Brother Ali
and her best friend Irene and all their
friends and supporters that are right up
here in our Galley Gallery today
you have done amazing work
through advocacy and honoring her memory
without question Miriam is looking down
from heaven right now smiling at both of
you
I want to thank our lieutenant governor
and his staff for assisting us with this
bill
and helping make it a priority for our
Senate and our house
through the accuracy work that Miriam's
case
the family learned about the Gap in
state policy and they specifically went
out to solve the problem
this individual should have been known
should have been leveled and monitored
as a sexually
dangerous predator
as determined by the sexual offender
registration review board also known as
sorb
however that risk assessment
never occurred due to sorb's large
backlog and funding constraints
I want to thank
sorb
as they have been instrumental in
helping us craft this language in
support of the bill along with the
sheriff's Association other law
enforcement groups and the prosecuting
attorneys Council let me give you the
bill as highlights Bill changes the name
of the sexual offender registry
soarb to the sexual offender risk review
board this bill provides updates to 13
sexual felony offenses rape child
mistake molestation and sexual battery
just to name a few this bill provides an
individual who is conceived
or convicted of two of these felony
offenses will serve life in prison or a
split sentence to serve the remainder of
time on probation and monitored by the
state actively
the bill grants an offender after 10
years on probation the ability to go
back before a judge for additional
judicial review
and the bill has Provisions later to
sorb allowing them to monitor these
dangerous sexual predators and offenders
who have had at least two felony
convictions
and will be monitored by the Department
of Community Supervision until their
official leveling process is completed
this bill grants an appeal process for
individuals who can't show their
leveling is not accurate
and therefore you have a four amendment
that makes it abundantly clear what that
process is today
the four Amendment simply gives that
appeal process for those dangerous
sexual predators codified into this bill
my fellow senators
to the family to the friends to
everybody who has been involved in this
I'm going to ask you to light this board
up green today
let's lock arms
let's honor The Life and Legacy of
Miriam let's make sure this never
happens again
and Godspeed to her in heaven I yield
the well
thank you Senator breaking down the
senator from the 14th speaks of the
measure
thank you Mr President
um I rise in support of the bill
I want to give my condolences to the
family and uh to honor the work that
they've done to try to make sure that
that story never happens again
uh I want to be candid with you all I
have voted against previous versions of
this bill that were more expensive for
the last few years in the house and
actually became a campaign issue you can
imagine in one of my campaigns because
it's difficult to inject conscience in
discussions about the criminal justice
system
I want to thank the chairman and the
sponsor of the bill for adding the
appeal language I think that creates a
fair result with respect to being able
to challenge classification but just
like I did previously today and I'll be
brief because I know we got dinner to
get to but I just want to drop a flag in
the sand because to be very clear about
the way that this bill works
the issue is ankle monitoring
the issue is there's a few hundred
Georgians who are convicted of previous
sexual offenses that law enforcement and
the governing authorities want to be
able to put ankle monitors on and the
Supreme Court of Georgia said the reason
you can't put the ankle monitors on past
a sentence is because that's
unconstitutional it's a fourth amendment
issue to put an ankle Miner on somebody
for longer than their their you know
valid sentence
I have concerns always about using the
criminal justice system and increase
penalties as a administrative work
around to try to solve what is
effectively an administrative monitoring
problem and I I think we should just
pause and recognize that this should be
a green board today but
the thing that we are doing is we are
making mandatory life sentences for
people who are convicted twice of these
offenses and one of the offenses is
statutory rate 21 year old and let's say
a 15 year old bad idea really bad don't
do it but if it happens twice the judges
don't even have discretion it's a
mandatory life sentence on that second
offense so you know My Philosophy with
how we do work in here is if you're
going to make a choice own your choice
I'm voting green today because I think
at the end of the day we need some kind
of a fix but I'm not going to miss the
opportunity to drop a flag in the sand
and just say we got to be careful when
we use sentence exposure as a way to
solve what are effectively
administrative monitoring problems and
so with great respect for the sponsor
for the family I think that we can
support a measure in memory of somebody
special but also maintain that
conscience about future bills that come
up and how we use a criminal justice
system with recognition great gravity
and seriousness and understanding that
these circumstances are very unique in
this system these are repeat offenders
uh that that I think you know I
understand why the sponsors brought the
bill so I just wanted to add that note
of conscience uh and and we'll see you
all in a little bit for dinner but
thanks Mr President
thank you Senator Senators yielded well
senator from the 34th would you like to
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President members of the
Senate I Rise

already said and I had met the family

story and I was waiting to see if in
fact you were going to carry it but I
would told him that I would be honored
to carry it and I am so glad that we
have this one before us today so we can
do what's right for this young lady

to provide an exception to a ceiling on

definitions to provide for authorization
of tax and applicability that completes
the order Mr President
recognized as the senator from the 23rd
speaks to the measure now
thank you Mr President colleagues I
bring you the Senate substitute to House
Bill 230
House Bill 230 is a c sploss measure a
Consolidated Government spouse plus it
is focused on Augusta Richmond County it
would authorize a referendum by the
voters to determine whether or not
citizens should assess themselves a half
penny sploss tax to fund the
construction of a new Coliseum and Arena
the framework for this c-splash mirror
is the framework for splost and other
Consolidated governments and it applies
specifically only to Richmond County
the arena is a regional facility
where the only way to gain Regional
support is through a squash measure 40
percent of all funds would become from
outside of Richmond County
many of those funds would come from
neighboring South Carolina
the project will be financed through
revenue bonds conservative estimates
suggest that the bonds can be issued for
construction and approximately repaid in
less than 20 years
the cap on the project is 250 million
dollars for construction and the bill
will sunset once the project is fully
funded this legislation is supported by
the Augusta Richmond County Chamber the
Augusta Richmond County Commission and
the Augusta Coliseum Authority ladies
and gentlemen I ask your favorable
consideration for house bill Senate
substitute to House Bill 230 I'll be
happy to yield for questions or yield
the well Mr President
you uh you don't have any questions
Senator thank you Mr President you'll
well
hold on senator
recognize senator from the 22nd that's
you senator
no sir no
recognize senator from 22nd to speak to
the measure
thank you Mr President I'll be brief
um if you remember a couple of weeks ago
we talked about not we had had a process
and myself and senator from 23rd kind of
disagreed on something that was going to
go to the voters well this isn't that
case this went through that process all
persons in Augusta basically are on
board with this particular project we
all had give and take we all talked
about it and we're 100 in favor of this
measure so we ask for your favorable
support and with that I yield well
recognize center from 56 speak to the
measure
thank you Mr President I have great
admiration respect for uh my two
colleagues here uh it's in the 23rd and
22nd my concern is not the great work
they're trying to promote for their area
of the state my concern is for the
Integrity of the splash system and I
along with many of us have worked
diligently on that over the last many
years
this opens the door to the very thing we
were afraid of what happened with this
blast
we have a mechanism to do things today
city of Atlanta has most of the folks
coming from the outside in
and they use Hotel Mel till taxes as
well as their existing tax base and they
bond things out in order to build them
Alpharetta Georgia which are
representative for 12 years does the
exact same thing in fact they balloon
from 60 000 people during the day to two
to three times that when businesses come
to town my concern here is we are
opening the door and next year we'll
have a 158 new requests of everybody
else who will find something in their
community that more sales tax will have
be that can certainly be beneficial but
if our goal as Republicans is to have
the sales tax hopefully be used to lower
the income tax
then that would be a much better place
to do that in this state there is only
one area that has a tax that is higher
than everywhere else and you're right
here in Atlanta it's at 8.9 percent and
there's only one reason for that because
of a federal lawsuit that we had to fix
the sewer systems and put a separate
special one percent sales tax on
so they would be at 7.9 percent
Augusta Richmond will be at eight and
now eight and a half percent the highest
in the State minus the one that is
trying to overcome a federal lawsuit
this will be to what end at one time I
would caution us that we have resisted
every work unspossed over the years to
keep it true to what it was designed to
do we have East Los we have t Spas we
have hosts we have most we have lost now
we have a cease boss
what's next so again I very much admire
and appreciate and if I was Senator from
the 23rd 22nd I would be advocating do
everything in the world I could for my
home county and my home area but we have
to be careful I yieldable thank you

Walker of the 20th district chairman

it is a rejection to moving it off the

hearing none I recognize senator from
the 20th
thank you Mr President
every couple of years we customarily
update our workers comp statute there's
a workers comp advisory Council that
involves
includes members of Industry
insurance companies attorneys and
lay people and they get together and and
make recommendations on what we need to
do to update our system the primary
thing we have to do is keep our our
weekly benefit for total disability and
for partial disability in line with the
Consumer Price Index and essentially
that's what this is doing
this bill will increase the maximum
allowable weekly benefit for an injured
employee who suffers a temporary total
disability from the current amount of
725 dollars to eight hundred dollars and
that's the maximum weekly benefit
doesn't mean everybody would qualify for
that but that's the maximum and then it
raises the benefit for a temporary
partial disability from 483 dollars a
week to 533 dollars a week
and further it uh
the maximum total compensation payable
to a surviving spouse as a sole
dependent after the death of an employee
will be increased from 290 thousand
dollars to three hundred and twenty
thousand dollars
uh again it's a customary update to our
workers comp statute I'd be happy to
answer any questions

the Senators move that we remove House
Bill 529 from the table secretary read
the caption House Bill 529 a bill to be
entitled an act to amend titles 33 and
40 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to insurance and
motor vehicles and traffic respectively
so as to provide for minimum amounts of
uninsured and underinsured motorist
coverage to be maintained by
Transportation Network companies and
taxi service companies
the committee of the Senate on
Transportation recommends that this bill
do pass respectfully submitted senator
dolezal of the 27th district chairman
that completes the order Mr President
is their objection to the motion from
senator from the 20th hearing none I
recognize Sarah from the 20th to speak
to the bill
thank you Mr President
um
back I don't know how many years ago but
when
Transportation Network companies came
into being
thank Uber and Lyft but their
transportation Network companies
it was a new new technology A New
Concept
so there was some concern
about making sure the the Riders were
protected and we required them to carry
one million dollars in uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage
not liabilities for something that
ubered the Uber driver or Lyft driver
did but liability for a third party that
were to hit the the car or cause cause
some sort of injury to the passenger not
Uber or Lyft
this has proved to be quite costly for
these companies and of course they have
to pass that cost on to the ridership
and they tell me that Georgia is one of
the most expensive states in the country
Ford Transportation Network companies
because of this and they've asked for
some relief to put it in perspective our
taxi cabs and our limousines are only
required to carry 25
000 injury per person 50 000 per
accident of
um coverage and that that's in line with
what our minimum State liability limits
are so it's not an unreasonable ask and
but instead of going all the way to the
state minimum the compromise that was
agreed to was to have a
um limits of three hundred thousand
dollars
and that's that's what this bill does
let me see if I can find it in the bill
all right so in line 24
it strikes 1 million and it says with
minimum limits of 300 000 for bottle
injury to her death of all persons in
any one accident with a maximum of a
hundred thousand dollars for bodily
injuries to or death of one person and
25
000 for property damage
if you have any questions about that or
how that coverage would work I'd be
happy to answer them well we could talk
about work matricious relationships you
do have a question Senator it's uh
senator from the 46.
I don't know that this body wants to go
there really but
I'll be happy to yield for a question
you do have questions senator from the
46. thank you Mr President Senator yield
yes sir so are you reducing the
liability coverages that Uber is
required to provide in case their
drivers hurt somebody
no sir we're just reducing the uninsured
motorist coverage so it would not
eliminate or reduce the liability that
caused by their driver or by Uber it
would be from a third party
what does the current law require a
million dollars in uninsured motorists
also yes sir okay thank you senator
yeah no further questions Senator all
right I'd ask for your favor well
actually there's a late coming question
if you got time for one more Senator but
you're always welcome to yield the well
senator from 22nd

it is it's just my question is isn't it
accurate that actually these reductions
have been done Nationwide and it's
something that has been agreed upon and
has been going on from different states

motorist coverage I'm sure the center
knows what she speaks

that completes the order Mr President
Senators Jackson of the 41st and others
offered the following Amendment one to
amend the house committee substitute to
Senate Bill 62 by striking lines one
through ninety that completes the order
Mr President
I recognize the senator from the 41st to
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President I Rise to ask
that you all would support my motion to
amend let me give you a reminder we had
this bill in the Senate and we worked on
perfecting it together by making some
amendments in the first place so this
bill has to do with homelessness and how
we legislate how counties and
municipalities deal with the issue of
homelessness we had a long and robust
conversation in this body already where
we came to a place where lawyers
educated us about the term writ of
mandamus y'all remember that I still
don't know what it means but it's not a
good word because we got rid of that
word we also got rid of a whole lot of
other things until what we had left
together as a body was for all federal
funds and all dollars related to
homelessness for them to be audited
that's where we landed
in this body with sb62 and so I'm simply
asking that we go back to that same
place where we take time to have a full
audit of how these monies are used and
that we also make sure that we get rid
of this writ of mandamus where any
person can come and Sue and we have to
pay their fees as they sue so again this
is fundamentally about returning to the
work that we did as a body by calling
for an audit and not introducing
additional burdens on our cities and our
counties as it relates to homelessness
I will take questions if they're you
have no questions senator
I recognize the senator from the 14th to
speak to the measure
thank you Mr President massive shocker I
support the amendment and I think
the thing you know the theme we keep
talking about with criminal legal system
is tightening the screws turning up the
heat in order to solve problems this is
related this is a similar type of
measure in the sense that it turns the
screws on local governments to try to
solve a problem that is so layered
multifaceted and complex that this type
of hammer just doesn't do what we would
like for it to do I mean you know I Echo
uh the center from the 41st and
commending you know the the intentions
and the purpose of a bill like this
which is try to attack a really
difficult problem but I mean I'm you
know right now I'm going to more
forcefully call for pause than I did on
the last bill before dinner for a lot of
reasons but I mean one of them is you
know what are local governments going to
do in a situation like this obviously it
has to be a written policy and so they
would have to have a written policy of
uh you know prohibiting enforcement of
an order and that you know may be rare
but local governments oftentimes do lack
the political will to take firm action
on issues like this because of how
divisive they are and by forcing their
hand we don't make the problem any
easier solved so I you know I'm starting
to repeat myself but I guess the the
real issue I've got is you know some of
these policy debates are not amenable to
bite-sized discussions like these on an
individual bill with individual uh
considerations in language this really
is a a discussion that's much broader
that has to do with investment in
communities on all the different policy
fronts we talk about health care
education Etc and I know we're impatient
I know that we don't think that those
interventions work quickly enough and we
would like for them to work faster but
when they don't work fast enough for us
we can't turn to knee-jerk solutions
that again Force local governments to to
you know move move deck chairs around
and not be able to really address the
problem so I apologize if I sound kind
of frustrated I think it's just you know
with the late hour and moving on
something like this uh I I think it
feels good to say we're doing something
but I don't think this is going to do
what we want it to do so I would
respectfully ask that you vote Yes to
the amendment and know on the underlying
Bill if the amendment doesn't pass I
would yield for questions Mr President
you do have a question Senator uh
senator from 30th
thank you Mr President with a senator
yield for Just Two simple questions I
would Senator when you say Paul's are
you talking about the polls like we did
last year in the session where we did a
study committee over the summer to come
up with the legislation that you see
before you well I think the center is
well aware that I wasn't here and so I'm
talking about the body Senator right
absolutely so what what I mean by that
is obviously I don't have direct
experience with the actions that the
Senate may have taken uh but uh but no
when I say pause I mean longer than a
year and longer than a study committee
because again these types of issues are
so intractable and they're so widespread
I mean a lot of ways you can think of
homelessness or many of the other ills
that we have as symptoms of underlying
conditions right we have an apathy
towards our neighbors right we we have
an unwillingness to live in proximity to
our neighbors not just people who
experience homelessness but you know
maybe people who live in a different
type of housing than we're used to right
I mean we hear the phrase NIMBY a lot
and so I think you know when I say pause
what I mean by that rhetorically is
before we rush to you know Implement
policy that's just going to turn the
screws turn up the heat on governments
that don't have easy solutions to this
let's take a step back and really think
about how layered and complex these
problems are and find the political will
to make the tough Investments across the
board thank you senator those were
exactly the points that were discussed
last year during the study committee the
second question I have for you
is you said it's not solving the problem
in your mind is what we're doing right
now to address the problem working
no but I mean there's an analogy I like
to use a lot in public policy context
and that is the idea of let's say a
house is on fire and you want to put the
fire out on the house but you can't find
any water around all you've got is a big
tub of gasoline it wouldn't make any
sense to say well the only thing we've
got to throw on this fire is gasoline we
got to throw something so let's throw
this right the reason I like that
metaphor is because that is the way we
think a lot about public policy problems
that are really tough and and we tell
ourselves there's not water available to
put out the fire but it just takes I
think some patience and some recognition
that these problems do not get solved
overnight and require real faith in our
neighbors and investments in community
that again may fall on partisan lines
sometimes but but are deeply and
fundamentally about believing in our
neighbors
you do have a couple more questions from
the 41st
Senator you yelled I do Senator isn't it
true that we did have a bipartisan study
committee on homelessness over the
summer on which I was a participant in I
believe that is true and Senator isn't
it further true that in our bipartisan
deeply well-studied studied committee
the only thing that we could all
actually agree on was the need to study
where is the money going because we
heard from all these different
organizations that are funded from
philanthropy money and federal dollars
and the one thing isn't it true sir that
we could agree was that we needed to do
a full audit to understand where the
money was going Senator given my
understanding of the Venn diagram of
Georgia politics I would imagine that
that is that Center space that you're
talking about and and I think that you
know let that is in line with the idea
of pausing to make sure we understand
what we're doing with the money we're
already spending but before we resort to
tactics that the local governments don't
want that only maybe one party in this
chamber agrees with and won't
fundamentally get at the root of the
problem do you further yield I do
I believe it's also true isn't a true
Senator that in that whole many meetings
and hours long study committee that we
never had any discussion about hospitals
dropping off patients and yet this bill
suddenly is talking about hospitals
dropping off patients who are homeless
isn't it true that that was not a part
of our hours and hours long study
committee if the senator States it to be
true and one thing I would say is that
you know I think part of the description
of this bill is going to be oh but we're
prohibiting drop-off this is an
anti-drop-off provision not if you fall
under one of the unless Provisions right
under it right and so what this bill
would do is legitimize a system of drop
off under certain conditions that local
governments could justify I mean there
are real like false imprisonment issues
and you know Fourth Amendment seizure
issues that go into transporting human
beings and I think for us to move on
that and to facilitate a legal type of
forced Transportation by local
governments is a dangerous step if we
don't all agree on it senator
uh senator from 36. thank you Mr
President Senator you I do uh thank you
for your remarks and uh essentially
as I understand it
your your point is and the thrust of the
amendment which I support is that online
on page five
section four
calls for a an intensive
uh data Gathering and audit of spending
on homeless programs and services
Statewide
uh it's true that doesn't occur
overnight is that the case uh really
taking a deep dive and and getting
information from all the sources that
are out there
um is
it is was it the core recommendation of
the study committee and should be at the
heart of this bill as opposed to these
other things that have been added isn't
that true absolutely Senator I think
it's the obvious first step and I think
again given how layered and complex the
issue is this is particularly one where
you don't want to jump in you know head
first addition if I could uh further
question we have we are in the process
uh in the second year of addressing
mental health parity
uh it's widely documented that many of
the unhoused people uh
that have no roof over their heads are
struggling with mental health issues or
substance disorder issues isn't that the
case and that we are in the midst of a
process that we
firmly hope is going to have out
positive outcomes for services for
people struggling with mental illness
and as well as substance abuse disorder
it's not the case Senator that's
absolutely right I think it speaks to
this broader theme which is you don't
solve a problem by putting it out of
view and I know that some proponents of
Bill will say well no we're Banning that
but not if you're fall under one of the
legal exceptions this is in essence a
superficial response to homelessness
that doesn't do the hard work of getting
to know our neighbors of investing them
and waiting until we have the
information we need to know how to treat
our neighbors humanely
uh thank you for that and further
question uh this very body has supported
robustly both parties uh co-responder
model where
people are approached
not with a Law and Order heavy beatdowns
but instead
a law enforcement is accompanied by or
substituted in some cases with a mental
health professional isn't that the case
and that we have this is a new Step that
we're modeling for some very successful
efforts in some counties isn't that
right it is Senator and and that and
that we are still
hoping to build that out Statewide isn't
that the case and and yet again another
positive approach that people have
United around to address the issues
facing our homeless population and
facing the municipalities and counties
as well that are seeking to struggle
with this problem it is Senator the last
thing I'll say in response is what we
know is that delicate well good policy
that is carefully crafted by a bunch of
stakeholders is very delicate it's a
very delicate compromise that has a hard
time getting into rooms like this and
surviving because in a room like this
we're driven by what the need to give
voters results outcomes results look
what we did we took action and complex
problems like this not always
susceptible to that type of politics
thank you for that response and and
finally many of us are planning to go to
the opening this week of a center just
here uh very adjacent to the capital uh
the the police alternative diversion uh
project that's not a project any longer
it's a building out program that
demonstrates success and merits more
funding and that's going to be available
to people just Thursday afternoon at
four o'clock right here in our
neighborhood if you want to learn more
about how these alternative approaches
are working and uh is one more good
reason in the case that we should we
should stick with this language on line
92 to 104 and move forward in a positive
that's right and while acknowledging
that the bill makes some accommodation
for diversion I think what we don't want
to do is turn the screws up in every
case that doesn't fall under some
carefully limited exception you know to
to use what the kids would say on Tick
Tock let them cook you know let them let
them finish the projects that we're
already starting and uh and see where
those go thank you senator
you have no further questions senator
senator from 13th
thank you Mr President
colleagues here we are talking about
homeless again
actually we've spent more than last year
talking about homeless we spent about
the last two and a half years talking
about homeless and since I came into
this Senate body I've counted a homeless
population go up between my little ride
from where I live when I'm in Atlanta to
this Capitol daily and nightly
I can take you right now and take you
out to the bridge out here where the
Coca-Cola museum is and I promise you if
you're not looking where you're going
and you run over the curb which is only
about four inches high you'll take out
anywhere between 15 and 20 people before
you can stop your car
it grows all the time every person we
interview every person that came in our
study committee said Homeless is getting
worse and worse and worse
it was not getting better
we all know that this bill attempted to
make a difference about homeless in
Georgia not Atlanta nothing is
indigenous to Atlanta we're talking
about Georgia that's this little part
that was added over the house we sit and
we debated it over in the house and I
worked with the representatives that
added the part on there and I personally
think it's a great add-on because what
was going on was
I will not call out law enforcement I
will not call on ambulances I will not
call out these different government
outfits but they were picking up
homelessness and they were taking them
to like for example in Athens-Clarke
County because they have a facility to
handle them they were dropping them off
there from other counties and that's not
right each County must deal with
homeless each county has to have a plan
to deal with homeless and what we're
doing is is we're forcing a county to
definitely deal with homeless and make
sure they know that they're going to get
the funding which the audit should tell
us where the monies are what's going to
be done for homeless and that's the
problem folks none of us in this Capital
have a clue how much money is out there
in homeless
none of us
we're talking 10 million and we're
talking 200 million we don't know
we don't know how many 501 3cs are out
there we don't know what they're doing
with the money we hope they're helping I
want to think they're helping but the
reality of it is folks we can do better
we can do better and the law what we
decided when it was debated in this
chamber we took out the cute Town action
and we added the mandamus action from
the senator from the sixth over here he
added the mandamus action in which I
agreed to and I agree too because I am
not a lawyer I'm just trying to make a
problem I'm trying to deal with a
problem and hopefully find a way to make
it better so I would tell you up front
we added a part about local governments
in the audit now have to participate in
the audience because it was brought to
our attention over there that we were
only dealing with Federal monies so now
we made it that all areas encompassing
all-encompassing has to deal with the
audit and everybody must comply with the
audience so we find out all the money is
out there not just some All the Monies
that are sitting out there so I would
ask you that you'd not vote for the
amendment let's move this good bill
forward folk got a money let's do
something about homeless I live in
Cordele Georgia I'm 145 miles from here
we have a little bit of homeless problem
nothing like we got in these big cities
up here you want to make a difference
make a difference vote for this good
bill and do something about homeless and
let's quit arguing about how we're doing
it and create worry about these Party
Line crap vote let's do something with
homeless and get on with it because you
got a good bill here you got to build it
protects people that's not allowed to
haul them off and just drop them off
somewhere under a piece of garbage
and it going to find out where they're
going it's going to find out audit and
have an audit Trail and find out where
they're going and last but not least
folks we might actually make a
difference
we might actually make a difference
please turn down the amendment let's
vote for uh House Bill uh Senate
substitute 62. are you on the wellness
brother all right
senator from the 41st would you like to
close debate
thank you Mr President
um I I'm actually really grateful to be
able to follow the senator from the 13th
because we do agree with we agree with
each other about the thing that he was
most passionate about which is that we
need to audit we need to do a full and
complete audit of where the money goes
who has the money and is the money being
used well if you notice it from his body
language that was the thing he got most
excited about most activated about it's
the audit and that's exactly what my
Amendment does it leaves the audit
intact and so I strongly encourage you
let's be deliberative let's return to
the very place where we started because
remember when we passed this bill out of
the Senate all it called for was an
audit because we wanted to know where
the money comes from I will tell you I
was in that study committee and the only
thing we could agree about
in a bipartisan way was that we need to
audit the money because once we have a
full audit then we can make some
calculated and important choices and
decisions about how to best use that
money until then
we just need to hold on and allow the
people who are out in the hallways and
who are out across the street and who
are doing the work every day with people
who are experiencing homelessness who
are doing their best to get people in
the house and we need to let them
continue to do that work while we do the
audit and then when we have the audit we
can make different choices if they are
called for so I do urge you please vote
Yes on my Amendment I'm going to agree
as as amended thank you
all right Senators yielded the whale
does any other Senator we speak for
against the measure
chair hearing none here's the pot here's
the posture that we're in right now
um because
senator from the 41st underlying bill
was the senator from the 13th with the
senator from the 41st move that that the
Senate agree to the house substitute as
amended it's a similar posture that we
had earlier

is their objection
to the motion without objection uh
calling the senator to the
of the 29th speak to the measure
thank you Mr President colleagues we're
all familiar with this piece of
legislation
we sent it over we went through the
committee process through the house as
it should have done we worked hard on
this legislation I want to recognize my
my my good friend representative Gullett
who has been working on this rep this
legislation with me for three years now
and
the additions that were made through
this process was a an appeal process to
the superior court judge within the
circuit where the D.A is uh
is is practicing and is elected and also
uh added was additions to point out
the opportunity that if a Judicial
Circuit district attorney fails to
perform their duties provided under code
section 15 18 6 or solicitor fails to do
their Duty under 15 1866 that it shall
constitute grounds for recall of that
individual what they have done is they
have taken an excellent piece of
legislation and they have made it better
and I ask that all of my colleagues vote
green on this so that we can close this
Gap within the criminal justice system
and move forward with making Georgia the
safest state to live in in the United
States of America thank you so much and
I look forward to your green vote Mr
President I yield the well
Senators yield of the well recognize the
senator from the 42nd
you
you don't have to say anything Senator
if you don't want to
thank you Mr President
um this is a huge sea change in uh the
law as it stood for hundreds of years
you know here in Georgia so I just
wanted to go back over some of the very
uh incisive and important arguments that
those against this particular piece of
legislation make when we're talking
about an attack on a duly elected
District Attorneys throughout our state
of Georgia who serve the people who have
elected them DA's are elected officials
and are accountable to the people and
the community that they serve that's who
elected them
stripping local DA's of the autonomy to
make decisions around the safety and
well-being of their local community
erodes the rights of those local
residents and the voters to choose the
leader that best reflects and furthers
their vision for the justice system in
their community in which they live
second guessing these duly elected local
prosecutors undermines local control and
erodes community self-governance
spreading out the prosecution function
among DA's in each County avoids a
concentration of too much power in one
centralized entity
here's the facts DA's have always had
tremendous discretion throughout our
history to prosecute or decline to
prosecute cases
and they regularly exercise discretion
in classes of cases from bail to
sentencing requests to old outdated laws
that are on our books but routinely not
prosecuted now such as crimes against
adultery
efforts to undermine their discretion or
push that discretion into the Shadows
even worse
deprives voters of the opportunity to
hold prosecutors accountable for their
policies by their voters the ones that
they are responsive to and the ones that
they have that have sent them to their
seat
in a world of very limited
public resources something that all of
us understand here in this chamber
District Attorneys simply cannot
prosecute every single crime and Petty
offense that occurs within their
jurisdiction they must make decisions on
how to use their precious resources
within the permissive borders of
deliberate deliberately Broad and
plentiful criminal laws they they serve
as Ministers of justice and are actually
ethically bound to pursue those
interests already
the ABA rules make clear that it is the
responsibility of a prosecutor not to
serve just as a zealous advocate but to
quote unquote do justice quote do
justice unquote on behalf of the people
it is the onus is on these duly elected
District Attorneys to promote Public
Safety in the communities that they
serve that is not a one-size-fits-all
across the whole state
and there actually is substantial
evidence
that in many instances some of the more
punitive and overweening approaches to
criminal justice actually end up
undermining Public Safety as they
undermine Community Trust
thank you Mr President just wanted to
lay out some of the points again about
the uh overthrow of district attorneys
in this state being able to serve the
people that elected them and I'm happy
to answer any questions and if not I
will request a no vote and yield the
well you uh you do have a question
Senator uh senator from the 37th thank
you Mr President does the lady yield of
course isn't it true that we elect our
Superior Court judges here in the state
it is true isn't it true that the the
actions of Superior Court judges are
subject to the voters as well they are
they are um is it true that we have a
Judicial qualifications commission
that's been in place in Georgia since
1972. that is true but there is a key
difference Senator would you Advocate
the repeal of the jqc what I would
Advocate is that all prosecutors in the
state fall under this new body and in
the this legislation they do not which
is a key difference with the judicial
qualifications Council moreover not all
judges are attorneys but all district
attorneys are attorneys and then
therefore they are beholden to the State
Bar of Georgia and all of its rules as
well as the American Bar Association and
the same cannot be said of all judges in
the state of Georgia isn't it true that
all Superior Court judges in uh in the
state of Georgia are attorneys and their
members of the bar they are but that
particular body that you brought up
overseas more than Superior Court judges
having made that point I'm the I want to
get back to peer Court judges the point
is we've got a process in Georgia isn't
it true to deal
um have a have oversight of our judges
who have a role that's that's at least
as important as DA's I think it's high
time isn't it true that we have a
similar organization that even though
DA's are locally elected there's still
professional accountability across the
state thank you Senator I think that you
make a great point and that's why I
think too it would have been wiser to
not create a constitutional class
um with certain
um constitutional issues that arise in
this bill treating different prosecutors
differently by exempting certain classes
of prosecutors in our state from this
new oversight Commission in a way that
is not done in the judicial oversight
commission and I agree with you that it
would have been smarter to take that
approach and then we could say that it
was applied equitably which again would
avoid some of the Constitutional
problems with this particular piece of
legislation thank you Mr President
thank you Senator Senators yield of the
well
does any other Senator which speak for
against the measure
hearing none
so the posture we're in is that the
Senate has agreed to the house
substitute on Senate Bill 92
is their objection
is their objection
you object okay
all right so uh now that uh
those in favor of the motion will vote
yay those opposed nay secretary unlock
the machines
on the on the passage of the bill the
yeas are 32 the Nays are 24 and this
bill has prevailed
all right we're getting close y'all
we're getting close
I recognize the senator from the 54th
for a motion
Mr Mr President
I move that the Senate insist on his
amendment to house bill 142.
[Applause]

on hospital bill 142. secretary read the

the Senate offered the following
Amendment

replacing with one tenth that completes
the order Mr President
Senator I recognize senator from the 54
to speak to the speak to the motion
thank you Mr President my friends a few
remember we passed this by a unanimous
vote in this chamber with a small change
and all this bill does is it creates the
unified police force for Spelman College
Clark Atlanta Morris Brown and Morehouse
College we overwhelmingly passed this
but with a small amount of amendment and
the purpose of that amendment was to
make sure that we're protecting students
we don't need to be running radar out on
the city streets but we need to make
sure that when these kids are on campus
that they're being looked at so we won't
brought it in that to 200 yards outside
of the campus the police are allowed to
patrol but to keep them constrained to
the campuses so they'll therefore they
will keep our students straight uh Mr
President if any questions I will yield
