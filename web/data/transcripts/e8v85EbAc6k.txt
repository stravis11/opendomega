Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 300?
House Bill 300.
House Bill 300, my wife, Senator Kelly, the 16th and others, to be entitled to enact to
amend Part 4 of Article I on Chapter 3, Title 46 of the Efficient Quoted Georgia Annotated
Relating to Solar Power, Free Market Financing, so is it required for the establishment of the
Solar Technology Trust Fund, this bill that refer to the Committee on Energy Utilities
and Telecommunications, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Members, we are about to discuss a very, very important issue for our state's future.
You'll give the gentleman in the well your attention.
Represent Trade Kelly is recognized to present the bill.
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I come before you today with House Bill 300, which looks
to do two things. First, it looks to provide some certainty and protection for landowners
who enter into solar power facility agreements with those who lease the property from them
to build out the solar power facilities. Second, it looks to maintain the balance that
we've seen in our state and the success we've seen as a state integrating solar into our
power mix without placing undue burns on those who want to continue building out those facilities,
while also protecting our property owners who are leasing that land to them. I want to thank
Chairman Don Parsons for giving us the ability to work on this bill over the session,
over the summer. We started at last session and worked over the summer on the measure to
perfect it and I want to thank him for allowing us to put together a working
group on that and those who served on the working group. Mr. Speaker I know we
just came back from lunch but I'll be glad to answer any questions. You have a
couple. I'll yield. I'm going to take the most important one first. He's not the
first one. He has a button but Chairman Robert Dickie that chairs the
agriculture and consumer affairs committee. Chairman Dickie. Back from his
speaker does the gentleman yield? I'll yield of course, yes sir. I just want to thank you for your
lot of work on this bill through the time and I just want to ask you is some terminology you
did not include in this bill and nowhere in this bill that you refer to the solar power facilities
as farms and I appreciate that and I thank you for that and these facilities do not
to grow anything for us to eat.
So thank you for that.
They provide a valuable resource to us in terms of power
supply, but they don't grow those delicious peaches
that I like to get down to Moussella.
We had that good on peaches.
I'm not sure.
But I like peaches, too.
You have no further questions.
Thank you, Ms. Speaker.
You had the well and asked for this body's
favorable consideration.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there an objection to the previous question
be in order. Chair has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting
the Committee's substitute? Chair has done the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is
any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Chair has done the report the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and
the clerk will unlock the machine.
have all members voted, all members voted for what purpose is representative Williams
rise? Parliament inquiry. Oh, really, a request. I'd like to be excused under the
Koch Chokas rule on this vote.
I was wondering what this had to do with Cherry Wine, but I now get it.
Gentlemen, so state, see, you will be excused from the vote. What all members
voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of HB 300. The
yeas are 146. The nays are zero. The bill having received a requisite
constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the
caption to House Bill 10221022?
House Bill 1022 by Representative Sainz of the 180th and others to be entitled back to amend Article 5 of Chapter 5 and Title 16 of the
Fisher go to Georgia and say to relating the cruelty to children so stand act the Colton McNeal Act.
Ms. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on June 5 Justice that committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Chairman Sainz is recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, this bill titled Colton McNeill Act for Colton
King, a member of my district, a beautiful five-year-old soul who at the age of two had a
cruelty to children's statue placed against a perpetrator, housing his home, his mom's
advocated for increased sentencing based on what happened in their family situation.
This simply modifies the cruelty to children's statue for the first and second degree and increasing the penalties having the first degree go from five to 20 years to 15 to 30 years and the second degree going from one to 10 years to 10 to 30 years with only in the instances that that child is defined as a disabled minor which is the first part of the bill in line 16 and below with that Mr. Speaker I'll yield the well if there's no questions.
You do have a question or yield for one represent Tony Miller to your left in
the back. Representative Miller you're recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield? I do. Chairman Saints just to clarify the sentencing
provisions that set forth in the bill. They do not require mandatory minimum
sentencing but keep in in keep in line the same discretion that courts have to
decide a sentence based on the facts of the cases that correct. The general
lady is correct it doesn't modify any of the ability to stay probate or
suspend it simply parallels the language within the first and second
degree and increases it increases the range there. Does the gentleman yield for
one more question. I do. Is it not also true, Chairman Sains, that these cases are some
of the most difficult cases to prosecute and are often some of the worst cases of child
abuse that we see in our state that's justifying an increase in penalties? I think this house
has an opportunity to take a stand in ensuring that those who perpetrate crimes to the most
vulnerable amongst us are penalized to the degree that they should and with that Mr. Speaker
all you'll do well.
The gentleman's yielded the well.
Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered to chair his none?
The previous question is ordered.

bill 984-984.
House bill 984 by Representative Lomston of the 12th and others to be titled an act to
amend titles 25 and 33 of the official go to Georgia annotated relying to for higher
protection and safety and insurance respectively so is to update the practices of the Department
of Insurance and the Office of the Safety Fire Commissioner.
Ms. Bill ever referred to the committee on insurance,
that committee recommends this bill do pass.
Chairman Lumston is recognized to present the bill.
I apologize, I didn't see you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 984.
This is the Department of Insurance Bill.
The bill does three things.
First, it sets the framework for off due to use
department vehicles by post certified officers of the Department of Insurance.
The second thing it does is it deletes a subsection of state law to bring us into compliance
with national association of insurance commissioners, model law dealing with small cap life insurance
companies.
And the third thing it does is to require that insurers waive the age requirement for
dependents with a developmentally disability or physical disability and allow them to remain
on their parents insurance or be added to their parents insurance policy. That's what the bill does.
Appreciate your favorable consideration. I'll answer any questions.
Gentlemen, did you yield? Do you have a question if you? Yes.
Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left.
Representative Clark has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Judge gentlemen, yield. I yield. I just have a clarifying question on the section about
individuals with developmental disabilities or physical disabilities does that
mean that they can be on the dependent coverage for indefinitely like there is
no age limit whatsoever. There's nothing in the bill that addresses the age
limit it says if they fall into that category they can be on their parents either
continue to be on their parents policy or be added to their parents policy. Thank
you.
You have no further questions with that I'll yield the well and the gentleman is yielded

The bill having to receive the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 997?
9.97 by Representative Corbett of the 174th and others to be taught on an act to amend Code
Section 45, 151 of the fish go to Georgia and annotate everything, the disqualification
of driving and action required after suspending, revoking, or canceling license or non-resident
privileges.
This bill I would refer to the Committee on Motor Vehicles, that committee recommends
at this bill do pass.
Chairman Corbett is recognized to present this bill.
Chairman Corbett House bill 997.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I'll bring you
before your House bill 997, LC394096.
This is a Department of the Driver Services bill brought
on their request.
What we're doing with this bill is the Federal Motor
care, safety administration, FMCSA, commercial drivers,
licensed drug and alcohol clearing houses,
a secure online database that centralizes records
of the FMCSA drug and alcohol program violators.
What we're doing with HB997, we're streamlining the
notification to the State Department of
Driver Services when a customer is prohibited from a
CDL and adds a layer of safety, making it more
difficult for drivers to conceal their drug and alcohol program violations from the current
or prospective employers and evade the CMV driving prohibition. Currently, CDL holders
can employ shop once they are notified of their violation because the current process
is not streamlined. This bill provides all parties real-time information. It also streamlines
the reinstatement of the driver's CDLs on the back end once they've completed the
requirement or valuation or treatment that the FMCSA requires that it streamlines the
reinstatement portion of their license back to them as well.
So that's what the bill does, Mr. Speaker.
I would ask for everybody's favorable consideration.
You have no questions.
Thank you.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair has done?
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill. Chair here's none. The report of the committee is
agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill?
We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the
machine.

bill 1044-1044.
House Bill 1044 by Reps. Anderson of the 10th and others to be titled
NAC2MEN, chapters 10 and title 13 of the official go to Georgia and TATA
relating to contracts for public works, so is the increase of dollar value of
certain public work contracts exempt from the provisions relating to
retention of contractual payments. This bill I'm referring to the committee on
The Governor and the Affairs Committee recommends
this bill do pass.
Representative Victor Anderson is recognized
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, today I bring before you house bill 1044.
If that caption of the bill sounded familiar, it should.
We passed this bill last year in this chamber
in pretty much the same form it is now,
but we've added some things to it.
passed out of here with 164 votes passed out of the Senate and the governor's office decided
they wanted to add to the bill. So last year's bill, which was House Bill 193, addressed
the public works project purchasing limits for county and municipal governments. That's
chapter 36. The governor's office wanted this to extend to other statewide departments.
So we've included Title 13, Title 20, and also a portion of Title 50.
In preparing for this revision and reintroduction of this bill, we checked with every department
in the state that could potentially be impacted, gave them an opportunity to either opt in
or opt out.
And House Bill 1044 is what we have that I present for you today.
Mr. Speaker, I'll be all for any questions if there are.
Representative, you have no questions.
I have one.
Yes, sir.
My recollection serves me adequately.
I think it was cloudy the day we passed this one last year and rainy.
Was it not?
It absolutely was.
Many of us refer to that day as Sinko de Vito.
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut.
There's no doubt about that.
You have no further questions.
Ask for your favorable consideration, and I yield the will.
Is there any objection to the previous question being
ordered?
Here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the
committee, which was favorable to the passage of the
bill the chair here is none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in
favor the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock
the machine
have all members voted, all members voted.
If so, the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of House Bill 1044, the Yays are 154,
the Nays 8, the Bill haven't received
the requisite Constitutional majority, is therefore passed.
Members, because we have some important issues,
we need to take up and committee date.
We will postpone House Bill 1037 and House Bill 925 to the next legislative day.
All right.
We have a couple of afternoon orders.
I want you to give your attention to the member in the well, especially on this first
one.
Representative Gladney in the Augusta delegation, Representative Gladney in the Augusta delegation.
If you'll stand with us, please, members,
represent Gladby and the Augusta delegation.
Thank you all.
Today we'd like to honor the honorable Ed Taver,
who represented the Augusta area in the Georgia State Senate
and served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia.
He responded to his final calling on this past Friday
at the age of 64.
The distinguished gentleman, Tarver, was born in 1959
and graduated from Augusta College
before enlisting in the United States Army.
He earned a law degree from the University of Georgia
in 1991.
From 2005 to 2009, Tarver represented
Georgia's 22nd District in the Georgia State Senate.
And later, in 2009, he was sworn in as the first black United States attorney from the
Southern District of Georgia.
He was a member of the Omega-Sci5 fraternity, Incorporated, and the alpha-mobile lay of the
Sigma-5-5 fraternity, Incorporated.
He is survived by his wife, Dr. Carol Dale Tarver, and his children.
Please bow your heads in a moment of silence and honor of his service.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well, sir.
A very fine gentleman who served this state with distinction, he will be missed, prayers
for his family, representing Mike Cameron, you're recognized for an afternoon order.
Please get the gentleman your attention.
Thank you Miss Speaker.
I rise today to remember one of our great teachers in Walker County, Georgia, who passed
away last week.
Mary Biss Smith was originally from Ohio.
She came to Chattanooga to a Tennessee Temple University to get her teaching degree.
She met her husband Michael.
They spent a lifetime together.
A few weeks ago, she didn't feel well one day.
So Michael took her to the hospital and she'd been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer and she only lasted about three and a half weeks
But during that time she showed courage and joy that very few people show in that kind of situation
And she passed away last week and she'll be remembered not only in the community
She was treasurer of Walker County GOP
But she invested herself as so many young people and helped so many young people over the years that that memory will never go away
We mourn, and the teachers, the staff at Ridgeland,
high school and miss are especially.
I'm like a moment of silence, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Prears for the family.
Chairman Dickie recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
Appreciate you recognizing Georgia today.
at their birthday, 291st, birthday.
And I just thought members of this chamber
would like to know a little bit more history.
I'm a lover of history.
And so Ogathorke got the idea for the colony.
After he learned that a friend had died in debtors prison.
He and several other men approached King George's second
with this idea.
The colony was to be named for the king.
In a group, the trustees would govern the colony
for the first 21 years.
There were four reasons for establishing the colony of Georgia.
Relief of poor subjects, a home for debtors,
a defensive barrier for South Carolina against the Spanish
who went Florida, trade, the production of wine and silk,
and a home for persecuted European Protestants,
like many of the other colonies.
The boundaries were from the Savannah River on the north
to the Altamhar River on the south
and from the Atlantic Ocean on the east
and believe this all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the west.
Georgia was only successful in two of these
as a barrier against the Spanish and a home
for persecuted Protestants.
No debtors ever came to Georgia
and they were not able to produce wine and seal in any quantities.
Two groups, interesting enough, were not allowed in the beginning.
They were Catholics and slaves.
Two occupations also were not allowed to come to the beginning.
They were liquor dealers and lawyers.
The trustees considered lawyers the scrunch of mankind.
And that's your history lesson for Georgia today.
They had a lot in common, still do, probably, we don't worry about that later.
Representative Reese, recognize for and afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As many of you know, there was a big game on TV last night.
Some of you may have watched it. Some of you may have not.
But I tell you there was one man in my district who was decided to watch it.
And that's 87-year-old retired command sergeant major William McKinley-Mail.
He was excited to watch it because his grandson, Wilbur Williams, was the trombone player
for us last night.
It was a very proud moment from him and a very proud moment for me because Mr. Williams
attended Carva High School, which is in House District 140.
Mr. Williams has also toured with Tyler Perry and performed now at the Super Bowl.
We think that's quite an accomplishment.
But in fact, Mr. Speaker last night was a display of the great talent that we have here
in Georgia.
It's a testament to our music industry and the entertainment industry that we have in
general.
To see Usher, Little John, and Ludicrous all on the stage together just truly warm our
heart.
And it's a fact that we are a superior and dominant display of the wealth of talent in the state
of Georgia.
The cheese may have warned the game, but Georgia warned today.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I year the will.
Mr. Chairman, we're glad you could make it from the ballgame back here to be with the
state.
You just forgot your cap.
That's the only thing.
If y'all know what I'm talking about, look at him.
Representative Gamble is recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm honored today to have Mr. Steven Schumacher here, the president of only in Carter'sville
Bartow County, which is also our Convention and Visitors Bureau, and I thought it would
also be a good opportunity to remind the Chamber that in Georgia in 2022, 168 million visitors
came to our state to tour and to vacation.
And of that, we had $39.8 billion in direct spending and $73 billion in spending total
that that industry brought to our state.
It represents approximately 442,000 jobs in our state.
Recently, Stephen and his staff there at only in Bartow
hosted the Georgia Association of Convention and Visitors
Bureau's conference that Jay Mark Walter led.
Many of y'all know Jay up until his move
over to the Department of Economic Development,
where he now is the statewide tourism director.
But Stephen and his staff put that together
to bring people to our community,
but that conference moves around the state
and has been in many of our communities
as it moves annually.
And so the final thing I'll mention is Mark Jaronski
and the team at the Department of Economic Development
that oversee tourism to a fantastic job.
We have a lot to be proud of.
And I just wanted to take the opportunity
to welcome Stephen and to mention
and highlight how important tourism is to our state.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, and welcome Stephen, floor lead of McDonald, Governor's floor lead is recognized
for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues.
Arise today to thank our men and women in uniform.
In recent weeks, we've been reminded here in Georgia about the rest of these men and
women take every day to keep us safe.
We as Georgians will not forget these men.
Crawford County Deputy Timothy Rivers was killed in the line of duty on February 6th.
State Trooper Jimmy Siskar was killed in the line of duty on January 28th.
Calvita County Deputy Anthem Manics was killed in the line of duty on January 4th.
And that's just this year.
We heard the weekend of a shooting at Lakewood Church in Houston that could have been much worse,
but for our off-duty law enforcement that were at the church and were able to respond
quickly and decisively, the thin blue line is real.
These men and women keep us safe every day, seeking to maintain law and order in this
capital, in the city of Atlanta, and across this great state of Georgia.
As we saw in Texas, these aren't nine to five jobs.
These men and women give us, they're all, every day.
And I believe this entire house owes them a debt of thanks.
Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Thank you, sir.
Representative Nullowicz has recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I wanted to make sure everyone here knew something
that we were very proud of in Cobb County,
and that is that our Cobb County Sheriff's Office
has received the accreditation.
They've attained accreditation
from the top three law enforcement accrediting agencies
in the country, which means that the Sheriff's Office
and Sheriff Prick Owen have been awarded
the Triple Crown Award from the National Sheriff's
Association.
I just wanted to make sure everyone knew
that we were very proud of him getting that honor
proud of the work that our Sheriff's Office is doing. Thank you. Thank you
Representative. That's great to be recognized and to sure we all know about
it. Representative McCullum is recognized for an afternoon order. Did a fine
job earlier today? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker has 20-year
firefighter and marine veteran and the father of a police officer. I rise today to
I thank those of my colleagues that have joined me in standing up in our law enforcement community here in Georgia.
In our 2024 budget, we've provided $4,000 raises to law enforcement officers.
We've recently passed SB 63 to keep folks in jail when they put our law enforcement officers at risk.
We passed 881 to push back against prosecutors that don't take their jobs and
partnership with law enforcement seriously. We pass HB 500, a common sense piece of legislation
to strengthen the penalty of burning police cars. We've passed HB 505 to increase the penalty
for riding that often puts our law enforcement at risk. We pass SB 44 to go after gangs
and those who recruit our young people, a scourge facing law enforcement in every corner
of our state.
The men and women of law enforcement put their lives in harm's way to keep us safe.
As long as I have the privilege of serving, I will continue to stand up for my brothers
and sisters in public safety, ensure that whatever happens, wherever in our state, that
They always have our support under the gold dome.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield the well.
That completes our announcements.
