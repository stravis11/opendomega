So it will be duly noted those that are here and those that are absent. So just so you know. Representative Mopthaihan, I see you back there. Good to see all this morning. And it is an honor to be able to be back in front of you again this morning to bring the message. Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Miss Kathy for asking that I come today. And as we get into these last two days of session, Tempers get short, nerves get frayed, feelings get hurt, feelings get the feeling better. And then on Tuesday morning we all, our next Tuesday morning hopefully we all feel like it's over with and we're happy with the world again as we go home to our families. But you know, the next couple of days will be incredibly tense. Those of you that have been here for a session have seen one of those, those of us that have been here for many sessions have seen many of those. And when the speaker asked me a few weeks ago to do this message today, I started praying about what it was that it felt like need to be said or what the Lord wanted me to say. And I guess I kind of, I want to continue on the theme that a lot of the preachers this year have been talking about. And Chairman Nicks has mentioned it a few times and a couple of his sermons and everything but it's love. L-O-V-E-Love. You know, the great commandments, they're ten commandments that we think about all the time. But as you read in scripture in Mark 12, 30 and 31, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength, the second is this, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. For there is no other commandment greater than these. Love, L-O-V-E-Love. The reason we're here is because we love people. You love the people in your district, you love your families, you love your friends. But I dare say out of the 180 of us on this side and the 56 as much as we fight with them across the hall, that none of us are here because we don't love people. We're all here because we do love people. You know, Lord's love is an agape love. Y'all should be impressed, I just said in fancy word. But agape love, the love that looks over everything, looks over all of our faults, looks over all of our imperfections. God loves us because we're here, we're here creation, we're made in his image. Those of us that have children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, we love them with an unconditional love. Leaching every one of us, each and every one of you in this room are God's children. So think about how much you love those little ones running around your house. And then think about how much God loves all of us because we're created in his image. Unconditional love. Not subject to any conditions. God's only begotten son, God's only begotten son died for our sins. I don't know how to divine love any better than that sacrifice. John 4.19, we love because he first loved us. Unconditional love. Not subject to any conditions. That's what God is. That's what Christ is. That's what the only spirit is. And that's what we should try and strive to do every day. You know, you've heard me tell you many times I'm a Baptist. Some will consider me to be a hard shell Baptist. We're not foot washers, not stink handlers or anything like that. Just hard shell Baptist, don't drink, don't smoke, don't dance. Still haven't quite found a scripture where it says that we can't dance, but it's somewhere there. But we still do business meetings in our church. Many of y'all still do the same thing. Little church at home in Alvern and you know, on a good Sunday we got 45-50 folks there. So it's small, very family-oriented. We love each other, again, unconditionally. But you know, as a business meetings, a Baptist business meeting especially can get a little tense sometimes. Y'all myth don't know thing about it. Y'all lose a preacher every three years. We wind up hanging on to a preacher for 25 because nobody wants turning by his feelings. But you know, church I grew up in, Beth Aver Baptist Church, which is just down the road from our house. We're all my family is buried. Growing up there, one of the oldest Baptist churches in our area. There was years ago of business meeting. And it's back in the horse and buggy days. And so one of the older deacons he had gotten to the point that he didn't come to many of the deacons meetings. He's thinking, you know, the younger folks got better ideas. I'll just kind of set back and let them kind of carry on the good work. And so he'd heard that one Sunday they were going to have a deacons meeting and they were actually going to spend some money. So he thought, well, maybe I need to go if they're going to be spending money. I need to make sure they're going to spend the money right. So get in there and they're having a discussion. And one of the deacons proposes is, Mr. Chairman, I move that we buy a chandelier for the church. One of the other deacons speaks of, I second the motion that we buy the chandelier. Well, this older gentleman who might have been related to me stood up and said, I want to speak. So Chairman recognized him to speak. He said, Mr. Chairman, you know what we're talking about spending some money here. But then none of us got a good enough education that when we go to order this chandelier from Sears and Robut, that we can even spell it. And if we can figure out how to spell it and get it ordered and Sears and Robut decides to deliver it to us, ain't none of us knows how to play it. And as bad as we need lights in this church, I don't know that we need to be buying no chandelier. So... You know, I've got a couple more days left here in this chamber. I hope I've got many more days left on this earth that I get to enjoy the friendships I've made. I love you all unconditionally, even those that I don't know very well. And I count it in my loss that I have not had the chance to get to know you better. But there's some sitting here in this room that I will treasure forever as my friends. And I hope you all know that. Unconditional love. I love y'all. I'll go forth and do good work. If y'all will, join me in a prayer. Most kind and gracious Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to you today, we come as humbly as we know how. When we come with humble hearts, humble minds, humble ears. When we seek your guidance and what we do, we seek your guidance and the decisions that we make. Lord, we just pray that the things that we do and say to one another will be pleasing unto you. And Lord, most of all, on the things that we decide on here today and on Monday, that Lord, those things will be pleasing unto you as well. Lord, we take serious the charge that you give us to look after our districts, look after our families, look after our loved ones. And Lord, above it all, we know that you're looking out for us. Lord, we just love and we thank you. And Lord, we just ask that where we failed you, where I've failed you. Lord, I just ask for your forgiveness. Or go with us through this day, keep us safe, take us home safely to our families today, and bring us back safely as we come back to finish up on Monday. Lord, we just ask traveling mercies upon everyone. All these things we ask in Christ name, amen. Join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Chair recognizes, Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee of Information and Audit. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

If you signed up for a morning order, you need to report to the front of the chamber. When I call your name, the clock starts running. Chair recognizes representative McLeod for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Big up to my colleagues. This will probably be the last time that you hear that in the well. Let me start by thanking the wonderful people that live in District 105 for their vote of confidence to allow me to be their voice. They elected me in 2018 with over 4,000 more votes than my opponent and almost 8,000 more votes than my opponents in 2020 when they re-elected me. They know I've been doing the work and I will continue to do the work. My journey to this place has been an incredible one. Most of you know I was born in the beautiful island of Jamaica. My father left the island for Canada back in the late 60s when I was only a year old. At the time, Canada needed to build its infrastructure and my father fit the bill because he was a welder and a member of the union. Both Canada and Jamaica are tied to the British Commonwealth. By the early 70s, Jamaica was plagued with political violence and after coming close to dying twice, my grandmother insisted that my father and my son sent for my sister and I to leave Jamaica. You can only imagine the cultural shock we had arriving in Canada and on the second day it snowed. I am glad that children are adaptable because we had a lot of adapting to do. After living in Canada for 21 years and having my daughter graduating with a degree in chemical engineering, my father once again decided he was going to move to the United States in advance of his retirement. Our immigration process took seven years and within that seven years, the 1996 Olympics happened in Georgia. That's when we decided that this was the place we wanted to live. Prior to that, Georgia was known to me in two songs, a rainy night in Georgia and Georgia on my mind. We moved to Georgia in 1998. I can only say that American politics has always been fascinating to me. The whole concept of this republic, a separation of power, representative democracy and the notion that if you see it, you can achieve it. Only in America can a little girl from a small island like Jamaica can serve in the Georgia House of Representatives with the history of slavery, segregation and the commitment of people that came before me to push forward for redemption. People ask me all the time, where do you get all that passion? And my answer is, have you seen my family? That is how we do it. I understand the assignment. My job is to be the voice of the people I serve. Every time I push a green button or the red button, I know I'm not just pushing it for District 105, but for the almost 11 million people that live in the state of Georgia. And for that, I am humbled. I want to thank my family for adapting to my unplanned life in elected office. Ladies time has expired. Thank you so much. And again, thank you all for everything, Dean Smirie, thank you so much. And I just want to say thank you for the experience in this body. I look forward to the future and I truly do appreciate it. Big up to you all. Chair recognizes representative Dreyer for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My mom said I had to do a farewell speech, so I'm down here. She has a lot of advice for you all, but I just want you to know she wants us to be prepared and she wants us to focus on the people we serve when we get down here. When I got elected, I said I was going to be a voice for people that didn't have a voice, not because we don't want to do that, but because it's so hard and our progress is made in inches and then we have to fight to hold half an inch of progress. And I'll say that I believe I've been that voice and I've worked as hard as I could and left it all on the field. And I want to thank my boys who've sacrificed so much and I've told them that I am down here because as special as those kids are, every other kid in state of Georgia is just as special and they deserve exactly the same opportunities. And finally, I want to say to the representative from District 89, her sisters call her Marshmallow heart because she cares so much about other people. But to care that much, it takes an amazing amount of strength and courage and she is the strongest, most courageous, loving person I know. I want to say it's my honor to have been down here and I appreciate you all so much. I love you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Hagen for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We all know that representative Patty Bentley here is the strawberry queen, but I decided that today I'm going to declare myself the Vade Sweet Union queen. So this vegetable, which in 1990 was declared the state vegetable of our great state. And as of active diplomacy, I'd like to present this fine onion to the strawberry queen. And I'd also like to invite all of you to come down to the Vade Onion Festival April 21st through 24th to celebrate our harvest. Don't worry, I have one for you. It is coming. There's a flyer on your desk with all the information and a website at the bottom where you can buy tickets. And I hope you'll join us. Thank you. Chair recognizes chairman Dickie, chairman blackman, chairman Clark. And chairman Williams for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If we could stand for a moment of silence for following law enforcement officer who was lost his life yesterday in Hauston County while on duty serving subpoenas as automobile accident. But Richard Croomes was a Hauston County DA investigator. And prior to joining the Hauston County DA's office, he worked for the Bibb County, shares office for 25 years, and also trained and mentored many up and coming law enforcement officers at the way taught at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center for CY. Richard Croomes was well loved and liked by many law enforcement and middle Georgia. And if we could just have a short moment of silence for Richard and his family. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Bentley for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And happy Friday, colleagues. I've asked Dean Smiley, representative of Jackson and representative, where for Duke to stand with me, I'm not going to ask for a moment, silent, I'm going to ask for a moment of celebration and honor of my husband, Dean Darryl Kay Bentley, who would have celebrated his 61st birthday on Saturday, April 23rd. And he's going home to be with the law and but his wife want to make sure that I let everybody know that I love this man right here. And I thank God for all of you that helped me through my trials and tribulation. I'm a blessed woman because I'm a member of the Georgia House of Representatives. And this is a great big family. And I love you all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, colleagues, and happy Friday. Chair recognizes Chairman Matthew Eck for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, representative, representative, and I would like to honor a great, griffin athlete, Homer Gibbons, world boxing champion. He is a person of exceptional strength and kindness being devoted to the betterment of our community with his time and his talents. Loyalty to Oak Hill Baptist Church. He is truly an inspiration and a great mentor to students within our community and his ministry. Thank you, Homer, for all you do and I hope you get to see us online. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Butler for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Chairman of the rural caucus, Sam Watson, and I as vice-chair are proud to be able to tell you that each year the dues from rural caucus are used to support programs, colleges, and agencies around the state that foster agriculture in Georgia. This year we also had the opportunity to honor some people. So we wanted to announce today, and you may want to hear this because your name may be on the list. The University of Georgia College of Agricultural Environmental Services will receive a donation from the rural caucus for a scholarship in honor of House Chairman Rural, Caucus Member, and House Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Terry England. We also honored by giving to A-Back Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College Center for Rural Prosperity and Innovation, Mr. Speaker, these titles are so long. I'm sorry. We're honoring Jan Tinkertzley, who has served as our secretary. And we are honoring our long-time treasurer, representative Tommy Benton, and by donating to the Horticulture Scholarship at Lanier Technical College. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We have run out of time for morning orders. If you had signed up and didn't get reached, and there were a number of you that didn't, and if you want to be heard on Monday morning, come up and see Betsy. All right. All members of this House will please take your seats. All members of the House will please take your seats. Seize conversation. Chair recognizes for a special order representative, Micah Grappley. Good morning, colleagues. I appreciate the scheduling of April Fool's Day to announce to you all my retirement. I will say this that every moment I have stepped into this chamber has been one of all, one of excitement, one of grandeur, one of deep humility, one of great respect for all of you. You see, it was in 1996 when I first came to the State Capitol. As a matter of fact, it was representative Alan Powell back then. That was the senior class of a manual college. I was the only one that wore a tie that day. We sit right here in the anti-room and the gentleman in the blue.

Luke Kote next to Representative Alan Powell was Dr. James Edminson. They tried and true Southern Democrat and he was my mentor. He was the government and history professor at Emanuel College and I loved every moment in his classroom sitting under his tutelage and he said, class we're going to go down to the state capital. And I stood right there in that anti-room and I watched this house in 1996 with all and respect. And as a senior in college I said to myself, one day I would love to serve in this chamber. I don't know how. I don't know when, but peering through the glass I imagined what it would be like. So after college I graduated and went on to the Congressional campaign of Congressman Bob Barr and at the first barbecue that I attended in Carrollton, Georgia, a gentleman was running for the Attorney General of Georgia. And that gentleman was Speaker David Ralston, then Senator Ralston running for Attorney General. Those are two very good looking men right there. And after meeting this gentleman I knew it only furthered my desire to want to serve, to engross myself in this thing called politics and service, helping others, representing the views and values of my friends, my family, my community. And so many of you may not know this. I came in a little differently in 2012. We had just finished redistricting in 2010 and the seat was vacated that I was in. An 18 year incumbent held that seat. And we felt that it would be a special election. However the state party would select the individual. And again this gentleman, because the primary had already taken place and the Republicans needed someone on the ballot. And the gentleman that I showed in the picture earlier gave a phone call to me and said, I'd love for you to put your hat in the ring. And so I did. And we won that election in 2012 and in 2013 we were sworn in on the house floor. My beautiful wife Heather, my hope, my Bella and my Abby. That was the first day I ever stepped onto the house floor to imagine the dream I once had peering through the aneurium glass of what it would be like to serve in this body. You see friends, and I mean that when I say friends, all of you. Whether we have differing opinions, whether we have different religions, whether we have different values, we come from different backgrounds. I view every one of you as a friend. And I believe that this caucus, this body is the greatest fraternity and sorority ever, ever created in the state of Georgia to serve in this house, to sit in these chairs, to represent the people from our districts is the highest honor of my professional career. And I mean that. The relationships that we build over donuts and coffee, little pigly, wiggly sausages or whatever is made in that stuff in there I have partake enough. But the conversations that happens over those snacks is things that has helped shape my views, changed my views on a few things. It's made me more apologetic of why I believe what I believe. And so my time here in the legislature has been filled with moments, moments that I will take with me and I will cherish every day going forward. To see it was made possible because the next picture was something that 20 something years later. Every piece of legislation that I ever worked on was supported by that man right there. He enabled me, he encouraged me from that one chance meeting in Carrollton. And then to stand right there with him that was after the firefighter legislation that we all supported and that changed the lives of firefighters throughout this state. It would not have been made possible had that gentleman not came to me and said we're going to get this done. We're going to make this happen. I didn't know that 20 years later we'd be standing almost in the same pose in this chamber, almost 30 years after peering through the window of the Annie Room. The next photo is two people that made it happen. That is my father, Michael Gravley, senior and my mother, Susan Gravley, who went on to be with her Lord and Savior two years ago. You see, they gave up dreams and aspirations and goals to make sure that my sister and I could fulfill and pursue our own dreams and goals. Their dedication, their ability to get up on Saturday mornings and walk in parades to wear my t-shirts to question why did you have this slogan on there? But they never wavered carrying my banners, offering me encouragement. My mother used to always ask me after reading the Mary of the Daily Journal, how was Senator Isaac a sisson? And I said who? She never could pronounce Isaacson, but she always wanted to know. She was one of my biggest cheerleaders. She was one that stood by me just as my father does today. The next photo is where I'm going. You see, I realize that it's not giving up on their dreams to help me to pursue my own. As a father, I now realize what my dad and mother did back then, that their dreams became the fulfillment of their children's dreams. And so my beautiful family, my lovely wife, Heather, who has been my biggest fan, who has kept me humble when the letters would come in the mail. My first guy elected, we all get him. And she was standing at the mailbox one day and she said they misspelled ornary. Let me see that. That says honorable. And she let me know immediately that this things were not going to change around the house. But those are my beautiful girls, all four of them. My wife, Heather, my daughter, hope Elizabeth, my Annabella faith, and my Abbey Jane. You see, coaching is my dream. But I want to talk to you a little bit about the moments that have helped shape this gentleman. I love a good laugh. All of you know that. I love to jostle and joke. And then I met Todd Jones, who came to me upon his election and he said, mentor, you've been assigned my mentor. I didn't know what that meant. And I said, well, you've been assigned. And so I thought, well, I'll schedule some time. We'll come by and talk in the office. And I'll mentor you. And so I sat down and I said, here's, you want to file a bill? You want to go to the clerk's office. Here's what a conference committee is. Third floor, when the bell rings, we need to be in our seat, stuff like that. I said, do you have any questions for me? He said, yes, I do. He says, are we working on any policy that would integrate fourth generation autonomous vehicles, kind of like they do in Western Europe? Or rather, it'd be the Pythagorean theorem and how it relates to quantum physics. And I remember thinking, what do you say to something like that? I think I might have just uttered back to him, may the force be with you. As I was headed back from the L.O.B. to the Speaker's office to say I've mentored this gentleman, I was thinking in my head, the people of Forsyth County have elected Obi-Wan Kenobi to be their legislator. Whether it be Bruce Williamson, I love you, Bruce. Bruce Williamson and I sat right there and we would all, you know, they come around and they take pictures. And we had a great picture. Matter of fact, it was so good. It was just one of those posed pictures looking at Bruce and I doing our work at our desk and he said, that was such a good picture. I'm going to use that in a maylor. And then after the campaign season went up, he came back to me in the office, he said, I could kill you. I said, why is that? He said, because your can of Copenhagen was sitting in that picture. And I got some calls from some old ladies, they said, we didn't know you did tobacco like that. And then he said, some other guys called and said, man, I might vote for you now. It's those moments. Sam Watson, when he presented his first bill, had one of the greatest comebacks to now leader Beverly, dealing with Black Angus. I'll let you go and watch that video in the archives. I want it. It's true you should do it. One of the greatest comebacks in the history of comebacks. As I imagine my time here, we have such a wonderful staff in the speaker's office. And that takes care of us that ensures that we look good to our districts. Communicates with our constituents, writes our letters, answers our phone calls. I want to thank the speaker staff. I want to thank all of our admins, those are legislative assistants. I thought I'd start thinking about the clerk's office. I want to thank our clerk. Imagine how smoothly it runs in here. Imagine for one second, for one day that Tyler Paul Smith was our clerk. I want you all to think about that for just a second. I want to also, on a serious note, I want to think about some of the legislation that we're still working through. And I want to thank everyone in this room. I truly mean that for all of the work on cannabis oil. You all took a step forward in faith. Some of you very cautiously, some of you at first weren't willing. And I understand that. I want to thank Representative Allen Peek for all the mentorship and leadership he gave to me as a freshman that year. I hope you all will continue the fight because there are people in this state that need medicine. And I know you will do it. And I know the leadership of this house is committed to helping the people of this state. And that regard, I know that both parties, both the Republicans and the Democrats, take this. This is an issue that transcends bipartisan politics. And it's fun when we get to work on things like that. I want to thank the Atlanta Road or the Atlanta Avenue Caucus. Marcus Weedower, Stephen Sains, Bill Yeard, Matt Barton, Heath Clark, Martin Mom to Hand, and Joseph Gullet, and Houston Gaines. You know, I really understood the meaning of it takes a village when we would get up and we would get Houston dressed. Sometimes Marcus would be cooking breakfast for him. I would be walking around in the living room to get him ready. We would do that first day of session photo with him and his briefcase. Those are the good times I'm going to remember. Fatherhood is very special. I want to thank Dale Washburn. When I went down to Robert Dickie's annual peach event down in Missella, I met Dale Washburn and Danny Mathis. And I knew after leaving that event, anytime my back etched or it hurt, if I would stand next to Dale 45 minutes later, I could walk away. Thank you, Dale. I really did appreciate that, brother. I want to thank Kim Alexander. We came in together. She represents Douglas County and I do too. We both represented Paul Ding, Republican and Democrat. A lot of times we were probably on obscenes of just about every issue, but I won't tell you. I know this rings true with all of us. I love you, Kim. We had some ardent battles, both locally in the local paper, but here down in the house. But every time I'm around, she's always looked out for me just this morning. She was calling me and said, you need to be in the governor's office by 9 o'clock. I didn't even know anything about that. But she looks out for me and I look out for her. She's a good representative of her constituents. I'm going to miss you. You're a good friend. I want to thank Jay Collins from Villa Rica. He was one of the first people local elected officials when he was the mayor of Villa Rica to come out and endorse me to believe in me. Jay, your friendship is awesome. You do a good job. I want to thank my seatmate, Penny Hauston. I got two tickets to Acapoco anytime. She is a breath of fresh air. She is a barometer on what is good, what is right. And I thank your accountability, Rob Levert, the man with every quote known to man right there at his disposal. I want to thank my leadership. It has been a true honor to serve with every one of you. And I mean that. This caucus, my caucus, thank you for electing me and allowing me to serve as your vice chairman. I truly mean that. This honor does not come without its pains, without its heartache, without its sacrifices. All of you know that. The time away from family, the constituents, Republican and Democrat. We all deal with the same issues back home. We have to serve our constituents. A lot of times we get mislabeled. We get misjudged in trying to do the right thing. People will knee jerk, reaction, say things, post things, send out things on us that are simply not true. But I encourage all of you to continue to fight the good fight. Because that's what we do down here. We fight the good fight. We do things that not every Georgian gets to do. I wish they could. I wish everyone could serve and just see what it's like. But I pray for you guys and I encourage you guys every day to continue to do that. Continue to serve. Move forward. Don't get too sidetracked on who's saying what back home. Because at the end of the day, all authority on earth is given from above. And I mean that. Dean Smirie. What an incredible. One of the ones I saw from the window that day and I never knew we would be able to work on legislation together like we have to form a partnership, a friendship. I have taken from you tons of wisdom and I appreciate the years of service that you have dedicated to this state, to your constituents, to this body, and to the members that you serve with. God bless you, my friend. The Josh McLaren. I found, you know, there's a joke, Marty Joseph and I have invited McLaren to Paulden County. He has yet to come. We're making sure that he knows he will be safe when he comes. But I want to take him dear hunting and we have not been able to do that yet. But I did find a pair of camo skinny jeans and we're going to be able to outfit Josh. I believe him in Houston are the only two men that had a beard exactly like you see it right now in the fifth grade. It has been incredible to Scott Holcomb and Spencer Fry to my brothers. I love you guys. A lot of times we go back home and we pontificate and we adhere to the direction often times of our local parties. But they don't understand the relationships that are formed down here that seize past certain disagreements, certain opinions and that we can honestly enjoy the fellowship of each other's families and ask each other how are you doing, how's your wife, how's your children, how's your husband doing. We pray for each other when we have loss. We lift each other up when we're going through difficult times. I love you guys. My West Georgia Caucus, Matthew Gamble, Mitchell Skoggins, Drake Kelly, Martin and Joseph. I pray that Vic Reynolds never sees the text thread that all of you have put me on. But I love you guys and I appreciate your brother, your brother. They don't know what I'm saying and I'll never remember to delete everything. As I close, I want to say this, I want y'all to, before I read this last part, my beautiful wife and children and my father are here with us today to recognize the dream that I had on the other side of that any room. And they're right here in the corner, if y'all will stand and give them a applause. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman Jasper's, if you'll take care of my family in Hinton, Georgia, in Talking Rock, Georgia. And I will close with this. I want to thank the members of the Georgia Child Lawyers Association for allowing me to do this while I was on their watch. I appreciate their advocacy, Dan and Caroline and John Jordan, Jason. Thank you so much for your love and your friendship. I am the son of Michael and Susan Gravley. I am the brother of Amanda. I am the grandson of William Boyd and Vessie Jane Gravley. I am the grandson of Marjorie and Benny Hopkins. I am the husband of Heather Gravley. And I am the father of three beautiful gifts, Hope, Bella and Abby. For ten years I've been the state representative for House District 67 and to my constituents, the citizens that represent that district. Thank you. Thank you for your love and support. Thank you for allowing me to be your voice. Thank you for allowing me to be in this house. Tomardy and Joseph, thank you for being the brothers I never had. You are indeed two men that I would leave my life to, that I will leave my county to for direction and protection. And I love you both. When I started I will start as I began. Every campaign season I would drive around my district, 67 and I would read the 67th Psalm. God be merciful unto us and bless us and calls his face to shine upon us. That thy way may be known upon the earth, that saving help among all nations. Let the people praise the oh God, let the people praise thee. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth. Let the people praise the oh God, let the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase, and God, even our own God, shall bless us. Lord shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being my friend. Thank you for making the past ten years a wonderful endeavor. Mr. Speaker, thank you for your leadership and friendship. You are indeed my brother. As I close, go forth, conquer and be good stewards of the people you represent. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you We really do need to get on. We got a long calendar. I want to give you the heads up that Winford Duke is going to come to you because I told him that he couldn't do a speech on Monday. Okay. He didn't want to run you for hire off the house. No. We're going to the rules calendar. Clark will read the caption to Senate Bill 116. Senate Bill 116 by Senator Robertson of the 29th. Anderson the 24th. And it will arc day 31st and others to be a total act to amend Article 1 and Chapter 5 of Title 49. The fish go to George annotated relating to children and youth services. So provide your registration of maternity supportive housing residences to provide housing for pregnant women. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Health and Human Services. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Cooper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring you Senate Bill 116. I mean, it is the maternity supporting housing bill. As we've talked in this chamber over the years about how to reduce abortions, I've always said, when we do that, we need to make sure that we take care of those prospective mothers. And many of them do not have the adequate care and resources to get the kind of care they should through the pregnancy process and then to reestablish themselves after the pregnancy. This would allow nonprofits, churches and groups to establish homes for mothers over the age of 18, which is an area of great need because there are places, some places for those mothers that are under 18. But for mothers over 18, all who already have children, they would have to register with their county, they would have to have written policies and procedures, they would have to comply with the residential building codes, show property insurance coverage, and also show the ability to be able to work either directly or through partnerships with local nonprofits, governments, agencies, or other programs to provide wraparound services. The one thing they do not, or will not provide, are medical services. If there's no questions, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the House's favourable vote and I will yield the well. You have a question if you care to yield. I will take a question, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? I will and I apologize I didn't get to you before. This is something that these homes are things that are happening already with nonprofit groups. Am I correct about that? They're probably, but I think the problem is that counties they have need a special kind of a license and they meet some kind of regulations to be able to function. Does the lady further yield? I will. That's what I'm trying to figure out. My understanding is that there are certain nonprofits or even informal groups that are trying to do this and that I thought perhaps the reason behind Senate Bill 116 was to bring some oversight, but I don't see any oversight and so I was just wondering if you could speak to that. Well, there is oversight and when they begin to have to register, they have to produce the four things that I mentioned before the county would issue them a certificate which would be done on a yearly basis. And the other thing, that was a concern of mine, representative. Abrams says that there was not a specific department or other, but what I found out is that defects can come in at any time to check on them and that a local DA or the police could come in and check on them any time in case there was child abuse or problems. So there is already in our law oversight of these facilities. I think for just one more. Sure. Just as a point of understanding. Is there anything formal in there and that's all right that happens a lot. Is there anything formal in the bill that would have regular inspections or reports or anything like that? No, that's one of the things that is missing. But you know, sometimes government just gets in the way. And one of those things would be like if you had regular inspections, then they would have to meet certain kitchen regulations to be able to have food in the home. And this is being run by nonprofits and you know, they may be and it's like more of a family atmosphere where you know, some nonprofit provides the food on Monday. Another one provides the food on Tuesday. And so they don't have to meet the regulations that go around that we normally as a government entity puts on other places. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable support. The city has yielded the well. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise in opposition to this bill. This bill establishes a new definition for a maternity supporting housing residences in Title 49 of the Georgia code. And it specifically amends Chapter 5. The title of Chapter 5 is programs and protections for children and youth. So I want to focus on that word protection because unfortunately the implementation of this bill would actually strip protections. This bill requires registration of these maternity supporting housing residences, but it specifically stops or prevents oversight by the department where in lines 41 through 44, it specifically says the department shall not. The department shall not have the authority to implement rules and regulations of the registration of these maternity supporting housing residences. That means the department does not have the authority to implement rules that could prevent things like child abuse or the reporting of child abuse. It cannot or it shall not have the authority to implement rules that might protect pregnant or postpartum mothers, their newborns and their other children, and make sure that they have access to health care and educational services. Also, the department shall not have the authority to make sure that the people who are coming to these residences, the people who are within these residences that might work in these residences to make sure that they are not doing predatory behaviors. The department shall not have the authority to have oversight over the different ages that can room together so you can have multiple families and their children can also be in there. And there is really no oversight over how the different families might intermingle and predatory behavior that might come as a result of this. Overall, this is a bad bill that strips protection. This is not and this is in a code that is that is called programs and protections for children and youth. This bill is missing something very important. We must protect our children. This bill does not do that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield a little. Chair recognizes representative Gilligan to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I want to say that I stand in support of Senate Bill 116. I would love for everyone in this chamber to understand why there is a need. Imagine that you are a young mother who is fleeing a relationship where you are in danger and your minor children are in danger. You have nowhere to go. Here in Forsyth County we are hoping to open up our home here called Living Hope. And the reason that there is a gap is right now in our laws, if you're between the age of 18 and 20 and you are not aging out of foster care, you're not eligible to come to this home. Can we see the next picture? Thank you. This is this is the home that we have in Forsyth County. It has three bedrooms. We can serve women and their minor children. The more minor children who come in, the fewer moms that we can accept because we're not housing one mom's children with another mom's children. So if I were this young mother and I had two children, I might be able to occupy one of the bedrooms in this home. And I can occupy this room until my unborn child has been born and 18 months afterward. We're providing services to this young mom. The next picture will show where these moms would be able to congregate with their families. The next one shows where they could eat together as a family unit. And then finally we ask and place up here that everyone who enters this home would be blessed and everyone who exits this home would be blessed. We have stepped out in faith in Forsyth County that you see the same need that we see for these in the gap 18 to 20 who currently could not be served in this home. And we are asking for your favorable support and thank you very much. I yield the well. Chair recognizes chairman sets for to speak to the bill. Listen, gentlemen, how some disappointed there's opposition to this, but people have a right of their perspective. HB116 does one very simple thing. Senate bill 116 simply deregulates kindness. It deregulates kindness. Today, under our current framework, to provide a place for a young pregnant mom to live, essentially for free, requires cash reserves, requires 24 hours staffing. I think I had a lady in South Georgia in Savannah that wants to do this, but says they've got to maintain one year annual cash reserves on hand to be able to open and do what they do. They've got to have around the clock oversight. They've got to meet commercial building goes just a lot that's in place to prevent churches, nonprofits and people for opening their homes to folks who are in need. HB116 doesn't deal with minors. Minors that are kept and looked after don't apply this bill. This is for people 18 years of age and older and deregulates the process of kindly giving a place for pregnant moms and perhaps their small children to live. That's what it does. The reason is how Senate bill 116 simply deregulates kindness. There's a registration process. You pay $250 a year. So at least these entities are known about and they meet certain basic requirements, but it really does nothing more than allow Georgians and nonprofits to exhibit what we know is the fruits of the spirit love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, gentleness and self-control. And with that ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote for SB116 and help us deregulate kindness so we can care for those in need. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Mary Francis Williams rise Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker is it not true that the Department of Human Services in Georgia already has second chance maternity homes which are licensed and regulated. If the lady so states I believe that is true and further further problem in inquiry please state your inquiry. Is it further not true that over the years there have been many attempts to provide homes for children and now pregnant women in situations that are unregulated and unlicensed. And one of the main arguments has been that these are done these are funded by churches and are in the name of love which I agree is is important but is it not true that even the best of churches can even the best of churches with the best of intentions should provide. Regulated and licensed care to vulnerable pregnant women and infants. The lady so states have all members voted have all members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 116 the eyes of 103 the nasa 57 this bill. Having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed what purpose does chairman sets or rise make a motion Mr. Speaker. State your motion like to move that we immediately transmit SB 116 to the Senate. It's automatically happens on the final three days. So let me state that again you do not have to move for immediate transmit from here till the end. What purpose does chairman Richard Smith of the rules committee rise. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I move that Senate bill 352 be recommitted to rules. Chairman Smith has moved the Senate bill 352 be recommitted to the rules committee the clerk will read the caption. Senate bill 352 senator to tops the 14th albors 56th of the 52nd and others to be titled knack to amend chapter 1443 the fish go to George Antigua late the general provisions of professions of businesses. So as to revive for the issuance of expedited licenses by endorsement. On the motion of the chairman of the rules committee that Senate bill 352 be recommitted to the rules committee is their objection chair here's not and it is so ordered. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 539. I'm sorry Senate bill 576. Senate bill 576 by senator Strickland of the 17th be entitled knack to amend code section 1977 three of the fiscal to George annotated relating actions by grandparents or other family members for visitation rights or intervention. Revocation or amendment of visitation rights. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes chairman dicky to explain the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A lot of people asked many students especially how to bills get started up in this chamber. And this is a perfect example. I got a phone call not many days after we. I finally died last year from a couple in my community that I knew that I actually went to high school, grammar school with the.

with the grandparents and their son had been tragically killed in automobile a couple of years before and had two young children and the widow had remarried and it moved away with the two grandchildren and was refusing to allow these two grandparents any visitation rights to see their two grandchildren that they had had a relationship with and it was just broke my heart because these were two good solid citizens in my community and the young young widow did get remarried and they actually adopted these two children so things were going well but at some point they just refused to allow any contact whatsoever with these fine grandparents that live in my community no phone call no meal together no just coming to see them absolutely no contact and so ask me what I could do to help so I got in contact with a local attorney that I knew in Roburta and looked into it and said it's really nothing you can do they don't have any legal right to any visitation contact with those two children I call lead counsel same thing and I call Mary Margaret Oliver at which I knew it was told that she'd had a lot of history with this and we can concurred and and she gave me all the legal things and the history and she's gonna speak to this in a moment because I don't have a legal background to do that but but somehow these two parents we got in touch with with Senator Strickland and he'd had some other cases I think or it seems similar situation and crafted this bill that that gives these grandparents a right to petition the court to have visitation rights doesn't don't give them guarantee I don't think but it gives them the right to petition the court if the appropriate situation is there and Senator Strickland has got it through the Senate and it's over here it's just something that's I was told the chairman matters also worked on this bill when he was here so I'm I'm gonna yield Mr. Speaker to Mary Margaret Ovela who's got a lot of history in this matter and if she could come now and speak to this bill as well thank you gentlemen as yielded the well the chair recognizes chairman Oliver to speak to the bill thank you Mr. Speaker and also want to thank Senator Strickland and Chairman Dickie for their attention to this very complex and compelling and heartbreaking issue the United States Supreme Court and the Georgia Supreme Court in multiple times has crafted a very narrow opportunity for the Spirit Court judge to make a decision that a grand set of grandparents may visit with their grandchildren over the objection of the apparent many of these cases come forward to the court tragically based on the death of one of the parents and the new life of the surviving parent frequently imp to harm the children in a way that harms the children will put a barrier between the grandchildren and the grandparents the way this bill has been drafted is to assist the court with some guidelines on that narrow circumstance where the grandparent may be awarded a right to see their grandchildren where the parents have objected and the court will override that objection where there is harm to the children to do so it's a long set of cases it's compelling based on heartbreaking facts and I'm very grateful that this bill is coming forward and happy to answer any questions if anybody has any thank you mr.
