Would you please stand for a pleasure to lead us to our flag. I would like to introduce the flag that I can take from America. Consider a privilege for which it stands for one nation under God in the middle of the war. Now the Georgia flag. Good morning, colleagues. I am simply delighted this morning to introduce our chaplain for the day. He is Reverend Anthony Motley, senior pastor of the Lensers Street Baptist Church right here at Atlanta, Georgia. Pastor Motley was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. He was educated in Cincinnati, Ohio. And after graduating from high school, he started his college career at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. And then received a bachelor's degree from Morehouse College. Reverend Motley comes from a deeply religious family from whom the Lord has called many ministers. He received Christ at the age of eight and was called into the ministry when he was 18 years of age. And he has fathered the late doctor, D.L. Motley's senior, the renowned and respected pastor, the emeritus of the Peace Baptist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio, licensed and ordained him. Reverend Motley has served several churches and he is deeply involved in the community engagement that seeks to improve the conditions of the socially and economically oppressed and the spiritually impoverished among us. He is active with many local and global organizations which include the Concerned Black Clurging, past president of the new Air or State Convention of Georgia, progressive national convention. The American Baptist Convention, the past president of the Atlanta Baptist Ministers Union, board member of the Van City Housing Ministry and chairman of the English Avenue Community Development Corporation. That's one of the things I like about Dr. Motley is that he is engaged. He is the father of one daughter, Shanei and the proud grandfather to one granddaughter, Sinai. And Sinai is a page for us today representing all-Bened Georgia from the senator from the 12th. So it is my pleasure to present today Reverend Anthony Motley. Good afternoon to Governor, president, Bert Jones and president pro-temporary, John Kennedy, majority leader Steve Gooch, minority leader Gloria Butler, Black Caucus and other caucus chairpersons, my marvelous host, the Pratt of Clayton County, Senator Gail Davenport. Senators who represent every city and the 109, 59 counties of the state of Georgia, my wonderful daughter of whom I'm so proud who sitting in the balcony, CEO of United Way Albany, Georgia, offering exemplary leadership across 13 counties, statewide, my daughter, and especially my granddaughter, Sinai, who is a page today in the sacred walls and halls of these congressional chambers. My wife Karen, who had to administer tests today to her students at North Clayton High School, could not be with us. The love tie, the love tie, the love tie, that's what I want to just share for a few moments with you, the love tie. Let's find in the book of John 13th chapter, 31st verse, and it says this, by this everyone will know that you are my disciples. If you love one another, by this everyone will know that you are my disciples. If you love one another, both the Revised Standard and International Virgin Jews, that same phraseology. The Reverend Albert Love, who's known in civil rights circles, called Love the Trademark of a Christian. Love is the, love is the centerpiece of our faith. It's, it's at the very heart of what it means to not just say we are, but to demonstrate through word and works. That we are followers of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. The death of our Savior died. His death is intimately tied, his death, our Savior's death, is intimately and directly tied to the life of love that he lived. Bishop Michael Curry, he got it, he got that. The Apostle Paul in that 13th chapter, 1 Corinthians, he expressed it and John faucet back in 1792 was captured by it. By God's love for us. I love for him and I love for one another in this beautiful well-known petition, this closing hymn of prayer and praise to our God as many of us know it. But it's traditionally saying at the end of sanctuary worship and churches across denominational lines. Right before the benediction or the final blessing, bless, be the tie that binds our hearts in Christ-like love. The fellowship of kindred minds is like that above before our father's throne. We pour our ardent prayers, our fears, our hopes, our aims, our one, our comforts and our cares. It's a praise prayer. A prayer praise or a prayer and a praise to our loving God to bless the love tie. Bless the love tie. The love that binds us, connects, protects and directs all of our collective, all of us collectively in a symphony of synchronized service to our God. That's what it does. The prayer is for God to bless that love, that love that flows from heart to heart and breast to breast, that love that transforms wrong to right and the low road into the high road. The prayer is for God to strengthen it, that love, deepen it, broaden it, heighten it, favor it. But what does that love tie our hearts to? Well, God's love ties and binds our hearts in Christ-like love to a common humanity. We share it. Whether we like it or not, like it or not, we are stuck with each other. We are sisters and brothers. Some of us have siblings that we don't necessarily care to own, but we are stuck with them. Our nation made up of persons who bring a variety of colors and cultures and countries that are scattered across the American landscape, but all made in the image and likeness of God. Captain George Fatcher, Balch, captures that glorious reality in his words, our pleasure legions. We just said it to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice, not for some, but for all. That great vision of Dr. King's beloved community, the writer of the revelation of Jesus to John, a prisoner on Pat Masala describes the heavenly kingdom in similar language when he says, and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. And I saw a number that no man or woman could number coming up out of every nation and culture and creed and color and race and ethnicity and village and Hamlet. The idea of America appears to foreshatter King Jesus himself and the extending of his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven, the common humanity where God blew into Adam's nostrils the breadth of life and only at that moment did he become a living soul. With this colorful but common humanity, the first epistle of John raises the question, how can we say we love God, whom we've never seen and hate our brothers and our sisters, senatorial, congressional, Georgian, intercontinental, international brothers and sisters who we see every day. No matter the differences, my friends, we possess and express our repress, our depress, we share a common humanity. We also share and petition God to bless the love tie that binds us to a common home. The earth is the Lord and the fullness of the world and the day that dwell there in. We are created. We are living creatures from earth, far earth to dwell on the face of the earth. It's a common home we humans all share. We are all occupants of planet earth and we are responsible for the care and upkeep of it. We all hail from some place of origin on planet earth. Whether it's Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, South America, this is our home. Heaven is God's home earth is his footstool. The Bible says, but earth is at the very least our temporary home and when we leave it over our remains some preacher will say earth to earth. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Looking for the general resurrection and in loving obedience to the loving Lord of creation we must heal the earth as good stewards and caretakers of what belongs to that one and the same creator. Dr. King said, we are tied together in a single garment of destiny, code and an inescapable network of mutuality and whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. And then finally we share in this earthly home of ours human hearts that are common to us all. That binds and unifies and dignifies and glorifies our hearts in Christ like love. The fellowship of Kendrick minds is like to that above the songwriter says it like this. We are all to be kept by Jesus, kept by the power of God, kept from the world unspotting, treading where Jesus trod, old to love each other like Christ loved us then loves us now and will continue loving us throughout eternity. And we are all to be kept by Jesus, though I majestically and eloquently and floridly speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not loved. I am but a sounding brass tinkling symbol and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and give my body to be burned and have not loved I am nothing. Uses will fail, tongues will cease, knowledge will pass away Paul says for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known and now I did faith hope loves these three. Not all the rest but the greatest of these is love. God bless you as we bow father. For all that you do for us have done and will do we give you thanks for these men and women capable able who conduct your business for the benefit and the redemption and the extending of quality life to citizens of Georgia we give you thank bless them and bless the love time. The love ties the ties that bind their hearts in Christian love so that the fellowship of their kindred minds will be like to that above and. Bless. Men and women boys and girls across this state as instruments of your service in the name of your son and I save you Jesus Christ we pray and ask at all family of God people of God across religious lives say amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well it's good to be with you pastor thank you for those encouraging words obviously I agree 100% but one of the things that kept ringing in my head obviously we live in a fallen world and Jesus said if you love me you will obey my commands and that ring in my head over and over as I was sitting there so maybe I'm getting a message here this morning but pastor thank you and love to have you come to the doctor. I'm going to have you come to the United States Congress and explain love to to the to the House of Representatives a little bit but I have I'm now serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and their committee on education workforce. I'm working hard in fighting for the policies to stabilize our economy support our farmers and help create economic opportunities for all March is going to be return America to energy dominance again month. We we pass through committee over 20 energy bills the last two weeks and all of those are coming to the floor the House is going speak with a clear voice to the administration that we must have a holistic all in energy posture in this country to maintain our economic freedom. Always grateful for your hard work you know folks and colleagues in Congress particularly from California New York what do you all got going on down there in Georgia and I said I tell you this if you own electric car you can have come to Georgia to charge it. We're going to open up plant Vogue will three and four which is a great lesson in perseverance as far as a business and so they're cutting his concern but yeah it this state has has tremendous leadership tremendous representation and that's why we are the best state to do business in I think now nine years in a row so and that takes great leadership and I want to commend you for what you're doing there please be sure you don't. Please be sure to utilize our office at any time for constituent services I know there's overlap and things like that I didn't guess one thing about this position I had no I had no idea that so many people had a problem with the federal government mainly Social Security RS and the Veterans Administration but brinsley and her team do a tremendous job with that and we're there to serve you it's a privilege to serve you and it's a privilege to be with you today I wish you all the best I know. It's your end of throws here of a rap in this thing up and I want to commend you for a balanced budget we're going to a undisclosed location for three days Sunday Monday and Tuesday to try to get our conference to agree on a budget that will bounce in less than ten years. Thank you. Then what we got to do is get the Senate to buy into it but we have no choice folks we're beyond that point there has to be some sanity as far as physical policy is concerned in Washington. We been through it tough time covid was tough we had to do some.

things to get through that but getting back to business, making just the energy dominant again, bringing down the cost of doing business and opening America for business again. Thank you so much. All right. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any unanimous concerns? Chair, here's none. Does any senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? Recognize senator from the 35th. Thank you, Mr. President. I like to recognize the South Fulton Chamber Commerce for the whole region that's here today. We stand. And also, we have our young children, the children's day. And so we have students from West Lake High School, from in South Fulton, and from our churches in Augusta, Georgia. Will you please all stand? Everybody who is with us for today. Thank you very much for being here. Let's give them a warm Senate welcome. Thank you. Take care. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I recognize a senator from the 28th, from a point of personal privilege. Good morning, Mr. President. I rise today to recognize March 16th as our nurses day here at the state Capitol. I see we have a few nurses up there. Your wave, everybody. Congratulations, nurses. We have 170,000 registered nurses in the state of Georgia, which is our largest health care profession. And as we all know, they're vital to the medical well-being of all our citizens. So we appreciate your nurses. Of course, I have a special love for nurses as I go home to one every night. So we appreciate y'all and all that you do to keep us safe. Thank you, and I yield the well. Thank you. I jumped ahead a little bit and forgot about our doctor of the day with all the extra guests we had. But we have a very special doctor of the day today. The senator from the 15th, the dean of the Senate, has his daughter here today. Dr. Harvinson. Yeah, let's give her a round of applause. And I told her she was way too good looking to be the dean's daughter. But I could tell after talking to her that he raised her right. He raised her right. So she's a pleasure to have her down here. And I just call on her father and the dean of the Senate to introduce her special doctor of today. Thank you, Ms. President. I am very, very honored to be here today to introduce this young lady who has really, really made her mark in the hearts of our family. She is a wonderful, wonderful person. She is a good person. She is a good cook. She takes care of a family. And she will do one thing that we should do. She will get your fat. If you come visit, I'm sure she is a very hospitable kind of person. She likes people. She is outgoing. And you can just see it. And when she meets people, she meets them very well. And you may refer to my son, Edward. I tell you, I wonder about that. But he got lucky and married. This wonderful, Kristen Young lady who is, does not mind praising God every chance she gets. So I'm just honored to be here today to introduce you to my daughter-in-law, Komisia Fair Harbison, the doctor of the day. Thank you all. Thank you so much. This is an awesome opportunity to come. So many of you have expressed your sentiment of just love and admiration for my dad. I want to let you know he is the exact same way at home. He is that loving. He is that kind and personable. And I feel thoroughly blessed. I'm so thankful also just to be here to serve today. Certainly if you need me, I'm there. And this morning they had us a little busy too. And I just want to just, Georgia is a great place to do business. I'm looking forward to when Georgia is a great place to take care of the health of its constituent. And that that becomes also the agenda as well. Just to put that plug in there for us too. And because we're not only underserved in the rural areas, but I challenge each of you. If you tried to make a doctor's appointment today, how long would it take for you to get in? The likelihood that you could be even seen in the week is very low. And it's because we need doctors and providers here in Georgia. And so the work that you do here, it definitely, it's resounding. And it makes Georgia a place where providers want to come and they want to live and they want to serve. So I thank you all for this opportunity. Thank you so much for the work that you do. Thank you. I recognize Senator from the 30 second for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Happy John Bullock day to you all. You have a one-pager on your desk from Kennesaw State University. And just a few things I wanted to highlight. KSU believe it or not is Georgia's third largest university and they have 43,000 plus students. They're recognized for research and for their STEM programs. And they are doubling the size of their nursing program in order to help us with our workforce needs in Georgia. But what I also want to tell you is on the back of that one-pager is the March Madness bracket. And as you know, Kennesaw State is in the big dance this year and their first game, the first of many, I hope, is March 17th. And they'll be playing Xavier. So it's going to be hard to decide whether to wear green on St. Patrick's Day or to wear yellow and black. But I hope that all of you all will join me in saying, go owls. Thank you all. You'll do well. Senator from Seventh. Thank you, Mr. President. Two years ago today, eight people were shot to death and spas across Fulton and Cherokee County. Six of them were Asian women. And today we grieve their loss with their families and loved ones. It should not be the case that we have to grieve their loss. They should be alive today. Hate crimes against the AAPI community is on the rise. And since March of 2020, there have been 11,500 hate incidents recorded. Now, I'm the third Asian person to be elected to the State Senate. I am currently the only Asian woman with my colleague, Senator Rahman, who is the first Asian man to be elected to this body. And today we have the largest AAPI caucus in the continental United States. And I'm very proud of that because for a long time, the AAPI community has been taken for granted. And I want folks to know that we will continue and will always fight for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. And may this body continue to fight against hate crimes? May the Senate body continue to fight against violence against women? And may this body pass legislation that will help curb the violence from what we have from gun violence? And so, Mr. President, I would like to ask for a moment of silence to honor the lives that we lost today and their loved ones. Senator's asked for a moment of silence. Hey, man. Thank you, Senator. Are you all the well? We're going to ask the Senator from the fifth for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Today is a Muslim at Vocacy Day here at the Capitol. This is an initiative of coalition of nonprofit organizations, faith committees, and leaders who wish to encourage civic engagement among the Georgia Muslim American community. So I'd like to welcome all the young folks today outside the rope or around the Capitol. Thank you for coming in and visiting us. That's one thing. Thank you. One more announcement real quick once I'm here. Colleagues, the Georgia's legislative sportsmen caucuses we have meeting on Monday, the fifth, at the storage range in guns and from 5 to 8 o'clock. So please be there. Join us 5 to 8 tomorrow Monday for the Georgia legislative sportsmen caucuses meeting. Thank you. Appreciate it. I yield the world. Does any other Senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege? You have Senator, do you wish rise on or do you? You have a before you consent calendar of privilege resolutions. Does any senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Senator, is that what you're standing for or you just you wave? All right, we'll do that right here. If the chair here is no objection, the resolution on the consent calendar is adopted. Senator from the 36, you welcome to rise on a point of personal privilege. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to take a moment to share with you some thoughts on Senate Bill 160, which has been sent back to us by the House with some lamentable action that they took over there that criminalizes doctors. One of the earliest texts I got today was from my pastor asking me to please stand up for trans kids and their families. Reminding me of the deadly statistics that in significant numbers, young people that are facing that decision of transitioning, that have found themselves to be trans are in the high numbers of committing suicide in their teenage years. And she pointed out to me, this is my pastor, she pointed out to me lovingly that it's not because they're a trans kid that they have thoughts of suicide and taking their own lives. It's because of experiencing that condemnation and that marginalization and that rejection that all too often society sins to trans kids and trans people. And she urged me to not remain silent, she urged me to speak out, she urged me to be a vote against this bill. And in fact, my congregation is participating in a candlelight vigil scheduled outside the Capitol Monday afternoon at four o'clock. So I take the well briefly to, as she asked me to do, to repeat some of the very solemn and staggering set of statistics that you've already heard about. Felicoccus members have made very moving comments about Senate Bill 140 from the floor and from their desks. The facts are there, their stark. Yesterday was a suicide prevention day here at the Capitol. I could not help but think that here we are witnessing people either through, well I'm just not quite sure why people decide to join cultural wars. They have different reasons. But working against the facts, denying the facts that have been presented by the medical community and pursuing this bill I think is could be one of the most unwise steps that we take. So I appreciate my pastor contacting me this morning and I appreciate your listening to my concerns today and hope we can be of of a one accord on rejecting this bill. Thank you. Does any other Senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? Are there any motions to withdraw or and commit? Here you none. You have before you a consent calendar of local bills. Mr. Secretary, have any objections been filed to any of the bills on the local consent calendar? Mr. President, no objections have been filed. Is there a agreement?
