TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to focus now on Georgia's
foster care system and how to improve
it, some possibilities. Joining us is
Republican Senator K. Kirkpatre of
Marietta. She's a former physician.
She's chair of the Senate Children and
Families Committee and vice chair of
Health and Human Services. Welcome to
Lawmakers. We got a lot to discuss here
because we really is a crisis in the
foster care system, isn't it? There's
always been a crisis and it's
continuing, but we are working hard on
making progress and we have been for the
last few years since the Children and
Families Committee was created in 2023.
Uh, Lieutenant Governor Jones was behind
that and I'm honored to be the chair of
that committee. We've also had three
study committees already and we've got
another one coming up.
>> There's so much to look into. I talked
to you in November about the work on the
bipartisan Senate study committee that
chair that you chaired that reviewed
resources for children who age out of
foster care. And one of those gaps you
found is with enrolling them in school
when they were young. Talk about that
one.
>> Um it's not so much when they were
young, it's anytime they change their
placement and change their school,
they're supposed to be immediately
enrolled.
And as a sort of an unintended
consequence of the school safety bill
that we passed, sometimes those
enrollments are delayed while the
receiving school waits for records, some
of which are not even eligible to be
released. And so, um, we've got a bill
that is coming up that will actually
insist that the school districts enroll
them right away. And uh I think that
bill is much needed because we heard
testimony from some of the kids. Some
kids lost credits. Their credits didn't
transfer in a timely way. They had to
repeat classes. We even had one young
lady who had to repeat a year because of
the delay. So we just want our school
districts to understand that foster kids
are facing challenges that other kids
don't have. And that was one of the many
things that we covered in that
committee.
>> Yeah. Now, I know you were focusing on
the aging out, but you found that
talking to them, there were things that
happened when they were young that
affected how they aged out of the
system.
>> That's exactly right. In fact, um, one
of the things that we don't do a lot of
in the legislature is prevention work.
And as a physician, that's important to
me. And we turned up some information
that kids who are in the foster system
are six times more likely to have
autism.
And
>> wow,
>> if we know that if you diagnose and
treat those kids early, they do much
better. They have better outcomes. And
if the diagnosis are made late, and it
it's sort of a vicious cycle. It's uh
the kids have a diagnosis that hasn't
been made and they haven't had treatment
for. They then have trouble staying in
foster homes or being adopted. And
sometimes they are these kids who end up
in hotels. And so we've got a bill, it's
not my bill, Senator Tiller's bill to
try to expand a pilot that we did on
that last year and Dr. Michelle Zena is
behind that and is doing great work. So,
we're trying to gradually expand that to
all the regions in the state.
>> Explain to people who don't understand
what it means to for these kids to go
into a hotel. It's because you can't
find a foster home for them.
>> It's frequently older kids that are hard
to place. They can't go back home
because the parents can't handle them.
The foster parents can't handle them.
And some of them are full-grown
physically and have behavioral issues
that make it very difficult. And so they
h were ending up in hotels and on the
floor defects offices and would require
multiple people to be with each one of
them because of the behavioral issues.
And uh Commissioner Bro worked hard on
that when she first got into office and
uncovered this problem. And uh for a
brief time we were down from like 75
kids in hotels to zero kids in hotels.
So we're working hard to find other ways
to manage that and diagnosing and
treating those kids early that have any
kind of challenges particularly autism
is very important. Well, I know
yesterday it was your committee that you
had to talk about HB431 you just talked
about and then you also discussed SR 622
because you need another committee
because it's specifically uh you really
want to look into the rising costs of
foster care. Um we know the Department
of Human Services is projecting a
funding deficit of $85 million.
>> Yes. and that um was already a problem.
And then the government shutdown just
made delayed money coming in from the
feds that really made the issue very
acute and resulted because we balance
our budget at the state level and don't
spend money that we don't have. We ended
up um having to cut programs. I don't
say I'm saying we but it's the agency
that had to do it
>> and um there are multiple reasons why
that happened. Some of the people with
complex needs um and then there's also a
problem with getting the medical care in
a timely way that some of the kids need.
So, we decided that it needed a deeper
dive and we're going to spend a lot of
time this summer figuring out not just
how we got here, but what are solutions?
How can we fix it?
>> Yeah. And I know when you say deeper
dive, you really get into it. Uh, among
the people who spoke yesterday was
someone who uh was spent for nearly 17
years in foster care and requested that
someone like him should be on the
committee. So, let's hear from him. If
Georgia is serious about understanding
the true cost of foster care, then we
must also be intentional about listening
to the people who live those cost every
day. So, full disclosure on that, I've
known Reginald Holloway since he was a
teenager living in foster care when I
was volunteering at a place where he was
in foster care. So, how important is it
to hear from someone like Regginald
Holloway?
>> I I told him before our committee met
yesterday that he's making change. he's
going to result in a law change from the
stories that he told our foster
committee. He wasn't the only one with
lived experience that came and spoke to
us. But it is very important to hear
from people who've actually been through
experiences that uh some of which we
really don't want to hear about because
they're so awful. But um he's a very
successful young man and I'm very proud
of him. And uh yeah, the I what I spoke
to him about is it's a joint study
committee with the House, so the bills
have to exactly match and so we're going
to work with the House on how to make
that happen.
>> Yeah, he he really is a success story.
He graduated from West Georgia College
mainly um couch surfing like didn't have
a place to go. So Exactly. We really we
really are proud of him and thank you so
much for what you're doing on this in
this area of foster care.
>> There's so much more work to be done.
Okay. You've got a bill tomorrow on the
floor.
>> I do.
>> Okay.
>> I have a bill tomorrow that has to do
with unclaimed property.
>> Okay. All right. Tell tell me briefly
about it.
>> It uh we know that the state has over $3
billion of Georgia citizens money that
they're holding in the Department of
Revenue.
>> Wow.
>> And there are all kinds of problems with
getting that money back to the people
that it belongs to. So, this bill is
going to clean that up. And there will
be a lot of interest in it. I can tell.
>> I'm pretty sure their website's gonna
blow up.
>> Yeah, it will.
