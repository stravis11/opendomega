TRANSCRIPT
----------
I trust everyone had a wonderful weekend. Had a lot of powerful conversations with fellow members as we head into the home stretch. So it won't require much conversation on the floor. I get it. It's very amenable to give you a full attention to the business of this house. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Our keepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 99th House District representing Matt Rees, representative Rees. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A good morning, House colleagues. We are here this morning with two and a half weeks left and the 2023 George General Assembly and it's my pleasure to introduce to you Father Jack Durkin of Catholic Church of St. Monica in my district in the spirit of true confession. I am not a Catholic. I go to church slightly outside of my district in Representative Hilton in House District and before that went to a great church in Duluth, represented by Representative Marin and Roman, perimeter church and Duluth First Nine Methodist Church. In order to avoid a chaplain residency challenge, I invited a pastor from the middle of my district, from the heart of my district, Father Jack Durkin. St. Monica's Catholic Church opened about the same time that Peach Tree Ridge, high school opened about 20 years ago and they've been faithful in service to our community for the past two decades. On Friday night, they had a fish fry and were doing stations of the cross to get ready for Easter. They minister at home with St. Vincent DePaul, ministry to the needy. They minister abroad in Haiti on the mission field and they do a great job proclaiming the fate, serving those in need and looking after people and people's dignity every day. Father Jack Durkin was a teacher and coach in Athens and Macon before he went in the priesthood. He's been a priest nearly a quarter of a century. For basketball fans out there, he went to Chapel Hill and Wake Forest and he is here today to speak to matters of the heart. Father Jack Durkin. So we'll just say a prayer this morning. Thank you for inviting me today. In the name of the Father and of the Son of the Holy Spirit, amen. And dear Father, you crafted each of us in our mother's womb in your sacred image to come to know the truth that frees us for abundant life and fruitful love. As one God you are ever holy and good and as Father's Son and Holy Spirit, you are eternal love. For love's sake you created angelic and human persons so that they would choose the happiness you desire for each of them, each of us. The happiness of Holy Communion that we call heaven, the destination Father that you prepared an eternity for each person in history, we humbly acknowledge that we have not always worked for Holy Communion, that we have sinned in Son Division, that we have abused our freedom in seeking what we want rather than exercising our freedom in doing what you will. Your will is not for partisanship but for partnership, not for taking from others for myself but giving myself for others, not for blaming and canceling others but for helping and cooperating with others. Father, by your grace frees us from sin and error, then set us together upon the common foundation of objective truth, upon the natural law written into the hearts of all citizens of good will. Indeed make us people of good will, representing citizens of good will. Make us this day representatives not primarily of our citizens but representatives for you. You who know and will what is best for each and for all may we in your name express opinions respectfully and rationally and in charity and truth craft legislation for our state that anticipates the perfect law of love in heaven. Father, may our legislation benefit each person in our state from those in the womb to those approaching the tomb, whether male or female, no matter what race or language of birth, all called with their great array of talents and carisms to contribute as one in completing your work of creation. In our state raise up holy and generous individuals and families and organizations of all sorts. May our laws help all those in Georgia to share in the responsibilities that come with freedom. For all disparities and differences, Father, your dain or permit for a creative and fruitful exchange by cooperation of different but complementary individuals. May our legislation enable and encourage those of us with food and drink to feast with the hungry and thirsty, those of us who are at home to welcome the stranger to it, those of us wearing clothes to dress the naked, those of us in health to visit the sick and those of us with freedom to visit those in prison. In the beginning, Father, you said it is not good for man to be alone. Help all of us therefore to remember always that we need one another, that no one is expendable, that our love is to extend not only to family and friends, but even to strangers and enemies. May our politics never divide us in ideology born of envy, but unanimous and truth born of love. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Father Durkin. We appreciate you getting our day off to the right start. Door keep us well in love to doors. Members you may join Father Durkin in the south any room for a photo if you so like.

Come on. Shalom, y'all. Thank you. It's my honor to present this resolution. Whereas the Jewish people established to sovereign an independent State of Israel on May 14, 1948, and the United States immediately recognized and established full diplomatic relations with Israel. And whereas 2023 marks 75 years of the realization of his eye in his dream of the Jewish people regaining independence in their ancient homeland. And whereas 2023 also marks 75 years of robust United States and Israel relations reflected in the relations between the State of Georgia and Israel, a special relationship based on mutually shared democratic values, common strategic interests, and moral bonds of friendship and mutual respect. And whereas the State of Georgia is an unequivocal supporter of the State of Israel and its right to defend itself against terror and any threat to its security. And whereas Georgia is proud to serve as home to the Israeli consulate general to the Southeastern United States. Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives that the members of this body commend the State of Israel upon the grand occasion of the 75th anniversary. Support Israel in its legal, historical, and moral right to its reestablish independence and recognize the Jewish people's right to self-determination in their ancient homeland. It is my honor to present Consul General Anat Sultan Dodon who assumed her role as Consul General in Atlanta in July 2019. Consul General Sultan Dodon joined the Israeli diplomatic corps in 2004 and has held various positions at the embassies of Israel in Cameroon, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem, Sultan Dodon has held positions in the Euro-Asia and Asia-Pacific divisions. Sultan Dodon earned a BA in Psychology and Education from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1999. My mother also went there. And an MA in criminology with high honors from the same institution. In 2020, Sultan Dodon was honored by Morehouse College with induction into the Martin Luther King Jr. International College of Ministers in Liyadee. In her current role in Atlanta, Sultan Dodon is responsible for promoting all aspects of the bilateral relations between Israel and the seven states covered by the Consul General of Israel to the southeast. Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Sultan Dodon is married to Yaron and they are the proud parents of three girls. On the floor, I'd like to also recognize Deputy Consul General Alex Schenler, Director of Political and Government Affairs Karen Eisenberg-Jones, Director of Public Affairs Aaron Bronstein, and Chief of Staff Jacqueline Allen. I also like to recognize the Consulate Staff in the gallery. Please stand up and be recognized. Thank you. It is our pleasure and honor to welcome you to the House of Representatives. Thank you. Shalom. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Panage, for the very warm welcome and introduction. Jewish visionary, Theodore Heltzel, who turned Zionism into a political movement 125 years ago, famously wrote, if you will it, it is no dream. Today, we celebrate the realization of the age old Zionist dream and there is so much to celebrate. We celebrate the regaining of sovereignty and control of our destiny and the incredible re-gathering of our people in our ancestral homeland. In 75 short years, we've established a vibrant democracy, a diverse society, and a robust economy. Israel, one of the smallest countries in the world, is today one of the world leaders in technology and innovation. Just after the state of Israel's declaration of independence on May 14, 1948, United States President Harry Truman officially recognized our statehood. Since then, the United States has stood steadfast in its support of the nation-state of the Jewish people. Within the United States, the state of Georgia has consistently demonstrated an unwavering support of Israel and of our bilateral relations, which encompass a vast variety of fields, economic, cultural, academic, and more. In 2022, the Georgia Israel Legislative Caucus was launched with the list of members continuously growing, a reflection of the strong relations that we enjoy. Alongside the many achievements, one crucial achievement is yet to be fully realized that of peace with our neighbors. This has been achieved with Egypt and with Jordan, and the Abraham Accords signed in 2020 between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, are paving the way for a new Middle East, one of partnership and prosperity, for those who choose a better tomorrow for their peoples. Both Israel and the United States are fully committed to further expanding the circle of peace. While we will keep pursuing that goal, we will also always remain prepared to defend ourselves against any threat to our state and people. Israel's eternal commitment as the nation-state of the Jewish people is that never again will a Jew face hate, danger, or persecution with nowhere to turn. But there must be a global commitment as well. With anti-Semitic incidents reaching an all-time high in the United States, declaring never again on Holocaust remembrance day is not enough. Anti-Semitism must be actively and consistently recognized, exposed, and addressed. I would like to commend the many representatives here who just a few days ago demonstrated moral clarity in voting in favor of HB30 to adopt the Ira Working Definition of Anti-Semitism in the state of Georgia. As we celebrate our accomplishments and as we continue to face challenges, we know that we do not stand alone. I would like to finish by saying thank you to Daraba, to our many friends here in the Georgia State Legislature, for your support and commitment to Israel and to the continued realization of the dream. Thank you. Thank you. Very, very nearly, well done. Thank you. Council General. Georgia and Georgia have always been blessed to have a relationship with Israeli people and with the country of Israel. 75 years, what an awesome milestone. We thank you for your relationship in Georgia with the many companies, Israeli companies that are part of our business climate here, provide a great working relationship. But most important, we appreciate the continued partnership that we have with the country of Israel. Your dedication to peace in the Middle East but peace around the world. We do, when data to you, we honor you today and you honor us with your presence here today. So thank you for being with us and we want to continue this relationship. Thank you for your recognition of the work of this House in some of the port legislation. Again, I just thank you and again for being with us and being a part of what this country holds dear as well as your country does. Thank you.

I'm sure the gentleman understands the lay of the land and in Wilkes County and believes certainly in what he speaks have all members voted.

Have all members voted. What purpose is representative draper rise. Parliamentary inquiry state inquiry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that nothing in delay be sudden the alleged reasoning for the restructuring of Cherokee County requires allowing commissioners to be able to reject all proposed names from one party in the way HB642 outlines. The court is ready to read the legislation and sort of believes what she's saying. Is it true whether the holding in delay be sudden applies to boards of elections is an open question of law and in fact is currently being litigated in Cherokee County Superior Court making HB642 untimely. I'm not sure of that but I would say that the lady has certainly studied the proposition understands a lot of things about our judicial system and she certainly believes in what she states. One final inquiry Mr. Speaker. One more inquiry. Thank you. Even though HB642 is on the local legislation calendar. Isn't it true that there are candidates from all parties on the ballot in Cherokee County including statewide candidates and that as such the bill has implications beyond the borders of Cherokee County. I'm sure the lady understands and knows what she speaks. Thank you. What purpose is representing Thomas rise. I'm not sure if the gentleman is a learner engineer and he can read very clearly and distinctly knows what he speaks. My reading is pretty good. Further inquiry Mr. Speaker. Is it also not true that this is local bill that's been voted for and passed by the local delegation. I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks in the delegation. Hope is followed the rules of this house. That's almost speaker. Thank you. Thank you for your inquiry. What purpose is representing Westbrook rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Stayed you inquiry. Is it not true that HB642 would allow the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners to appoint partisans of only one political party to the county Board of Elections and Registration. Thereby potentially weaponizing the board. I'm not sure the chair follows your exact line of thought but I know the lady is a learned attorney and believes in what she speaks. Thank you Mr. Speaker. What purpose is representing O'Lala? Yeah you rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stayed you inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that the boards of election and registration determine voter challenges and also certify elections which is why partisan balance is so important. I'm not sure exactly where the duties of the boards are in this legislation but the makeup of the board certainly are very important in each county in this state and I'm sure the gentleman believes of his points. Thank you Mr. Speaker. For what purpose does Ripley-Braman rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that the current election supervisor of Cherokee County who herself identifies as a Republican wrote to every legislator requesting that we reject this legislation. Her message was quite urgent. She called it urgent and she mentions that this model could potentially be a threat to election integrity. I've not seen that letter but I'm sure the lady speaks of what she read in the letter and I respect her opinion. For what purpose does Barchett rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stayed you inquiry. Isn't it true Mr. Speaker that delay V. Sutton does not have an open question of law as to whether it applies to the board of election and applies to all public boards. There's no question of whether it applies. Is it true? I'm sure the gentleman is read extensively on that subject and then certainly believes in what he states. Further parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true Mr. Speaker that it is a time on our tradition here to let the local legislatures propose and vote on their local legislation. I'm sure the gentleman believes in what he says states. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm going to take a couple inquiries and then we're going to call this one. We're going to call the vote. In a spirit of bipartisanship. Whip park is recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker is it not? Is this a parliament inquiry? I'm parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true Mr. Speaker that a few years ago a local delegation introduced legislation approved by a majority of that delegation that was still rejected that would have reformed the Gwyneth Board of Elections? Is that not true Mr. Speaker? I'm sure the gentleman has a great grasp on the history of this House and I'm sure he believes exactly what he states. Further inquiry Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that if we continue to see Republican counties introducing these reformations to their Board of Elections that hopefully will see the kind of deference given to democratically controlled counties in terms of how they would want to reform their Board of Elections? I'm sure the gentleman believes exactly what he just said to me and I'm going to leave this up to all the members of this House to make a determination on the legitimacy of your thought. I'm sure the gentleman does agree and his thought very much to it. I want to say one more inquiry and that's going to come from the representative from the 22nd for what to purpose does representative Jordan Ridley rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that there are more than two parties in this great country and this bill allows representation from those outside the two large parties and ensures fairness to all parties and even those who registered independence? I'm sure the gentleman believes everything he just stated to me. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of the bills on the local calendar, passage of the bill on the local calendar. The eyes are in, the eyes are in 97, the nays are in 70. This bill haven't received your requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 644.

He actually went to the Andrew Young School of Public Policy here at Georgia State and graduated Kung Lao. We're just really proud. He used to be a legislative aide here for the working families caucus and then went on to work for the AFL CIO. And now is a full-time educator. We just thank you Alfred for bringing these kids today to the Capitol. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Welcome young people. We're glad to have you. Representative Tran is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is API Media Day and I'd like to ask Lee Wong and George A. Sian Times up in the gallery to stand up and waive to the fine folks down here. Welcome to the Gold Dome. A little bit about George A. Sian Times. They were founded in 2004 as the first Asian American newspaper here in Georgia. Last night we had the first two Asian American actors when Oscars. They cover not just Asian American community but the local businesses, health, lifestyle, food and arts. They also cover Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Malaysian, Cambodian, Leotian, Filipino, Singaporean, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Thai, Burmese, Indian and Indonesian communities here in Metro Atlanta. So they are here at the Capitol today. They've asked everyone to join them in 502 for lunch upon adjournment. Come meet them. Maybe they'll do some press coverage on you or invite them or invite you onto their podcast. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Welcome to your house. Good to have you all. Carmen Carson, recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to say real quick we have a group of trail life and American heritage girls here at the Capitol today. I think they're out and touring around the Capitol Rotunda and upstairs. But I see one little girl there in the gallery. Could you stand? She's the red uniform with American Heritage Girls, the faith-based organization along with trail life and other faith-based organizations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.

That completes morning orders. We're ready to move on to the rules calendar. Members will please take your seats and take those of our, take those important conversations into the any room. It's probably two or three of us want to hear what's going on at least. Members will cease conversation or take your conversation into the any room. We could be done by lunch if we go ahead and get started. Members will please give your attention to the member in the well that's presenting the bill. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 21? Senate Bill 21. Senate Bill 21 by Senator Kropantra, 30 second and others to be entitled to amend code section 38 for 14. The official go to Georgia annotated relating to creation of the Georgia Veteran Service Foundation, Incorporated Purpose Operation and Reporting, so it was revised operations. The spill I refer to the committee on defense and veteran affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chairman of defense and veterans affairs, Chairman Bonner, to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to present Senate Bill 21. This comes as a request from the Department of Veteran Services and it makes adjustments to the Georgia Veteran Service Foundation. First it increases the number of board members to 13 up from 7. It reduces the terms of those board members from 7 years down to 3 years. Then it increases the frequency of the meetings from annually to quarterly. And the final thing it does that allows the commissioner to appoint the executive staff of the foundation from the existing employees of the Department of Veteran Services. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker. I'll stand for any questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair has done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? What was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 169, the nay zero. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate bill 23? Senate bill 23 by Senator Karpatric, the 32nd and others to be titled. And act to amend various titles of the official code of Georgia annotated. So it was revised. Committee named repeal provisions relative inactive boards, panels, authority, centers, commissions, committees, councils, tasks, forces, and other such parties. This bill ever referred to the committee on code revision. The committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Hill to note the 48th House District will present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Today I'm proud to present to you Senate bill 23, which renames and eliminates various inactive boards, commissions, councils, and authorities. Among the list includes the Georgia Education Authority, which no longer is operational per DOE. The Georgia Rail Passinger Authority Overview Committee, that's a mouthful. And my personal favorite, the World War I Centennial Commission. Senate bill 23 offers us a fantastic opportunity to begin to remove hundreds of lines of legislative code and exercise. We may want to consider again in the future. I know sometimes we pride ourselves on how many bills we pass. It may be a healthier exercise to see how many we can take off the books. Two changes were made in the House Committee process. The first language was added to help legislative council. Our clerk's office by removing the duplicate process of pre-filing bills. Second, a member of the Pallad of Care Council testified in committee that their council should be kept on the books. Despite lacking a quorum of appointed members and not having met in over three years, that council was indeed added back in. Senate bill 23 passed unanimously a little over a month ago, and I ask your favorable consideration today. Without all your questions. Gentlemen, as you were to first question the lady from the 141st district, representative Higley has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I will always yield to my seat, mate. I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were presenting this bill. Can you tell me about the rationale for eliminating the commission on women's health while we would no longer need that? Great question. So this bill is actually birthed out of a former, the genesis of former colleague of ours, representative Regina Quick, who served over the Lieutenant Governor's office. And during her work over there, she identified a number of council commissions and authorities that were really no longer operational, including the one you mentioned. So we've reached out to all of them. All of them have since closed down and we're simply removing these from the code. The representative from the 30th representative Campbell to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. This is a follow-on question to representative Higley. I'm curious to understand a little bit more about the office of women's health. When they were initially started, the work that they've accomplished. And again, the rationale for closing that down, especially in a time when I know we're all focused on supporting women's health throughout the state. Great question. I'm sure there was an excellent rationale as to when it was started. It's since ceased operations. I don't have any additional background offer you at this time, but happy to connect one-on-one to you and I can explore some more. Does the gentleman further yield for another question? Yes, ma'am. Would the gentleman be open to amending this bill to include keeping the office of women's health open so that that further review could be conducted? I'm not sure if amendments were allowed on the floor at this time, but happy to work with you on legislation if that office is needed to be put back in at some point. Gentlemen, yield for another question? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Representative Bruce, to your left in the back of the chamber, has a question. Where's the gentleman here? Yes, sir, I do. The work that these committees, these departments that are being eliminated, has the work gone to other departments to be done or has it just not been done at all? Not being done at all. In a lot of cases, they, like I said, have ceased operation. They don't have appointed members. They kind of statutorily ended their work or what their initial mission was. So yeah, they're essentially obsolete at this point. Well, the gentleman further yield. Yes, sir. Is there some place that you are aware of where people that are interested could find out what these departments were doing? Keeping in line with the ladies, have already mentioned. It just seemed that some of those that you've named that there's still work to be done under those, if you assume what they were doing. I'm sure there's great, you know, the title of it sounds great. I'm sure there's great work to be done. I'm sure a lot of that work, frankly, is being done by our agencies and other boards and commissions that the state has. Probably hundreds of boards and commissions that are doing good work on women's health and other issues every single day. Thank you. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes. Representative Park Cannon to your left for a question. Thank you. Do you yield? Yes, ma'am. Can you help us understand changing that house rule around the pre-filing of the bills, not having to be publicized anymore? What's that about? It's a great question. So you can still publicize a bill, talk about it to your constituents. What we're simply doing is removing a duplicate of procedure where it would be really toward November. You can go into legislative council, they write the bill, you file it, but then you don't really file it. You have to come back and on the first day of legislative session, that's when you can file it. So you can still draft a bill and file it day one of session. We're just removing a process by which you have to draft a bill, get a different backing to it, and then come back in, add another backing to it, and then file it again on day one of legislative council. So there's nothing stopping you from drafting a bill before session, advertising it to your constituents. It's just we're changing, you then file it one time when we get into session at the beginning of the year. Just a further question. So why would you say that it was duplicative before and why is this a better solution? Does it change the bill number? Because legislative council, they draft a bill, they put a different backing to it, you then pre-file it, and really you haven't filed anything. So you'll reserve a number, say, HB1, and then HB1 is kind of floating out there until you file that bill. You actually have to come back in, get a different backing to it, and get co-sponsors to that bill. So it's removing kind of a second step, and going back to a practice that we've had in this body in the past. Gentlemen, you have for another question. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Majority of this House, leader, estration is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speakers, Jim and you. Yes, sir. Sir, isn't it true that your bill does not abolish the office of women's health? It simply alleviates the reporting requirement that that office may have, and that's as covered under Section 6-1 of your bill. Yes, sir, that is correct. Any concerns as to work that's being done by the office of women's health would be unaffected other than the reporting requirement that's referenced here? That is correct. Thank you. A couple more questions that bring from clarity to this issue. Representative Chocus has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Isn't it true, sir, that in committee, many of these boards did not meet and haven't met in quite a few years? And also, isn't it true that when we had the hearing on it, none of the boards in question that we were taking off the books? None of their representatives even came to the committee to defend the work that they did. So I commend you on this, and I thank you for this legislation. Yes, sir, thank you. Without Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. If I have no other questions. The gentleman is yielded the well. He has a couple more questions, but he's yielded the well. I think we've had a third discussion and clarified a couple of points that were of concern. So thank you for the presentation, and thank you for the questions, members. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? To chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Representative Bonta hand rise? Parliament or inquiry, Mr. Speaker? The State of inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that while we are eliminating the reporting requirement of the Office of Women's Health? But this State also has the Georgia Commission on Women, whose three main pillars are human trafficking, maternal mortality, and women's health. And I think that this Chamber and the Governor's Office and the Senate is our very support of a women's health in this State. And we want to continue to see that work being done. I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks and believes of what he speaks. Have all members voted, yes, so the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the A's were 108, the NA's 61. The bill having received it requisite Constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll move on to afternoon orders. Representative Hilton is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Twice in one day. This is great. Well, this past weekend we all had that dreaded weekend where we sprang forward into daylight saving time. The weekend where I must explain to my children that it's really 9 o'clock and not 8 o'clock and they really do need to go to bed. The weekend when churches are empty because everyone is an hour late and everyone today is a little bit grumpier because we lost that precious hour of sleep. Wouldn't it be great if this was the last time we had to spring forward? There are enormous health and economic benefits to making daylight saving time permanent. The Georgia General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to move our State to permanent daylight saving time and Governor Kemp signed that bill into law. However, we can't do it without congressional approval. This could be our last spring forward if Congress would pass the Sunshine Protection Act. These are bipartisan bills in both the Senate and the House. The same bill passed to the Senate unanimously last year but with a new Congress that had to be reintroduced. I know Congress has a lot of weighty issues to address but I think we can all agree on one thing that way they ought to move forward. Please join me and our former colleague, Rep Cantrell and millions of other Georgians, urging Congress to act today to pass the Sunshine Protection Act and in the antiquated practice of changing our clocks twice a day. With that twice a day, twice a year, Mr. Speaker, I'm tired. I yield the well. Did the gentleman say that your colleagues are all grumpy? Is that what you said? I thought that's what you said. I mean, I'm not sure that's allowed by our rules to say that about your colleagues but Representative Hutchinson is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Today I'd like to introduce you to Christian. Christian was born in 2006. He's a sweet and affectionate child who loves taking walks, playing games like Uno, listening to rap music and watching Bob's Burgers. He loves action movies and marble movies are his favorites. Colleagues, Christian is one of hundreds of children available for adoption in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the well. Representative Cameron is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor a man and one of our great men in day counting who passed away in the last week. Calvin Newton was a pioneer in gospel music and Southern gospel music. He sang with the Oak Ridge quartet years before they became the Oak Ridge Boys. He also founded a group called The Sons of Sound, which was one of the precursors of modern Christian music. Later in life, he sang with the Gather Homecoming Group and did many videos with them. Today he slayed the rest in rising fund, Georgia, with the Oak Ridge quartet and a lot of the Gather family there to sing him home. Rest in peace, Calvin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Cameron. Representative Reese is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Teddy Reese. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today, my colleagues, because last Thursday I failed to mention that yesterday was me and my wife's seventh anniversary. But she didn't fail to remind me that I didn't go to the well and say happy anniversary. So even though we lost an hour of celebration this weekend, I stand today to say happy anniversary to Dr. Chastity Reese. Love you, baby. We're seven years in. A lucky woman, a lucky woman to be married to Representative Reese. No doubt about that. Representative Draper is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I suspect most of us here would fancy ourselves very familiar with how elections work. After all, every single one of us has been on the ballot. But let me ask you this. How many of you have paid close attention to the inner workings of election administration? How many of you have been a poll worker or a poll watcher or appointed to it be an absentee ballot processing monitor, a vote review panelist, a ballot duplication panelist, or observed an audit? I've done all those things and more. And today I rise to tell you about my first experience seeing how the election sausage was made. So it happened several years ago. I was asked to volunteer on a vote review panel. And I didn't know what a vote review panel was at the time. But what the panel does is it reviews ballots that cannot be interpreted by a scanner and attempts to discern voter intent. So for example, maybe you have a ballot where there is a voter puts a check mark by a candidate instead of filling in the oval. But there it's obvious what the voter intent is and you can put the ballot for that candidate. Or in another case, in other instances where the voter's intent is not clear, you can throw out the ballot. Like if a ballot is somebody votes for two candidates where they're only supposed to vote for one. Vote review panels are comprised of the election supervisor or their designate and one volunteer on behalf of every party with a candidate on the ballot. My assumption, never having done this before, was that I was going to be dealing with rational actors who were going to look at each ballot objectively and be consistent about the judgment calls they were making regardless of which party benefited. Spoiler alert, that was not my experience. Right? During my experience, my counterpart on the vote review panel argued that every single ballot up for discussion should be counted in favor of her party's candidate, no matter how tortured or unbelievable the argument was. Where I agreed with her, the ballot went in favor of her party's candidate and where I disagreed with her, the election supervisor broke the time. I walked out of that experience with a couple takeaways. First, the process worked, the right results were reached. Two, having the political parties involved in the process as counterbalances to one another was critical to the process's success. Three, when candidates and parties understand the process and have a stake in its implementation, the results, no matter which side they favor, are more readily accepted. And four, having both parties in the room serve not only to increase transparency around the process, but as a check and balance on the influence any party can have. This body, in its wisdom throughout its history, has recognized the important role that the political parties play in the election process. Title 21, the election code is replete with responsibilities for the political parties that are interwoven into the fabric of how we run our elections here in Georgia. From qualifying candidates to conducting primaries, to appointing poll watchers, to vote review panelists, to ballot process monitors, to stepping in as an election superintendent if a probate judge is challenged during an election, the political parties play a quasi-governmental role in our elections. And notably, the election code gives these responsibilities to all the political parties, not just to one or the other, not just to the one that happens to be in power at the time. The code contemplates that the system works by having all major stakeholders be part of the process and hold each other accountable. It's not about partisanship, y'all. It's about strengthening our democracy. It's about increasing transparency. I trust that this body wants to restore faith and confidence in our elections. Offering parties equal participation opportunities just does just that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chairman Chokus has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was in Bentley and I are here on behalf of Georgia Southwestern State University. Georgia Southwestern State University, Lady Hurricanes, basketball team, is playing in the sweet 16th of the NCAA Division to National Tournament tonight at 7pm versus Kataba College at Kataba. Anyway, please join me in wishing the Lady Kane success. Go, Kane. Thank you. I'm sure they'll be able to hear representing Bentley cheering them on. That completes our afternoon orders. For what purpose is ribosody, bear it rise. To make a motion. State your motion. I move that the rules be temporarily suspended so that a bill may be read for the first time and assigned a committee. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? A numbered house bill by Robson of Barrett, the 24th and others to be entitled and act to provide for homestead exemption from Forsyth County School District Addable Arm Taxes for Education and Purfuses. I want the gentleman's motion that the rules of this house be temporarily suspended so a bill can be read for the first time and assigned a committee. Is there objection? Enter governmental coordination. I want to have one final afternoon order and I overlooked it. And I'm sure it's special. Chairman Carpenter is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know everybody's ready for lunch, but I thought this was important. I don't know what most of you guys were doing this weekend, but I had a small group of folks in Whitfield County get together and decide that I was not the representative for the Republican Party in Whitfield. I just want to say it's pretty disgusting to attack my integrity and my concerns for my citizens and concerns for this state. So I look forward to whoever you put up against me next year and continue to support the great folks of District 4. That was obviously worth waiting for Mr. Clerk. Will you read a caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Recognizing commending major general Thomas F. Grabowski upon the grand occasion of his retirement. Commending congratulating William Aaron Herring Christopher Wong-Wan Chen and Cooper Jacob Davis. Congrat commending the John Millage Academy of Arsene Football Team.
