you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you It is my pleasure to introduce my friend, Pastor Bud Womack. He is accompanied by his lovely life, who's in the chamber. Bud and Fay have been married for 33 years and have two grown daughters. Kelsey will be having her 22nd birthday this Saturday and is a senior at Georgia Southwest and State University where she will be graduating in May with honors. Kayla, the oldest daughter, is married to Earl Dupree and they have a three month old son, Ripton. Kayla and Earl are both educators with the Sligh County school system. Pastor Womack has served as lead pastor at the live point church in America for 23 years. He also serves as district overseer for the Church of God. Pastor Bud has been the chaplain for the Sumter County Sheriff's Department for the last 27 years and chaplain for the Georgia State Patrol for the last six years. He enjoys the outdoors being involved in the local community, pastoring of course at live point church, but most of all he enjoys being papa to his new grandson, Ripton. Pastor Bud. I'm sure I'm glad at least one of us are skinny to get back and forth through here and I'm not going to say which one of us are skinny. Thank you Speaker Ralston and Representative Chokas and each one of you that are here today. Thank you for the job you do. And especially I want to thank you for beginning each session every year with spiritual goddess and prayer. Always like to start when I'm speaking anywhere with something a little humerus and after by years of low enforcement I thought this might fit me a little bit. During an investigation an FBI agent goes out to an old country farm and he sees an old farmer sitting in the barn, milking cows and he walks up to him and says sir I'm with the FBI. I'm working a case and I'll be searching your entire farm today. Farmer looked at him over the back of the cow and he said son that's great but do not go in the field with the green gate. And he said sir have you seen my badge and he pulls out this shiny gold badge. He says you see this badge it gives me permission to go anywhere in the United States I want to go that includes your farm. He said sir I appreciate your job and your effort and your young man but you need to learn something. I'm telling you don't go in that field with the green gate. He throw the badge back in the old farmer's face and said young man or old man I will go anywhere I want to go because I have this badge that says I can. Old farmer said okay sit back down started milking the cows about 30 minutes goes by and he heard the young FBI agent screaming to the top of his lungs. Help help help somebody help. Farmer smiled stepped outside the barn and noticed his two-ton prize bull chasing the young FBI agent across the field and he screaming help help. The farmer put both hands over his mouth and yelled the badge the badge showing the badge. At my age if I'm running you better run because something's after me like a two-ton prize bull. Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 through 9 says this now dear brothers and sisters one final thing fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise keep putting into practice all you learned and receive from me everything you heard from me and saw me doing then the God of peace will be with you. That word fix means to direct oneself steadily or unwaveringly towards an action thought or goal. I found out in my 57 years of living that we focus more on the big things the big fireworks the big booms the big loud the big colors then we do most of the little things that we have right in front of our lives my daddy used to say there's some people that move so slow in life that you have to line them up with a fence post to see if they're moving you wasn't raising the country you might not know what that means but I always did but today we seem to move so quickly and so fast that not only do we miss the fence post oftentimes we miss the people as well. I want to share a story with you this morning that a young woman wrote in first person so I'm going to read it to you and it's also a beautiful lesson that she learned the title of it's called red marbles she writes I was at the corner grocery store buying some early potatoes I noticed a small boy delicate of bone and feature ragged but clean hungrily gazing at a basket of freshly picked peas I paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh peas I'm a pushover for cream peas and new potatoes pondering the peas I couldn't help over here in the conversation between Mr. Miller the store owner and the ragged looking little boy next to me here's how the conversation went hey Barry how are you today Mr. Miller said hey Mr. Miller I'm fine I reckon just looking at them peas they sure do look good they are good Barry how you mama doing she's good Mr. Miller getting stronger all the time I asked good Barry I'm proud anything I can help you with no sir just looking at them peas would you like to take some home no sir Mr. Miller I ain't got nothing to pay for him with well Barry what you got that you'll trade me he said I got my prize marble Mr. Miller it's a blue one and I sort of like it but it's a beauty and I sure would trade it well Mr. Miller takes a sack of peas and hands it to him and he says Barry do you have a marble it's a different color like a red one I like red marbles more than I do blue ones he said I don't know but I got one at home Mr. Miller he said I tell you what Barry you take these peas home with you and when you come back you bring that red marble and we'll see about trading Misr's Miller who had been standing nearby noticed I was watching the conversation between Mr. Miller and the ragged looking little boy she came over and said there's two other little boys just like Barry around here all three are in very poor circumstances my husband just loves to bargain with him for all kinds of things he knows they need a special to win its food when they come back with the red marbles he decided he doesn't like red after all and he sends them home with more groceries for a green orange or different colored marble I left the store that day smiling inside and out just so impressed with Mr. Miller a short time later I moved to Colorado but I never forgot the story of this kindhearted man and those three ragged little boys several years went by and I had the opportunity to visit home with some old friends in that Idaho community and while I was there I learned that Mr. Miller had passed away they were having his visitation that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go I agreed to go as well when we got there there was a long line to meet the family and to offer words of comfort ahead of us in line I noticed three young men one was in an army uniform and the other two were in nice suits and ties and all of them looked very successful they approached Mrs. Miller each one hugged her kester on the cheek spoke briefly and moved to the casket she watched a one by one each young man stopped briefly and placed his warm hand over the cold pale hand of Mr. Miller and then quietly left as they wiped tears from their eyes I returned came to greet Mr. Mrs. Miller and I told her who I was and reminded her of what I had witnessed so long ago at their store and about her husband swapping and trading marbles for food with her eyes glistening she took my hand and led me to the casket she then said those three young men who just left are the three boys I told you back about way back then they just told me how much they appreciated the things my husband Jim did for them and now that he couldn't change his mind about color or size they came to pay their respect she said you know we've never had a great deal of wealth in this world but right now Jim would consider himself the richest man in Idaho with loving gentleness Mrs. Miller lifted the lifeless fingers of her husband and resting underneath were three exquisitely shining red marbles Maya Angelo once said this life is not measured by the number of breasts we take but by the moments that take our breath my friend we may not be remembered for a lot of the words we say but we will be remembered by the things we've done and why we did them I think sometimes we need to look at the post and the people and just slow down and pay attention fix your thoughts know what is true honorable right pure lovely admirable excellent and worthy of praise then the God of peace will be with you and that's what I pray for every one of you every day is that the God of peace will be with you can we pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much for the day that you blessed us with Lord thank you for allowing us together here thank you for the men and women that spend their time working so hard for the great state of Georgia God we thank you for their efforts their minds their abilities their talents God work on our hearts every one of us from pastors right on down to legislators right on down to the neighbors to the little country store owners God let us remember that life is a lot like those little boys and those red marbles it's important that we see those around us God give us a heart to love to be gentle to be pure to be kind to be thinking on things that are admirable and Lord I pray for your blessings to continue on this legislative body Lord we ask you to go with us throughout the remainder of this day lead God and direct us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen join me for the pledge I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands for elimination under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all Doorkeepers will unlock the doors Go members may greet the chaplain in

He did so much for Atlanta Georgia and for the state of Georgia and you go back and look at the Royal Congress Center and the dome and other areas of the that's beneficial to Atlanta mortar. You'll see the footprint of Thomas B. Murphy's so it's just a joy to come today. I talked to the son Mike Murphy judge all the time we talk and I'm always looking forward to seeing the grandchildren appear on the page but of course we can't do that now. Thank you for giving us this opportunity to have the birthday on behalf of the House and speaker Ross and representative. I'll tell Paul Smith we want to say have a birthday. Speak of Thomas B. Murphy. Thank you all very much. There is no doubt that speaker Murphy was a real giant in Georgia history and we have much to be grateful to him for. I think the thing I'm most grateful is he fought for 34 years for the independence of this house and so our independence today owes in large measure to his determination that this house would be independent and equal to all other branches of government. Now what minute each chair recognizes representative Al Williams for a morning order. Thank you speaker. I'd rather this morning to honor the retirement of retired Admiral and Andrews who recently retired as the deputy administrator for the federal aviation administration and she has moved home to Liberty County and part of the honor was she was given a final approach fix at the Savannah Hilton International Airport. It's named after Annie and movie used by all pilots as they make their final approach in preparation for landing. Listen out for runway 28 for Annie. Rare Admiral Annie and Drew's who went she retired. She's one of only three African American women to attain the rank of Admiral in the Navy and a graduate of Savannah State University where you can go anywhere from Savannah State. Thank you. I give a speaker. Chair recognizes boss chairman gravely for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have the distinct honor this morning to recognize a group of individuals who have come from our community and for the last 10 to 12 years have had a tremendous impact on our public safety community back home where we live. The Pauling Public Safety Appreciation Incorporated Board members are here as a matter of fact they are watching from our office upstairs and we want to thank them for everything that they've done. This is an organization that provides for the men and women of public safety who both live and or work in our community. Since their inception in 2009 they've been able to raise over $300,000 with various runs, a glow run, 5K in our community breakfast events and really just helping out the men and women. So we want to commend them. Joseph Gullett and I have had the great pleasure of serving as president of that board and it's been a really great honor. So we as the Pauling County delegation stand up here to commend them today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative bonner for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I'd like to just say a happy birthday to the city of Peachtree City back in March of 1959. House Bill 242 was introduced by Representative Grady Huddleston, carried in the Senate by Senator Harry Redwine, signed into law March 9, 1959. And that day the city of Peachtree City was chartered. Joel Cowan served as our first mayor. The city was the first planned community in the United States featuring a village concept where every village in the city had its own stores, schools and recreational areas. Today Peachtree City is a thriving community of over 35,000 residents, over 100 miles of golf cart paths, over 11,000 golf carts registered in the city. It is consistently ranked among the best places to live in the United States. And it's been my honor for the last five years to represent that great city, Peachtree City. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Malo for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today is Scouts Day at the Capitol. I'm sure you have seen all of the Scouts from the Boy Scouts of America here for Scouts Day at the Capitol. The Atlanta Air Council has provided a popcorn and each of you have it on your desk. And we're so excited to have Scouts from all of this state here with us. So if you haven't met your constituents, your Scouts, I encourage you to take a picture. And with that, I will yield the remainder of my time to represent at least a Hagen who has a special guest today. My special guest is my son, Henry. He's in the back this morning and he is no longer a Scout as he turned 18 last month. But he did make Eagle about three weeks before that deadline. So we're very proud of him. And thank you for being here today. Thank you. Thank you. There we go. Good job. Thank you, sir. Chair recognizes representative Kelly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Monday night, the Georgia State and hands basketball team, Beat Louisiana, securing them a place in the NCAA, March Madness Tournament, and securing a Sunbelt Conference Championship for the Emmittles or Tenth-Win and the sixth time that they are advancing now to the NCAA Tournament. So just want to congratulate them to say, go Panthers. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Today is March of Dines Day. And on your desk, you will find a gift from them. It is a cookie and attached is their priorities for this year. It was nice of them to thank us for all that we have done for mothers and babies. And I want to thank all of you that have helped me on so many bills in that issue. And it was very nice, like I say, to have them recognize that. But of course, there's still more that they want that we can do. And they are the one organization or one of the main organizations that works on that constantly. So March of Dines Day, March of Dines Day. And if you see one of the advocates, please tell them thank you for all they do for Georgia's moms and children. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Cantrell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I've been down here a couple of times recently to call out some behavior that we didn't agree with. But I wanted to come down to give credit where credit is due. So today I want to raise a bottle. First of all, the President Biden for cutting off all oil imports from Russia. And secondly, to our friends down the street, that certain soft drink company for also cutting off all business with Russia. Be grateful for that. And we want to encourage all companies to do the same thing. Companies like MasterCard, Visa, Disney, Harley Davidson have done so. Let's continue to encourage private companies to make the right decisions and to support our government. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Lot for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There's a huge misunderstanding in the media with some of our constituents and unfortunately among some in our chamber about Medicaid expansion in Georgia. To be clear, Georgia did expand Medicaid when we passed the Patients First Act and Georgia Pathways in a way that would benefit nearly a million Georgians. But the Biden administration has halted our efforts to ensure that those Georgians that fell within the gap created by the Affordable Care Act could qualify for Medicaid. The implementation of our 1332 waiver has since created a 12% reduction in insurance cost to those Georgians on the individual marketplace, as well as increased insurance carrier participation in Georgia. Unfortunately, the 1115 waiver that had been approved by the Trump administration was stopped in its tracks by the Biden administration. Georgia was set for the 1332 waiver to go into effect last summer and would have offered Medicaid as an option for all those that fell within the gap created by the Affordable Care Act. The implementation of the 1332 waiver was for those able-bodied Georgians under 100% of the federal poverty line and would have had the ability to use our Medicaid program while ensuring that all those insured, uninsured between 100 and 150% of the federal poverty line could continue using private health insurance at no cost to those who were in the state of the state. Thank you. It is our time now to reach out to our U.S. Senators and seek help. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Beth Moore for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure to come down here on an annual basis to recognize tomorrow, March 10th, as Public Library Day at the State Capitol. So I hope you will join me in recognizing the 407 public libraries that serve every county in the state of Georgia. Libraries in librarians do amazing things for citizens every year, but they were especially impactful this past year. In 2021, there were more than 7.9 million in-person visits to more than 21 million and more than 21 million online visits to Georgia's public libraries. Last year, there were 28.9 million books, media materials, checked out of public libraries with an average of 79,000 materials checked out every day. And in 2021, 1.4 million children attended public reading times, both in libraries and online across the state. So for folks who will be here tomorrow on library day, Thursday, March 10th, Julie Walker, our State Library, and has arranged for a food truck to, a food truck to be available between the Capitol and CLOB from 11.45 to 12.45 for anybody that would like to grab a food box. So that will be tomorrow for anybody who's here on committee day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hutchinson, you've got 25 seconds, is that enough? Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a brief morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to go super fast. This is 11-year-old Helen. She is a sweet, friendly and engaging girl who enjoys going for walks riding her bike, listening to pop and hip hop. She enjoys playing volleyball, cheerleading, and participating in activities at school. And I just want to say in less than 25 seconds, it's women's history month, and just imagine what this girl can do with the right parents. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're going now to the rules calendar. Going to the rules calendar. House will come to order. House will come to order. We've got a lot of measures on the rules calendar today, so I'm going to ask you to please stay close by your seat. And let's keep the noise down to a manageable, um, clerical read the caption to House Bill 1455. House Bill 1455, resident of Hutchinson's, the 1161st, and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2, a title 52 of the official go to Georgia and attending, relating to Georgia Port's authority, so it's to provide for powers of authority. This bill ever for the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today on behalf of House Bill 1455. I don't think anybody in here would, uh, would disagree with me when he said the growth that the Georgia Port's authority has been phenomenal over about the last 20 years. I've been fortunate that I've represented a good part of it, the container area, which has moved from about 15th in the country and number of, uh, and materials moved to the port to number two. And, uh, what has happened as a direct result of that is the geographical boundaries of the port can no longer stand any expansion. So what's happened is the port authority has bought off site properties where they store containers and other materials that are in transit. And what this bill does is gives the authority to the Georgia Port's authority police who are all post certified. Uh, authority to, uh, take action is there in transit from the port facility, uh, proper to one of these sites. I have a letter here from every police agency and every city manager that, uh, that falls within a city of Savannah, where we're at garden city, uh, Brunswick in the Chatham County Police. They are all in favor of this. And, uh, if there are no questions, I would appreciate your approval. You have no questions. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1455. The eyes are 159. The nays are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1406. House Bill 1406, by the way, I'm Martin the 49th, being titled an act to amend Code Section 3664, the official vote of George Antoned relating hearings and proposed zoning decisions notice of hearing and non-governmental initiated actions. This bill I'm referring to committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, while we're here for this bill today, the plan this bill is a government that nearing dear to us here in Atlanta, while maybe well-meaning years so ago, put forth the process to just change the way that single-family residential property is used and did so without notifying a lot of people. Now what happened is that was with the

but it caused, as you, if you've been around here this session, a little bit of upset across the Atlanta community. So what I have before us here today is a compromise piece of legislation that I want to thank GMA and the City of Atlanta for working on that provides transparency for citizens, but does not take a municipality's ability to do the zoning away from them. It just requires notice. Specifically, if a widespread change in single-family use is proposed by a government, by the city, they're required to do extra notifications, which you'll see on line 17 through 37 of this bill. And again, I want to thank Atlanta for coming forward and working with us, being good neighbors to the people that live in the city, so that we can give our community members and the homeowners, because to each and every family that owns a home, the place they live is sacred and important to them. And this provides transparency so that the city and the homeowners can be good neighbors. I want to make the last point I'd like to make, Mr. Speaker, is this does not at all affect or impact an owner initiated zoning. And the last, last thing is this does not prohibit the city from taking that action. It instead makes sure that everybody is noticed for that action. And with that, if there are questions, it is a bit of a technical issue. If there are technical questions, I'll take it, Mr. Speaker. Otherwise, I would ask the House's favorable consideration to this for more transparency and so that the people that live within our municipal governments are well informed. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes the minority leader, leader Beverly. You're left for a question. Does gentleman you? I do. On line, just 21 to 23, the zoning, it requires this only decision to be adopted at two regular meetings of local government making a decision in a period of not less than 21 days apart. As I read through this bill, why is that requirement there? Is it just a multi-family trying to become built in a residential district? But why are those lines there? Does it seem like it's a little bit more onerous than it needs to be? I'm sorry, more onerous than why are those lines added? Okay, sure. The gentleman asks why is this more onerous? It's more onerous because what we're trying to do is provide notice and lengthy meetings when a city tries to change the land use of a residential lot. We're not talking about a reason. We're not talking about somebody coming in and saying, I want to take vacant land and make it residential. Or I want to take this residential property and make it multi-family. What we're talking about here is what is referred to in Atlanta as a text amendment. I'd never heard that before, where they wish to take blanket across the board for every single family piece of property in the city of Atlanta. And they want to say, now you can change that to multi-family. We think that's a fairly large change and deserves a little bit of extra notification. And Atlanta agreed with that. Okay, sir. Further question, gentlemen? Yes, sir. Line 38 to 42. And I just want to get some clarity around this. This is notice much, the notice must feature a prominent statement that proposed zoning decisions relates to or will authorize multi-family uses. I'll continue. Or that the proposed zoning decision gives blanket permission to property owners to deviate from the zoning requirement, requiring single-family residential zoning. Could you explain that? Well, I mean, I can explain that's what the city is trying to do at a mass level. In this case, over 50,000 property owners would have been affected. So what we're asking them to do is put on the notice what they're trying to do. It's just that simple. And again, I appreciate the fact that Atlanta realized that if you go back that suggestion that zoning was pulled back because of the notice, but it also caused a lot of angst among residential neighborhoods and communities. And this will give the opportunity for everybody to have transparency and get along. I think it'll go a long way to get along together. I thank you, gentlemen, for the question. Are there other technical questions which I'd take them? Do you have one more if you care to you? Yes, sir. I want to make sure everybody understands we're being transparent. Chair recognizes representative Carter up in the gallery for a question. Thank you, Speaker Rossin. Just a gentleman yield. Yes, ma'am. My question relates to how the residents will be notified. Will this increase the, like where are the zoning notifications like the signs are being set up? Because in my district, we found that sometimes the signs are in areas where the residents don't see it. So in giving notification, I want to just want to be clear that the signs will be where people can see them. And the residents who are affected will definitely still get the information in the mail. Yes, ma'am. I thank the lady for the question and the answer is that all of the notice requirements that are in current zoning code still have to be met. In addition to in lines 31 through 37 of the bill, additional notices have to be placed. And that means prior if a government was going to rezone property, they didn't have to put signs out on every property. This requires if their zoning falls under this section, if there's less than 500 properties affected, they would have to put a sign in every yard. If there's more than 500, the compromise that the City of Atlanta asked for is that they would put one every 500 feet if it was a larger zoning than 500 parcels. That is in addition to the notice that's currently required for any so-called text amendment. So this is more notification for the lady. It does the gentleman further you. Yes, ma'am. So I understand that this process is a place for rezoning, but will this also affect when there is special land uses? The land may currently be zoned, but it may need an additional land use permit. There it is, permits to have to go out so the people can see what's going on. Will this also address special land use purposes? This only addresses the reclassification and uses that's changing a current zoning that is zoned single family and that the changes would make it multifamily. That's the only place this language falls into. The other zoning code is not impacted. If the lady thinks there's some needs that we need to do there, I'd be happy to work with you to make sure that we get that done in the future, but that's not impacted here. Nothing's taken away. No, notice is watered down or taken away, but this does not specifically impact zoning decisions that are initiated by an owner or zoning decisions not covered in lines 14 through 20. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll look in the instant of time, I'll yield the well and ask the House's favourable consideration. We have another speaker on the bill. Chair recognizes representative McLauren to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the bill. Shocker. But let's keep it a little lighter today. I don't want to talk about prisons with you today. Let's talk about trees. Trees. Let's talk about sandy springs quickly. A bunch of people in sandy springs said I moved to sandy springs 30 years ago and I moved there because it was a forest. It was a nice, wooded area where I could have my single family home live in peace. There are a lot of people in sandy springs still thankfully living that experience. It's my job here at the Capitol to represent those people. So when GDOT is building express lanes, having baked this idea years ago and already got the federal money on the way and public hearings are a little late and the people in these wooded areas of sandy springs want to know why fly over express lanes are going to go right over their property, I'm the one who has to answer for that in addition to GDOT staff. So I represent those folks but I also represent a lot of other people too. And just from a pure, raw electoral perspective, the reason I'm standing here and not a Republican is because of a lot of people in multi-family homes in sandy springs. Thousands of people who live on the north end of sandy springs whose doors I knocked on and vote builder data on who was in those apartments wasn't very good so if there's a light on in the window, I knocked because maybe I get somebody home. People who have a lot lower engagement on average with the political system, the powers that be, then these people in single family homes who again I'm proud to represent. So let's talk about trees because trees are an amenity. I moved to sandy springs because it was a forest but trees are also a wall. Trees are a barrier. If you live in a single family home in sandy springs, you might not unless you take some of these extra off road turns, you might not know how many of your neighbors live in sprawling multi-family complexes just behind the trees along Roswell Road. But there's thousands of us, I say us because I live in an apartment in a multi-family community in sandy springs. The affordable housing that we have in sandy springs, we are barely holding on to it's called naturally occurring affordable housing, NOAA. It's in the literature if you read about affordable housing. We're not building a lot of new affordable housing in sandy springs right now. We are holding, we are clutching on to the affordable housing that we have. When you look at historical pressures, we've got a few trends happening. Quick data point that I share with a colleague the other night that I think is worth thinking about. I remember hearing from somebody who studies housing and transit in my area that in the city of sandy springs, 100,000 people go into the city every day for work. 100,000 people leave the city every day for work, commute out. Only 7,000 people live and work in sandy springs. It is truly a gateway community that requires creativity, requires proactive thinking on density, housing, transit for the next decades to come. The decisions we make now will determine whether decades from now we have any communities remotely resembling the ones that the folks moved to 30 years ago or that are livable for people of all different classes like the community is now. That is a lot of preface and so I will get right to the point. This type of bill creates an incremental procedural barrier to doing more multifamily housing, more potentially affordable housing to allow for a little more density in metro Atlanta communities in response to the rush of people moving in to the state of Georgia, the metro Atlanta area driving up housing prices, making our transit issues worse and the list goes on. We have a brief respite during COVID from some of the worst of our transit issues. You guys remember driving illegally driving with the windows down during the lockdown, with only you in the road. We don't need those COVID restrictions, just me in the road. When you did that, you recognized COVID brought a little bit of relief temporarily from those transit issues, but it is coming back. Here is ultimately the question I have for you. We have a decision to make not just in sandy springs, but all over the metro about how to handle difficult questions of housing, transit, etc. To deal with density. This type of bill is fairly innocuous on its face, right? Transparency, a little bit of procedural barrier if we move from a single family zoning to multifamily zoning. But the question I want to ask you is where is our vision, where is our legislative agenda for taking the big bite, for tackling the big issues when it comes to density, finding the political will to do that, whether it is community land trusts for affordable housing within city limits, to make sure that people are not priced out of their homes by property taxes, right? I am going to invoke the legacy of a great man, Mr. Jeff Parker, who would stand on a stage in front of all of us, and with no irony or kidding in his voice would point at a PowerPoint and say, what we need in this state is $100 billion for transit. And people would laugh, because they are familiar with the way that political works are, will work around these issues. But he is not wrong. He was not wrong. If we don't think on that level, $100 billion for transit, aggressively thinking about how to keep existing communities in their homes through different legal techniques and state funding for affordable housing to make sure that works. Not just the tax break here and there to developers, not just random isolated zoning decisions at municipal level, we have to want to live with our neighbors. Not just the ones we have now, but the ones who are moving here. And so again, a knock you a son at face, this bill, but the question I have for everybody that I hope stays with all of us is when we legislate not just for 2030, but for 2050. And we think about what our communities are going to look like. Are we only going to pass legislation that incrementally moves us towards protecting a single family home status quo? Are we going to think creatively, courageously about how to build communities with more density that are cosmopolitan that meat modern needs for jobs, social life, family connectivity? Are we going to take that leap together as opposed to zooming in and only thinking about these decisions in a small way incrementally year after year? I invite you to join with me and everybody else who is trying to do this. And let's think about how to do transit, how to do housing for the next few decades to build the kind of metro Atlanta that not only do we deserve, but is inevitable. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you'll do well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute to chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will die. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1406. The eyes are 110. The nays are 51. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk agreed to caption to House Bill 1381. House Bill 1381, my brothers and gentlemen, the 164th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 80, Title 36, the official code of Georgia, and tentative relating the general provisions applicable to county municipal corporations and other governmental entities who require Water and Sewer Authority board members to complete yearly continuing training courses. I refer to the committee on Governor LaFaire's committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Stevens to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 1381 does one very simple thing. Out of the rule development council that we've met several times over the past, we've come to realize that the development authorities specifically in this bill, the Water and Sewer authorities don't require education at all whenever they go to apply for some of these grants and loans. So all this bill does, very simple, is require the Water and Sewer Authority board members to complete a yearly four hour training course, either online or in person before they can receive funds from the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority. Mr. Speaker, that's very simple what it does. It gives the board members until July of next year, 2023 to complete this course. And again, then those funds from GIFO would be freed up. Mr. Speaker, I'll take any questions if there are any. You have no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1372. House Bill 1372, members, I have Smith and 133rd. And others to be entitled to amend Title 25 of the fiscal and Georgia and it is relating to fire protection and safety. Those who revise the provisions in short title of Chapter 9, the Georgia Utility Facility Protecting Act. This bill haven't referred to the committee on energy utilities and telecommunications. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Vance Smith to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, last year we passed House Bill 449, which was a utility bill and it passed out 160 to zero, went to the Senate. They wanted to add some language. We came back during the summer and thanks to Chairman Parsons on the EUT committee. Appreciate all his help. He appointed a subcommittee, off of his committee. We had several meetings. Representative Meeks was chaired. We did all the people that served on that committee. We looked at the issues that they wanted to add and with this bill is all inclusive. We put everything in this one bill. There are 18 organizations where this group's associations, departments, everybody working together have been for about two years now discussing the update to the code on call before you dig. The number one issue in the whole bill and to all of these groups and to the contractors that do the installation is safety. Safety to our citizens, safety to them, their operators that are working on this machinery. So we've gotten together. The bill is updated. It's giving a larger window for people to call in to the Locate Company. They can call eight days ahead of time. It allows the Location Company to sketch you better than just calling two days ahead of time. So it's actually a safety bill and a more efficient bill and the way we have it structured now. You'll notice it has the first nine pages of all definitions. It's about a 33 page bill. It goes into talking about blasting and how all that is handled. But appreciate all these groups working together. And I know it's been a challenge for them. But again, thanks to Chairman Parsons and if anybody has any questions, I must speak out of yield a will. But I certainly appreciate your favourable consideration. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Tell this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of the bill. Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Of all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1372. The eyes are 160. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk agreed to caption to House Bill 1371. House Bill 1371 by Representative Jasper's the 11th and others to be entitled to act to amend chapter 1, Title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tate of Railing and General Provision regarding health. So as we provide for the creation of the Rural Health Advancement Commission, this bill then refer to the special committee on quality health care and that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The recognizes chairman Jasper's to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. During the past five years, or six years, really many of us have passed legislation to find ways to improve health care outcomes in our state. We've also passed many bills to create avenues for strengthening the health care workforce. In a very many ways, we have been successful. What we heard clearly this year in the Rural Development Council was a need to take a real hard look at addressing short and long-term health care solutions in rural Georgia. And what we see before you, Dave, is the creation of a commission to do just that. And when we sit and try to figure these things out, we saw through the people that come to see us, this Rural Health Advancement Commission was the best way forward. They'll have time to really look at it and meet bi-monthly over the period of two years. And then afterwards to look at solutions for this. The commission has 13 members. Know many of you look at that list and you're saying, what about this group that I'm interested in? Well, I've been deluged by those people. But we felt we had to put a limit on it. And stopping at 13, we know if you look at that list, these 13 people will seek out the brightest and best, concerned to find out what the needs are and the best play and create the best plan for Georgia moving forward. This will help us direct our dollars and efforts in the most seated areas that identify where gaps in training and health care and workforce. It's a high bar. We're asking these members to do. And those chosen know what's at stake to help keep us moving forward in improving health care outcomes in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd be glad to answer any questions if there are any. You have a question if you care to heal. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Dreyer to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, thank you for bringing this bill. We all want to do something to address a crisis in rural health care and health care access in Georgia. I just want to ask you this commission that we're setting up, if there was a way to get approximately $1 billion extra dollars in health care funds in Georgia on an annual basis, would that be helpful for these commissioners to make a dent in the lack of health care access in some communities in rural Georgia? I think the best thing will be to pass this bill and let these 13 members decide what's best. And also, I think, um, four-lear lots, explanation of additional dollars for Georgia was very good this morning. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on House Bill 1371? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable, to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Well, vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Mallow rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that if we fully expanded Medicaid in the state, that would address some of the short-term and long-term issues facing rural Georgia and health care? Well, I think there's an honest debate on that representative. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1371. The eyes are 156. The nays are four. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1396. House Bill 1396, by the way, year to 150 second and others to be entitled back to a man.

Chapter 32, Title 36, the official to Georgia and Teta relating municipal courts. So if you create the Georgia and municipal court clerks council, this bill I've referred to the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends the dis bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Yeardin to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House I bring you House Bill 1396. This bill would simply just recognize the municipal courts clerk council as a statutory, given them statutory recognition in the state or make them a state entity. This will help them with standardizing municipal courts in the state of Georgia, bring further professionalism to the courts and their administration of the courts. Best practices, if you will. It will also help them aid in seeking grants for the creation of a municipal court clerk's certification program. This will basically be an entity that represents the needs of the municipal court clerks in the state. They also plan on developing mentorship programs and implementing a number of training programs. This will again allow them to apply for grants and certainly serving as a mayor I know the importance of municipal courts in the community. I think they're probably the largest class of courts. I think they're over 300 70 in the state from very small communities to the city of Atlanta. And I've actually had judges to call me and express support for this bill. They know the importance of what it can mean to efficiently and professionally run the middle courts in the state of Georgia. And I just asked for your favor consideration on this bill and I'll be glad to entertain any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you, sir. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1396, the eyes are 162. The nays are two. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll read the caption to House Bill 1437. It's on the supplemental calendar. House Bill 1437, our representative, Blackman of the 146 and others to be entitled to amend chapter 7 to title 48. The fish go to Georgia, annotated, related to income taxes. So it sort of buys the rates of taxation on income. This bill have referred to the committee on ways and means. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, chairman Blackman to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Bring before you House Bill 1437, also been referred to as a tax reduction and reform act of 2022. Just a little background early last year, considering the year-to-year revenue increases along with some of the modernization of various parts of our tax code. Speaker Ralston tasked us with looking at responsible tax cut reforms for the upcoming session. So, after many months of studying and modeling and looking at various iterations and discussing with proposals with CPAs, high level economists and a host of other stakeholders looking at proposals all across the political spectrum. We settled in on an option that is simple and fair and allows Georgians to keep a larger portion of their harder and dollars. The proposal that you have before you wraps many of our existing exemptions up to into a much larger $12,000 and $24,000 plus a $3,000 dependent standard exemption while preserving the option to itemize at the federal level. We also lower and simplify the rate to a flat 5.25. And this will keep more money in our citizens' pockets, especially for those that need at the most. A family of four, for instance, will not pay one penny, not one penny of state income tax on their first $30,000 of income. That same family of four at $50,000 of income will see an over $400 reduction in taxes. My wife, before we got married, as a single mother, would have saved nearly $300 annually under this proposal. And overall, it translates to an estimated $1 billion that we return to the taxpayers of Georgia. Additionally, in with savings across the board, we believe this tax cut reform will make us more competitive for wage earners at every income level. And thereby making Georgia an even better place to live, work, and raise a family. So to summarize, this plan lowers the rate. It significantly raises a standard exemption. It's simple, it's fair, and allows Georgians to keep more of their money. And I think most of y'all know I've got a two-year-old at home. So if you'll indulge me, I have a good friend who suggested that. I tell a story from time to time when I get up here. And he loves the movie The Grinch. I don't know if any of y'all seen the newest version of that from 2018. But he will recite at two years old the first part of that. And he will sit in the way it goes as it says, past the place where you come from, far beyond what you've seen. Well, as a town like your town, if your town was a dream. Chokes me up a little bit, I'm sorry. We would not be in this position to do what we've done in this budget, Chairman England. We would not be in this position to give taxpayers more their own money. We would not be in a position to take care of Georgians. We're not for the dozens and dozens of those that came before us with a dream of what this Georgia could be, what this Georgia should look like, and what our economy could become. So thank you to all of them that came before us and made this possible. As to speaker, I'll be happy to answer questions. If there are any questions, I ask this body for its favorable consideration and I yield the will. We do have other members who wish to be heard. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise to ask you to vote no on HB1437. And the reason why I'm asking you to vote no is because I'm asking you to vote no on raising taxes on over 500,000 Georgians. To be clear, HB1437 is not a tax cut for all. Analysis done by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute shows that this bill will actually raise taxes on hundreds of thousands of voters. Now I do recognize that it will it will decrease taxes on some, but most of the people who will see a decrease in taxes, that decrease will only be about $73 a year or less than $6 a month. This is a so this increase burden that we will see on over 500,000 Georgia individuals and families. This increase in taxes can be up to $600 per year. So who will see this increase? Because I think that is important. This increase will be on middle class voters and families making between 38,000 and 150,000 if the bulk of that being to those making 64,000 to 109,000. So to vote for this is a vote to raise their taxes by hundreds of dollars per year. Right now our economy is recovering from the pandemic. And because of that we are seeing record price increases. We're seeing inflation. Not to mention we're in the midst of a war. Right now is not the time to raise taxes on some Georgians on any Georgians. This bill is also a spending bill. This bill will cost our state over $1 billion. I find it curious that a bill with a billion plus dollar impact does not have a publicly available fiscal note. The members of the committee did not have a fiscal note. In fact this bill was debated for less than five minutes. Number one billion dollars and less than five minutes to talk about it in full committee. Where will we cut one billion dollars from our budget? Because I think that's important. We have a lot of ambitions in this chamber. It's the year of mental health. It's the year of education and all these other things that we claim that we care about. Well if we cut one billion dollars from our budget we're going to have to cut from education. We're going to have to cut from healthcare. That includes rural health care which we clearly care a lot about because we pass several bills about rural health care. We are going to have to cut from mental health. So this bill costs over a billion dollars. This bill raises taxes on over 500,000 Georgians. This bill is not good policy at this point in time. I ask you to really consider this especially if you represent one middle class voter. Think about the impact on them. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues I'm all for helping hard work in Georgians who need a break in these tough times right now. Very expensive times. But let's talk about who this bill actually helps. This is an incredibly regressive bill. The majority of the cost, about 620 million dollars a year is going to go exclusively to fund tax cuts for the top 20% of Georgians. Those families making over about 110,000 dollars a year. As my colleague just mentioned, it actually raises taxes on about 10% of Georgians. Those who are earning less than $24,000 a year, they'll get less than half of them will even get a tax cut. We are effectively raising taxes on the working poor. That's what this bill will do. And we're only able to do so thanks to the budget surplus that we have from the American Rescue Plan, which the majority party is happy to claim while bashing our president, even though Georgia Republicans not a single one of them supported that measure. So let's keep that in perspective. This bill has been rushed through in an election year because it's going to look good on a mailer. But it's not smart policy for Georgia and ask you to oppose it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Maynard rise? Parliamentary and inquiry. State, jury and inquiry. Is it not true that I wanted to ask one of the speakers about line 106 because it says for each dependent of a taxpayer there's a $3,000 advantage. I wanted to understand why they felt like that was not positive. You didn't have that opportunity, so I certainly wouldn't pretend to speak for them. What purpose does the majority caucus whip representative Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary and inquiry. State, jury and inquiry. Is it not true that I appreciate the work that the author has done on this bill and it has a lot of very good points in it. The one concern that I do have is the lack of a fiscal note and that is the primary reason that I am voting no today. Gentlemen, so states, what purpose does representative Malo rise? Parliamentary and inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that the state of Georgia has not returned any money back to the federal government from the American Rescue Plan as a state? I will find that out from Chairman England. What purpose does the chair of the Ways and Means Committee rise? Parliamentary and inquiry. Is it the fiscal impact roughly a billion dollars that will go back in the hands of hard work in Georgians? That is my understanding. What purpose does Chairman Collins rise? Parliamentary and inquiry. Is it not true that while a lot of other states were shut down, our state kept on working hard through the pandemic? That is entirely true. And there's still a plan for it. All right, one more parliamentary inquiry. What about the representative? What purpose does representative Becky Evans rise? Parliamentary and inquiry. The state of inquiry. Is it not true that there are 7,000 Georgians with disabilities waiting for now-comp waivers in the state of Georgia? If the lady is so states, I am sure she is taking a look at that. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1437, the eyes are 115. The nays are 52. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. All right, this House will be in recess for lunch until 1.30 p.m.
