Spakin ladies and gentlemen. I want to bring everybody's attention Hopefully you can remember this bill from last year Alfa lot of discussion for years. I've been in broad being on the old House industry committee 34 years ago when I was elected And it lived through the the wars and the pits and the turmoil that surrounded the coin operated amusement business in Georgia Few years back probably about 14 years ago Co-am enforcement was set over to the lottery as was the commissions that came out of it Now y'all may remember last year I had told you that these co-am machines some people love them some people don't But it is what it is and it's a real fact of life that people do like the game the courts a long time ago Ruled that non cash redemption is legal in the state of Georgia. That's what these machines are about One of the things that we had attempted to do over the last three years was to basically put some tools into place That would stop any illegal cash payouts of machines and the process of that There's a lot of things that I'd like to tell you about government bureaucracy some of that ain't exactly real pleasant or real kind The way they do rule and regmaity So last year we brought a bill forward Passed it out of this house went to the Senate came back and now we've amended this bill I'm gonna tell you a few things this in the bill First it puts the co-am division of the lottery under the administrative procedures act So that they have to publicize their rules and regs We have had a situation we suspected for years that the enforcement division over there in some points were being very unfair about how they administered justice to these folks Took their businesses suspended their licenses took their assets Would not a how to do an explanation Quite frankly has been some litigation and to pass about the unfair taking of property in this petition So this puts that division of the lottery under the administrative procedures act There's a second section here that allows a portion and this would be Representative Evans language that she's been very passionate about it would allow portion of the reserves That 10% of the excess reserves would be a portion for educational purposes and programs Ladies and gentlemen that gives the house and the legislature a little bit more of authority that we've lost over the years in the appropriation process $50 a cap the class A machines that we all consider to be the kid games the cranes and that kind of stuff That for the last 50 years has been a $5 cap so it puts a $50 cap on whatever prize is in that type of a machine It defines the gift cards finally after 20 years or 18 years of being Not able to do it. This would allow gift cards It would be a progressive system that it goes into effect and in a couple of years It would be mandatory that they do gift cards Right now they can do replays or they can do lottery tickets or they can do gift certificates And that moves it forward to setting a standard That anyone that is caught paying out of cash Then they were too stupid to be in business finds Class A those same kid games were talking about as As it's typical of the regulators over there they were finding these companies a thousand dollars for being late on renewing the license on a kids game Provides multi-year licensing right now on all of these A and B machines Where they pay an annual licenses would allow them to get a license for one two or three years just by multiplying the license fees Clarifies non cash redemption When a little bit further into this so that we move forward that we're doing a clear and a definitive explanation Allows kiosk machines at some point when these Non-gash redemption cards or issued these kiosk it can be possibly located in these would take the place of the clerks So that we're trying to remove any possibility of any wrongdoing in any of these stores Alchons it allows the Georgia Lottery Commission to do one competitive master license once every three years But also and more importantly to get rid of any signs of impropriety that has been in the past That if a company loses their master license Then instead of just being steered to another master to buy then there'll be auctioned off Ladies and gentlemen, that's common sense fairness in government opinion letters Like the revenue any agency that is charged with Formulating rules and regulations that we've given them the authority Most of these will issue opinion letters so this keeps those people from stepping a file That's been asked for in the past and the co-am division that the lottery has steadfast refused to do it So they to go in at some point and catch somebody for making some kind of error that if they'd been given an opinion that they would have known better Childable institutions veterans groups VFWs and vets legends These will now be able to have these machines with a 50% rule Being expanded to the three months cycle quarterly cycle instead of a monthly cycle Merchandising the people that serve the masters that bring machines in and I'm not talking about these machines It's not the old days when these machines were the $500 or $1,000 machines these machines these entertainment machines today Or up to 20,000 plus dollars a piece This basically spells out so it's not considered to be an inducement for the business They can bring into stools they can bring into rugs they can bring in the signage Believe it or not to the lottery commission has always said that if you if a Master decides to put a sign up in that store that tells people what the rules of the game are And that is non-cash that that was considered an inducement this clearly spells out what they can put in as an inducement 1099 forms ladies and gentlemen 1099 form you would think that any company or anybody else that is doling out any receipts issue a 1099 To the recipients they refused to do that in the past We're telling them at that division you got to issue a 1099 Who is that good for quite frankly is good for the state of Georgia So now nobody can skip around and not pay any taxes on any of this and then finally last but not least Tax increase You know as you may remember the last year That I told you that these co-am machines are the highest taxed industry in the state of Georgia Not only do they pay Extra ordinarily high fees for licenses for the stickers that go on the machines and such as that But they also pay a straight-up 10% across the board On whatever goes into the machine five percent comes out of the retailer five percent comes out of the master We were asked at the start of the session To raise that tax from 10 to 13 percent There were initiatives or some of the leadership of the house For something that I considered to be very good and that was to do universal pre-K Well as usual in dealing with the governor 160 million dollars was the formula for pre-K 200 million would be the the magic number to do universal pk pre-K At that point I am told that the governor refused even though Your state lottery has two point two billion dollars in reserves 2.2 billion in reserves So when brought up to these folks in the co-am business They agreed I will tell you that I'm very pleased that they did agree They didn't bulk They understood that surprise And they support very much the pre-K movement in this state Now that being said I got a few other comments I want to make You know I told y'all last year what a hard issue this is to deal with Because you have too many people Roming around that have an interest Whether it's individual masters or the retailers or the companies that serve The manufacturers and such like that and everybody wants to gain the system for their own benefit Well, I want to give credit to the speaker and his staff Forfairting all of this out And to stepping in to try to help that and my pleas with everything it was taken out. No, I'm not But do I think that this is a good bill as passed right now? Yes, I do Because one it creates a gift card system instead of to trick take away any idea of any criminal activity apparently cash Do I believe that it cleans up some stuff over with the regulators? Yes, I do I told you last year if we didn't do anything else but gift cards and put them under administrative procedures act That we will have achieved something at that point So ladies and gentlemen with my thanks to the speaker and his staff for tolerating minds mind assistants of this I want to thank

I would appreciate the members of this House voting for this bill. And that, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions if there are any. You have several. Do you live, Representative Stacey Evans has a question? Representative Evans? Yes sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I certainly will. Isn't it true that you and I have talked about legislation around co-imm industries for a while, and that I very much appreciate your hard work in this legislation? I hope you do. So is it sure it has been a painstaking affair? We're going to have trust falls later. Further inquiry, or will you yield for one more? Certainly. Isn't it true that I have historically not wanted to support any changes in legislation around the co-imm industry without an increase in the percentage that the industry pays the state for hope and pre-K, and that not only does this bill do that, but as you mentioned, also adds language that will start freeing up the over $1 billion in excess reserves that we have sitting in the lottery for education fund, which will ensure on the low end probably $50 million a year for pre-K and on the high end $100 million. And this could be a game changer for the state, for families, and for kids, and that I literally can't thank you enough for your work that's gotten us here today. The lady is certain she's very complimentary and I appreciate that, and she knows from what she speaks about the funds over at the lottery commission. Thank you. Thank you. To your left, Representative Workhizer. Chairman Workhizer has a question, Mr. Chairman, if you yield. Yes, sir. Thanks, Speaker. And Chairman, if you yield, I want to echo the state's evidence comments about, I don't think anybody in this bill knows more about this industry, and I appreciate you cleaning it up. Just a question on 31, because I'm always for adding more stuff to the APA. Can you help me with saying removing Article 2 from the APA? If you would give me the line number, that bill. The line 31 and 32. Yes, sir. And I think that's the language that puts the Co-Am division under the administrative procedure act. Okay, so put some money, because it says, shall be exempt on 32. You know, I'm not a lawyer, I didn't write the bill. But you're saying it does add up to this. Sometimes it's in life. Lawyers write things backwards to make them mean what they're supposed to mean. And I appreciate your judgment, because like I said, I appreciate your effort in cleaning up this industry and I've always been amazed that you're a knowledge and I appreciate your work. I want to thank you very much for the support. You have one last question, if you'll, you'll represent Jasmine Clark to your left as a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I know you have worked extremely hard on this, and so I just want to make sure that I am understanding when a person gets one of these gift cards. There are deems one of the gift cards. Are they allowed to buy fire arms and alcohol with their winnings? They can buy any legal product. So including fire arms and alcohol. Any legal product. But if they buy that, if they want enough points to buy fire, am I saying they're extremely lucky and they need to go to Vegas? Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there's no more questions, I'll step aside and I'll apologize to some of the interest in the state that things were taken out. They could have meant of a help to them, like a graduated penalty system in contract 101 interpretation. But maybe we'll get that in if it goes to the Senate. And I do want to thank the speaker and his staff for being so courteous to put up and tolerate me. And that, Mr. Speaker, I'll step aside and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We appreciate your hard work. Is there an objection to adopting the adoption of the House Amendment? That's your here's doing it. The House Amendment is adopted.

The changes before you really are nothing more than housekeeping. You'll notice on line 162 and 166.

Mental Coordination. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Clerk. 221 Chairman Parrish, you ready to go? The rules chairman of this house, Chairman Parrish, is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I would ask this house to agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House. Representative Parrish, it moves that this house agreed to the Senate substitute of House Bill 1339 as amended by the House. What are you ready to capture? House Bill 1339, a bill to be entitled back to amend Title 31 of the Fisher go to George Anitetti relating to the House's revised relative to certificate of need. Chairman Parrish is recognized to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, if you remember, we passed House Bill 1339 out of the House with a vote of 166 to 1, I believe. It went over to the Senate and they took a perfectly good bill and made some changes and that's what came back over here to us. And what I'm asking you to do now, the bill that came back to us was quite different than the bill that we sent over there to them. And I'm going to get into the bill and try to run through it and explain some of the changes to you and then I'll be happy to answer some questions. But I'd like to ask you to think about something as we deal with this. This subject has been around a long time. We've been working for a long time trying to make some changes and seele in some meaningful changes that would help. The priority of the speaker when he became speaker and he said this on numerous occasions. His goal was to increase access to quality health care, quality affordable health care to every Georgian all over this state, regardless of their zip code. And I think this is a step in the right direction. This is not the beginning and the end all of everything. You'll hear more about this in the days and years to come, I think. And I'm asking you to think about this like the budget. When Chairman Hatchett presents the budget, we can look at that and I think every one of us can look at that budget and find some things in the budget that we like. We can look at it and find some things in the budget that we don't like. But what we're going to have to do in my mind is look at the big picture of this. We have had input starting back in the summer, this past summer, last year. We went around the state, we met, we had seele in hearings, we had a bipartisan group that listened, we had suggestions from anybody that wanted to come and talk to us. We listened and tried to take those suggestions and come up with the recommendations and that's where we base our recommendations when we first drew 1339. The Senate had some different ideas on that and that came back in that fashion. Let me just share just a few things with you that I think that might be helpful to you. If you remember, the hospital down in Cuthbert, Georgia closed. There's a provision in here that allows that hospital to reopen without having to go back through the certificate of need process. One of the things that we have heard so much about was the way the process worked. We felt like it's antiquated, it's too cumbersome, it's too expensive, it's too drawn out. We have provisions in here that will make that move faster. It'll streamline it, it'll make it more modern and it will affect change in a faster way that'll help us to affect change in the healthcare system and hopefully give better healthcare and hold the cost down as we deal with that. The hospital in Cuthbert could open. More house medical school came to us and wanted to have a hospital to tie in with their university or their school when they're graduating their medical doctors. This would allow that to happen as well. One of the things that you probably have heard from some of your hospitals is the idea of the surgical centers. When we first started y'all remember we had folks on one end of the spectrum that wanted to do absolutely zero changes. We had folks on the other end who wanted to change everything, including CON and do away with it. What we tried to do is bring these two together and come up with some changes that were common sense that made center and moved us in the right direction in a thoughtful way so that we are moving in the right direction. And make changes as we go down the road to make that happen. One of the other things that we heard from a lot of our hospitals was that when they got ready to replace equipment in their hospitals in the CON, the way it is now, there were caps on the equipment. If you wanted to replace an MRI machine and the cost of a new machine was over that cap, you had to end up getting, go through CON to make that happen. This removes those caps. If you want to replace a machine that you have, you can do that without having to go through the CON process. If you offer a new service, you still go through the CON process to do that. One of the things that we have done in here also is there was interest in locating hospitals in rural Georgia. There is a provision in here that you can build a new hospital in a rural county. That's your counties of 50,000 or less, as long as you do certain things. And there's a litany of things that you must provide if that hospital. And to be quite honest with you, if I think any of us would like to have a hospital like that in our area, if they agreed to either become like a teaching hospital, to be a member of the trauma network and meet certain specifications and requirements, to have an intake 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, and accept behavioral and psychiatric patients that would come in as well as the emergency hospital. These are just some of the things that we have put in there and tried to balance. And remember this, whatever we do with this, we have to have an agreement with our friends across the building over there too. So we have tried to take the best of what we had in there and merge it with what was presented to us from them that they wanted to do. I can go into as much detail as you want to or we can maybe make a few more remarks and then I'll be happy to answer any questions you have and try to do that. But ladies and gentlemen, I think this is an absolute good first step in trying to make a change. I encourage you, most of this bill is the same as we passed in 1339 out of this house with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. And I'm hoping that we'll have that today. So Mr. Speaker, if there are questions, I'll be glad to yield to them. Yes, sir, you have a couple of questions. I thought you might. Yes, sir. Reps. Owl to your right. I see Owl. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. First of all, I deeply respect your work and your commitment to this effort. Three real questions, not isn't a true question, but real questions. First question. You said the goal of this bill is to increase access to quality affordable health care. In lines 42 through 44, it allows for CON exceptions or health care entities that are owned and managed by private equity, which has been shown. To drive up health care costs and decrease quality of care. How does that increase access to quality affordable health care? In some areas, I think these would have health care facilities that otherwise without additional capital probably would not be there. And I think that's one thing that does. And let me mention this to you too. We could give a health care card to everybody in this state period. If we don't have enough health care providers out there, the doctors, the nurses, the dentists, whoever to see and treat these people, we haven't solved the problem. We've partially solved the problem. I believe this is a good way for us to move into that and move in that direction. Gentlemen, you have for the second of three questions. Yes, ma'am. Second question. Line 818. Dictates that health care entities qualifying for CON exception provide uncompensated and charity care in an amount equal to or greater than 3%. Generally speaking, for nonprofit hospitals and health care entities that is closer to 5%, as much as 8%, this is significantly lower than that to qualify for these quite lucrative exceptions. Can you explain how that would increase access to quality affordable health care? The bill that we passed out of the house, we had a 5% of growth or net or growth, whichever. The other side had a 10%. So it was a matter of how you're going to measure it. And we felt like that 3% was a good rule. And that this will be it. So we looked at as we go along and the community health will be looking at that to make sure that they're living up to it. But there are much more strict requirements in here for furnishing that information. And if you don't meet these requirements, then you can be penalized monetarily for that. So I think that that will make sure that these people provide at least what they're required to do. You'll yield for one final question. Yes, ma'am. Indulgence. One of the reasons that we've seen hospital closures, especially in rural areas, but including in urban areas, is that Georgia has the second highest and insurance rate in the nation. And the highest cost to a hospital system is its uncompensated care costs. That is related to having a very high and insurance rate in the state. Does this bill extend health insurance coverage to a single uninsured Georgian? I think I understand where you're going with this and I appreciate that. Over on the Senate today, there was an attempt to pass a Medicaid expansion and it did not pass. So I think that what we need to do is do what we can with what we've got to work with to provide these services for as many people as we can around the state. Thank you so much. You are. I appreciate your work. I'm very disappointed in this bill. Thank you. Jettelman, you yield for another question. Yes, sir. The data this house represents Gerald Green has a question.

Thank you. Thank you miss Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes sir. Mr. Chairman, it is with the grateful applaud from South Georgia that you have placed in this particular substitute here. An opportunity to open our hospital on an emergency room and a couple of rooms down there. Is it not further true that there's an allocation in the Congress right now that's been set aside for over six million dollars if we are able to pass this particular piece of legislation? Yes sir. That's my understanding and this would provide health care in an area that really we some of us have considered a health care desert. This is desperate need of it. Thank you. Reptile in advance to your right in the back of the room has a question. Yes sir. Is it genuine yield? Yes sir. With all the work you have and your committee have done on this bill, am I to be confident that you agree and support this Senate substitute and is it as it is in keeping with your original goal that you worked on for so long? Yes sir. Thank you for that question. It's like I mentioned to you about the budget. You know we started with what we thought was a good place we should be. But as we've gone through this process and had to deal with others and we have listened to the stakeholders out there too. The hospitals, the provider groups, individuals, anybody that came and talked to us and expressed some concerns or suggestions. We tried to take those and incorporate as many of them as we could. Let me be the first to tell you this bill is not perfect. I don't think I've seen a perfect bill since I've been down here. But I'll tell you this. I think it's a great start in the right direction to help us get health care out here to some of our areas in Georgia that needed. One of the things that we are expanding is the period of care across the state. This is something we've all been concerned about with the infant mortality and maternal mortality that Georgia does not do well in as we would like. This will help us to get to that part. So I think that's it. And then also working to increase the affordable or access to beds for our behavioral health patients in a more timely fashion. I think that will make a big difference in that too. So thank you for your question. Mr. Chairman, will part to your left right out in front of you? You have a question. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Parish, do you yield for a few questions? Yes, sir. Is it not true that I also appreciate your passion on trying to address health care in Georgia? Yeah, I have concerns that this bill does not go far enough. Yes, sir. Thank you. Is it not true that since 2010, nine rural hospitals in Georgia have closed down, whereas in the state of Arkansas where they expand and Medicaid, not a single rural hospital has shut down. I'm not aware of that, but I'm sure if you give me those numbers, I'm sure you've checked it out. Well, you'll for a few more questions. Yes, sir. Is it not true that this bill does not cover a single, uninsured Georgian, but it creates opportunities for more facilities in which they would still face one of the primary challenges here in the state, which is uncompensated health care costs. Let me explain something to you from a little bit different perspective. This house has been a leader for years in expanding health care coverage in the state. All you've got to do is think back on the number of federally qualified health centers that this house has funded as startups all across this state. And now I think they're in like 139 out of all of our counties. That for someone who has no coverage or no care, they can go there and they're treated and they pay according to their ability to pay. And so to me, that's one thing we've done to help that. Starting a new medical school down in Savannah, that's one thing we're providing health care providers. It'll be out taking care of people. A new dental school that's coming online in Savannah. That's another thing. So this house has been a leader not just this year, but for many years in this to expand the pool of health care workers if you would. The nurses, how many schools have we helped to expand in the university system as well as the technical college system? So yes, so I think we have worked hard to do it. But to answer your question, no. One final question. Is it not true that again, while I appreciate some of the incremental progress this bill will provide, again, it falls far short of addressing Georgia's health care challenges in which we have the highest uninsured rate along with some of the worst health care outcomes in the United States of America. And part because of the failure to expand Medicaid as passed by nearly 40 other states, including North Carolina very recently. I agree with some of what you said and I agree that we've got some problems and we're working on them and we're trying to address them. Does this address all of it? No, it does not, but I still would continue and hope you would realize that this goes a long way. And I certainly like to have your support. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, representing Newton to your right. And those little bit about health care. Let's see what he's got. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, with the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. First, I do want to thank you for this. I think that the work put into this is incredible and is a good step forward. I did notice on line 510, ambulatory surgery centers. For example, ambulatory surgery centers are still capped at the 2.5 million. I can just tell you anybody who's done construction recently knows that we may need those caps raised at some point. But I also noticed in section 12, you've got that comprehensive health coverage commission that's still in this. Is that one of the roles that that commission would play is to look at things like that in the future. If 2.5 million dollars doesn't, doesn't get you a fully fully formed surgery center. Absolutely. Thank you for bringing that up. And that's one of the reasons that we remove the caps on the equipment in there. In the past, we've had a number and it was adjusted for inflation sometime, but honestly, it didn't keep up with the new technology of equipment that goes up. The prices were going faster than the cap was. And let me mention something about section 12. This is where the comprehensive health coverage commission is created. Let me share that with you a little bit. This commission shall consist of nine members who will be appointed. The chairperson will be a subject matter expert on health policy. She'll not be an employee of the state of Georgia and be appointed by the governor. Three 9 legislative members will be appointed by the speaker of the house. Three nine legislative members will be appointed by the president of the Senate. One 9 legislative member is appointed by the minority leader of the Senate. One 9 legislative member will be appointed by the minority leader of the House. These shall not be registered lobbyists. They'll serve without compensation. The purpose of the commission will be to advise the governor, the General Assembly, and the Department of Community of Health as the administrator of state medical assistance program on issues relating to access, quality of health care for Georgia's low income and uninsured populations. And it will also be tasked with reviewing opportunities related to reimbursement and funding for Georgia health care providers, including premium assistance programs. Opportunities related to quality improvement of health care for Georgia's low income and uninsured populations. Opportunities to enhance service, delivery, and coordination of health care among state agencies. And subject to, and so yes sir, that in my mind that's where we will get information from people who be looking at this to make the recommendations back to the Department of Community Affairs, to the governor's office, and to the legislature about what we need to be doing, and certainly that would be one of the things to be considered. Thank you. The gentleman further yield. Yes sir. Just to wrap that up though, as you mentioned though, without a workforce and without facilities, a card in your pocket doesn't do much good. We've been working on workforce and isn't this a step forward for rural hospitals, for perinatal care, birthing centers, and for mental health that it's going to be a big step forward for Georgia. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. You go for another question. Yes sir. Let's see. You have several. I recognize Chairman Halkins right at the center aisle for a question. Is Jim and yield? Yes sir. Isn't it true that the issues of health care vary across the state like the mountains to the coastal and the flat plains of South Georgia? Yes sir. Do you further yield? Isn't it true that with this situation that we face every year, isn't a much better plan to have a veritable access and providing different pathways to health care? Yes sir. In one last question. Yes sir. This is not the end of the road for us. What we again, 25, 26, 27 on into the future, keep addressing the access and good quality health care for all Georgians. Absolutely. Thank you for your work. Thank you for your help with your health committee and all the issues that you face and the work that you all have done and a lot of the recommendations that we have in this legislation came out of work that came to your committee. Thank you. Representative Buckner to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. A wise man once said that I shouldn't let the great get in the way of the good and I'm really trying not to do that but I have lobbied and worked very hard for Medicaid expansion by whatever name it's called for a long time and I still hope that we'll come to that at some point in the near future. I also worked for a hospital for many years so I know a little bit about certificate of need from both sides. My question that concerns me is I know in the house version with all the interest and concern that we've had about maternal mortality. That we had a requirement for the centers that did birthing or provided any of those services to have a relationship that was a requirement. I've looked through the bill in on 724, 743 and 763. It's got words that trouble me where it says that the hospitals shall not un reasonably deny a transfer agreement or affiliation with one of those centers. Can you help me understand what an unreasonable denial is or a reasonable denial? I think you've got to read a little above that as well when we're talking about the birthing centers there and one reason the birthing centers are in here is that's an effort to combat exactly what you just said about perinatal or infant mortality and those sort of things like that that we want to work on. And for those that want to have a birthing center they need to be able to have an agreement with a hospital if complications arise so that they can do that. It just basically says the hospital cannot un reasonably deny that agreement. And then in there also there's some more conversation in there. If you look further down around line 758 and so that when they go to a birthing center if it's a normal healthy birth that we're looking at by 20 weeks of gestation and they're healthy with that everything is fine but if by chance they develop complications and everything then they revert that to the hospital as opposed to having them still come to the birthing center in an effort to make sure that they receive the proper prenatal care and they're ready when they do deliver that delivery would be successful and have a good outcome. I appreciate the work I'm struggling with what I'm going to do. Well I understand that but I'm sure that you're going to agree with me that we can't let perfection stand in the way of us doing some good things and I promise you this is an effort for us to do some good things and I hope you'll book yes. Thank you. Representative Lynn Smith, Sarah, Mr. Chairman, has a question. Yes. Thank you, gentlemen yields. Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that when I came to the General Assembly and started serving in 1997 it's a new legislator that I was told to speak to represent a butch parish if I had any questions about health care? Is it not true that as the state's population has doubled in size since that point in time? Is it not also true that our issues are more and more complicated because of our increasing population and density that you have been a steady hand in God of this General Assembly through this long, long journey? Well, thank you very much and I'll tell you one thing I've learned about this journey is that once you learn something I find out how much I don't know, it's a complex issue and I think anybody in health care would agree it's a very complex issue but thank you. Representative Oliver to your left has a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I'm going to continue what is a very sincere expression of appreciation and respect for the work you have done. However, Sarah, this is a very harsh reality to me that my bias that CON and business interest in health care have distracted us from the real goal of improving the health care of 500,000 uninsured George's. I feel again and unfortunately this has happened before that I have been led down a path and maybe I know it's not the house that has failed in our effort to expand Medicaid. It may not even be on this floor that the expansion of Medicaid is being denied. But, sir, I cannot vote for a bill today that does not expand Medicaid. Isn't that true? Well, I appreciate your comments and I certainly understand your position and we've talked about this many times and I still would get back to you that we can do a lot of good here. It doesn't quite get to the issue that you raised and I hope we'll continue to work together on that. Representative Lot to your right, has a question? Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I too would like to say thank you for this legislation. I think that you've done an incredible job and put a lot of effort into it and I know that this is kind of a grown and shrunk and grown and shrunk over the years but very appreciative of the work that you've done. I'm just, is it not true for this sake of some in this legislature that in 2019 we did expand Medicaid in the Georgia Pathways program and that because of the way that we did that in 2019, 710,000 Georgians between the level of 100 and 138 percent of the FPL currently have fully subsidized private insurance and they would not have that if we had done our expansion of Medicaid a different way, the way of the ACA. And is it not further true that in 2019 when we passed the legislation, it was delayed until July of this year due to the Obama, due to the Biden administration stopping us from moving ahead until our lawsuit was relieved and I would just like to say for again the sake of the new members of this House that we're not here, that it, the members in your community that are uninsured have an opportunity for insurance and that we should all stand up for them. Thank you. Chair, I would like to thank the members of the House of the House of the State for providing the opportunity to make sure that we have a lot more questions but I would like to recognize for a question. Chair, I would like to thank you for your work on this bill and I especially appreciate the fact that we included safety guards around the birthing center as that is especially important to public health and are working on infant and maternal mortality so thank you for those guardrails of like if there are any complications then they have to be seen by the hospital and cannot continue in the birthing centers. And I do have a question about what Representative Newton brought up and would ask that you look at this in both bills from the Senate, from the House first and the Senate, the cap on building they were removed and so now they are gone and I wonder if that's a scribblers area if somehow there was a mistake made because these, the lines were struck in both of the bills and I would ask that you would look at this because as Representative Newton said, it probably somebody today said you couldn't build an outhouse for 2.5 million so I think it's something that really does need to look at. Thank you very much. Thank you for the question. We have made an honest effort to try to remove as many roadblocks as we can and to streamline and modernize the seal in process so that we go through there and we have many exemptions that are in here but we still have some guard rails that we hope will keep us on the right track as we work through this but this is certainly not the end of everything. Miss Speaker, I don't want to take everybody's time. I know there are probably some other questions I'll be happy to talk to them or whatever. There may be some others that would want to speak. I'll take one more question. No speakers. Reps. He Parsons to your left. He weighs. Reps. He percol to your right. Has a question. That's your last question, Bill. Yes, sir. Thank you, Miss Speaker. It is Jim and you. Yes, sir. So, and if you cover this before I apologize and I apologize to the members as I was writing down but it appears to be that you did increase in this bill to $100 million the rural hospital tax credit that we know for a fact has saved many rural hospitals in this state. It also provides flexibility in donations, additional flexibility and it extends the sunset that would expire this year without this bill to 2029. This is a vital part of rural health care and I thank you for including this part because it absolutely for a fact has kept rural hospitals open. No question about it. And thank you for making that point. I should have mentioned that as the very first thing. Miss Pick, I'm going to sit down and ask for their favorable consideration but before I do that I want to thank your office and the people in there who work with us, folks in legislative counsel that you can't believe the number of hours that have been, that have gone into getting us to where we are and all the folks who have worked with us, the team and it's just been a real team effort and I'm just happy to be part of that team. I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. You're right, Mr. Chairman, not a hard work, not just days and weeks but years. Is there any objection to adopt to the House amendment? But you're here, none in the House amendment is adopted. On the General's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1339 as amended by the House. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The Clerk will lock the machines. This House has agreed to the Senate substitute as amended by the House of House Bill 1339. The yeas are 95, the nays are 68 and the House has agreed. For what purposes represent the parish, rise? You won't be recognized for a motion. Chair recognizes Chairman Tyler Paul Smith for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I made this House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 827. Does any Smith moves that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 827, 827? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill number 827 to be entitled next to a men code section 16820 of the EFIS. Go to George Anatetti relating to livestock theft so as to provide for increased penalties. Senator Tyler Paul Smith is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is our livestock theft bill. The only change that was made, this House had included a language to provide for a specific trespass statute for zoos and basically those facilities that have exotic animals that are on display. That would provide penalties for those who commit the offense of trespass at these zoos. These incidents obviously a lot of times end up with the animal attacking the trespasser and the animal having to be put down more times than not. These animals usually cost thousands if not hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. We thought this was a good policy to protect especially our animals here at Zootland and Ms. Speaker, that is the change that you have one question for you. Sure. Representative Miller has a question to your left and the back. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman use? I do. Is it not true that part of this bill, the part dealing with zoos and aquariums and places where wild animals are housed for educational purposes, was a result of bipartisan work. It was very well-covid and desired by the Atlanta Zoo and zoos all across the state of Georgia and it is designed to keep both people and the wild animals who are we who we are entrusted with safe. I would agree with the general lady on that point. Thank you for the bill. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You had well-nastest bodies, favorable consideration. On the general's motion that this House agreed to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 827, all those in favor will vote. Yes, all those opposed will vote no in the clerk. Unlock the machines. I have all members voted. All members voted. That's so, Mr. Clerk, where you locked the machine. On the general's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 827, all 159, the Nays are two. We have agreed with the Senate's substitute. The Senate's bill is recognized for a motion. Representative Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 880. The Senate amendment. Senator Ballard, move that the House agreed to the Senate's amendment to House Bill 880. Mr. Clerk, where you read the caption. House Bill 880 to be entitled. NAC2A, amend code section 43134. The official go to Georgia, annotated, relating to licenses for transitioning members of the Armed Forces, so as an allowable military spouses to use an existing license.

Representative Leveritt moves that the House agreed to the Senate substitute of House Bill 1033. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1033 to be entitled back to amendment chapter 5 or 16. The official vote of George Anitetti relating to crimes against the person associated with violent protections for utility workers. Chairman Leveritt has recognized to explain.

The Senate's substitute. Thank you, Miss Baker. This was the Utility Worker Protection Act. If you recall, this was kind of a follow-up to the Critical Infrastructure Act we passed last year. We increased the penalties for a simple assault, aggravated assault, simple battery, and aggravated battery if the crime is committed against utility worker while they're in the course of performing their duties. When we got to the Senate, we realized there is also a crime of battery, which is different from simple battery and aggravated battery. And so we simply added similar provisions to that statute. That's the extent of the change and we'll ask your favor or consideration of that. Miss Baker, I'll yield for any questions. You have a question to your left. If you yield, represent- I'll yield. Representative Park, canna has recognized your question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, do you yield? Yes, ma'am. What's the difference between the battery and the simple battery? Then what's the example? My understanding is battery is if you- I mean, I don't want to encourage you, but if you were to punch me in the job, that would be simple battery. If you punch me in the job and do some significant damage, it's battery. Thank you for the question. Representative Holley, to your left and towards your back, has a question. Parliament is being agreed. Question. I'll yield for your question, Mr. President. Thank you. Just so that I'm clear, this particular substitute is the- I'll see- I'll see it here. This is the one here where you are including in this, or the Senate includes in this, the specialty license plates to honor the women of Delta Sigma Theta Incorporated. I didn't realize that was in there if it is. I believe it's some- Is it on 35, line 35? I'm sorry. I want to bring my copy up here. Okay. Yeah, it's- It's a- Just so I can make sure, is this the correct one here? Is this a- It's not a single page. It's- Okay, it's not a simple page, okay. You have House Bill 1033 representative. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. 1033. 1033, okay. Okay, my apologies. I got the number confused. I certainly think the world of the ladies of Delta Sigma Theta, but I wasn't allowed to ask to put that bill on here. Too much homework up here, thank you. Thank you, sir. You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd ask your- Please vote- Yes, in favor of the motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. On the gentleman's motion, that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 1033, all those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Those opposed will vote if so. The clerk will lock the machines.

This bill emperors the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Powell is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I bring to you this afternoon Senate bill 5 both. General will suspend. A little brief history on this. Back 20 years ago we passed the residential contractors license and commercial licensing. There has been no work done on that bill since its inception. This bill quite frankly is just a updating of that by removing provisions that weren't needed, such as the name of the board. Changing some of the sections that allows for a qualified agent that obtains a building permit so that they can have a grace period if someone passes away while in the process of doing a job. That means that if you're a contractor and you're the sole licensee, then you can complete that and you've got a hundred and going from 120 to 180 days. It expands that grace period. Changes of terminology for residential and general contractors throughout residential and commercial general contractors. Increases annual revenue threshold for the small volume commercial general contractor from $5 to $10 million for their licensing. It moves the timing for obtaining the prolonged evidence of required insurance before authorization. Increases a number of opportunities to take the exam right now. You can take it twice a year while waiting if you have failed it so this you can take it three times a year if needed. Basically this is just an update of the code. Nothing changes. Use an individual. If you're acting as your own contractor, you can still do the same. Act quite frankly is a very simple explanation of this bill and I would ask for your favorable consideration if there's no questions. Gentlemen has no questions. Gentlemen, is here the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.

I have no. Have all members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 503, the yeas are 149. The naysr two this bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 293, 293? Senate Bill 293 by Senator Watson, the first departure to the 32nd walk, or the 20th and others being titled next to a men's chapter three, a title 31 of the official go to George Ancetta, relating to county boards of health. So, to provide that operational policies and procedures, the Department of Public Health apply to local personnel. This bill have referred to the Committee on Public Health. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair Lady Cooper is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring you Senate Bill 293. This is the Department of Public Health Agency request. The bill basically does three things. It makes one change. There is a dearth of doctors, MDs, that are also well versed in public health and have the qualities that we have been requiring for district health directors. So therefore, this bill would allow for a non-physician to be hired as a district health director. Someone that's qualified with a background in health, public health, but is not an MD. If they do that and they hire somebody that is not an MD for that position, they would have to have a clinical director who was an MD overseeing the clinical part of the public health division. And when you think about it, these district directors don't spend a lot of time with patients, if any at all. They really do things like budgets. And if they're building new buildings, they build new, they oversight the building, they do HR work, really, they're not involved in the clinical. So that's the main thing and the main change that the bill does. The other thing, it sort of ratifies existing processes. There are, in the last five years, 61% of our directors for our public health divisions, and there's been a 61 vacancy and turnover. Retirements, career changes, going from one district in Cobb to up in the mountains when they move. And it takes an average of about 380 days to find somebody to fill that type of position. And also, we have about four counties, or four districts, public health districts, have been without a director for two to four years. So one of the things besides saying who they can hire, the commissioner, the process clarifies that the commissioner would select the district health director, but that's still that the county boards of health would still vote on that director, and majority vote would prevail. So it just puts that and makes it specific in the law. So there's no question about it. The other, it says that the public health commissioner for the state would select an interim director if a vacancy occurs, and they would work to fill that vacancy. And if it went past a year when the position was open, they would give monthly reports back to the county where that was happening. That is the bill in the hole, and I'll be glad to answer one or two questions if we have them. If not, Mr. Speaker, I will yield a well and ask for your considerable vote. The lady has a couple of questions. I'll take them, sir. Representative Park to your left. Park Will Pazinquist. Will Park has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair Lee DeCouper, do you yield? Yes, I do. Is it not true that while I think the bill overall is okay that there are concerns from Winnett Newton-Rogdale, and so I'll be voting no to this bill? Yes, there are concerns, speak of a situation, an unusual situation in that, but this bill does not affect that situation in any way. Thank you. Representative Reeves to your right has a question. The lady will yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with a chair, lady, you. I will. Thank you. Chair Lee is true that the bill was amended over here in the house and that the bill was fully hurt in the house and has been improved since it was over the Senate when there were concerns from Winnett. Yes, it did. I'm still a little muddled in the brain from my cold. So thank you for pointing out that this is a substitute since it was Senate bill 293. I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker, if there's one. If not, I'll give you a little bit more. Representative, registration to your right, leader, registration has a question. Mr. Speaker, is the lady yield. Excuse me, I yield. Isn't it true that while in the lives of the representative just covered that there were extensive discussions that took place offline, discussions with Winnett County and we worked to make improvements in the bill and as the minority with asked and pointed out, the rules committee this morning when this was asked about, this will not impact any county health director that is employed by the Department of Public Health. This bill has no impact. It will make no changes in way that they're able to handle that at this time. Thank you. So thank you very much for pointing that out and I appreciate you working on the issue with me. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for the rooms positive vote on this bill. Thank you. Ladies, yielding the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, has none the committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed, will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine? All members voted for what purpose is representing Bernal, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, will this bill, I didn't get to ask the author of the bill, will this bill have any effect on health districts, the combining of one district into another one? I can't answer that question, but I'm going to see if I can get the lady that presented the bill for what purpose is representative. Cooper, rise. Parliamentary inquiry, is that what you have? I have to ask the question repeated, sir, I couldn't hear it here again from my cold. If you sit down, I'm going to keep this in order and I'm going to re-recognize Reps. Bernal and you will help me with this question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is, will this bill combine districts? Health districts have been combined because they didn't have a director or will all health districts stay the same? They won't be combined into another district automatically by the commissioner. Now I'm going to recognize, Chair Lady Cooper, for a poll of many inquiry, that will answer that question. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the bill, this bill does not make that change? If, and I know of no intention to do something like that, but if the commissioner of public health has that ability to do that now, she would have that ability in the future because this bill does not change anything except what I talked to you about. And it's pointed out. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the answer. For what purpose is representing bird, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that this takes away local control and gives it to a statewide bureaucrat and it removes the authority from the county board of health? I'm sure the lady is ridded very closely, and that's her opinion. For what purpose is representing fry, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this bill will alleviate some of the issues that we've faced with our public health departments across the states. It will not combine any districts, but will allow us to be able to recruit qualified candidates to fill the vacancies where we don't have to share a district leader from district to district next door. Is that not true? I'm sure the gentleman sounds like he's willed, and I believe he believes and I believe that he stated the truth. This one for what purpose is representing Wilkerson, rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that the commissioner has the ability to fill those vacancies on a temporary basis until the local board decides to fill it permanently and I do agree with the gentle lady that this is really a local control issue that I would like to see left in the hands of my local county? I'm sure the gentleman believes exactly what he said is to be accurate and he's passionate about it. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passes of Senate Bill 293, the yeas are 120, the days are 37, the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, you have an agreed disagree on your desk. House Bill 1312 is on your desk. House Bill 1312. Chair is going to recognize Representative Levert, Chairman Levert for a motion. Chairman Levert is recognized. Give the gentleman in your well your attention please. Excuse me, Speaker, I move that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1312. Chairman Levert moves that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1312 Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 1312 to be entitled to amend that decree relating to the regulation and taxation of electricity use as motor fuel and electric vehicle charging station. Reptile of Levert has moved that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1312. We are going to recognize Chairman Levert to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 1312 was originally a bill to deal with effective data, regulating authority of the Department of Agriculture with respect to electric vehicles. That bill has been also passed out of this House Bill 516 and I believe it's in the Senate may have been acted on today. It's on the floor. So we are taking care of that particular provision. We're using this as a vehicle to deal with an issue which is sort of crept up on us concerning the PSC elections. So you may recall there was a lawsuit filed against the state called Rose V. Raffinsberger that claimed that the system in which we elect PSC candidates violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That's a delusion claim. The argument was we were deluding votes and minority voters. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in August of 22. And as a result, issued an injunction against further PSC elections. So the PSC elections that were supposed to happen in 22 and 24 have not happened because of that injunction. On November of last year, the 11th Circuit issued a ruling that overruled the federal judge here locally who had issued that injunction. But before the injunction can go away, the 11th Circuit has to do a thing called issuing its mandate and transmitting that to the lower court. It's basically an order from the appellate court that tells the lower court you got it right or we think you got it wrong and here's what you're supposed to do. That mandate has apparently been held in the 11th Circuit by a judge. We don't know who but for some reason they're holding it and it may be that the plaintiffs are contemplating an appeal. It's by rid of Cerserari to the US Supreme Court. So the mandate could be issued tomorrow. It could be issued six months from now. We don't really know when. We remain under the injunction until the mandate is released. When it's released it'll dissolve the injunction and then the Georgia will have PSC elections again. Currently there's no state law that creates a plan for when these elections will be on the calendar. As you may know, those are staggered elections and because of the injunction, the normal schedule has been disrupted and it's rather complicated and difficult to get back on that schedule. What's likely going to happen when the case does come back to the district court is the judge will be asked to issue an order setting what that new schedule is for the time. We would like or it's the my opinion that we should try to preserve staggered elections for the PSC. So when the case is in federal court, it would also help if there's a statement of legislative intent with regard to that schedule and that's what this bill is seeking to do is to provide what that schedule would be so that our council has an opportunity to point to an act we have passed as an example of the schedule and get the judge to adopt that schedule. So what we've tried to do is just reset the election schedule and it's bill. So if you look at it, that's primarily done on page four. So what we would do is take the district one position which had an election in 2020 and the current currently up in 26 and we would have a election in November of 28. That term would then begin January of 29 and run to December of 34. For the district two position which was elected in 2016 and there were supposed to be an election in 22 that's been postponed, we would have a special election in the 2025 election cycle. That's not a regular state-wide election cycle. There were municipal elections though in November and so that's when we'd have that election and that term would run from January of 26 to the end of December of 30. District three would be treated similarly in terms of when the election would occur but that would be that would only be a one-year term. That's the position that was supposed to be up for election and has been filled by an appointment with Commissioner Johnson. Then on district four there would normally be an election in 26. We're pushing that back two years with a term that would begin January of 29 and end in December of 34 and then on district five we are, that election would be in November of 26 so that term would run from 27 to 32. So by doing that we would be able to continue to staggering of terms on the PSC rather than having potentially the judge could say well let's just elect them all in one year and they would, you could potentially have complete turnover on that body which I don't believe would be a good idea and certainly not consistent with the practice and tradition in the state for all these years. So that is what the bill does so it's to try to address this. It could not take effect currently because the injunction is still in place but when the injunction gets lifted this would be a schedule that our council could point to the judge and the judge could adopt. So Mr. Speaker that's basically the bill I'm glad to stand for any questions. Gentlemen has a couple of questions. Will Park to your left right out in front of you has a question. Will Park. Thank you Mr. Speaker. So can you help me better understand and maybe clarify some of these issues. So are we essentially providing some of our public service commissioners eight year terms just for purposes of ensuring they're not staggered? I would submit to you that while that is correct we had some help from the federal district court. I don't know exactly what you mean or what the implications of that are but essentially we are taking away the ability of Georgians this year to vote for at least two of their public service commissioners. No sir, no sir. The federal district court is taking that away the injunction is still in place and at this point it's too late as my understanding to have an election in November we've already had qualified. Thank you. Since I haven't convinced you but I believe what I've said is accurate. Leader Beverly is recognized for a question. Reverend. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes sir. Just from a historical standpoint can you tell me how many years does the PSE commission are currently served? Six. Six. In those years currently are staggered? Yes. Further question. The injunction revolves around what? Why did the federal court decide to create injunction or? The federal court found that at large the at large election of the PSE where they run in or they run from residential districts but they are elected at large. They found that that deluded vote. Deluded minority vote under section two. Correct. And to that point does this attempt to maintain the at large opportunity but still be appointed to a specific district? It maintains the current system in terms of how you run and where you're elected from the 11th Circuit reversed the decision. It just hasn't become effective because the mandate hasn't been issued. Correct. Still would establish what was prior to the injunction. Is that correct? It preserves that part of the system. We're just having to change some of the dates because we haven't been able to have an election during the dependency of the injunction. Thank you. Unfortunately I'll be voting no one this bill. That's your privilege. Representative Jasper is recognized for a question. Stillman yield. Yes sir. I've had a few text from concerned legislators. And to me this was a friendly give up of this bill to do this a very important change that we needed to do. And there was no problem of moving the contents of this bill onto House bill that we had the Transportation Committee. So that's in good shape. And I very much appreciate you carrying this very important piece of legislation. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you all for that bill for this extremely important matter that affects all of us because it affects all of our PSC districts. Representative Buddy Deloitte, your right has a question. Will you yield? You'll miss. Would you be surprised if I told you that the current method by which we elect those public service commissioners came about somewhere around 99 or 2000 where that's surprised you? Yes sir it would. Well I think you found that that's when this method came about. I think you also found that the Democratic Party was in control of this body. And the fear was that in certain areas of the state the Republicans began to elect more and more people of the congressional districts. And in fact this current method was a device to try to preserve the Democratic majority on the public service commission. Is that not true? I am. As I suspect the gentleman was present at the creation, I certainly do believe it to be true based on your statement sir. And thank you for that historical perspective. For a seat made, Representative James Berchett is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? I yield, yes sir. Is it not true there is nothing in code currently that sets aside a method for vacated seat in the PSC? That's my understanding yes sir. Is it not true this bill simply puts in a method to assure that the terms are staggered. And this order comes down. That's precisely the purpose of the bill. It's only to try to preserve the staggering of terms to show the judge what our intention is. Is it not true that this does nothing to change the makeup of the PSC? It does not. It cannot. Thank you for the bill. Thank you. Representative Wilkerson in the back to your left has a question. Thank you. Is the gentleman yield? Yes sir. It is my understanding that I guess under currently when a vacancy is filled the person does not have to actually live in the district which they're represented until they're actually elected. Is that correct? I suspect that maybe I confess I don't actually know about filling a vacancy in what the rules are. Okay was there any consideration of having them actually live in their district after their appointed so requiring that they move into their district because the current commission or I believe has not lived in their district for the several years that they've served. I'm just curious if any consideration is that correct? That could be the case. I'm not aware of any consideration. I think we're simply trying to set a schedule that the district court could look to for guidance. You have no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I ask your favor consideration of the substitute for House Bill 1312 and will yield well. On General's motion the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 1312. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines. On the General's motion to agree to the Senate substitute of House Bill 1312 that yeas are 93 nays or 66 the House has agreed to the Senate substitute of House Bill 1312. Mr. Clerk if you read the caption of Senate Bill 373. Senate Bill 373 by Senator Walker the 20th and in the end of March today the 31st Cropatric the 32nd to be titled back to amend Code Section 4310A 13. The district go to Georgia and Tate of related requirements for licensure and marriage and family therapy. So it's a provide for the issuance of expedited licenses by endorsement. This bill emin for the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends a dispelled do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Powell is recognized to present Senate Bill 373. Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I bring to you for the last time today Senate Bill 373 and this is a bill that I think could be dedicated to virtually everybody under the gold home in one way or another. This bill is a professional counsellors and marriage and family therapist. What this does Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen on the associate professional counsellors and the professional counsellors it raises the quarter hours from 80 to 90 hours but takes away the requirement of a doctoral degree. It has been long since thought that these professional counsellors didn't need to be a psychiatrist or a sociologist of a doctor's standing to be a normal counsellor, professional counsellor or an associate professional counsellor. Second part of this bill deals with the licensing board for marriage and family therapy that they shall issue an expedited license that by endorsement for individuals seeking licensure for marriage and family therapist. This should be done in 30 days and the endorsement would only require such information as a documentation that is necessary and meet the current requirements of the state. This comes from the senator from Houston County that we have gotten an awful lot of bills from this year and looks like it has got to be quite popular to do endorsements and reciprocity because of all of the to do with the military. So these folks want to come into the state and that puts George back on top of the list where we add a zero rating on up so that these service people move in the state so that they can be licensed in the state. And that, Mr. Speaker, is what this bill does and I would certainly request...

Man that. Be glad to answer any questions in the hard not. You have no questions and I will set down and thank you for your support. That's amazing. Thank you. Fine job. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agree to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair, here's none the board of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machine. All the passage of Senate bill 373 the yeas are 159's and nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 433? Senate bill 433 by Senator Couser, 46 Kenny, 18th and others to be entitled to amend Article 1 of Chapter 3, Title 14. The official go to George Anand's editor will link the general provisions for nonprofit corporations. So it's doing act the donor intent protection act. This bill will refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Kelly is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I come before you with Senate bill 433, the donor intent protection act. What this legislation does, it provides a legal pathway for the enforcement of written endowment agreements. These agreements come when individuals work with our local nonprofits or charity organizations to specifically give money for a specific purpose. And what this will do is it will allow a mechanism for the donor or their descendants that should that written agreement not be followed. It'll give them a mechanism to petition the court for declaratory relief and an injunction so that the funds would be used for that purpose. It doesn't allow any callback provision for where the funds would have to be received. It just simply says that should the judge make a determination that they're not being used as a reasonably agreed to in a written agreement that they will they'll encourage the organization then require that organization then to use them for that purpose. Fairly simple, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer your questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You do have a question. Whip Park, if you're a general, will you yield? I'll yield. Whip Park. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So do these contracts require such donor related agreements to be in perpetuity? As you know, as we know as attorneys, you can draft these agreements in different ways. And so it would be really up between the donor and the organization to write the agreement as to how that would work. Just because at least the bill says that the donor's lenial descendants could potentially claw back. That donation and so I'm just curious as to whether or not there's a requirement for these contracts to have some provision with respect to and perpetuity or whether or not donors will for all these subsequent generations be able to claw back if something otherwise changes. We limited it to the donors great-grandchildren so it couldn't go any further than that. Thank you. So I appreciate the question. I had some clarity on the way but you guys figured it out so you have no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I asked for the body's favorable consideration. We're seeing Stacey Evans is going to help you all out but you all got it right. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is done? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The Chair here is done. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 433 the yeas are 157 the nays are three this bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 374374? Senate bill 374 by Senator Walker the 20th, Strictly, the 17th, Halpern the 39th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 15 and Title 43. The official go to George Anandtett and the professional engineers and land surveyors act of 2021 so as to change provisions relating to land surveyor interns and professional land surveyors. This bill I'm referring to the committee on regulated industries. That committee recommends this bill do pass by Rules Committee Substitute. The gentleman from Jasper Georgia representative Rick Jasper's to recognize to present the bill. Representative Jasper's. Thank you Mr. Speaker. They bring with you as Chairman Powell just said Chairman Larry Walker has been busy and Senate bill 374 is some of his work. You know during the fall of the Senate study committee on occupational licensing met and many professional organizations came to describe the problems they were having in their fields you know whether it be with that we're an obstacle. You know we've seen a number of these bills in the last couple of weeks down here to reduce obstacles in licensing. This is the third bill that I have done on this very important skill of surveying. I have found these members to be very precise and very committed to the excellence of their trade and in the description you heard that 2021 bill I did that one too. The SoulScite Society of Georgia and the Survey and Mapping Society of Georgia presented to that Senate study committee and the bill that I have you before you is their recommendations today. In the process of meeting three within the three 74 they met over time with lots of different other people and the other organizations that they interact with to create this bill and they approved it as their association and that's what I'm working from today. Section one changes the experience requirements for certification for soil classifiers and through the Department of Public Health and you think why the Department of Public Health. Well a soil classifier is that man or woman who conducts soil and site investigations and prepares a soil analysis for septic systems. Very important we all agree and there's a real need to improve this the wait times of these are are getting up there. The current law requires that the soil classifiers get four years of experience after they meet the educational requirement. This bill does not change the experience but what it does do is after two years allows them to work on the educational requirements that need to be completed. The bill does streamlines getting them through this four years so they can get to work. Section four details the path to attain a professional land surveyors license. There are three different ways you can do it and this and it kind of clarifies this. You can get a bachelor's degree and approved bachelor's degree and approved curriculum 18 hours of study with three years of experience. You can get an approved associate's degree with 18 hours of curriculum that they require with five years of experience. You can't enter this trade with a high school diploma with the 18 hours of their approved curriculum and eight years of experience. What this bill does is allows the two main national tests to be taken at a different time. You know the law requires the current law requires that we take in after the experience time. You know this what this is doing is decoupling that. It's allowing to take this after two years and we feel that they feel that will lead to a lot more people being certified in that in this very needed work role. I have a few questions you know people asking me about a couple of the things. They ask me about the 18 hours of course work. You know where do they do this? How do they do this? You know Georgia's the big state. There are three schools that offer it. University of North Georgia, Kettysaw State and Georgia's Southern. All of them have the training. All of them do it online. So there's no problem about getting those 18 hours. The problem is doing those years of training experience. That's about Bill Mr. Speaker. I'll be glad to answer any questions. Gentlemen has no questions. I think I yield the well and ask for your favor for kids' consideration on this important matter. General is yielded the well. We do have one member that's opposed to the bill. Representative may be others but one wants to speak. Representative Washman is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Dale Washman. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I rarely come to the well to speak against the bill. In fact I don't think I ever have until today. But I rise to speak against this bill and I want to give you the reasons why. I've been in the real state business 49 years as most of you know and I'm very familiar with what surveys do and I'm very familiar with planning and how important all that is and the accurate work is. I also have a son that's a civil engineer who worked as a surveyor for about five years while he pursued his degree so that he could become a licensed engineer. And I've talked with them often about the work he did during that time and in that process I learned what it takes to get a surveyor's license. The representative who's carrying the bill mentioned the fact that we have a shortage of surveyors now and so when I saw this bill being presented in the subject committee I had been thinking about doing this anyway and so I pursued an amendment to the bill and I want to read that amendment to you to and please listen carefully to add to the educational requirements I had an amendment that added one line or be licensed under this chapter as a professional engineer. We were adding an amendment that said someone who is going to school to get that degree to become a certified professional engineer if that person has the experience required in the bill and sits and passes the examination to become a licensed surveyor then that certified engineer ought to be able to get a surveyor's license and that was the amendment. Now I want to tell you about the process of the amendment. I've known the author of the bill over in the Senate for a long time and I could committee them on his work about this and I went to him I prepared the amendment I got led counsel to prepare it I wrote some notes on it for him and hand delivered it to his office and when I met with him before the fool and I did this after the subcommittee met because I wasn't aware of what the nature of the bill was to look out to the subcommittee that day when I told the senator that I wanted all for this amendment his response was well the surveyors are not going to like it. Ladies and gentlemen we are not sent up here by the citizens of this state to have to go get permission from every professional association to pass legislation. Now I respect the surveyors I respect every lobbyist in the hall I respect all of them and as you know I work closely with them. Ladies and gentlemen they give us their input they give us their advice but we should not have to go to them to seek their approval on the legislation we pass for the citizens of this state. So I told him well I'm going to bring my amendment and we bought it and in full regulated industries committee meeting we had a long spirited debate and the representative carrying this bill for the senator is a friend of mine and he and I debated pretty spiritedly in that committee. There were a lot of questions and after a while the bill passed by a big majority. I'm not sure how many no votes that were but there weren't many. We had a big majority. We passed that bill out of the regulated industries committee they're doing their work as they were supposed to do it and then in the rules committee this amendment got taken out. Ladies and gentlemen I bought this amendment because it needed to be bought. We have a shortage of surveyors and a professional engineer that has worked in the field for what the bill requires and has passed the examination ought to be able to be a registered surveyor. Ladies and gentlemen we have too much turf protection in this state. We've got to work a shortage. We need to be licensing people and letting them go to work whether it is putitions or land surveyors. Mr. Speaker I will yield for any questions I urge that you vote no on this bill because it is weaker than it would be if the amendment had been left in it. I respectfully ask you to vote no on this bill. Mr. Speaker I will yield for any questions. You have a question from Representative L Williams from on the coast to your left. Representative Williams. Mr. Chairman Yeal. I will for my friend. Is it not true that your eloquence and passion moved me from my seat? I am honored by seeing you stand my dear friend. Is it not further true that some weeks ago I said that the tail was wagging their head in this legislature and it's high time that we listened to the people and not necessarily the agency heads and as bad as we need people I find no reason that an engineer should not qualify for this. Thank you for your spirit and keep on wagging your head. Thank you very much my friend. Gentlemen to your right Representative Jasper's I thank you for that question. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Yeal. I yield for my friend the chairman. Thank you. We have disagreement and is it not true that the Engineers Association that your son may be part of or may not be part of came to us saying they would like to at further time meet with the Solve the land surveyors Sam Sogg with them together this year in the later in the fall or winter and come up with a solution to your amendment. It is true. That is true is it not? It is true that they came to me and asked me to do that. And is it not further through that you or I at that time can bring a bill after that discussion that does satisfy both the surveyors and engineers for their shortage of people that are working in this way right now. But they did oppose doing it on the fly. They didn't feel good about your amendment. What is true is that this is the tariff protection we are speaking of Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen has no further questions. Chairman Collins has a question I didn't see his light. Does General Yeal I do yield for the chairman? Is it not true that I too share your frustrations with how certain members of the rules committee seem to pick and choose bills to pick apart from time to time? It is true. It is frustration. Is it also not further through that like you I too work for a living never relied on the government to make my living is that correct? It is true. It is not true that I further share your passion on this piece of legislation. I support my friend 100%. Thank you Mr. Chairman. General Yeal I have a new further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House I appreciate your questions and appreciate your interest and I urge you vote no on this bill to send a strong message. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Yeal I will. Debate is the power of this House. The people's House is in objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair here has done the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to withdraw in the committee's substitute? Chair here has done the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair here has done the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to a green to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none. Report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. What purpose does representative Reese rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that if I would have pressed the correct button I could have asked the gentleman doing his presentation for a point of clarity as to his statements earlier. I understood him to say that a committee of this House and a bipartisan fashion put an amendment in the bill and passed it to rules and that rules it was taken out the work of that committee. Isn't it true that's what I understood him to say? I think that's what I heard. There's wisdom there's wisdom in every step of the process in this House including on this floor. For what purpose is representative Thomas rise? Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. Stay tuned. Is it not true that there are two members of this body that belong to the engineering board one of which is myself and I support the language is written? It's a gentleman's so states on it. Further inquiry Mr. Speaker. State that inquiry. Isn't it good practice to be consulting members of the engineering board or whatever board that's being affected by a piece of legislation prior to making amendments or having concerns? Is usually the process yes. Thank you. For what purpose is representative Colier rise? I want to hear this one. Did you say wave? All right but Mr. Speaker is it not true that I'm also the other licensed professional engineer in the House? I've heard that. That I am opposed to this bill. Thank you. Thank you for your input. Have all members voted? I think we've heard enough on this bill. All members voted so the clerk will lock the machine on the past of Senate Bill 374. The yeas are 59 the nays are 96. This bill having failed to receive the requisite constitutional majority as therefore failed. I think Mr. Speaker I'd like to make a motion for reconsideration. Now is that time the gentleman wishes to pursue the motion so desires as the gentleman move? It's moves. All the gentleman's motion that this House reconsider this action and failing to give Senate Bill 374 a requisite majority. All those in favor of reconsideration will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. All members voted. If so the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion to reconsider Senate Bill 374 the yeas are 82 the nays are 68. Motion carries and the House has reconsidered this action on Senate Bill 374. It will be reconsidered if he so request in the next couple of legislative days. Members, we have a little more business we can tend to before we leave here in about 30 minutes. We will have had a good day. Mr. Clerk where you're either captioned Senate Bill 505 505. Senate Bill 505 Senator Tillier the 19th cows are the 46th Watson and the first and others to be entitled back to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's either relating to regulations, hospitals and related institutions. So those revised provisions relating to required publication by hospital certain financial documents on this website. Ms. Bill haven't heard the committee on health that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Thank you members. Chairman Knight recognized to present Senate Bill 505. Chairman Knight. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It's been a long day starting to get a little testy around here isn't it. I present for you Senate Bill 505 and this is dealing with the reporting requirements that we require of our hospitals. Let me say right up front we're not changing any of those reports or the reports that are to be reported and disclosed. Okay. What we're doing here and if you'll look at the bill we're putting in basically a uniform template of how they're to be reported and on website making and making sure that's easy to get to and that there's a uniform template that is going to be created by the department that the hospitals will report this on and making sure that the links, the web links are promptly displayed and it's on the department's website. The key provision of this is in subsection D1 which if you'll go with me.

This is where we're telling the department that they're going to establish a uniform template in the criteria for the reporting of the documents. Again, we're not changing what is already in current code about what documents it will be reported. We're just telling them they're going to make up a uniform template so that the reporting is all made in the same manner. The department is going to come up with this template by the end of this year, December 1, 31, 24, and that the hospital is no later than July 1 of 25 will start using that template to report what they're already reporting, the documents that they're already reporting. The next section is providing a uniform resource locator. I had to look that up, but that's simply for those old guys that don't understand technology. That's just a website address. And that DCA is going to maintain on its website the link that is provided by each of the hospitals. There are provisions such that are to enforce compliance and that is that you've got to comply with this. That's July 1 of every year, but there's also a 30-day notice of deficiency and an opportunity to correct deficiency. Otherwise, you'll be in jeopardy of your state, any of the state funds that you are doing. That's the main part of the bill. Section 2 is where we've got a local hospital authority. What's going on is our local elected officials will make appointments or suggest nominees for the appointment to the hospital authorities. But what we're seeing is that these hospital authorities just keep rejecting and rejecting and rejecting. These are our local elected officials and they have a duty and the authority to make sure they're making a recommended list of appointments. We're changing here saying, hey, hospitals, you've got to choose from the elected officials list of recommended nominees for your board. And that's the bill. Let's speak our outstand for any questions. Gentlemen, you here for a question? Yes, sir. Representative Lisa Campbell to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I have a question online 99. 99. If you'll, yes, ma'am. And so originally this code included donations as part of the penalty. She'll be suspended from receiving any state funds or donations. That has been struck and then online 100. We add back funds administered by the state but not donations. Can you explain the rationale for that reduction in penalty? Well, I think what it's trying to do is say, hey, we're coming up with disclosures. This is just a simple way to say you need to make sure that you are meeting your obligation and you're making timely disclosures. And you're doing it in this manner, this up under this new uniform template that the department is going to create and we're not messing around. These are stiff. These are stiff. You know, I say stiff. These are, hey, you don't want to mess around with this. So I don't think the high school is going to risk this. This is to say this is important. We're taking disclosure of variant, you know, very seriously. And we want you to do this. So again, that's what's in code or what is on the proposed legislation. With the gentleman, the young people. I will. A little further clarification. So I support that and agree and appreciate the uniformity and some of the statements here to keep this information up for public transparency. But my question is really about the red it seems to me this is a bit of a reduction of penalty there were excluding the word donations and I'm curious for things like the tax grant or any other grants. Would those be considered donations and now they are not, they're still able to receive those donations even if they're not in compliance? Yes, and I'll, I'll have to say the representative. I'm not sure. You know, go back to that code section. I don't know if these are private, I assume these are private donations. That may be the reason they're taking this out of it. And I'm not, again, I'm not sure of the exact answer. But again, that may be what's going on from a donation and we're strictly putting in there. Hey, you know, state funds that are administered by the state that those are the ones that we're going to withhold. Thank you. And I'll do it to the lady. I'll make sure we clarify that. But again, this is a very honest proposition to make sure that we are not only disclosing what's already existing on law, we're trying to do it in a uniform manner and making sure that it's promptly, uh, uh, prominently displayed on websites so that everyone can, can go and see these disclosures and not have to hunt for them. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll, uh, I'll, uh, yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill 505. Gentlemen, has no question. He's yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being in order to tear his none? The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute that tear his none? The committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? tear his none? The committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote. Yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purposes represent a Kenner rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stay chamber. Isn't it not true, Mr. Speaker, that at this moment in the night, I would be happy with the biscuit or a piece of cornbread, either one. All I got to piece of shoe leather, so we'll have to share that. But I'm going to look for something for you just a minute. It won't be much longer. All members voted. But I agree, Representative. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the pass, the Senate bill 505, the yeas are 156 and nays are zero. This bill, having to see the requisite constitutional majority is there for pass. Senator Clerk, will you read the caption, Senate bill 324? Senate bill 324, Senator Jackson of the 41st, do you know the 30th, press of the 28th? To be entitled back to a man, chapter 18 and title 50, the fiscal to Georgia, and Teta, ruling the state printing and documents, those required for a victim, senator to address confidentiality program. This bill, I'm referring to the committee on governmental affairs, that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative Gaines is recognized to present the bill, or is it Houston Gaines? Thank you, Ms. Speaker. Senate bill 324 continues our efforts in supporting victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. I'll be really brief because I know the hour is late. There's several cleanup items in the bill that gets our code sections aligned. And then Senator Kim Jackson had worked to incorporate and add an address confidentiality program to ensure victims and survivors of trafficking, domestic violence, and sexual assault can have their addresses remain confidential on public record. Also want to thank Representative Murray Crawford, House Bill 1101, is captured in this legislation. So I want to thank all involved and I think it's a really good bill for victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, and other victims. And Ms. Speaker, you'll the well and ask for the body's favourable consideration. General has no questions, General succeed to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, who has none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the Committee's substitute? chair, who is none, the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting his substitute, offered by the committee on rules? Chair, who has none, the rules committee's substitute is adopted? is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair, his none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. All members voted if so, clerk will lock the machine. On the pass of Senate bill, three, twenty-four, the yeas are 151, the nays won this bill. Having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 259259? Senate bill 259 by Senator Hatchett, the 50th Kennedy, the 18th Gute to the 51st to be in Title IX, to amend Article 166, Title 15. The official go to George Anitetti, where laying the general provisions regarding the Spiricorps says to move the Spiricorps of Banks County from the Pete Mont judicial circuit to the Mountain Judicial Circuit. This bill then referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee Substitute. Mr. Clerk, any early on is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I know as the last representative said the bill moves Banks County from the Pete Mont judicial circuit to the Mountain Judicial Circuit. Banks County is about 10% of the court cases currently in the Pete Mont Circuit and we did a study a couple of years ago with the Judicial Council. In that study, they found that this was a feasible move. I want to thank the Judiciary, House Judiciary Chairman and Committee for coming to Banks County, sitting and listening to all the parties involved here in determining that this was a feasible move and a good move for those citizens of Banks County to be in a more like circuit. Mr. Speaker, with that, I will pause for any questions, but would ask if there aren't any for your favorable but. Your polls worked. You have no questions. Well then we'll yield the well and again asking for your favorable but. Gentlemen, yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? Chair, here's none of the Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none of the Board of Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? I'll in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no when Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. I have all members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 259, the yeas are 150. The nay is 1. This bill haven't received any requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of Senate bill 479. Senate bill 479, my senator hatchet of the 50th of Stuttler, the 52nd burns the 23rd to be entitled to Act 2ment Article 14 of Chapter 1, Title 10 of the official go to Georgia and Tate of Relay and the Secondary and Mental Recyclers to survive for the applicability of the definition the term used detached catalytic converters. This bill haven't heard the on agriculture and consumer affairs that committee recommends this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chairman Levert has recognized to present Senate bill 479. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House this is Senate bill 479 but it is not the Senate bill 479 that it was when it came over to us from the Senate. We have replaced that language with House bill 974 which was the bill that we passed off the floor back in February that would change the structure of judicial compensation which changed the manner in which we pay judges without necessarily changing the amounts. It passed out of here anonymously. We have made a few changes to one of the final sections of this bill at ACCG's request that had to do with the manner in which some local official pay is tied to judicial salaries but the changes were not substantive. They were just clarifying the intent. The bill is over 974 is over in the Senate. We are hitting some stumps over there and we would like to have this alternative so we can try to move the bill this year. I would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration and your affirmative vote for this bill. I will yield for any questions Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has no questions. The calculation, gentlemen, please, I will yield the well and appreciate your affirmative vote and favor of the bill. Gentlemen, has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair, here is none of the previous questions ordered.

Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. All in the past, you've said it bill 479. The yeas are 138. The nays are 13. This bill, Henry, seated, requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. For what purpose is represented who lemon Franklin runs? Mr. Speaker, I'd like to make a motion to recommit. State your motion. Yes, sir. I'd like to make a motion to recommit, Senate bill 384 go back to rules. I thought I was only one guy to hear to myself. Representative Franklin has moved that Senate bill 384 be really committed to the rules committee. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? Senate bill 384 to be entitled back to men chapter 19 to title 45 and they fish go to Georgia and say to relay the labor practices relative to public officers and employees. All in the jama's motion. That Senate bill 384 be withdrawn from the calendar and recommitted to the rules committee is their objection. Hearing none it is so ordered. The words you wanted to hear the last bill of the day. unanimous consent. Representative Buckner, why don't you head down to the well. In a true sense of working back and forth across the aisle. Save the best of last. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 496 for 96. Senate bill 496 by Senator Burns, the 23rd Huffstock letter, the 52nd. Paying to the 54th to be entitled back to men article 1 to chapter 5 on title 48. The fish go to Georgia and annotate relaying the general provisions relative to add the alarm taxation to property. Social survivor and extension for a financial assessment periods for certain historic properties. Mr. Bill, I'm for the committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Give the lady who will be in the will your full attention. Representative Debbie Buckner from Junction City is recognized to present the bill. Representative Buckner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And this is a truly bipartisan bill and I will take my suggestion from a colleague to be brilliant and brief. Senate bill 496 is a combination of three house bills. In one section we are using information from House Bill 1134, which was Representative Ron Stevens historic tax bill. And it changes the definition to allow the Department of Community Affairs to designate historic districts and communities in residential areas. And then it takes a section from my bill that I had to extend the sunset for historic tax credits out of House Bill 1116. And then it takes the some information from Representative Penny House to bill House Bill 1197 to extend the sunset for her bill for downtown rural historic development. And that's what the bill does. It combines three great house bills into one. That's as brilliant as I can be at this time. Well, it must have been brilliant because you don't have any questions. Please vote yes and we can go home. Thank you. I yield the well. Fine, John. Ladies, you are the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, is none the previous question is ordered? Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, is none the Committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, is none the Committee is agreed to? This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We will vote yes. All those opposed. We will vote no in the clerk. We will unlock the machine. It was a trick. We have all members voted. All members voted.

Three different times gave them three different literations to try to meet them. I couldn't get there thanks to sub-chairman Hong who spent a lot of time trying to negotiate. I do have a commitment from all parties that we are going to meet during the interim. No matter where you fall on the death penalty, I think that's probably a step too far.
