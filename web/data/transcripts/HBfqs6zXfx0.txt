TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
Welcome to the Children and Families Committee and before we start I'm going to ask
Senator Paine what's your mic number 11 to open a separate prayer.
Let's bow our hand pray.
Having Father we come to you today Lord and we just thank you first and foremost for
all of our many blessings.
Thank you for the air that fills our lungs.
It comes only with purpose to serve or let us find our purpose in you that we would be
glad of you to do all your will and not just of our own.
Father, we just give you, ask you to give us clear eye and mind the discernment and
all that we do, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
Amen.
Thank you.
Okay.
We have one bill on our agenda this morning, it's House Bill 144 and there is now a
substitute to that, which was formerly House Bill 30.
And Lieutenant Governor's Office
feels this issues of public importance
and should be considered by the Senate.
So that is why we're talking about this this morning.
Threats and attacks against the Jewish children and families
in all of our districts can't be tolerated in Georgia.
This bill has been thoroughly publicly vetted
and here's how we're going to proceed.
We have a hard stop at 8.50
because many of our members have to go to another meeting.
And so we need to be sure that we're finished by then.
And we're gonna have the author present the bill
and take questions from the committee.
Then we are gonna allow some public testimony,
although there's been a lot of public testimony
on this bill already.
And the way that's gonna work is we're gonna have
15 minutes for people that are opposed to the bill,
and 15 minutes for people that are in favor of the bill.
and feel free to yield your time
if your points already been made.
And I would ask people to be as brief as you can.
We also need everyone to be respectful
and we don't have any disruptions in our Senate committees.
So please keep that in mind.
And we will have discussion by the committee
but we're not gonna entertain any amendments.
And so with that, I'll ask Representative Carson
to come and present the bill.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the committee.
I'm presenting before you, the substitute to House Bill 144.
Many of you know this as the anti-Semitism bill that this legislature has been debating
this year.
What this basically does is, and just for clarity, I'm working on LC 491454S.
What this basically does is what it does is codifies a definition of anti-semitism for
the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
All this bill does really is ensure that when analyzing intent behind illegal discriminatory
actions that target Jewish people, whether it involves a hate crime or illegal discriminatory
actions, that there is an allegation that the action was motivated by anti-Jewish sentiment
and that the relevant authorities consider
that this, the world's most accepted definition
of anti-Semitism by Ira,
the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
I have a printout, Madam Chair,
if members want to see it in regard to what that definition is,
but I think we've talked about this in length
in both bodies and both chambers.
But I'm happy to share, I have several copies of that.
What this bill does not do,
It does not in any way limit or chill,
anyone's freedom of speech, what have you.
You can take a look at the Bill Substitute.
If you take a look at lines 29 through 34,
I'll just read the first sentence or two.
Nothing in this code section shall be construed
to diminish or infringe upon any right,
protect it under the first amendment to the US Constitution.
In addition to that, the Ira definition of anti-Semitism
Literally says, however, criticism of Israel, and I'm quoting here from the definition
from Ira, criticism of Israel similar to that level to against any other country cannot
be regarded as anti-Semitic, and that's just an excerpt.
Groups in support of this, you have a letter in your packet, I'm just going to hold this
up, sorry, mine's in color, maybe yours isn't in black or white.
I want to encourage you to understand the persecution
that the Jewish community is under,
even though they only make up one, one and a half percent
of the Georgia population, they probably are targeted
with over 50%, maybe 60% of all the crimes,
hate crimes of persecution in the state.
This bill is very similar to what are almost identical
to what has been passed in Arizona, Iowa, Tennessee,
Arkansas, several other states.
So I think about six or seven or eight states by statute,
about 22 states and total by resolution.
This definition has been adopted
by 1,100 separate governments, non-governmental entities.
Most of the EU nations has also been adopted
by the US State Department, US Department of Education.
And as you can see, on lines of the bill,
on lines 16, 17 and 18, it's also been adopted
as a presidential executive order.
and it's also been enforced by the prior president
and it's been enforced by the current president
and the current administration.
The biggest question I get, Madam Chair,
and members of the committee is why is this necessary?
The Jewish identity is multifaceted and it's complex.
It incorporates race, religion, culture,
national origin, national origin, and ethnicity.
And it's not just one simple thing.
Some people can put up a swastika and say,
I'm making a political statement.
No, you're making an anti-Semitic statement.
With that, I know we have a number of speakers.
And honestly, this legislature has debated this quite a bit.
I'm happy to take questions at the pleasure of the chair.
I do have with me, Mark Goldfeather, Mark,
if I may, Madam Chair.
He's kind of a legal scholar on these issues,
constitutional scholar, and I'm happy to help have him,
If you may, at the chair's indulgence,
help him answer technical questions.
But with that, I would just ask for the committee's support
in this matter.
Thank you.
We are going to take some questions from the committee.
Sure.
Okay.
Senator, the represent.
Representative, thank you for bringing this legislation forward.
I got a question for you or your esteemed attorney.
Why are you?
Ira is the internationally recognized definition of anti-Semitism.
It's been sought out, vetted extensively by various professors, went through a three-year
working process.
It's been adopted by non-governmental entities, it's been adopted by government bodies around
the world, including, as I mentioned, a number of states, as well as the U.S. Department
state, U.S. Department of Education, and the prior president's executive order, which
the current president is enforcing.
I would not want there to be another definition, such that what is anti-Semitic under state
law is not anti, or in other words, there's differences between state and federal law in
regard to what is anti-Semitic behavior, so thank you for that.
uniformity matters. Absolutely. Absolutely.
Thank you, Senator. I would just add that dire definition was put together over years by subject
matter experts across 50 different countries. It's been vetted. It's been adopted by presidents
of both parties, UN Secretary General and others. And more importantly, it is accepted by the
vast majority of Jews as actually reflecting their shared experience of what antisemitism is
is in how it manifests itself.
It's true, and that's why it's a good definition.
In terms of why it's a good definition for this bill,
the IR definition focuses less on why people hate
and more focuses on manifestations
of what people do when they hate.
It's a practical, sociological,
raconduct-based definition, if you will,
which is what you need when you're looking for
this kind of definition.
Thank you, Madam President.
Good morning, everyone.
And I do understand the intent of this bill.
The actual intent of the bill, I have no problem with.
I'm black on them from the south.
I understand hate.
We don't want any postings of any hate of anyone or any group.
And I do think we pass our anti-hate bill in this body
a couple years ago.
And it should cover what we're trying to do here.
I would have said go ahead and add an amendment to that particular bill.
And I guess our concern is the definition of IRA.
That is the sticking point here.
And I do believe this was heard in another committee, is that correct?
That's correct.
Okay.
Was there a problem with what the Judiciary Committee did that day?
There was.
Okay.
Can you explain to me what?
Essentially just to Senator Robertson's question, we're about a conformity here and
what the Senate judiciary did is by a one vote margin adopted a definition other than
Ira for anti-Semitism.
Okay.
If I may, then chair.
Okay.
So because the problem is the Ira definition, that definition is very broad.
I get what you're saying, but under that definition, and I've seen it, there are several
what means what anti-Semitism means.
And the concern is it could be used if interpreted strictly by law to sense of free speech.
And that's what we don't want.
And I kind of, and even the, and I, you know, I just did some research myself because it
could be used in that way.
It could be because the language under the IR definition is, I've seen it, it's a lot
there. That it could threaten, you know, our academics, the protests for students, and
even the author himself, Kenneth Stern, he warned that it could undermine the fight
of anti-Semitism and charges of anti-Semitism. So he was in concern, and this was only supposed
to be a working definition. And it wasn't intended just yet to be the definition that we're
going to codify into law.
And I have huge concerns if we're going to codify this into law
as it applies to our state.
Because here, it's all state agencies
share, shall consider, any sympathism
as evidence of discriminatory intent
for any criminal or non-criminal law policy
in this state, which prohibits this discrimination
based on race, color, and religion.
So I have some concerns.
And I do, I get what you're trying to do.
I really do.
But I think the vagueness might leave us open
to some trouble later.
And that's what we don't want.
So that's my question.
How do we-
Senator, I very much appreciate that.
And if it's OK, I'd like to respond,
if I can, just several of the points.
First in regard to what Ken Stern actually said.
And this is not fearful.
He's been misquoted on this so many times.
He's written about it in three places, including chapter 7
of his book, The Clarify.
He does not think this should be ever codified
as a speech code.
I won a thousand billion percent degree.
That is why this bill cannot and does not touch speech.
There's never been an allegation that any bill like this one,
which is in several states now has ever been used
to silence or chill speech because it cannot be used that way.
That our definition is only, only, only triggered
if there's been an unlawful act of discrimination
or a hate crime.
And in that instance, the our definition is clear
that those examples, if you look on the line
above the examples, could taking into the overall context
be discriminatory?
context is crucial here as it is in every case of discrimination.
The reason those examples are there are not because they're always anti-Semitic and
the Irish takes pains to say that in two different places.
It's there because people sometimes do these things and use them as excuses to attack
Jewish people.
And I'll give you an example if it's okay.
Just recently, two weeks ago in New York, a man named Sodom, a Sod was on trial for
hate crimes and his lawyers filed an open court and I submitted this testimony to the previous
meet him, happy to submit it again, and said that he didn't attack these innocent American
Jews because he's an anti-Semite.
He did it because he hates Israel, as if that was an excuse.
And our hate crimes right now doesn't catch everything.
You'll hear testimony soon from children themselves who are from Fulton County who are terrorized
because the swastika is not a religious symbol, and the school gaslighted them and told
them that it wasn't.
And you'll hear stories about people if we have time who have been attacked for things
relating to Israel as well, and they use that as an excuse.
So the examples are there just so that a judge
when there's a hate crime allegation
looks at a list of things, prior statements,
prior posts, all kinds.
All this definition says is, look at this list of things
that could potentially be anti-semitic,
so you don't miss it.
Because otherwise, anti-semites like to hide
behind ambiguity and do things to Jewish people.
So this is only if a Jew is targeted,
and there's an allegation, look at this for intent.
Understood.
Now the example you just gave, we,
What triggered this is anti-hate groups lag,
white nationalists, white supremacists,
Nazi symbols, these type things, right, correct?
No, Senator, it's coming from all different sites.
Okay, so, okay.
I was just saying the example that you gave,
I think the intent of this was to just target
those groups that were actually doing
the crimes that were here in Georgia recently
in the Jewish community.
And Senator, this bill would not touch any of the
antisemitic literature, that's free speech.
This bill wouldn't even come close to touching it.
But I'm really glad you brought that up because two things.
Number one, the person in Georgia
who is actually spreading those literatures,
he is a person who has done hard time
for violent racial attacks.
He's not, we're worried about it.
Two weeks ago when they cleared a national day of hate,
members of my community were afraid to go to synagogue
and afraid to go to school.
Actually, because they're afraid of being attacked,
it's not the literature.
And in San Francisco, three weeks ago,
a man who distributed that same literature,
a man named Jamie Tran, then went and shot two Jewish men,
leaving two different synagogues on two different mornings.
This bill would not touch the antisemitic literature.
It's a free speech.
But it would say that if he then got forbid goes and shoot
somebody, it would be used as evidence of intent
for why he selected his victim.
OK.
Thank you, Collie.
Senator Estvez?
Sorry.
We'll lock the end of this in time.
Yeah, thank you.
and good morning.
Can you explain why this version of 144 is different than HB30
and how it incorporates the IRA definition?
I can, yes, which version of HB30 were you referring to?
As passed by the House.
The As passed by the House online 14.
The next speaker says definition.
There used to be the word advisory or working,
and that's been striking.
Well, I understand what's different.
I'm asking why.
Why?
If uniformity is the key here, why remove the definition
itself, and then include a reference to a federal order?
If I may.
Thank you, Senator, for that question.
What happened to the Judiciary Committee
exactly the reason why we want to do it by reference because if you put the
definition to the code it invites anybody with a pen to go and start editing out
what they don't think should be anti-semitism. In the one minute that it happened
on the judiciary committee the person who made the amendment changed a word
in Ira and from the word he changed was he said I don't think it should be a
certain perception Jews has to be a negative perception. Well people like
Ilan Halmi were tortured and killed because they thought that Jews were rich.
It's not a negative perception. People in Colleople, Texas were taken hostage in
synagogue because they thought Jews were powerful. It's not a negative
perception. In minutes, people go and they think and they mean well. I'm not
they mean well. They think that they have a better definition. This definition
works. It's been an essential valid tool. And just again to go back, I'm
sorry to what Kenneth Stern wrote. And I'm happy to provide this and writing. I
provided to the previous committees. He said, of course, the Irish should be
used for hate crimes. Of course, it should. And more importantly, the other three
authors also signed a letter saying the working definition, it was cold
working because they meant to put it to work. And that's a letter that they signed that
three of them, Andrew Baker, as a person from the AJC will come and speak to that as well.
He's from that committee. And it has been put to work. They immediately gave it to prosecutors
and other authorities in Europe. And it has a 20-year history there of being a tool to
help us monitor anti-semitism and to help us look for intent behind hate crimes.
Thank you. Two more questions really quickly.
Thank you. You're kind of short because otherwise we're going to run out of time for public
really really quickly how many time well are we aware of other instances in
Georgia law where we refer to a third third party definition yes depending
the definition itself in the law we are we ask legislative council to provide
that for the House Judiciary Committee and throughout title 33 which is
the insurance title. The code Georgia code refers to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners NAIC as authoritative. In title 12 regarding to forest resources in title
6, in title 12 in regard to forest resources chapter 6, the code recognizes the NAICC or
the North American industry, industry classification code as authoritative. And throughout the code,
the NFPA National Fire Protection Association
and its various safety codes are recognized as authoritative.
In chapter six of 32, that's the regulation
of maintenance and use of public roadways,
the code sites, the National Arborist Association,
International Society of Arbor Culture,
their regulations as of January 1st, 2011, as authoritative.
Okay, and the last question is how many times
generally has it's been used to prosecute hate crimes across the country.
A statue like this?
Yes, never.
Senator Jackson.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you all for being here today.
This question Senator Robertson may actually be able to answer it, but for me.
I've spent a lot of time in code 16 with you and I feel like we spent a lot of time
We spend a lot of time writing definitions or clarifying definitions in code 60.
To your knowledge is there any incident, because this is about a crime, their instances
within that title, where we don't define the definition explicitly, or to your knowledge
are we always, do we ever reference somewhere outside of that code, or do we not just name
the definition?
I think questions for Senator Roberts?
Yes.
I think in Title 16, a lot of times the way we write the code are based on case law because
we're dealing with criminal acts that happen in other places.
And I think Title 40 is where we would probably find more definitions as associated with traffic
safety and things of that nature that are definitions that were codified by the federal government
and sent down because of federal highways and other things.
in Title 16, I think the vast majority of that is based on case law.
And looking at case law looked at a case yesterday, similar to this, where it didn't reference
the definition, but what it did was explain how this bill and the definition, the way this
bill is defined, is applicable in the courtroom, and I'm sure the attorney will correct me.
If I'm wrong, which I am occasionally, that a crime occurs, crime occurs in what this
legislation does is allow law enforcement to look for evidence related to this that calls
the crime.
In other words, if somebody stands in the middle of the street and yells, I hate Israel,
that's fine.
It's when there's an act that follows that, that you can draw a line from that act back
to them standing in the street saying, I hate Israel.
The same thing is if I went out there and made racist remarks
on a regular basis and then went and followed through,
and I will briefly say this, the individual that they are
looking at for spreading this literature,
while this literature is free speech.
This is a legitimate thread.
I have a very, very good understanding of this individual
because he happens to be from my district or was
until he was banished.
But by the court, not by me, but to answer your question,
title four, you would fall in line more than title 16.
One follow.
So you've said repeatedly that this is only
as it relates to if there was a crime that happened beforehand.
But once 22 say that all state agencies
shall consider anti-Semitism as evidence of discriminatory
intent for any criminal or non-civil law or policy.
So the way I read that, that means that this is going
to come up in any state agency.
So this could imply, say, to our schools,
to our university system, that this exact definition,
and because you all, instead of giving us
what we had previously from the House,
because you've referenced the entirety
of the Iowa definition, that includes
examples, which explicitly say that if you believe that the state of visual
is racist, that that is anti-submitting, then this will apply to our
university setting where this has become. We have letters, tons of letters in
here, from students who have had this iridefinition used against them from
their speech, and so I am gravely concerned because it's not just about a
predicate to a hate crime lines 22 explicitly say that it implies it applies to all
state agencies so please explain to me how I am wrong if I am I don't want to
say that you're wrong I just want to explain what the bill does the acts
that's referring to are unlawful illegal discriminatory conduct it's not
just acts and it applies to all state agencies and I'll give you an excellent
example of why you brought up schools you're gonna hear testimony from children
who were terrorized in their public schools,
and the school administrators rung their hands,
and they said, well, we don't know what anti-seminous is,
or not sure what it looks like.
Swastika's killed the Jews, gas the Jews terrorized.
The Fulton County wouldn't correct this
until the Department of Education
and the federal government came in and threatened
they were funding and their accreditation,
but that's why you want to tie it to the DOA.
You want the exact definition
that the federal government uses.
Now, I've seen those cases on your list.
I have, I want to say this, almost every one of those cases
are false.
They're full of things that are not true.
And I'm happy to submit in writing a bottle of every single
one of those.
But I will tell you this in a short response.
None of them, not one of them, involves a law like this.
None of them.
All of them, even the ones that some of them don't even involve
Ira.
The ones that involve Ira, don't involve a law like this.
They involve the possible use of Ira as a speech code.
The ones that involve a law, involve Title VI, which is already
in existence, and will continue to be in existence.
This law would not change in Iota.
It doesn't affect free speech on a campus.
It doesn't affect speech speech in a public school.
State agencies should use this in case there's a problem
in their district like Fulton County had
just a couple of years ago.
And why is it not acceptable for us to just write
exactly as Iro State's what the definition
of anti-Semitism is?
Why are you referencing the entire thing with the examples?
And that was the bill that we received from the House.
It just says anti-Semitism means a certain perception
of views.
like it says the definition.
Why are you all so insistent that we include
the reference specifically to Ira
and now to the Federal Civil Rights Act
that is also like, just help me understand
why we're in this different posture.
Sure.
First of all, again, what happened at the last committee
is why you don't wanna put the definition in word-by-word
because people then take a pen and edit it.
Another senator said, she'd be okay
if we just cut a different two lines.
Last year a different senator said
she wanted to cut seven lines.
Those examples are there because they're crucial.
Those are some of the most common excuses
that people give to hurt Jewish people.
It doesn't matter.
You can hate Israel, you can hate Jews.
It doesn't matter.
You can say whatever you want.
And the Irish definition, again, clearly says,
these are not always anti-Semitic.
They could be.
They're there because some people say
that they're never anti-Semitic,
even like Saddam Assad,
when you're attacking physically violently Jews.
They say, it's not.
There was a case in Germany,
They were told Germany in 2017 a group fire bombed a synagogue and they said to the judge
when they wanted to hate crime enhancement it's not anti-semitism we just don't like
Israel and the judge accepted that and removed the hate crime enhancement in response Germany
adopted the ira definition with the examples because that is what anti-semites do and that's
why it's important.
Okay, we're going to have to stop with the questions right now and move to public testimony
and unfortunately we are now behind on time so we're going to have 10 minutes.
for each side. So we're going to start with the people who are opposed to the bill and I'm going to ask the author to
stand by and
we'll call you back at the end
First I'm signed up and keep in mind that however long you take is
using the total time. So if you want more people to speak you need to make your points quickly. René
Okay, I'll vote funny.
I probably butchered your name.
I'll miss Annie.
Thank you.
Members of the Children and Families Committee,
my name is Renee El Nubani,
and as a Palestinian and a board member,
an incoming president for the Georgia Tech
Muslim Students Association.
I am giving this testimony in opposition to HB144,
which has been replaced with the bill text
of former HB30.
Please do not vote any version of this bill
out of this committee.
This year our MSA held a year-long educational series
highlighting different genocides and human rights violations
taking place around the world.
In February, our MSA plan to hold an event
about Palestine as part of the series.
When reaching out to speakers from Jewish voice for peace,
we found out what happened years prior
at YDSA's Palestine 101 event
and how they were put on a nine-month disciplinary probation
after complaints that Hillel made.
Georgia Tech later adopted the IRA definition
and 11 examples of anti-semitism as a result.
We initially intended on discussing the topic
of the legality of the state of Israel,
and one of the other examples of anti-semitism states
claiming that the existence of a state of Israel
is a racist endeavor.
Considering this example,
and how we could be labeled as anti-Semitic,
we decided not to discuss the legality of the state of Israel
during the event for fear of what the consequences might be.
We communicated this to the guest speakers
to ensure that they would not discuss it.
We reached out to IDSA to ask them about what happened
years prior and they gave us suggestions
for how to proceed with our event cautiously.
We also contacted and met with Palestine Legal
to give us advice on whether or not we should hold the event,
what our legal rights are in the scenario
and how to ensure the safety of the students attending.
Based on the advice given to us,
we took the following measures to ensure our safety.
We video recorded the event to capture
if anyone acts violently.
We required we required people to RSVP for the event
and we only allowed people to ask questions
through an online form for sensory purposes.
All of these are things we have not done
for any other events like this in the past.
Had it not been for the Ira definition,
we would not have had to suppress the speech
of the speakers and students attending
or take extra measures to ensure the safety
of our students.
This bill is not about combating anti-semitism.
It is a bill that will silence those advocating
for Palestinians and against human rights violations
in Israel infringing upon freedom of speech.
Thank you for letting me give this testimony.
Thank you.
Next is Fatima Chaudhary.
And we're down to seven minutes and 43.
Good morning.
Members of the Children and Families Committee,
my name is Fatima Chaudhary.
And as the current president for and on behalf
of the Georgia Tech Muslim Students Association,
I am giving the testimony on opposition to HB144
which has been replaced with the bill text of former HB-30.
Please do not vote on any version of this bill out of the Senate Children and Families Committee.
Renee spoke previously about the effect the IAHRA definition has had on our MSA in suppressing speech,
and I want to further discuss the extent to which this could affect students and college campuses.
Many students have been interested in advocating against the IAHRA definition at Georgia Tech,
But if any run addition of this bill is passed in the Senate and signed into law,
the issue would become much larger and become more challenging for us to repeal.
While proponents of this bill suggest that the definition of anti-Semitism outlined
will only be used by state agencies, there is nothing stopping schools and universities
from viewing this as the official state of Georgia definition of anti-Semitism
and using it to suppress speech even further.
For Georgia Tech specifically, this bill will affirm the school's leadership
that their adoption of the IHRA was appropriate
and acceptable under state code,
leading to greater suppression of speech
and targeting of Georgia Tech students and organization
who speak out in support of Palestine.
The claims made that the purpose of the bill
is to protect the Jewish people from hate crimes,
but it will only increase hostility and violence
towards those who advocate for Palestinians,
especially Muslim women who are easily identifiable
because of their hijab and who have been the target
of countless hate crimes, threats,
and verbal assault even on college campuses.
Every year, we have a few instances of verbal assaults
on Georgia Tech Muslim women.
And I want to urge that while you may hear from the opposing
side that anti-Semitism should be considered equal to the
criticism Israel, there is no country, no state, and no
single authority on this earth that exists and from having
the ability to be criticized by the people.
And I think if you were to equate criticism of a state to
the racist and persecution of a people,
then there is a dangerous boundary that you are crossing.
We ask this committee to protect free speech and support
to just students by voting no on HB144.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yep.
Yes.
What are the questions you might have for my room?
Hello.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Can you show me in the drill where it says
you can't criticize the state of Israel because the way I'm reading this all
that matters is if you have an act and they will tie that act as a was
motivated by discriminatory discriminatory intent so the only way you the
only way you would it would suppress speech is if you're motivated to go do a
violent act as the only way that you're going to be negatively impacted by your
speech is if your intent is to commit violence towards someone that is what
this bill says. Right but let's take back into consideration what Renee said
about specifically what happened in Georgia Tech which led to the IHRA
definition being adopted at our school. Why DSA held an event that criticized
the state of Israel that brought to light issues that were going on with their humanitarian
violations or whatnot that Israel was doing in Palestine at the time, right? That specific
criticism of that state, not advocating for any violence, not advocating kill all the
Jews or any other type of heinous and antisemitism action was criticized as going against the
Jewish people. Why is it that going to criticize and going to talk about a certain state and
their certain actions that they've taken against the people that have been well documented
by many international agencies is seen as equal to the criticization and the prejudice
against a Jewish people, but you're saying it's an act, right?
No, I'm not saying anything.
I'm saying what the bill says, the bill says you can say whatever you want, but as soon
as a violent act is committed they can tie that back to the speech.
I understand. So if there's no fear of doing a violent act and there's no intent to commit a violent act
You can say whatever you want
So that is the point of this bill is very clear. Okay, so my question to you would be what you don't ask questions
I asked the questions I think okay
Excuse me. Yeah, we have another question real real quick
You use the Georgia Tech example and you said y'all held an event there, you know, yeah, why do you say right?
How did you end there and you said y'all were criticized they were criticized by the okay
Hold on just give me a second who was criticized why DSA at the time who were they criticized by the Georgia Tech leadership
Okay, thank you. Was any student expelled or suspended no, but the organization was almost banned okay almost banned
I've almost been hit by cars. Okay, so it's been very specific because
myself and Senator Jackson as we were talking before, laws are laws they're very
specific so let's don't make hypotheticals and let's be very specific to Senator
Brass's point as I said before there's got to be the thread tying the two
together if it's not there then I can stand on the street out there and talk
bad about anybody I want to.
Just the way the committee process works you I asked we asked questions up here
I didn't mean to jump you so I don't know
Personally, I think stop there
It doesn't say it in the bill but the IRA definition is pulling the very question that you
are asking like where is it?
It is implied in the IRA definition.
We're going to have to move on here.
We're seriously running out of time so we have five minutes left.
or testimony from the con side, Annie, Jolani.
Chairwoman and members of the committee,
thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
My name is Annie Golanne,
and I'm a political strategist
at the Asian American Advocacy Fund.
A grassroots organization with a mission
to uplift the voices of Asian American specific islanders
and Native Hawaiians in Georgia.
I'm speaking to you today in opposition of HB144.
I want to first acknowledge how inappropriate
and undemocratic it is to just two legislative days
before Sinidai, strip a bill of all its current language,
and funnel in a bill that failed to make it out
of its original committee.
HB30 was heard in Judiciary in both the House
and the Senate.
Just three days ago, after significant opposition
to the measure, we watched it get tabled in Senate Judiciary.
It is now before you in this committee.
HB30, now HB144, is a violation of the First Amendment
of the Constitution.
It disproportionately suppresses the freedom
of speech of Palestinian Americans
and applies in both the context of hate crimes
and discriminatory intent.
Seven of the 11 contemporary examples
of anti-Semitism outlined in the 2016
IRA definition have to do with the state of Israel.
For context, one of them claims it is anti-Semitic
to say that the state of Israel is a racist endeavor,
which would bar someone from stating
that Israel is in apartheid state.
While the sponsors of the bill suggest
that it has nothing to do with protecting Israel,
they have publicly made comment stating
that people who oppose this bill do so
because they support Palestine rather than Israel.
These comments make the sponsors intent clear.
This bill is about protecting Israel
and the IRA examples that protect the state of Israel
at the expense of freedom of speech will be weaponized.
Our organization is particularly concerned
about this bill's impact upon Palestinian, Jordan's,
exercising their freedom of speech
to protest Israel's human rights abuses.
This bill explicitly states that anti-Semitism will be used
as evidence of discriminatory intent
under both criminal and civil code.
Not solely in the hate crimes context
that proponents claim the bill will apply in,
which we also oppose.
With the IRA definition conflating criticism
of Israel with anti-Semitism,
this leaves the door open for any actions by individuals
who criticize Israel to be perceived a discriminatory.
Because of the definition cited in this bill,
and especially the language used of rhetorical manifestations,
we are very concerned that this language will be used
to target peaceful protests by Georgia residents
who seek to voice opinions
about the occupation of Palestine.
In fact, ever since the IRA definition
was adopted by Georgia Tech,
students have been afraid of speaking out
in support of Palestine due to the risk
of their organization being suppressed.
I want to be clear that triple AF will oppose
any rendition of this bill.
Although we remain steadfast against anti-semitism,
we do not see any use of the IRA definition and examples
whether explicitly stated or not to be acceptable.
Due to the IRA definition suppressing
freedom of speech, the bill's disproportionate impact
on Palestinian-Americans and the bill's use
in multiple criminal and civil contexts.
We urge this committee to vote no on HB 144.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
next is Megan Gordon, and we're down to two and a half minutes.
You lining up to the next of that, father.
Good morning, y'all.
I will be quite brief.
My name is Megan Gordon.
I'm the Policy Manager with the Council
on American Islamic Relations.
Y'all have already heard this is not
version that passed the House. The House Judiciary Committee had three very long hearings
on this bill, and I know my audience. I know the Senate does not feel bound to do anything
that the House does. This bill also didn't come out of the Judiciary Committee, and I
know this landed with y'all. I mean, I don't actually know when it landed with y'all, but
It couldn't have been like 72 hours ago.
If this was as simple as predicate to hate crimes,
it would not have spent three committee hearings
on how judiciary.
If it was that simple, I think Senate Judiciary,
probably would have passed it.
If it, like, we have had 55 minutes almost in here today,
and y'all have had this bill for a couple of days,
It is the first year of a two year session.
There is time to continue to vet this bill.
We don't have to rush.
We don't have to make a decision today.
And so all I'm asking if you all
is to just not take action on the state
and allow time for the process to work.
Thank you.
Excuse me real quick.
Yes sir.
You came and saw me yesterday
and you gave me your number.
And what organization do you represent?
I work with the Council on American Islamic Relations.
Okay.
Is it true or not true that the FBI's distance itself
from working with your group because of ties to Hamas?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I appreciate your answer.
I've only been with the organization for.
You've answered my question.
That works.
Okay.
I'm sorry, what's your name?
My name is Fahed Abou-Aqou.
Yeah, you're not next on the list, unfortunately.
I know, but since our time is limited,
and I was born there, there are about eight other people
that are out there.
But you say there's only three minutes.
There's one minute left.
And you're jumping the line in front of five other people.
But we agree that I need to speak.
At least Cohen is next.
OK.
Good morning.
Unfortunately, we only got one in 15 left.
Okay.
I would say more about myself.
I'll just say my name is Elise Cohen.
I'm an anthropologist and also Jewish Studies
and Middle East Educator, Scholar Activist and Writer,
Jewish Life Cycle Facilitator.
Almost 20 years I led delegations to Israel and Palestine
and I also have lived in Israel multiple times for research
and for working with Palestinian Jewish sectors in Israel.
There's no need for this bill to define anti-Semitism.
There's no consensus by the Jewish people
and organizations to do so.
And the controversial IRA definition
could not highlight that more.
As it said, Kenneth Stern, one of the lead
drafters of the definition, has said it would be
weaponized to chill free speech.
The push to codify this non-legally binding,
IRA working definition of anti-Semitism
is one of a long list of ways that sadly,
some in our Jewish community have tried to shut down free speech related to
Israel for decades. I have multiple examples of those including personal ones
and how I the university where I worked was pressured to make sure even though I
was a Jewish studies professor there and did advocacy on Palestine outside of it
that to pressure the university to make sure my contract didn't continue. I
want to just actually point out that and I wouldn't typically do this but I
I think it's important to show
that why the I wrote examples,
what the intent is about using the I wrote examples.
You're going to need to wrap it up, Ms. Cohen.
Okay, Mark Goldfetter, legal counsel to the bill,
and who has said in testimonies
that he made the model for this bill,
has written articles in the Washington Times in Mishbhaha
about the Palestinian Nakba or history,
calling it a foundational myth of forced displacement,
demonstrably false.
The entire story is a lie,
Nakba mythology, a blood libel,
and anti-Jewish information.
he denies. Thank you. We're gonna go to the people who are in support of the
bill and again we only have 10 minutes so please keep your remarks brief. Beth and
Aaron gone.
We're only three minutes total. We've timed ourselves. Okay so what I know
Oh, will I want to make sure?
Okay, I just need my glasses.
I'm sorry, I'm going fast, I'm a little nervous.
Okay.
Should have had this ready, but I dropped my phone.
Okay.
Good afternoon, honorable members, or good morning, I should say.
Honorable members and chairwoman of the committee.
My name is Beth, and I'm in front of you today
to discuss why the definition of anti-Semitism is so important.
My twin boys were terrorized with antisemitic gestures
in Swastika's.
This went on for 18 months.
I was told that this was not a Swastika, but a piece symbol.
I was not taken seriously until I was
contacted by the Department of Justice
and the Department of Education in the Office of Civil Rights.
And that's when the school board decided to take action.
The Department of Education said if the state
could not figure it out, they would
I feel figured out for the county and take away the accreditation.
My situation had escalated to death threats and physical assaults, so I had to pull my kids
out of school early.
Our case is now known as the worst anti-stimetic incidences in schools in the history of the state
of Georgia.
It seems obvious that this killed the Jews picture that my son found in the bathroom and
down his locker is antisemitic, but it was not, we were told that it wasn't antisemitic.
Unfortunately, this is going on today.
I am currently advocating for a mixed racial student that is Jewish who defines our selfish
Jewish who is experiencing the same hate that we did.
And I've advocated in other schools and counties throughout the state of Georgia, including
but not limited to Fulton, Gwinnett, DeKab, and Atlanta.
Why?
Because there's no definition.
The school was afraid to act.
The police could not act.
And if there was a definition of anti-semitism,
there would not have been a question of what this was
and how to act.
I stand before you today to encourage and act,
to encourage the definition of anti-semitism.
So no other family has to endure the pain
that we went through.
I ask you to vote in favor of HB 144,
so my family's suffering wasn't invading.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
I know.
Madam Chairwoman, honorable members of this committee.
First of all, thank you for letting me testify today.
My name is Aaron, and I'm testifying to you
today in favor of House Bill 144,
and part based on my own personal experiences
of anti-Semitism.
As my mother previously pointed out,
me and my brother were terrorized for 18 months at our school, finding graffiti on the walls
such as kill the Jews, gas the Jews, along with, I believe I found 15 swastikas in the
18 months that this went on.
And I also had students occasionally surround me and throw money at me while screaming
Jimmy down in my face.
I believe this wouldn't have happened had there been a definition of anti-semitism, in
In part because everyone I went to, teachers, staff, administrators, even social workers,
and even the principal at one point all told me the same thing.
That what I was experiencing did not amount to anti-semitism, rather it was a piece symbol
and that the graffiti I was finding amounted to nothing but students pulling pranks.
The graffiti appeared on a near weekly basis, and it got so bad to the point where I contemplated
suicide at only 13 years old. And ever since I've been in therapy, had there been a definition
this would not have happened, and there would have been no doubt as to whether or not the
graffiti I was finding was anti-Semitic in nature. Such a definition would not have allowed
such an action for such a long period of time, but as painful and traumatic as this experience
has been, and as upset as I was to wake up at 7 a.m. to come here today, I'm here today,
And I'm here today because I don't want this to happen to anyone else.
Let alone have someone successfully contemplate suicide because no one acted.
Because not everyone has such loving friends and family who are fortunate enough to recognize
signs of suicide.
So please, to ensure that no one ever has to go through the unimaginable pain and trauma
that I went through and to make sure that everyone has a safe environment which they can
learn, work, or just be themselves where they don't have to worry about being targeted
because of who they are. Please vote in favor of this bill.
Thank you very much. Julie Katz. We've got five minutes and 26 seconds left.
morning. My name is Julie Katz and I am the Associate Director of American Jewish
Committee's Atlanta office. We are the Global Advocates organization on behalf
of the Jewish people and anti-Semitism is one of our areas of expertise. So
someone who spoke in opposition of this bill said if it were that simple we
would have just passed it. And unfortunately that is the problem is that
anti-Semitism is not simple and manifests differently than other forms of
of hate.
A little over a year ago, a terrorist
entered a synagogue in Coliville, Texas
and held four Jews hostage.
His motivation was to try to release
another terrorist from prison a few miles away.
And he chose the synagogue because he
believed that Jews had an extraordinary amount of influence
and government in the media, and that if he held
these Jews hostage, then he would be able to help this person, this terrorist get released
from prison.
When the FBI released a statement, the first statement they released while this hostage
situation was ongoing, they said that this person was not motivated by anti-symmetism.
that sink in. One of the oldest tropes of anti-symmetism in the books, the idea of Jewish
power and control, was not recognized by arguably the most important law enforcement agency
in the country. And that is why we need this definition so badly because it is not simple.
Anti-symmetism is multifaceted and manifests in so many different ways, which is why the
or definition compiled by experts for years gathering together to put together a definition
that encompasses or tries to encompass all these different types of anti-symmetism to help
people recognize it.
That is why this is so important.
I will finish with a few statistics from American Jewish Committee's most recent state of anti-symmetism
report.
One third of Americans have never heard the term anti-symmetism or do not know what it
means.
Nine out of ten American Jews are concerned about anti-symmetism, and four out of ten American
Jews believe that their status as American Jews is less secure than it was a year ago,
and that is a ten percent increase from a year ago, ten percent.
So please stand with the Jewish community,
help us address these hate crimes,
and vote in favor of the spill.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Rabbi Nidich, and we have just a couple of minutes left.
It's not here.
OK.
Wayne Keel Kyle.
Kyle, thank you.
Members of the committee, my name's Wayne Kyle.
I'm the CEO of Hills of Georgia.
Organization manages 24 campuses across the state of Georgia.
Supports 7,000 Jewish students.
Our students are subjected on campus incidents
that don't make the news and they're terrified.
We have had a student who had a walk out of a class
because professors called Judaism or Brutal
and grew some religion in explaining the Exodus,
the same professor said, how could it take 40 years?
Maybe they were lazy.
So substitute Judaism for African-American,
or any other ethnic group, and get a sense of how that student felt.
So let's talk about the elephant in the room.
The Irish definition talks about Israel being a racist state.
It has caused apoplectic contortions.
Now, I don't know about you, but I think
that the Chinese government is guilty of crimes.
But I don't believe that that belief allows me to go
and subjugate Chinese people to violence or discrimination.
OK?
The type of Israel rhetoric that's being referenced here
is being used by people on our college campuses against Jewish students.
And why?
What did they have to do with the Israeli government?
They don't have a direct line to the Kineset.
They don't.
Yet they're being harassed simply because they are Jewish.
The escalation of anti-Semitism isn't up for debate.
It's happening around us how we decide to step up and fight it.
That's on us.
I get in front of university committees.
They don't understand Title VI, Title IX.
Well, I'm going to tell you our students aren't being harassed and bullied or publicly
shame because they like candles on Friday nights or because they pray in Hebrew.
They're being harassed because they choose to go to Israel or vacation there in their
Jewish home.
It has nothing to do with religion.
And the bill in front of you allows us to set a standard.
We need to protect our students and give universities something that they can set policies
around and this bill does that.
I ask you to be brave.
I ask you to ignore the noise behind me who are from people who haven't read the bill
and haven't read the definition.
I could care less if someone thinks Israel is a racist state.
I don't care.
I don't care if someone's critical of the Israeli government.
I'm critical of the Israeli government, but what I do care is if you use that to attack
Jewish people on the street, and that's what's happening.
Thank you very much. We're out of time.
Senator Robertson. Madam Chair.
I move this committee past substitute House Bill 144 LC 491454 S is in Sierra.
Second. Okay. We're out of time.
Any really quick discussion? Then we're going to vote.
motion to table is or second that motion text priority so we'll vote on that
now so all in favor of the motion to table raise your hand all opposed okay
the motion fails.
Madam Chair, we have a member that is not part of the Children and Families Committee.
He's an ex officio member.
It's not listed as ex officio.
Right.
We have a letter from the Lieutenant Governor's Office because of the conflict with time,
we were afraid we were not going to have enough members to take a vote on this measure.
So I can provide the letter to you if you would like to see it afterward.
Thank you, Madam Chair, it would have been nice to have seen that the committee members
to know that before.
But thank you.
Okay, now we're going to vote on the motion that is on the floor from Senator Robertson.
We have a motion a second.
All in favor of the motion, raise your hand.
All opposed?
Okay.
Did you get the count?
Okay.
To oppose the motion passes.
We're adjourned, thank you.
You
