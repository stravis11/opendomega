you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you are your Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I don't believe anything in life really happens by accident. And since I have been a member of this body, I have had great experiences when it comes to learning more about the Jewish faith. It started with one of the legislators from my area, bringing down his rabbi to do lunch and learns. And we sat there and listened to this wonderful storyteller, tell us stories and to bring to life the Bible. Then when we became a majority party, I was honored by our speaker to be a sign, to be our representative to the Holocaust Commission. And I have served in that position most of the time that I have been here. And Mr. Speaker, thank you again for letting me continue to do that. And so when I learned that we had a fairly new rabbi in East Cobb, I wanted to make sure that he had the opportunity, and we had the opportunity to welcome him to Georgia and to the General Assembly. The Jewish community is a very large part of East Cobb and it's a very active part of our community and adds a great deal to the tapestry that makes East Cobb a wonderful place to live. So today, I and I will be introducing to you a senior rabbi Larry Surnovich. And he represents the Temple, Col. Emeth, one of three or four temples that we have in our East Cobb area. He, you know, describes himself as a teacher, a writer, a speaker, and he's a community leader. What I really like in him that he truly believes in the eternal hope of the Jewish people, which is to be a light to the nations of the world, something we especially need during these traveling times. He's been with us a year, he comes from New Jersey. I asked him how he liked Georgia and did he miss New Jersey and the winter weather and he said the first, the first things he did when he knew that he was coming here was he threw away his snow blower. You know, a really pretty smart move on his part. He moved here with his wife Becky and their two children and he enjoys yoga, running, and coffee with a good book which makes him somebody that I cannot identify with. You know, he's also trained as a police chaplain and he serves already in that role for the Cobb County Police Department. He's on the Council of Greater Atlanta and the Jewish community relations part with that and serves with the Cobb County Neighborhood Safety Commission. Already in just over a year, he has become a moving part and a great leader for our community and so I'm very glad to having with us today. Rabbi. Good morning everyone. And yes, I was very happy to get rid of my snow blower. No doubt. I hope it don't jinx us that hopefully the snow is over. Thank you to Speaker Ralston for the opportunity to be here. With all of you today, it's a real honor and thanks to my friend representative Cooper for the invitation and warm introduction today. Along with the delegation of Cobb County where I am blessed to call home. Thanks to all of you, the individuals of the Georgia State House of Representatives for spending your precious time here serving and sacrificing for the people of the great state of Georgia. It's an honor to be with you and to pray with you today. Let me begin then by saying I love you. I love you. You want to try that with me? We can all do that together. I love you. Here we go. I want to share a sound with you in just a moment. A sound that emanates deep within our souls. One that takes us back to the wilderness of Sinai. The sound of the shofar of the Ram's horn. If you would indulge me for just a moment, close your eyes and imagine that you are standing at the beautiful and majestic Mount Sinai, a place that will become known as one of Revelation and one of transformation. Along with the generations of Israelites that have just been freed from slavery, you've been told along with the rest of the people to remain at the bottom of that mountain. And wait until the third day when Moses would give you further instructions and share with you a vision of the future. Exodus 19 verse 16 describes this immensely deep and spiritual moment on the third day this morning dawned. There was thunder and lightning and a dense cloud upon the mountain and a very loud blast of the horn of the shofar and all the people who were in the camp trembled. The Blair of the Horn grew louder and louder and as Moses spoke, God answered him in thunder. Yes, there was fear. They were indeed afraid because there was no turning back and the future was unknown, unpredictable. The time for asking, do I stay or do I go? I'm not going to sing that by the way. Maybe later we can do a private song session. As my colleague, Daniel Ruttenberg writes, they'll have to face the ways in which responsibility covenant can be uncomfortable. It can push us and challenge us and force us to be accountable to the divine to others and to the best version of ourselves. At the heart of the Torah, deep in its center is the commandment in Leviticus 19, you shall be holy. How many distractions the penniness, the indulgence of our less admirable qualities do we have to give up to be holy? Freedom would be heralded with the blast of the shofar as you just heard. It was exactly the wake-up call they needed. Life is not lived in the comfortable but rather in the uncomfortable moments. Because that's when we grow the most, isn't it? We spend most of our lives finding ways to avoid the truth because we know that when we confront it, we must listen. And when we listen, we have to respond so many times we run from the truth, don't we? So since March of 2020, we've been launched into a world of unpredictability. But let's not kid ourselves. The world was in chaos before the pandemic and the cracks in our country and in our world were only getting worse. I believe that it was at that moment, at that moment that God hit the reset button and sent everybody to their rooms, to their homes to think about their lives. Anybody ever have that happen as a kid? You got sent to your room to go think about what you've done? We can all admit it. Come on. I know confronting the truth is hard, isn't it? To contemplate our individual roles and the challenges unfolding around us. Some people went into their homes and thought about their lives and pledged to help heal the divisions around them, including in their own families. Others emerged remarkably unchanged as if nothing really ever happened. There's a world filled with fear and hatred of the unknown, of the other, of the stranger among us. But the shofar, the loud blast of the horn, is a wake-up call. To remind us to believe once again, in the impossible, becoming possible. In miracles occurring in our own day, every day, of belief in the power of our world to move us, to inspire us, to allow us to partner with God in the continued creation of the world. The great, chastnic Mass, the Rabbi, Levy Yitzhak, a birdichaf, taught people here, the shofar, on Rocha Shana, on the Jewish New Year, and are supposed to awaken from their spiritual slumber. The shofar jars them, inspires them to reevaluate their lives and improve themselves. Most people, though, do not carry the sound of the shofar with them for too long a time. Some have already forgotten. By the time they return home for lunch, for those who are more spiritually sensitive, the sound of the shofar continues to inspire them every day of the year. When they feel themselves falling into a spiritual rut, when they feel that they're losing their spiritual direction, they hear the shofar within their minds, it challenges them to energize themselves, to refocus their goals. The inner shofar keeps them alert. But before you all go out and buy a shofar theme to alarm clock, and if you need, just give me your number. I'll call you in the morning. No, bless that shofar. To keep you alert, when you begin to get jaded about our world, there's more to the story. Sumer after revelation at Mount Sinai, you may remember, God asked the people to bring gifts. We read, tell the Israelites to bring me gifts, true ma. You shall accept me gifts from every person whose hearts move them. What does God need gifts for? Because just a few verses later, what does God say in Moses? As Sully McTash, Veshechanti, Bittocham, and let them build me a sanctuary that I may dwell among the people. After this tremendous moment at Sinai and hearing the sound of the shofar, God tells them to bring gifts so they can build a sanctuary enabling God to dwell among the people. But let me ask you the question, wasn't God already with the people? What was this all about? God needed to teach them a lesson, and one that is endured for generations. People will give or sacrifice something of themselves, not because they have to, but because they want to, because they believe in a vision of the future that is so much bigger than one single soul. These words here form the link between the generous thought and the generous deed. Isn't that right? Because we know about good intentions, right? Once people started giving, they couldn't stop. In fact, people gave so much that Moses had to tell them to stop and not bring anymore. There was an energy and an excitement about a shared future, one that would far surpass their wildest dreams. And this wasn't superficial or for show. There were no selfies at the moment. They had the knowledge that in the wilderness, they were either all in, or they all would die. It was a revolutionary idea introduced to the world that our own individual future is tied up with the future of the stranger sitting next to us. As the former chief Rabbi of the UK, Rabbi Jonathan Sachs, may his memory be a blessing, as he taught the Jewish sages noted, that on only one occasion, for those who know your Bible, only on one occasion does the Bible command us to love our neighbor. But in 37 places, it commands us to love the stranger. Our neighbor is one we love because sheer he is like us. The stranger, though, is one we love because sheer he is not like us. Loving the stranger is not banning books that teach the reality of the Holocaust or making it subjective on who decides, what Holocaust education might look like. Loving the stranger is not taken to synagogue, hostage in Texas, where my friend and classmate, Rabbi Charlie Citron Walker, has to save members of his community from a Jew-hating conspiracy theorist who believes that Jews control the world. Loving the stranger is not making threats at historically black colleges and universities or targeting Asians, Muslims or members of the LGBT community. Loving the stranger is making their lives as sweet, as precious, and as beautiful, as we want the lives of our own children to be. Well, one doesn't have to worry about being salted. Because of their race, religion, gender, and other things that make them unique. Rather, they're loved because of who they are and the gifts, right? The gifts that they bring, which will make our community even stronger. It's a place where we recognize that our diversity here in the great state of Georgia is what makes us stronger. From the building of the sanctuary to the building of this beautiful Georgia state capital, one common theme is clear. No building project will truly be complete. If we don't recognize the value of each individual and the gifts they bring. So if you would please rise with me. And let us pray. Dear God, we stand in your presence in this holy chamber. We've witnessed the thunder and the lighting and the blast of the shofar waking us up from our slumber. Moving us to do your work here on earth. We know our lives are in your hands and that tomorrow is not a given. Dear God, bless us today under this beautiful gold dome. Bless these leaders. Give them this strength and courage to do your will as they represent all of those who call the state of Georgia their home. Dear God, you endow us with the knowledge that freedom is never free and that we cannot take our representative government for granted or silence the voices of those who disagree with us. God, you know the opposite is true. Bless each of these incredible representatives with the gift of vision and the gift of hearing. Remind them that they have been given two years and one mouth so they may listen more than they speak and they may hear your voice and feel your presence in each other and let them seek to include rather exclude. Dear God, may the filing words from this beautiful Franciscan tradition be in the hearts today as they do the people's work. May God bless all of these incredible representatives with discomfort and easy answers and half truths and superficial relationships so that you may live deep within your heart. May God bless you with anger and injustice, oppression and exercise.

exploitation of people so that you may work for justice freedom and peace. May God bless you with tears to shed for those who suffer pain, rejection, hunger and war so that you may reach out your hand to comfort them and to turn their pain to joy. And lastly, may God bless each and every one of you with enough foolishness to believe that you can make a difference in the world so that you can do what others claim cannot be done to bring justice and kindness to all of our children and to all those in need. Let us all say, Amen, Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

At this time, it gives me a great pleasure to introduce to you a great Georgian, the Honorable David Namios, Chief Justice of our great Supreme Court here in Georgia. Justice Namios was appointed to the Supreme Court by Governor Sonny Perdue in 2009 and was sworn in as Chief Justice of our Supreme Court on September 4, 2019. The Son of Immigrants from Egypt and Germany, Chief Justice Namios was born in Atlanta on September 11, 1964. He attended Duke University where he graduated second in his class and Summa Cum Laude, and Harvard Law School where he graduated Magna Cum Laude and was a classmate of US Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. And as an editor of the Harvard Law Review, along with former President Barack Obama. Chief Justice Namios then served as a law clerk for Justice Scalia on the US Supreme Court. In 1995, Chief Justice Namios joined the US Attorney's Office in Atlanta. Shortly after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Chief Justice Namios returned to Washington and became one of the Justice Department's leading terrorism prosecutors, coordinating the investigation and prosecution of terrorist activity. Across the country and internationally and assisting in counter terrorism policy making. On December 1, 2004, Chief Justice Namios was confirmed by the US Senate as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. Chief Justice Namios was received numerous local, state and national awards and honors for his public service. It is my great honor to present to you the Chief Justice of our Supreme Court, the Honorable David Namios. Thank you. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Duncan, Speaker Ralston, President Pro Tem Miller, President Pro Tem, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, Members of the General Assembly, Constitutional Officers, my colleagues who are here with me today, presiding Justice Boggs, Chief Judge Rickman, and Vice Chief Judge Mercer, our fellow justices and judges who are watching and my fellow Georgians. Thank you for this opportunity to present to this gathering of the people's representatives, my report is Chief Justice on the State of Georgia's Judiciary. In past years, these reports have often discussed a variety of accomplishments of the judiciary in the preceding year along with an assortment of priorities for the coming year. But I'm going to focus on only one topic, the challenges to our judicial system created by the COVID pandemic, because while we do have other accomplishments and priorities, dealing with the pandemic's consequences is consuming the attention of Georgia's judges at all levels and it will for the foreseeable future. I will lead off as good lawyers all we should with the most important point. The resolve of Georgia's judges to uphold the rule of law and provide equal justice for all is as strong as ever, in spite of the difficulties created by the COVID pandemic from us two years now. We must never lose sight of the importance of our courts, citizens and businesses rely on courts to resolve their disputes fairly and peaceably through decisions by impartial judges and juries rather than by whoever has better weapons, more money, or the most political power. Our judicial system is critical to the rule of law that is a very foundation of this state and this nation. My parents came to this country from colonial Egypt and Nazi Germany and I've heard and studied what it's like to live under the rule of tyrants rather than a law. We are truly blessed to live in a state with a fair and effective judicial system. But as with all areas of our society, the COVID pandemic has created enormous challenges for our judicial system. And like most Georgians, we're frustrated that every time we take a couple of steps forward, a new wave of COVID cases comes and knocks us a step back. What we still call COVID-19 has now been with us in 2020, 2021 and into 2022. Yet through it all, Georgia's judges, lawyers and other participants in our justice system have demonstrated remarkable perseverance, creativity and resolve to keep our courts operating, even in areas with very limited resources and facilities. Even at the start of the pandemic, when much of our society shut down and people were told to stay home, our courts always remained open for matters essential to the protection of life, liberty and property, like criminal warrants and bond hearings, domestic abuse, protective orders and child removal matters. Last July won the statewide judicial emergency order ended along with the governor's statewide public health emergency. As Chief Justice, and in consultation with the Judicial Council of Georgia, which I chair, I continue to provide advice and guidance to judges around the state on how to deal with changing COVID conditions. And our Judicial COVID Task Force, led by my colleague, Justice Sean Ellen LaGrua and Chief Judge Russell McClelland of the Forsyth County State Court. Also continues to provide advice and guidance to courts and lawyers on COVID response. But it's advice and guidance, not orders. As we've learned more about dealing with the ever changing COVID challenges, we've realized that the best approach at this point is not broad statewide directives, but more tailored responses at the local level. And in this regard, I want to recognize and thank the leaders of our local judicial systems, the Chief Superior Court Judges of our 50 Judicial Circuits, who have taken on the primary responsibility for addressing COVID as it affects the courts and their areas. We've learned that if there's a COVID outbreak in a particular type of court or a particular area of a courthouse, it's not necessary to declare a lengthy local judicial emergency order for all the courts in the county. And we've learned that if there's a COVID outbreak in a particular type of court, it's not necessary to declare a complete legal emergency order for all the courts in the county or the circuit. A good example of this occurred during the week between Christmas and New Year's when the Omercron wave passed over Wakecross and infected or exposed several judges and staff members in the Weare County Magistrate Court, who then needed to isolate or quarantine. Chief Superior Court Judge Dwayne Gillis, working in consultation with the Chief Magistrate Judge, did not issue a local judicial emergency order affecting the entire Weare County Courthouse for the full 30 days allowed by the Judicial Emergency Statue. Instead, Judge Gillis issued an order telling deadlines in just the Magistrate Court for just 15 days with provisions to ensure that the court was never closed. Court documents could still be filed using a drop box in front of the courthouse and essential hearings could still be conducted by scheduled appointment. This sort of targeted and limited response to COVID outbreaks and risks is critical to keeping our judicial system as operational as possible. Another important response to COVID has been technological, particularly the use of remote video conference proceedings to keep cases moving. Now, judges tend to be pretty set in their ways. We're not usually early adopters of new technology. But the pandemic forced us to adapt, and in two years we've probably made as much technological progress as it would have taken two decades otherwise. And I want to recognize the extraordinary work done by the IT professionals in the Judicial Branch, like Bob McAteer and his team at the Supreme Court to support this technological transformation. Almost all courts in Georgia have used video conference technology, Zoom, WebEx teams, all sorts of platforms, to conduct proceedings virtually and therefore safely even when COVID conditions are at their very worst. When Cobb County Superior Court Judge Tang Kell's son had COVID early in the pandemic, Judge Kell was able to continue to conduct hearings virtually from a makeshift courtroom he set up in his bedroom, complete with an American flag he swiped off the front porch. While his whole family quarantine, Judge Kell live streamed to his open courtroom in the Cobb County courthouse, so the public would continue to have access to the proceedings. As COVID conditions have been flow, so too can the use of these remote proceedings. My court, for example, would prefer to hold our oral argument sessions in person in our beautiful new Supreme Court courtroom in the Nathan Deal Judicial Center. But remote arguments worked fairly well, and we quickly started using that technology after the pandemic hit as did our Court of Appeals. Since last summer, we've gone back and forth between in person in remote argument sessions. As the Elmachron wave peak last month, we decided to shift back to remote arguments. That enabled me to participate and preside over the oral arguments, even though I actually had COVID at that time and was isolating in my home. There is no way I could have done that in January of 2020. The school proceedings are one of the lessons learned from the pandemic that will be used long after it dissipates. We found that for many proceedings with few participants in limited evidentiary disputes, zoom hearings can be as effective and often far more efficient than traditional proceedings with everyone in a courtroom. Many lawyers prefer calendar calls and status conferences conducted online, which they can participate in from their offices, rather than having to drive from courthouse to courthouse, find parking, schlep through security, and then wait in the courtroom until their cases call. And it saves money for clients too. Most courts have also used to use, moved to using video conferences for initial appearances and bond hearings in criminal cases. That reduces the time, cost, and security risks involved in transporting defendants between detention facilities and courthouses for these usually short and straightforward proceedings. As another example, Chief Judge Bobby Reeves of the Middle Judicial Circuit in Southeast Georgia reports that it's not unusual now for his court to deal with multiple habeas corpus petitions in a single day, sometimes as many as five or six cases. These hearings involve prisoners challenging their convictions after appeal. In the past, the judge in that five county circuit had to travel to the courthouse in the county where the prison prison is located, the inmate needed to be securely transported to and held at the courthouse. The lawyer representing the state had to travel from Atlanta or Augusta, witnesses also had to travel, and the schedules of all of those participants had to be coordinated. Now the hearings are usually conducted by video conference with the consent of the parties. Judge Reeves presides over from his home courthouse in a manual county, the prisoner participates from the prison, usually in Washington County, the state's attorney from his or her office, the witnesses from their homes or offices, and with all the travel eliminated, there are many fewer schedule conflicts and lower costs for all involved. We recognize that some participants in court cases do not have good access to the internet, including many self-represented litigants in magistrate and other courts. Judges have been creative in providing electronic devices and secure spaces in courthouses or even devices with hotspots that can be used in vehicles outside the courthouse to ensure fair access to these proceedings for all involved. Many of these virtual proceedings can and should be part of the judicial system's new normal when COVID becomes just a memory. And looking forward, I also have the hope that the technological lessons that we've been learning can help with longstanding concerns about access to justice by poor and lower income Georgians who need legal help with issues affecting their families, health, homes, and jobs. One of the biggest challenges for access to justice in this state is that most of Georgia's lawyers are in Metro Atlanta or other larger cities, while much of the need for free, pro bono or low-cost legal services is in parts of the state with few lawyers. Now that we've learned that judges, lawyers, and litigants don't always have to be in the same physical location to participating court proceedings, perhaps we can find ways to bridge this gap. My newest colleague on the Supreme Court, Justice Verde-Colvin, is chairing the Judicial Council's Access to Justice Committee, and she's an energetic proponent for ensuring that all Georgians have the ability to get the legal advice they need. But many judicial proceedings cannot be done effectively or even lawfully by video conference. These proceedings require their participants to be live and in person in a courtroom, and they often involve a significant number of participants. It's very important to keep in mind that most of the people who come to our courtrooms are not thereby choice. Georgians can decide what level of COVID risk they are comfortable with before they go to a grocery store or a braze game. But litigants and lawyers may need to come to courtrooms to get their cases resolved. Witnesses are often compelled to be there by subpoena, and jurors are there because they were summoned and would be subject to contempt if they fail to appear. Because we require these people to come to court, we also have an obligation to ensure that the conditions there are safe for them. Judges across the state have triage cases to determine which ones really need to be in person and in what priority. To limit the number of people in court house hallways and courtrooms in any one time, judges have split up case calendars and spread them throughout the day, with some courts using procedures for participants to wait in their cars until being notified that it's time to enter the building. Many court clerks have set up secure drop boxes outside court house doors to reduce contact between people filing papers and staff. All of these innovations are helpful, but the number of court room participants is largest for jury trials, which are also the ultimate proceeding in our judicial system. All Georgians have be constitutionally protected right to have their criminal cases and many of their civil disputes resolved by jury of their fellow citizens. And jury trials require a lot of people. The judge courtroom clerk, court reporter, bailiff's security, the litigants and their lawyers, witnesses, the jurors, and usually a few alternates. And at the start of the trial dozens and sometimes hundreds of prospective jurors from which the trial jury will be selected. Plus family members, victims, media representatives, and members of the public who want to watch the trial is their constitutional right. Now think about the Georgia trial courtrooms that you've seen on TV or been in yourself. They're usually not large to start with. In the court, we squeeze the jurors together on one side in what we call the jury box. With the witness stand, the judges bench, clerk, staffs, and tables for litigants and lawyers all close at hand. Because all the participants need to be able to see and hear the proceedings. And during breaks and final deliberations, we sent the jurors to sit together in an even smaller room. We had all these folks sit in tight spaces for hours a day and days and sometimes weeks on end. That way of doing things is a recipe for the spread of a dangerous respiratory virus like COVID. So when COVID rates are skyrocketing, as they were in the spring of 2020, and again in the winter of 2021, and with the Delta variant last fall, and recently with the Omicron variant, there may be no way to conduct jury trials in a way that adequately protects the health of those involved. When rates are more moderate, however, our judges have figured out ways to safely conduct jury trials, even high profile trials that last for several weeks. They've done so by requiring mass and improving ventilation and sanitation. They've reconfigured courtrooms to socially distance jurors and other participants. Or when the courtrooms just weren't big enough to accommodate jury trials and jury selection, they borrowed or rented larger facilities were possible. In Douglas County, for example, Chief State Court Judge Eddie Parker explains that the judges modified their two courtrooms by moving benches and desks to allow socially distance trials for misdemeanor crimes, which used six person juries. But there still wasn't enough room for civil trials that required 12 juries. So the court approached the Douglas County Commission to obtain use of the citizens hall, where several jury trials have since been held very safely. The same with court administrators, sheriffs and other stakeholders, courts have used the classic center and Athens, the James Brown Arena and Augusta, the ice rink at the Columbus Civic Center, and other alternate facilities for trials or jury selection. Now acoustics and sound problems are a particular problem in these larger spaces. So they require creative solutions, like the wireless headsets, that the Augusta Superior Court obtained for prospective jurors, parties and lawyers to be able to clearly hear the questioning in that huge facility. And there's also often a major challenge with holding criminal trials with detained defendants in these alternate spaces, because they usually don't have secure holding cells, meaning that many more sheriffs deputies are required at a time when most sheriffs departments are stretched then. Technology can still help, to some extent. Fulton County Chief Judge Christopher Brasher and his fellow Superior and State Court judges have developed a method for selecting jurors remotely in civil cases. Judge Brasher estimates that since last June more than 75 juries have been selected for civil trials using Zoom. The Fulton County Courts are seating more than half of the potential jurors summoned that way, which is a rate much higher than when jury summons were in person only. While some lawyers have been hesitant about the process, Judge Brasher notes that many prospective jurors seem to open up and respond more to questions when they're sitting alone in their home or in another known and safe feeling environment rather than in a courtroom surrounded by dozens of strangers. Judge Brasher also reports that the reaction of prospective jurors has been overwhelmingly positive. Other courts in Georgia are starting to use this remote jury selection process, and it's another of the innovations that should outlast the pandemic. But remote jury selection is used only for civil trials, and even with all the creativity our judges have shown. As long as social distancing and other health measures are required, the number of jury trials will be far below what it was before the pandemic. For example, Judge Kell says that the Cod County Superior Court would often conduct seven or eight jury trials a week prior to the pandemic. The most they can conduct now with social distancing and other precautions is three, less than half the pre-pandemic rate. Judge Wade Pagget also notes that while he and other Superior Court judges in the Augusta area have worked hard to resolve cases that were likely to result in jury pleas, in guilty pleas or in civil settlements, what's left now are the hardest and most complex cases that are more likely destined for trial. Keep in mind that a civil settlement can be conducted completely on the court.

paper and a guilty plea hearing may take 30 minutes, but a trial often lasts for several days or even weeks. So even when not halted entirely, our judicial system's capacity to conduct jury trials and other proceedings that need to be done in person is significantly lower because of COVID. That's led to significant backlogs, particularly of the serious criminal cases that are the most likely to get a trial and have long and complicated trials. Having many gang related and other trials with multiple defendants, multiple defendants multiplies the participants in a trial. Dordi County for example has at least five pending serious violent felony cases with eight or more defendants. But there are also backlogs in domestic cases, personal injury cases, business cases, and all sorts of other cases in all of our trial courts. Superior courts, state courts, juvenile courts, probate courts, magistrate courts, and municipal courts. Judges are acutely aware that all of these cases are important to the litigants in the community. We must always remember that court cases are about real people, our fellow Georgians, defendants accused of crimes and detained in jails without bond waiting for a trial to determine their guilt or innocence, crime victims waiting for some justice. Children in limbo has divorced cases and child custody disputes language. Children in limbo are waiting and struggling to survive until they can be awarded compensation. Business owners are trying to operate under the cloud of pending litigation. We're working hard and we're working together to try to restore and expand the capacity of our judicial system to resolve cases, especially those requiring trials. You provided the courts with some much needed statutory tools in your last session. You authorized judges to extend statutory speedy trial deadlines at the local level for a time, even after formal judicial emergencies end, so criminal defendants are not required to just be released without even having a trial. You allowed more criminal cases to get started with a prosecutor's accusation, instead of by grand jury indictment, and more cases to be tried by judges rather than juries were the defendant's consent. Many made it easier to use alternate facilities for court proceedings. And last November, Governor Camp allocated to the judicial system $110 million in funds the state received under ARPA, the Federal American Rescue Plan Act. These funds cannot be used to supplant normal operating budgets that let courts handle the ongoing flow of new cases being filed. The ARPA funds can be used only to obtain temporary space and hire and pay temporary personnel to address case backlogs, with a priority on backlogs of serious violent felony cases like murder, arm robbery, and aggravated sex crimes. The goal is to add more capacity with proportional funding for senior and temporary judges, as well as additional prosecutors, public defenders, court clerks, court reporters, bailiffs, and the like. The judicial counsel through a committee chair by presiding just as bogs and staffed by the administrative office of the courts has worked diligently to establish an application process and award initial grants, tuddling nearly $25 million to 26 judicial circuits around the state by late December. So those funds have already started to be used. The second round of grants will be awarded later this month. A total of 42 of our 50 judicial circuits have applied for help reducing their backlogs. This has been a complicated task, but presiding just as bogs his committee, the AOC, and the judicial circuits have worked very hard, and we all greatly appreciate this financial support. But note that this ARPA funding is targeted and restricted, both by federal rules and additional limitations established by OPB. Working for most courts in Georgia has traditionally been a shared responsibility of the state and the counties. And we need more counties to step up and contribute some of the ARPA funds that they're receiving directly to address the backlogs of cases in their county's courts. This year, every single Georgia county will receive another portion of federal COVID relief funds. Many individual counties will receive more than the $110 million that judicial grants was allocated to use in 159 counties. The federal guidelines expressly authorize counties to use their COVID relief funding to address backlogs of cases in their courts. Fulton County has dedicated $75 million of its ARPA funds to assist its judicial system to clear out backlogs. Now Fulton is our largest county, and it has the largest backlogs, but other counties need to assist their courts as well if we're going to get back on track. We've been working with ACCG to help communicate the urgency of this issue to county leadership. Because in the end, the issue is not just the backlogs of cases that have built up over the past few years, new cases keep getting filed in all of our courts, sometimes at higher rates and before the pandemic where crime rates have increased. So let's assume, let's pray that we'll soon see COVID risks reduced to the point that we can get rid of social distancing and other health precautions and get our jury trial rates to back what they were before the pandemic, back to 100% of what we considered normal capacity. Well, in many counties, the judicial system operated at maximum capacity before the pandemic hit. They were barely able to handle the number of jury trials required based on new cases coming into the courts each year. This is demonstrated by the fact that a pre-pandemic case load analysis by the Judicial Work Lead Assessment Committee identified the need for eight new superior court judges in circuits around the state. All of these newly filed cases still need to be handled, and now add on top of them, all the cases that have not been able to be resolved in the normal way over the past two years. I want to offer you a way to think about what our courts are facing. The Atlanta Braves canceled 102 games during the 2020 baseball season due to COVID. Those games were just canceled, forever, not postponed to be resolved later like court cases have to be. What if those games eventually had to be played? And the Braves had to postpone another 102 cases 102 games last season. They would be looking at a not-coming season with the usual 162 games plus 102 games from the 2020 and another 102 games from 2021. That's a 366 game season, and I'm not sure that even our World Series champs could handle that. This is the situation some of our courts are facing right now with their overall case loads. Let me give you a few specific examples from around the state. We have a rural judicial circuit on the coast that has four prisons. It has more than 200 serious, violent felony cases pending, 33 coming from the prison system alone. A northeast Georgia rural circuit has a total pending case load, two thirds higher than before the pandemic, including 53 serious, violent felony cases. The six county southwestern circuit had 377 open felony cases in 2019. Now it has more than 900. Muscogee County in West Georgia has almost 300 serious, violent felony cases pending, including more than 100 detained defendants charged with murder. And these are just the indicted serious, violent felony cases. They don't include cases in which the defendants have been arrested but not yet indicted. All the other sorts of criminal cases, much less all the civil cases. So this will be the main issue that the judicial system in Georgia will be dealing with. Not only until the rest of our state and society return to more normal conditions, but for several years to come. I can pledge to you the continuing diligence and creativity of Georgia's judges at all levels. But we will need support and patience from you and from the public as we struggle to keep up with new cases while also resolving the cases backlog due to COVID. I want to mention one last pandemic related issue. Studies have shown that people with mental illnesses are more likely to be incarcerated than hospitalized. Our jails have become our de facto mental institutions. And our criminal justice system has struggled for many years with how to deal with offenders who have unaddressed behavioral health issues. The pandemic has significantly magnified these challenges. I know that improving our mental health system across subordinates are priority for Speaker Ralston and for many of you. Presiding justice boggs and judges Brian Amiro and Sarah Harris served on the behavioral health reform and innovation commission. And Georgia's judges support these efforts and stand ready to assist. One effective method of dealing with nonviolent offenders who have behavioral health issues is our accountability courts, which is the general assembly and the governor have been so supportive of in recent years. These courts, including mental health courts, veterans courts, drug courts and DUI courts, deal with criminal defendants with much greater frequency and depth than traditional courts. As they address the behavioral health issues and other issues that often lead nonviolent individuals into our criminal justice system. Our accountability courts have had to be particularly creative during the pandemic in balancing remote and in-person check-ins, group meetings and treatment sessions. But they have continued to be successful in reducing recidivism rates, saving the state money by allowing offenders to re-enter society and the workforce, rather than being incarcerated, and most importantly saving lost souls. But beyond accountability courts, communities across Georgia need more resources to serve our fellow citizens with mental health issues. Addressing this problem is not just good for our justice system and our economy, it's a moral imperative for our state. I'd like to end on a positive note. In December, the Supreme Court of Georgia celebrated its 175th anniversary with a two-day history seminar. I want to thank the Georgia Legal History Foundation, which organized the event along with my colleague, Justice Carla Long McMillan. In listening to the speakers of that event, I was struck by how much our Supreme Court has changed over the years. We've grown from three justices in 1846 who traveled around the state by Horts and Buggy to hear cases. And non-justices with chambers in the state's first building dedicated to the judiciary who now have the ability to hear cases by video conference when necessary. There are only three former female Supreme Court justices, but we now have four women serving as justices at the same time. Yet some things don't change. We remain one of the busiest high courts in the nation. We disposed of nearly 1,400 cases in 2021, including issuing 239 full opinions. That's more than three times as many opinions as the US Supreme Court did issued in its last term. But most importantly, our fundamental mission has never changed. Like all courts in Georgia, we remain focused on providing an independent and impartial form, in which disputes are resolved through a fair and efficient process, in accordance with the law and with equal justice for all. That mission has been challenging many ways over the centuries, and the pandemic crisis has certainly been a significant new challenge. But Georgia's judges and the staff that support us are resilient and resourceful. We're weathering this storm and we'll emerge better than we were before. You are very valued allies in our mission, and we appreciate everything you do for our state and for the citizens who we serve together. Thank you again for the opportunity to report to you on the state of our judiciary. May God continue to bless the United States and the great state of Georgia. Thank you, Justice Namias, for your remarks. And just a great reflective look back as to how hard you and your colleagues have worked all throughout the judicial system through this unprecedented time. And grateful for your commitment to carrying out justice in our great state of Georgia. Madam Dorrickiepper, please ask Court the Chief Justice, the Justice of the Supreme Court, and the judges of the Court of Appeals from the Chamber at this time.

Chair is going to ask that members who speak on morning orders limit their remarks to no more than two minutes each. Chair recognizes for a morning order representative lyrichia. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It probably doesn't come as a surprise to many of you that I'm up here this morning to offer an apology. If you know me and had an opportunity to spend a little bit of time with me you'll see that I can be a liability to be around. You might get a little trouble but I will also say that if you know me and you're going into battle I'm the guy you won't stand beside you. But that does not excuse an inappropriate action or behavior or speech and if you'll ask my wife she'll tell you I'm prone to all of that. However it's made me pretty good at apologizing. There's a lot that I can say and I've heard I've even heard the word hypocrite. Let me be clear about something with the word hypocrite. We all are and I am the chief. We are all broken. We are all in need of guidance and advice and wisdom and grace and mercy. So I'm going to quote the rabbi that we heard this morning and I'm going to keep it short. I love this house and I love you. I'm sorry for what I did and in case anybody doesn't know I was the goofball in the panoramic picture that thought it would be cute or naughty or a little funny. To make a gesture with my bird finger and none of that was cute or funny but it was definitely naughty and inappropriate. I apologize I hope that you'll extend me a little bit of grace and forgiveness. I love you and I love this house and God bless you. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Ethics Committee. Chairman Randy Nicks for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ben, if you don't wish to hear the morning orders there's plenty of room and the Annie room are out in the hall. Otherwise the chair is going to expect that you give attention to the member in the well. Chairman, gentlemen, may proceed. Friends of the House, I've been honored to serve in this house for 16 years. Now the old adage that the days are long and the years are short is really true. They've been some long, long days. But the years have gone just like that. It has been such an awesome honor. I come in here every day and I look around and I'm amazed that I'm here. Do you realize the history that's in this building? Do you realize that there are almost 11 million people in this state? There are 180 state representatives. I am one. I'm one. I said at that desk right over there. Right on the front row. I didn't start on the front row. I started way back in the middle but I'm on the front row. I've got a thing there that's got buttons on it. It's got a red button. You've got a green button. You've got a yes. It's got a button you can press to speak. It is such an amazing thing to me and it is so very, very special. But you know what? You're just as special. You're just as special as I am. You were elected to come here. You represent about 60,000 people. You are given the title of the honorable representative just like I am. You're special. You've got the same voting apparatus there on your desk. You represent people who believe in you and they sent you here to take care of the people's business. And you know what? In a lot of your districts, I couldn't get elected. But most of you are a lot of you could not get elected in my district. It's just that way. But when we come here, unfortunately we come here with differences. We come here with competition on our mind. We come here with contention. We're almost like the court system. We come here almost as an adversarial situation. We start off. Maybe in a primary. You either got to outright or out left to others in the primary with you. You make it to the general. You got an R&D. You're already beginning to vibe up. And then you get down here. You got rural. You got urban. You got conservative. You got liberal or progressive. We've got the full gamut of political ideologies in this house. We've got caucuses of everything you think of. We've got a majority caucus. We've got a minority caucus. And I can go on and on and on is how we divide our country.

sells up on these things. And that's before we even swear in. But we come here because decisions have to be made. We come here with this volatile mix of people that I've just mentioned with all of these differences. And I've got a question for you. What keeps us from just being a mob? What prevents us from just being a mob of 180 people? The people who decided about making the rules for the house kind of solved that force. If you look at the house rules ethics and the core of the House of Representatives, rule 1.1 says this. All members and staff of the house shall conduct themselves at all times with dignity with dignity. And with respect for others in a manner to ensure appropriate decorum and the deliberations of the house and to reflect the responsibilities incumbent upon a member or staff of the house. Dignity. Dignity. Dignity. You know the fact that we are elected by the people and we hold this special office means we're held to a higher standard. That respect that you get, that what's given to you when you come in here, do you get all of these things? You're to be held to a higher standard because of that. You know this word dignity is an interesting word. It's not a long word, but it's a powerful word. Here's the definition dignity, bearing, conduct or speech indicative of self-respect or appreciation of the formality or gravity of an occasion or situation. Indicative of self-respect or appreciation. I want to share just a couple of things with you and I'm going to be more than two minutes, Mr. Speaker, but you said I could. I was looking at the word dignity and it means a lot to me and I hope it means a lot to you. God by the name of Michael Wynn wrote this, dignity. Listen to this. Dignity is the ability to stand strong and tall in the face of adversity while being able to bow to the elderly and crawl with the children. Dignity is taking a stand for your beliefs without closing your mind to another's opinion. Dignity is being an example by your deeds and through your words avoiding gossip, anger and lies. And finally he says dignity will manifest itself in the warmth of your smile, the depth of your love and kindness for your fellow man. Another person says it this way, knowing when to walk away is wisdom. Being able to is courage. Walking away with your head held high is dignity. You're all special people. People sent you here because they trust you, but they sent you here to do something. They sent you here to do the people's business, not to promote yourself, but to do the people's business. And for that they believe you should be held to a higher standard. I want you to think about this. I want you to think about conducting yourself while you're here as if what you're doing and what you're saying is being live-streamed and directly to your mother, to your family, to your pastor. Think of the person that you admire the most in this world that you would hate to disappoint and imagine that everything that you do and you say while you're in this house is live-streamed directly to them. And we all have that person. I think about my third great teacher. I'd hate to do anything in the world that would ever go back to her because she poured herself into me. But just think about that. Please conduct yourself with dignity, treat others with dignity, and remember this is important. The people have entrusted us with the honor and dignity of this house. At this moment in time we're building on the history that's out there, we're going to pass it on. Let's join arms together and leave it better than we found it. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Dickie for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Chairman. And thank you Chairman Dickie for that. Wow, I hate to follow that. On a different note, today is Georgia Farm Bureau Day at the Capitol. It's Georgia's largest farm organization with over 250,000 members and offices in every county. And I hope you'll stop by your local office and visit them and see what they're doing to promote and encourage agriculture throughout our state. And they also sell little insurance as well. You know a few years ago this house lost a great farmer and a great ag chairman in Tom McCall. But Farm Bureau gained a great president with he and his wife Jane and saw on behalf of Georgia Farm Bureau like the virtue to have lunch down at the depot today as soon as this session's over and they also have their mobile classroom out in the street what was formerly Washington Street and two of that and just just want to say a shout out to our Georgia Farm Bureau organization in this state. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett, Chairman Stevens, majority whip hatchet and representative Ridley for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. February 8th today is dyslexia day at the Capitol also in 1994 the National Institute of Health conducted a study here's some of their findings dyslexia is identifiable with 92% accuracy at between the ages of five and a half and six and a half dyslexia represents the most common of all non-learning disabilities dyslexia is the leading cause of reading failure and school dropouts in the nation early intervention and is essential for this population children do not outgrow reading failure or dyslexia to say it better children do not mature out of reading disabilities early detection is critical and they can go on to do many great things some of the famous people with dyslexia just a few Steve Jobs Albert Einstein, Muhammad Ali, Bill Gates, Steven Spielberg, Magic Johnson, Tim T.

colleagues jahil is one of the hundreds of children that are available for adoption in Georgia today thank you and i yield the well jahil recognizes representative canon for a morning order thank you mr. speaker good morning members i wanted to bring to you today the attention of an issue that has been near and dear to a lot of members which is birth in Georgia as many of you may know i serve as a labor doula here in our hospitals in the state of Georgia i serve clients who are as far down as al-bini and as far up as blu-rige you see as a labor doula sometimes you're compensated by those who can pay you and in other states you're compensated by medicade unfortunately in our state we have seen that birth workers have only been able to be compensated by individual pay and so i want to just talk to you a little bit about what it looks like to be a labor doula or a direct entry midwife in Georgia right now it means that you're providing care to people who would generally receive Medicaid services but the state doesn't actually include it every other state surrounding us florida tenisee north and south kira line uh alabama and missusippe all allow for direct entry midwives those are midwives who are trained in emergency response care for birth and have those who are support workers to them labor doulas like myself we're struggling right now in Georgia because as i reported to you yesterday in the a jc reported the births at home have gone up 29% over the past years because of covid-19 of course on your desk of course i have some information about it but the goal is really to increase the opportunity for legislators to just understand that birth is natural and the ways that birth is happening right now in the state of Georgia we can all relate to whether you were born at home or whether you were born in the hospital i asked that you just take some time to get to know birth workers in georgia will be here all around the state capital today and if i can ever be of help to you regardless of where you think i might be on the issue i hope you come talk to me thank you mr speaker that completes morning orders what purpose does chairman work eyes arise to make a motion

Amendment, Chapter 9 on Title 34 of the fiscal year, Judge Anitator relating to workers' compensation. So it's the extend the time period for the dissolution of the subsequent injury, trust fund. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Industry and Labor, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Houston Gaines to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1045, there are two parts to this legislation. Both are simply changing dates. The first part, which is sections 1 through 6, maintains the employer contribution rate at 2.64%, with the administrative assessment at 0.06%. Rates we've had since 2017. Should this not pass, the employer contribution rate would increase to 2.7%, the administrative assessment fee would increase to 0.08%. This legislation extends these rates through 2026. The legislature has implemented extensions every few years since 1987. In 2016, extension of this sunset passed unanimously. The second part of the legislation, Section 7, extends the subsequent injury trust fund for two years, from 2023 to 2025. The subsequent injury trust fund was started in 1977 to encourage employers to hire and retain qualified employees with disabilities. Subsequent injuries were picked up by the fund as they occurred. Insurance companies and self-insured to pay assessments yearly into the fund since 2019. When it was decided, there was enough funds accumulated to pay for all future benefits. The fund quit accepting cases in 2006. They are down from 10,000 over 10,000 cases to 645 cases. The program is self-funded, so this does not cost the state or taxpayers. And by passing this legislation, it will allow the subsequent injury trust fund to continue to lower its case load and help more workers close their cases. And 2025, the program would be transferred to the Department of Insurance. In 2015, extension of the subsequent injury trust fund also passed unanimously. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer a question. Do you yield for questions? You have a lot of questions. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for one, and then I'll. Okay. Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I will. I'm a litigator. I live my life by the grace of deadlines, both from judges and from opposing counsel, as most people do. So I don't have any problem generally with extensions of time. But when you say we've given extensions regularly since 1987, we haven't had any more cases since 2006, which by my math is 16 years ago. I understand we've got nine employees over there. Last year, we settled 57 cases out of the 645. At that rate, we're going to need a lot more than four years. So I don't mind giving extensions, but I want to know to what end. Because it seems to me we've got people that are lagging out there waiting for attention. These are working people. So tell me how this is actually going to alleviate problems for these working Jordans. Sure. Well, thank you for the question. The 1987 piece was the Department of Labor Assessment that we've given extensions for every five years, not related to the Sub-Squint Andrew Trust Fund. So we have extended the Sub-Squint Andrew Trust Fund. We lasted that in 2015. As I said, in 2006, there were over 10,000 cases were down to 645. So there has been progress made. And two more years would allow additional progress before the program is transferred to the Department of Insurance. You yield for another question. I will. But if we have settled only, as I understand it, 12 cases in the last year, how are two more, four, or six more, even eight more are going to do it? Aren't we at the point where we need to settle what we can and let the rest be handled administratively forever and ever-eight men? So as I understand it, they are on the verge of settling quite a bit more. As I said, they went from 10,645. The program is going to be transferred to the Department of Insurance. That's what the legislation did several years ago. It's going to transfer the department. But this would give the current Sub-Squint Andrew Trust Fund the ability to get that down even further. And so that's what the legislation does. In addition to, again, the Department of Labor component, keeping the rates as we have them since 2017, which those rates would increase if we didn't pass this. So Mr. Speaker, with that, I'll yield the well and ask the bodies favor. We'll consider that. You don't want to take any more questions? Oh, you. OK. gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute? The chair here is none. The Committee Substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote I. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Kenner rise? Parliamentary inquiry. It's not true that the governor has appropriated $150 million in part to fund this. And with four more years, $150 million, the expectation should be to settle all these cases. Well, I think the first part is certainly true in terms of the amount of the appropriation or the allocation. What purpose does representative Evans rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Isn't it true that if that $150 million is appropriated, which I believe that it is as well, it certainly could be spent between now December 31, 2022, which is the current sunset? I believe that that is the case. All right. One more parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does representative Holly rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Is it not true that for those of us who have heard this case and are committee meeting for those that actually voted against it, after realizing that both sides actually came to an agreement that we voted and that now will likely vote in favor of it? You have the gentleman so states, have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1045. The eyes are 116. The nays of 37. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 961 will be postponed until the next legislative day, the clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Honoring the life and memory of Russ Russell Carrick, Honoring the life and memory of Gloria Elaine Doss, recognizing commending Ethan fam, recognizing commending Moses missionary Baptist Church on the occasion of its 115th anniversary, recognizing February 8th. 2022 is Georgia's stop day at the state capital, recognizing January 28th, 2022 is John Evans Day, saluting the 100th anniversary of the Brasantom Women Club, recognizing commending Ethan's Clark County Police Chief Cleveland Sprule, recognizing commending in Georgia State University team on its outstanding performance of victory into 2021 tax act, immediately abol honoring the life and memory of Russ Russell Carrick and other purposes.
