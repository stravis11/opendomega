Doer keepers, will you please close the doors?
Thank you, Chairman Warkhizer.
We'll up your pay for the day since you were keeper and representative.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by our Chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning is brought to us by the Dean of this House, the German from
the 154th House District, German Gerald Green, German Green.
Thank you, Miss Speaker, for this opportunity to introduce the pastor from Southwest Georgia.
And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your leadership in the school's safety initiative, fire students,
our schools and the state of Georgia.
My constituents appreciate that.
Colleagues, it is my pleasure to introduce Pastor Chris Gaffey.
He's not my every Sunday pastor, but he is praying for me and he is praying for you as we
do the business of the state and before I tell you about Chris I would like to
introduce his lovely wife Kelly if you'll stand a dear friend of mine Dr. Garrett
Bennett and his lovely wife Diana I'm covered in two ways today the pastor here
and Dr. Garrett and so if any of you are feeling sick, let us know.
This individual that is about to come and speak to you, I first learned about at a retired
teacher's meeting.
He was speaking before I was and he spoke and I thought that's the man I want the Georgia
General Assembly to hear. And so we find that he was gracious enough to say, yeah, I'll
come. And this individual has three children, Isaiah, Zaria, and appropriate enough Georgia.
He's well educated. He has had some masters of divinity from theological seminary. He
He works, he's worked in Missouri for 15 years as a pastor there, but now he is the senior
pastor at the First Baptist Church in Blakely, Georgia.
And I found that he is doing the Lord's work throughout not only our area, but throughout
the world.
I learned very quickly that he is a board member of other most international, which provides
K through 12 education for 1600 students for free in India.
He's really working to make sure that the Gospel is spread.
He is the author of winding road of problems and currently working on another book, The People of Paul.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my good friend, my new pastor, Chris Gaffey.
Chris Gaffey.
Well thank you Mr. Speaker, Representative Green, it is a privilege to address this honorable
body.
I was going to tell a joke, but I have learned, however, that since being invited on this privilege
that there are a lot of rules.
I was told that I had to be here on time, which I failed to dress properly, which I hope
I succeeded in, and that I was not allowed to make any comments about politics.
And no more was I allowed to make any jokes.
That was my brides' rules, and then came the speakers' rules.
The speakers office informed me that I had to keep my remarks to approximately five minutes
that asking a Baptist preacher to do that is about like asking Auburn football to beat
the mighty Georgia Bulldogs.
It is not going to happen anytime soon
and the best we can do is hope to run out the clock.
Right before I came up,
Representative Prince came up and told me
to ignore those rules and take as long as I wanted.
I knew there had to be one righteous politician in Georgia.
I'll do my best to abide by those rules however
And so let me get to the task at hand
into the 250 years of our nation's history.
There have been a number of similar moments.
Moments that were so important that they required
consequential leaders.
Leaders of unparalleled character, skill, and ability,
and as a nation, I think we would all agree
from every political strive that we have been blessed
over these many years.
The list of leaders is long, but perhaps the most
influential and important is a man whose birthday we celebrate this month, the very first president
of the United States, Mr. George Washington. He was born on February 22, 1732 in the colony
of Virginia, and so that means that this nation was always his home. At age 22, he literally
started a world war as he was the commander of the Virginia forces in the French and Indian
War. At the birth of the American Revolution in 1775, you know that he was tasked with
the responsibility of leading a Ragtag Army of Rebellion against the most powerful nation
in the world. Name Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, his task was impossible.
He had to take untrained, albeit passionate men into battle, without the proper ammunition,
supplies, or even the proper clothing. He marched them against the British Army, suffering
both victories and defeats, and when Troop Morale reached its lowest moments, he was
singularly responsible for doing whatever was necessary to maintain the fight.
When independence was finally won, he would be given an even greater challenge.
He was given the responsibility of bringing politicians together in harmony.
He was named the President of the Constitutional Convention, and when it was time for a new
nation to elect its first President, Washington was named the man for the job.
In retrospect, we can barely fathom how daunting a task it must have been for him.
He not only had to govern without much direction, but he was also setting precedent for our
future leaders and presidents about how this new nation would be governed and led.
In the history of Americans, he stands with great distinction.
He was a leader of men, he was the general of an army, he was the president of a new nation,
and he was the leader of a new and freer and more prosperous world.
And we imagine him, we think of a larger than life figure.
In fact, he was a man who was unafraid of anything, willing to take on any challenge,
a warrior, a hero.
In my life, he was the Chuck Norris of our politicians.
As much as we know about his service to this nation, we also know that he was a man of
great faith.
He was raised to Anglican.
Washington became something of a Christian wanderer in the years to come.
In his lifetime, he would join a host of churches and denominations, including the Presbyterians,
the Quakers, the Roman Catholic, the Congregationalists, even the Baptist for a season, and eventually
the Dutch reformed churches.
Somewhere along the way, in Mr. Washington's life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ penetrated
his heart.
I want you to listen briefly to a short prayer that he wrote at the end of his life.
He said, oh eternal and everlasting God, I presume to present myself this morning before
that divine majesty, besieging thee to accept of my humble and hearty thanks, that it
hath pleased thy great goodness to keep and preserve me the night past.
From all the dangers poor mortals are subject to, and has given me sweet and pleasant sleep,
whereby I find my body refreshed and comforted, for performing the duties of this day, in
which I would besiege thee to defend me from all the perils of body and soul.
This my faith and the sweet promises of the gospel, give me repentance from dead works, pardon
my wanderings, direct my thoughts unto thyself, the God of my salvation.
Teach me how to live in thy fear, to labor in thy service, and ever to run in the ways
of thy commandments, make me always watchful over my heart, that neither the tears of conscience
the loathing of holy duties, the love of sin, nor an unwillingness to depart this life,
They cast me into a spiritual slumber, but daily framed me more and more into the likeness
of thy son Jesus Christ, that living in thy fear and dying in thy favor, I may in the
appointed time attain the resurrection of the just unto eternal life.
And then he concluded, bless my family, my friends, and my kindred.
In that prayer, General Washington, we find not a warrior, not a general, and not a hero.
In that prayer, instead we find a simple and humble man who loved his God, sought God's
favor, and prayed for his nation, his family, and his friends.
In Micah 6 and verse 6, the prophet of old asked a question, he asked, what should I bring
before the Lord when I come to bow before God on high?
I think that is an important question.
It's a question that I believe all of mankind must answer in their life.
What is it that God requires of me?
does God want? Should I gain the great privilege of entering the presence of the
an Almighty God whose person, nature and majesty, shutter the very foundations of
the world itself? What would this divine demand of me? Luckily God answered
through the prophet. He writes in verse 8, mankind, he has told each of you what
is good and what it is that the Lord requires of you to act justly to love
faithfulness and to walk humbly with your God. What would God ask of this
deliberative body on February the 5th, 2025? He would ask of you what he
ask of all men and women that you love and seek faithfulness in Jesus Christ,
that you act justly and that you walk with humility before a holy God. That is my
prayer for you this morning. Would you stand and bow your heads and join me in
prayer. Good and sovereign God, maker of heaven and earth, father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
we come before you in this appointed hour to seek your help. By your grace, you have
sustained us through life and adversity, you have seen it appropriate to place us in these
hollowed halls and to legislate in this great state. Our decisions and our attitudes
affect our homes, our families, our friends, and many that we do not know.
Such a task is great and terrifying, and we are wholly unable to be faithful without
your good guidance.
And so therefore in this hour we come humbly before you and seek your good assistance.
We ask for your spirit to give us insight, your word to instruct our wisdom, and your
precepts to be our guiding star.
us into a better future, a greater faith, and a more glorious hope. Protect our nation,
our families, and our friends, these things we ask in the name of our Blessed Savior, Jesus
Christ, amen. Would you remain standing and join me in the pledge of allegiance?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it, brother.

This orchestra program gives these wonderful young musicians
a wonderful place to learn.

them a greater opportunity in life to be able to make it to where they want to get may
it be in the job world.

shown us, as a two-time, seven-a high school state champ, she never makes it to that state
championship if she had to compete against anyone other than someone born a female.
And we know that that's important because we want to give that opportunity to females

Thank you Madam Speaker, I'm honored today to give the black history moment and today's
Black History Moment was spotlight Charles W.
Chappelle, an architect, engineer, and a native of our great state.
Charles W. Chappelle was born in Inton in 1872
to African Methodist Episcopal Reverend George W.
Chappelle and Anna Johnson Chappelle.
He attended Knox Institute, a private elementary and secondary school
in Athens and Mars Brown College right here in Atlanta.
where he trained as an electrical engineer and architect.
In 1897, Chapelle moved to Pittsburgh
to work for US Steel as an electrician.
By 1910, he had moved to Brooklyn
and worked as an architect.
In January 1911, Chapelle was the only African-American
to participate in the first industrial aeroplane show
in New York.
The week-long event highlighted innovation in aeronautics
and full-size aircraft for an audience of more than 15,000 people.
Less than a decade after the Wright Brothers
had shown that powered, sustained, and controlled airplane
flight was possible, Shapel debuted
an aircraft of his very own design.
The plane which took Shapel a year to bill
was supposed to be able to travel long distances safely.
Shapel's aircraft was awarded for its design and capable
buildings and with the spade displayed at the United States aeronautical reserve, headquarters
in Manhattan. Following his success at the air show, Chappelle helped to establish the first
black-owned airplane company, serving as the company's vice president for a time. And
afterward in 1913, Chappelle set up the African-American Union Company, a profitable Ghana-based company
He's specializing in the global export of African resources such as Mahogany and Coco.
Chappelle headed the company until his closure in 1930 and he died in 1941.
This has been your Black History moment.

your annual checkups if you haven't gone in the last six to twelve months
please get that done check your blood pressure regularly regularly you can
go downstairs, your cholesterol, and one of the most recent studies have shown that not
just our cholesterol, but we need to be monitoring our LDL. That is one of the numbers that I know
in the last few years that the physicians have been looking at. There's some new medication
that can help manage that, but it is an indicator that you are a pre-exposed and potentially
cardiovascular disease that we haven't really looked at over the last few years. So thank you
