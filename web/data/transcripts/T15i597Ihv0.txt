TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you for joining us for this important press conference.
My name is Senator John Albers, I represent the 56th Senate District and serve as a Senate
Chairman of Public Safety.
We have all watched with great concern the tragedy that continues to unfold at the Fulton
County Jail.
The Georgia Senate is listening and taking a head-on approach to investigating and helping
to solve this crisis.
Our senators, including myself, have been directly contacted by many individuals, including
those who have lost loved ones in the jail.
I want to welcome and thank all the senators in attendance today, including our majority,
chairman, caucus chairman, senator Jason Anivatarte, our majority leader, Steve Gouche, senators
Dixon, Hodges, as well as Harbin.
We also have with us Senator Randy Robertson who I'll talk and introduce later.
And I'm proud at this time to introduce our Lieutenant Governor.
Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones has a very long history before joining as a member of the
Senate and then becoming our Lieutenant Governor, retacking some of our greatest issues here
in the state and supporting our criminal justice and law enforcement systems.
This time we welcome up our Lieutenant Governor.
All right.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Good morning.
Thank you, Senator Alvers.
I appreciate that introduction and thank you members
of the senate caucus for being here today
and thank you members of the press for being here.
I appreciate this opportunity and I appreciate the leadership
of our public safety chair, Alvers and Senator Randy Robertson,
who's a former retired law enforcement officer himself.
You know, for the past two years, we've watched here
in our capital city and our county of Fulton.
The crime has gone up, the backlog and the court system has increased and obviously our
jails are overcrowded right now and unfortunately we've had some unfortunate deaths, multiple
deaths in the last year that has brought a significant concern to what's going on within
the Fulton County system here.
And I'm proud to have Senator Albers and Senator Randy
Robertson taking a proactive approach to tackling this issue.
And we're not coming to this from an adversarial standpoint.
We're coming at it as a body that wants
to help have solutions to this issue and this problem that
is continually to grow right now.
And I'm proud that the Senate is leading the way on that issue
and that we're going to, but anytime you have a significant
issue going on, whether it's in your state or in counties
or at the federal level, you've got to get to the root
of the problem.
And that's what we've set up this subcommittee for is
to look at what's going on on the streets with law
enforcement activity and the backlog in the court
systems as well as overcrowding of the jail.
So I'm proud that our senators met with the local sheriff here
and took a tour of Fulton County jail yesterday
to hear him out and what's going on
and the issues that they're trying to address there.
So I want to thank these senators for being proactive.
We do want to be the safest place,
not just the best place to do business,
but we want to be the safest place to do business.
And in order to do that,
your capital city has got to be that.
And every person deserves due process
and not have the unfortunate situations
that we've had in the last year
with the untimely deaths of individuals
who were waiting to be arraigned in most cases.
So thank you, Senator Alvarez,
thank you, Senator Ren Roberson,
and leadership at the thing of the Senate committee
and I appreciate everyone being here
and being a tenant to this, so I'll sit, sit there.
Thank you Lieutenant Governor.
As a resident of Fulton County,
that I've had the honor to serve for almost 13 years,
I share the concerns of my fellow citizens,
elected leaders and key stakeholders.
First thing I want to mention today,
because some tend to confuse these as a jail,
is not a prison.
You go to jail once you've been arrested
and booked into the jail.
but that begins our process of being innocent
until proven guilty.
If someone is proven guilty,
then they can be sentenced to a full prison term
somewhere in the Georgia State System,
but it's important for us to note the distinction
between the two.
We can't stand idly by by people are dying
and justice is not being adjudicated in a timely manner.
Therefore, I've assigned a Public Safety Subcommittee
to do a deep dive investigation into these issues.
The root causes, and most importantly, the solutions.
I have the utmost confidence that this committee
of professionals will do what it needs to be done.
I want to thank Lieutenant Governor Jones
for appointing two ex officio members of this committee
to complete this very comprehensive task.
At this time, let me introduce the members
of the subcommittee.
There will be Senator Mike Dugan,
who chairs our veterans and Homeland Security Committee,
and also has a long career as United States Army officer.
Senator Chuck Payne chairs our Science and Technology Committee,
and also serve for over three decades
as a juvenile probation officer.
I will serve as a member of this committee.
Our two ex officio members will be Senator Sonja Halpern.
Senator Halpern is the chair of the Fulton County Delegation
in the Georgia State Senate.
Senator Brian Strickland is the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
And last but certainly not least
is our majority-whip Senator Randy Robertson.
He serves as the vice chairman
of the Public Safety Committee
and will be the chairman of this important subcommittee.
He is a retired major from the Muscogee County Sheriff's Office
who has very specific experience
both working in and leading a large jail.
He's a very talented and detailed individual
and nobody has more experience
and is more capable of handling this task
than Senator Robertson.
I'd like to invite him up for a few remarks.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I wanna start by thanking Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones
for his leadership not only on this issue,
but throughout my career in the Senate,
his leadership on all issues related
to criminal justice reform and public safety.
He has chosen to step out front and stand against the hot winds of politics and other things
when it comes to public safety and criminal justice and lead us to the battle.
And I thank him for that.
I want to thank Chairman John Albers for the confidence he has given in me and for the
opportunity he has given me to lead this subcommittee to look at the problems within the
Fulton County jail. As we understand it and understanding the environment inside of a big
jail a lot of times these problems are caused either by funding management or in the court
systems whether that's at the bench or in the DA's office and we'll be looking at all of these
things. We've already started over the past few weeks of gathering data and information related
to this issue and I feel very confident in the members of this committee that it will
be a very professional and detailed investigation into the operations and concerns surrounding
the Fulton County jail.
Our first meeting will be at 10 a.m. on November 4th, November 2nd.
I apologize in the Capitol and the agenda will be posted on the website once all the
witnesses have been confirmed and all of our meetings, of course, will be open to
anyone and everyone who wishes to attend. Again, I want to thank Chairman Albers
and Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones for this opportunity. Thank you. Thank you.
This time we're going to take a few questions before we conclude the press conference.
Yes, as mentioned, we will go through the areas that are causing the concerns today that
have led to, unfortunately, the deaths in the Fulton County jail, as well as the conditions
that people are surrounding right now to make sure we determine what the root cause is
and what the solutions will be in order to fix those problems.
At this time, based on the evidence that Senator Roberts and Gathers spoke committee chair,
We will determine from the information we get from both open records requests, as well
as direct requests from agencies.
We will determine who we will bring forward for that time.
I appreciate everyone's interest in going a little too political on this issue.
However, we're looking at the Fulton County jail and all the things that surround that.
So it would be very presumptive and getting far out of bounds of where we are right now
to be talking about an individual or any one group.
We're gonna do the right thing
and that's to conduct a thorough investigation
and go wherever the facts may lead us.
And we're gonna do one final question.
No?
No?
It's a lot of questions.
But with the recent death of the corrections officer
in state prison, will we get a business committee
going to look at that at all?
Or is there going to be any focus on state level
locations at prison?
Certainly.
We all mourn the loss of our corrections officer
down its mid-state prison.
Thank him for his service, and it was a very sad state
when we had a convicted criminal who was a prisoner there
who took his life.
We have a full investigation underway
from the Department of Corrections.
That investigation is shared with the entire public safety
committee.
We work with them on a daily basis, and as with anything,
whether that happens in any part of our government,
we continue to provide oversight and work together with them
to make sure that we're giving them the proper tools
and funding and everything is done above board.
Thank you all for coming today.
We appreciate your time and we look forward
to conducting this further analysis
and hope to see you on November 2nd
at 10 a.m. at the Capitol.
Thank you.
