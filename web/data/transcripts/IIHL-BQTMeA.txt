you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you means door keep us now. Will you please close the doors and keep them closed? We will begin our day as our custom with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. And we have a pitch hitter introducing the, as football season, I get it, it was, but we have a pitch here, that's baseball season. We have a pitch here to introduce in the chaplain of the day. Our, the lady from the 88, nor you from the 88, representative, Rhonda Taylor was supposed to, has invited our chaplain. I think Chairman Mitchell will probably allude to that. And she's having some, I thought she was some voice issues. So we're going to allow Chairman Billy Mitchell to introduce the chaplain of the day. Chairman Mitchell. First of all, please be seated, you honor me with this standing ovation. Our chaplain of the day is the presiding pre-late of the sixth Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which encompasses over 500 churches throughout the state of Georgia. Chances are that each and every single one of you have at least one AME church in or near your district. Before being appointed Bishop, he was the pastor of the St. Matthew AME church in Orange, New Jersey, where he grew the congregation from 75 members to more than 2800 members. Now I often feel you can really gain insight about someone's background by seeing what motivates them to transform from a mere consumer of issues in policy to an advocate for change. The former school board chair, County College Board of Trustees chair, board member of the largest health care system in New Jersey from the most influential list in New Jersey, now to the most influential list in Georgia, who has received five pens from four different governors, including our very own governor, Kemp, to sign legislation. The next Bishop has advocated for its passage after the choir sings the next voice you'll hear is that of Bishop Reginald Jackson. Speak of Burns and members of the House of Representatives, my delight in Georgia be with you today. I want you to know you are moving up on my prayer list because you all have to put up with Billy Mitchell. Happy to have all of the AMEs who are here today and thank you so much for coming. In Matthew's Gospel, the 6th chapter and the 10th verse, we call this section the Lord's Prayer and everybody knows the Lord's Prayer. The Lord's Prayer is one of those passages that we know by heart. But in that prayer, Jesus says some words which I think are extremely important. These are words which help govern, shape and define my ministry and it's my prayer and hope that it will help define and shape your service to the state of Georgia. Listen to what he says, your kingdom, Kemp, you will be done on earth as it is in heaven. These words are often overlooked and insignificant when we read or say the Lord's Prayer. We face a difficult and challenging time in our nation and in our state. Our people are polarized.

Our government is divided and we need to find one common thing which will bring our people together prayerfully, unite our government and help us to improve our state and our nation. And I believe that common theme is found in Jesus' words in the Lord's prayer. Your kingdom come, your will be done. Imagine how much more we can accomplish if all of us have our minds centered on trying to bring about God's kingdom on earth. And I am aware that there are those who say that is idealistic, that it cannot be done. But that does not excuse us from the responsibility from seeking to make it real. Our brothers and sisters, I hope that whatever legislation you propose, whatever legislation you vote on, they would have this one common theme is this God's will. God who is not a respected person, God who loves us all. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the one thing that could bring us together would seek for us to try to bring about God's kingdom on earth? And the Old Testament prophets described when men beat their swords in the ploughshares and study war no more. When we come and when we reason together, when we have a common goal of doing God's will on earth. And there is a school of theological thought which I believe is Aaron, an inappropriate and not biblically sound. But there are those who say that the scriptures don't speak the issues of government and justice. But that simply means you haven't read the scriptures well. Listen to what the word says in the Old Testament. He is showing you a man what is good and what does the Lord require of you except to do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with your God. For those of us who go to church or worship every Sunday and I know there's all of us. I had no doubt. I'm sure yesterday morning everybody was worshiping somewhere. But there's a passage in Amos which really I think calls us to task. Those of us who gather and go through worship. It's an indictment on our fear to worship but not serve. Listen to what it says. I hate. I despise your feast days. I have no regard for your solemn assemblies. They offer me grain offerings. I will not accept them. Take away from me the noise of your choirs and the melodies of your stringed instruments. I will not hear. But let justice run down like water and righteousness like a mighty string. We must not only praise God but we must also serve God. We in our own prayer time must seek God's will and God's direction. It is my prayer that all of us will have a desire for God's kingdom to come on earth as it is in heaven. I assure you if we don't get it right down here we won't have a chance to get it right up there. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. We stand and join with me in the pleasure of allegiance. Let us pray. I'm Father God we thank you for the blessing of this day. This is the day that you have made. Help us to rejoice and be glad in it. Remind us that with this day comes opportunity and responsibility. Help us to seize the opportunity which is before us to make this a better state, a better nation in which to live and remind us that we are responsible for the opportunity you have provided us to please you. Lord bless us individually. Then bless us collectively. Bless the speaker of this house as he provides leadership. Bless the lieutenant governor, the president of the Senate as he presides over that chamber. Bless our governor who carries the awesome responsibility for leadership of this state. Remind us that everything rises or falls on leadership. Now forgive us of our sins. Continue to shower us with your grace. I may your mercy continue to bless us daily. In your name we ask it all. Amen. Our pleasure, allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation, one God, indivisible with liberty and justice. Thank you, Bishop Jackson, for that message and thank you for many, many churches in our state. Amen. Churches are a powerful force. Thank you for your leadership there. Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors, but I'm going to ask members to stay seated in the chamber just for a moment as we tee up a video. Just yeah, I'm poor today, y'all. We're celebrating something today. There are a couple of you who are around and new General James over thought by his first name. James Al Williams, we know you were there. Excuse me, representative Williams and calling by his first name. It was a good man, is that what you said? So we all know that this great state was settled by General over the Orp in Savannah in 1733. So we're going to have a good nice video as we celebrate Georgia Day, so important day in our history. We will we have a quick video. Each year the Georgia Historical Society recognizes Georgia Day, the anniversary of the founding of the Georgia colony as part of the Georgia History Festival. The Georgia Historical Society is the statewide educational and research institution responsible for collecting, examining and teaching Georgia and American history. The Georgia History Festival is GHS's signature educational program featuring a variety of public programs exhibits in school events, teacher training and classroom resources that help bring history to life for students of all ages. Thank you members. The Georgia Historical Society does an outstanding job of chronologic and the catalog and the history of our state all over our state. So thank them for that video and hope we all enjoy this great Georgia Day. You may greet the pastor in the south any room. He's making his way out there so you can go out and greet the bishop. We appreciate him being here. So I don't know if I can... So our doctor of the day is brought to us by Representative Derek McCullum and it's of the 30th and the doctor of the day is Dr. Jody Mon Miller, Brazil. I probably didn't do very well with that name but we certainly appreciate the service of our doctor of the day so if you need the doctor of the day they're downstairs taking advantage of their services. Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information and Audits is recognized. Chairman Tarvan. Mr. Speaker your Committee on Information and Audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct and something to think about. Whatever the human mind can conceive and believe it can achieve. That's profound there, Mr. Chairman. I think we've seen that in the history of our country. We are a country that achieves much for great technological advances at Benefitisole.

Today, February is cancer prevention month, and today we have some visitors from Georgia Corps and the West, not just West Central. All of the regional coalitions, but I want to take a minute and I'm going to talk fast. Cancer continues to be the second leading cause of death in Georgia, and the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 60,000 Georgians will be diagnosed each year with cancer. If you have a family history of cancer or if you are over the age of 40, you need to have a conversation with your medical care provider about ways that you can be screened for breast, lung, colon, cervical, whatever kind of cancer, and make sure that you are taking care of early. Because many of the cancers, there's no prevention other than early detection. I want to give a shout out to a couple of people that are very meaningful in my life, and one is a doctor in Columbus who is unique.

So thank you all for being here. We appreciate you all. Okay, we're moving on to the rules calendar. We'll move on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to hb10331033. Hospital 1033 by Representative Levere to the 123rd and others to be entitled and act to amend chapter 5 and title 16. You just go to George Aniteta relating to crimes against the person. So, so to provide for protections for utility workers, this bill ember for the committee at Judiciary Non-Several Act Committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Levere is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House is about pleasure today to present to you House Bill 1033. This is the Utility Worker Protection Act. You may recall from last year, this act follows up a bill we passed last year to protect our state's critical infrastructure. That was hb227, which this body passed by an overwhelming margin. That bill protected the infrastructure, the machinery and equipment that is essential to providing the utility services that we all depend upon so much. This bill protects the men and women who maintain and keep up that infrastructure. And this is not just intended to to fight some possible future anticipated evil. This is something that's happening right now as we speak and has been happening. Acts of violence against utility workers are becoming more commonplace. We heard testimony in committee about a line worker who was dragged in his car for about 100 yards. We heard testimony from a railroad engineer who was shot at while he was in a moving train. This kind of thing has been happening and it's continuing to happen. And we need to protect these folks who are so vital to our enjoying these various utility services that we depend upon so much. So this bill seeks to combat this evil by increasing the potential penalty for certain crimes if they are committed against a utility worker who is in the in the course or scope of performing his duties at the time of the crime. It takes four selected crimes, simple assault, simple battery, aggravated assault and aggravated battery and increases the range, the potential range of penalties that the court can consider. So for example, we take simple assault and simple battery. Those are currently misdemeanors generally. If however the crime is committed against a utility worker while performing their duties, this bill would propose that those crimes become a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. So basically we're going from a potential penalty of up to a thousand dollars and up to a year in jail to up to a year in jail and up to five thousand dollars as a fine. With respect to aggravated assault and aggravated battery, those are felonies. The current penalty is from one to 20 years. Under this bill, if that crime is committed against a utility worker who is performing their duties at the time, then the potential penalty would be three to 20 years. We believe this addresses a very immediate and imminent need. We need to protect our state's utility workers. We made some changes in committee to try to expand the scope of the workers that it would protect and it is supported. I think you've got some letters on your desk today that are supported by quite a number of organizations including the Georgia Chamber and the Transmission Association and we would ask that you favorably consider and vote for this bill to protect our state's utility workers who are working so hard for us every day. Ms. Speaker, I'll yield for questions. There are no questions. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I ask your favorable consideration of House Bill 1033. The gentleman has yielded the well.

So it's required that the proceeds of local government regulatory fees be used to be paid for regulatory activities. This bill will refer to the committee. Ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes representative Thomas to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today I rise to present House Bill 461 LC number 500693S. This bill basically sets up so that regulatory fees are cut so we don't charge extra or try to generate revenue off of regulatory fees. It does so on lines 23 through 25 by saying regulatory fees shall be used to fund such regulatory activity and not general operations of local government. Additionally, it changes but modifies one of the six methods to calculate that by adding in lines 39 through 40 or for extensive renovation projects and defines an extensive renovation project to be valued at $75,000 or more. Additionally, because of this change, it allowed us to get rid of the sixth method. That's the bill and be happy to take questions. There are no questions. Thank you, Madam Speaker, with that I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to.

I have a bill that's a DOT Department bill. This bill raises the limits on quick response projects from 200,000 to 500,000 due to inflation over the past 10 years. Also it updates the P3 statute to adjust the timing of the public hearing to earlier in the process and the G DOT board final approval. Lastly, it increases the marks or homes from 80 to 84 feet so they can be transported. But it does not increase the weight. That's my bill. I'll stand for questions, Madam Speaker. Gentlemen, you'll take questions. A few, Mr. Speaker. I know this is your new at this game being in the well, but you know you could have yielded the well, but since you didn't. Gentlemen, from the sixth to your right, representative Ridley, Jason Ridley has a question. He's recognized for a question. My friend Yilder will for a question. Yes, for you. You said that you're increasing the length from 80 foot to 84 foot on mobile or modular homes. Either one, mobile or a Mazur home, whichever terminology you'd like to use. Could you explain the difference? Well, I think a mobile home and Mazur home just constructed differently with two by fours and things like that. But to be honest, no, I can't. Okay, father up, father up question there. You don't have to yield. I'll yield. So is an 80 foot, what regular person buys an 84 foot to what you buy if you win a lottery? Is that the difference? That sounds correct. Okay, thank you. Is that the way it is in your district? We prefer single wads. Too sweet. I think he'll, I don't think he has any more questions. But let's see, I know there's a gentleman here that knows a lot about this subject matter. And he's right in front of you. We're shit. Do you have a question? Does gentleman you? From our way up, I do. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the bill. So it way crosses having multiple module home manufacturers. This is very significant bill to us. Don't one question. What is the effective date on this bill? Well, it'll take effect on July 1st unless the governor does a bill sign and personally for me. He's just going to do a bill sign for you? Well, I don't know. I'm just saying if he doesn't, it'll take effect on July 1st. Oh, okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Wim, that's assuming that pass is here first, I guess. That's right. Just checking. Now, I know this gentleman also understands a lot about length because he's not real tall, but he knows about length. Let's see. Chairman Corbin has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do, Mr. Chairman. On line 103, it says all laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act is repealed. Can you tell me what we are repealing? What we're repealing? Yes. Well, in committee, we went over this, so I'm hoping we already know what it's repealing. Do you mean we all have to look at the tape of committee to figure out what we're repealing? Is that what you're saying, sir? Well, Mr. Speaker, if you say so. I'm just trying to understand the bill is what I'm trying to do. Will you accept yield for another question? I'll yield for one more, Mr. Speaker. This will come from the... Maybe this gentleman can help you on what was said in committee. Chairman Jasper's recognized full question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? I do, you've... Do you, Mr. Chairman? You say that with reservation. I should've listed the speaker and yielded, but... Well, I just had a question on your comments. You made about the bill that we worked so hard on in committee that we talked about the length of modular homes being increased four feet. Is that true? From 80 to 84, yes. Yes, that's true. And you also said it did not increase the weight of a modular home. Do you have some new law of physics that we're not aware of? Well, the only thing I can think of, maybe they're transferring without appliances. Oh. That's the only thing I can think of. Well, I do believe, I think, in committee to clarify, it would increase the weight, but it stayed way below the weight increase that didn't... We all worked on last year. Thank you for doing the work on the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For that, I hear the way I appreciate your consideration of the past new past. Well, you did have a serious question, but you viewed it well. Good decision. Not that all those were not serious. So am I to understand this is the first time you've been to the well and presented the bill? Outstanding. You're not welcome back. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here is none of the previous question. Is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here is none of the committee's substitute is adopted.

And the decision will need to be made by 11 a.m. on the Thursday following the election. And additionally, on line 66, the bill says that nothing in this code section shall prevent an additional election from being audited if the election is superintendent deems that to be necessary. Mr. Speaker, that is a summary of the bill and I'll be glad to take questions if there are any. And I have no questions. All right. Thank you and I appreciate your favorable consideration.

This bill seeks to expand upon the spirit of Gracie's Law by ensuring that COVID vaccination status is not a sole barrier to an organ transplant. Decisions, especially in matters as critical as organ transplant, should be based on comprehensive assessments of an individual's risk and not solely focused on vaccination status. And that's exactly what this bill addresses. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. Do you have some questions? Representative Gamble right out in front of you has a question. Gentlemen's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Thank you. Is it not true that in part of this legislation constituent of mine who is 74 years old and was on a kidney transplant list was taken off of that list purely because he had not had the COVID vaccine. And that's why he hadn't done it. And if this legislation passes, it will prevent that situation from happening and others as well. Yes, that's right. And I really appreciate you telling us that story and telling me that story. That's really the nexus for this bill as we have found out. So the American Journal of Transportation, transplantation did a survey in 2022 of 141 unique transplant centers. I mean, it showed about 36% of the centers reported implementing a vaccine mandate. And most often they've cited administrative and legal considerations for the decision, not so much the well-being of the patient. So thank you for that question. Jeremy Yeal for further question. I do. Representative Lisa Campbell, excuse me, is recognized for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I'm curious to know in the current law, the broader context for organ transplant. Are there other diseases that are considered when prioritization on organ transplant lists are compiled? Or is, and so would this carve out be exclusive for COVID only? It's for the COVID only the COVID vaccination. But there are other diseases that are currently allowed in consideration for prioritization of organ transplants. Is that correct? This bill only addresses the COVID vaccination. If the gentleman will allow, I think I'm understanding that part, but I'm not clear on, is are there other diseases that are currently included in the consideration for priority of organ transplants? I'm sure that there are. However, my bill addresses only the COVID vaccination status. Okay. And as a sole basis for the decision, not additional basis for the decision. Thank you for the clarification. I'll answer one more, Mr. Speaker. Okay. Rep. to your right. Representative Chairman Martin has a question. Representative Martin. Gentlemen, yield for a question. I do, my friend. Isn't it true that I believe you got to my question with your last statement, but I think it's important that the body understand you and I have had this discussion. Your bill deals strictly with someone being disqualified because of their vaccination status. Right. Soly on the basis of that is what your bill prevents. That's great. Doesn't have anything to do with whether you have an active case of a disease. Any of those just specifically, they can't use the fact that you did or you did not take the COVID vaccine to eliminate you solely based on that from a transplant. That's 100% right. That's all the bill does. That's not true. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Mr. Whip, I know you had a question. There are a couple of speakers opposed. So you may communicate that question to those speakers. We recognize Representative Al for a time to speak to her opposition to the bill. Representative, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before I start my written remarks, I want everyone to take out their driver's license and check at the bottom. In the middle, it should indicate if you are an organ donor or not. If you are not, I encourage you to have that conversation with your family and consider changing that status. So I rise today to speak against HP 576, which is the latest in a long string of bills aimed at achieving these two wrong-minded goals. Number one, bills like the Seek to legislate the practice of medicine without regard for best medical practices. Number two, bills like the Seek to undermine confidence and trust in the COVID-19 vaccines and in doing so, we can our confidence and trust in all vaccines. Let's start with the basics. So nationally, more than 100,000 people are currently waiting for life-saving organ transplants. That's why I had you check your driver's license. The number of people requiring organ transplants far outstrips the supply of available organ donors. This means that in allocating this incredibly scarce and vital resource, transplants teams seek to ensure that recipients present with first the most urgent need, second the closest possible match, and third with the best prospects for long-term survival. Every organ that's transplanted into one patient is an organ that cannot be transplanted into another equally sick or needy patient. Every day, 17 people in this country die waiting for an organ transplant. For these reasons of resource scarcity and optimization of outcomes, these are some of the conditions that may preclude patients from receiving an organ transplant. These include multi-system organ failure, persistent infection, current or recent cancer diagnosis, and serious cardiac disease among some others. There are also, as we note, vaccine recommendations, recommendations, not preclusions, but recommendations prior to solid organ transplant for a simple reason. Prevention against infection in organ transplant recipients is crucial because post transplant patients are immunocompromised. Further, vaccination after transplant may not be as effective again because of the suppression of the immune system that is necessary for receiving the organ transplant. Up on the board here, you don't have to read it, but, or you can, I can send it to you. This is a 20-23 article from the journal Vaccines. Yes, there is a journal called Vaccines because doctors are fun. This reviews the research and gives recommendations. Again, these are recommendations, not preclusions, on recommended vaccines prior to certain organ transplants. COVID vaccination is recommended at least two weeks prior to lung, heart, kidney and liver transplants for the simple reason that patients with lung, heart, kidney and liver transplants are at higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID infection. And when a patient dies, the organ dies too. Perhaps along with the scores of other patients who could have received that organ, but we're not lucky enough. Is it possible that a non-COVID-vaccinated patient might present a need of an organ transplant? Absolutely. Might it be that they choose to not get vaccinated, even in light of the fact that clinical recommendations show that they should? Certainly, and that's their right. That's what patient autonomy is. That should transplant teams be precluded from taking that choice into account with many other factors, not as an absolute. I think that's a fallacy that we're entertaining with this bill here. Never just an absolute, but as a relative contraindication for organ transplantation. Let me just ask this in a slightly different way. Should a transplant team be forced to ignore that a patient with alcoholic liver failure refuses to stop drinking prior to receiving the rare commodity of a liver transplant? You're making this decision. Should a transplant team not take into account that a long transplant patient refuses to quit smoking? Should a patient who continues to have used IV drugs be considered as good a prospect for long-term survival after a heart transplant as a patient who abstains? We love to talk about personal responsibility in this building. With some exceptions, some legislated by this very body, patients have the autonomy to decide what happens to their own bodies. But we cannot ignore medical best practices in service of these choices. And we cannot legislate away medical professional's ability to practice according to these standards of care. So just...

move on to the second broader harms of this bill, which I believe some of our colleagues are also going to cover. Real talk now, just among friends. We're all friends here. I recognize that bills like this may ultimately be a messaging piece in an election season. This is real talk. But remember that the messaging itself has the potential to inflict real harm. Because we've seen over the past four years, especially, the corrosive messaging around public health and vaccines can do a tremendous amount of harm. And we've seen the way that doubt and cynicism and misinformation and undermining the confidence of public health institutions has caused cracks in the foundational elements keeping our society safe and indeed free. We have a responsibility in this body. What we say here matters. How we vote here matters. What we legitimize on our discourse, what issues we focus on in this chamber, what we write into law, matters. Because for good or for bad, mostly for good sometimes for bad, people are listening to what we say. This bill undermines public trust in the COVID vaccine full stop. Whether explicitly or not, it gives oxygen to the idea that people should be skeptical of the demonstrated safety and efficacy of a vital health tool that here in the state of Georgia is still vastly underutilized. And especially the season when we've seen so many of our members out sick with a variety of infectious diseases, a bill seeking to undermine the uptake of a proven and effective vaccines not just wrong-headed, but dare I say insensitive. This body needs to stop legislating the practice of medicine. And now while I know I don't have to, I do feel it's my responsibility to take some questions. Are there any questions? The lady has a question. Representing buttoner to your left has a question. Representing buttoner's recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? Absolutely, for my friend. This is just for my information, I guess, that if someone were to be considered for a liver transplant, aren't they usually checked and strongly encouraged that they've had hepatitis vaccines? Absolutely. They're actually, if you want the full article, there is a full list of the recommended vaccines for each type of organ transplant. And certainly all the standard set of early childhood vaccines are usually on that list. And they usually recommend that you finish your vaccination schedule at least two weeks before the transplant, because the body might not respond as well to the vaccine afterwards. Does the lady further yield? Yes. Is it not true that probably one of the most rare organs that are transplanted and that we have the fewest of our lungs and lung tissue? That is absolutely true. For us, a couple of reasons. One is that when a patient arrests or coats, lungs are often the most delicate in terms of the resuscitation attempts. So often, even in patients who do sign up to be organ transplants, when we go in and take a look at those lungs prior to what we call an organ harvest, the lungs are damaged in the course of that resuscitation. So lungs are indeed one of the most scarce resources when it comes to organ transplants. And lungs are also, as we know, the organ that is targeted by the COVID virus. Thank you. I guess I'm thinking that the way I read this bill is that this would be kind of like a definite, there's no flexibility for doctors to say, well, maybe they could have it or maybe not. It's like it's not going to be required at all. Is that the way I read it? That is correct. There are several absolute contraindications to receiving an organ transplant for one, if it's the wrong blood type. That's a no-go, right? But a lot of other considerations, including age, certain types of vaccine status, are relative contraindications. So in weighing, let's say, a panel of 30 patients who could all receive this organ, we look at that full panel and see who is optimized to have the best possible result. And it's a hard choice, right? Because it is a very scarce resources and a lot of patients do die on that waiting list. Thank you very much. Lady Yill, for another question. Absolutely. Representative Maynard to your right. Representative Maynard's recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Absolutely. Thank you for presenting. My question to you is multi-fold. There are parents that homeschool their children. There are parents that, for religious reasons, do not vaccinate their children, not just COVID, but many other things. So there are people that don't do vaccinations. Even myself, I got the COVID vaccine the first time and the second time. But when it said do it a third time, I made a personal decision that's a little bit too much vaccine in my body and in my children's body. My question is, since people have religious reasons why they don't vaccinate or just preferences, what do you say to that? Representative Maynard, I think you bring up a great point about patient autonomy. And what you're saying actually illustrates the very phenomenon of patient autonomy is that patients can decide what they want to do with their own bodies. And certainly the choice to not vaccinate your children or yourselves is a choice that you can make, right? So I fully respect the types of religious preclusions or just personal options that people exercise when making these decisions. However, what we're talking about is prioritizing the medical criteria used to make this allocation of a very scarce resource, given that many people do need this resource. So what I guess I'm saying is that you can choose to not vaccinate yourself or your children or you can choose to continue smoking or you can continue drinking. But that does not preclude the medical team from making that choice and that triage and assessment of who is the best recipient from an outcome standpoint for that very rare organ commodity. And do you further yield just one more question? Yes, I do. And so for a child whose family chose not to vaccinate and they are in dire need of a transplant and the doctor has deemed them to be healthy and able to receive the transplant. What do you say to that? And that's my last question. Again, I note that these recommendations and I put that up there just to show it is a recommendation not an absolute preclusion, that if that child is the best person to receive that organ transplant, that there is no other patient who would do as well, who maybe is as acutely ill, who is the right haplotype match for that organ that that child may well receive that organ. But it certainly should not be a factor that is taken out of the medical consideration for allocating a patient with the best outcomes possible. Let a yield for another question. Yes. Chair Minutin, do your right has a question? Well, the general lady yield. I do. I think if you're interested in this, I know you mentioned patient autonomy, which is of course a core principle of all health care in form consent. Isn't it true that there's nothing in this bill that would preclude a patient who needs an organ transplant from having an in-depth discussion with their own physician or team of physicians, who maybe looked at their previous COVID infection and the fact that they have antibodies, but maybe didn't have a vaccination to make that decision. And this would just allow that patient and equal treatment as if somebody who had never had COVID, they got the vaccine. This would just allow them both to be treated equally without discrimination against one because they had natural immunity instead of a vaccine immunity. Isn't that true? I think the good doctor brings up a good point is that there are many factors that we take into consideration when evaluating the appropriateness of a patient getting an organ transplant. And I would argue that the criteria you bring up are actually being used right now. We always do in form consent for patients. We will tell them what the recommendations are to optimize a patient to receive an organ transplant. I don't think what you describe is actually tremendously different from our approach right now. What this bill, the narrative that this bill frames is that there is an absolute contraindication for some patients to receive an organ transplant without the COVID vaccine. Don't believe that is the case, right? So part of it is that this bill is presenting a scenario that does not exist. It is creating a problem that does not exist in real life. I believe actually in the health committee in which this bill was presented, a representative from Emory, which was cited as sort of the nightest for this bill being drafted. Denyped this actually is a criteria, at least that Emory, for a conclusion for organ transplant. But it does create a narrative in which COVID vaccine is presented as an absolute contraindication, which it is not. And undermines trust in the COVID vaccine as you would have heard in the other people coming to testify in favor of the bill. And I think you were in that committee also. Any other questions? Yes, ma'am. You do have several other questions. Let's see the couple that have been here for a while. The gentleman from the 17th, Mr. Demonto-Han is recognized in the back to your right. Gentlemen's recognized. Like Mr. Speaker, there's the ladies' yield. I do. Isn't it true that on February 1st of 2024, the CDC put out a new article called the Early Estimates of the Monovalment COVID-19 vaccine, showing that the vaccine was only 49% effective? As soon as the gentleman has the article pulled up in front of him, I do not. Isn't it further true? If the generality yields. Yeah, I do. That it typically takes over a decade for new vaccines to be generated and put out into public use. Isn't that true? What I will say about the development of the COVID vaccine is that while it may seem that it was developed very quickly and certainly many, many people were working on developing that vaccine prior to its release, the technology behind it and in developing that form of the mRNA vaccine, which is new and sound scary to some people, had actually been in the works for several decades prior to that vaccine being developed. And it just happened that at that time, that form of technology was ready to be rolled out for the COVID vaccine. So I disagree with the premise of your question. But typically new. Is that a question? Yes, it is. Does General ID further yield? Well, isn't it further true that given it short time frame? And it's less effective than is effective status as a vaccine that we shouldn't be removing people from the ability to get a transplant based on such low efficacy numbers. I don't know that I totally understand the question, but I will say that I have had a lot of patients come up to me with similar questions regarding the speed of the vaccine development and its efficacy and so forth. What we have to understand, first of all, is that if we are using the prior precedent to other vaccine development, we have to remember that first of all, that mRNA vaccine development to place over several decades and that the COVID pandemic was an unprecedented event. So we had unusually so many, many different companies working together to solve this one problem. So that explains some of the speed that has incited some distrust and concern among some patients. With respect to the efficacy of the vaccine, I think it has been demonstrated to be efficacious and it is one in a long string of layered strategies that we use in public health to minimize and mitigate the effect of COVID infections in our community. Thank you for your questions. Lady has numerous other questions and we have two other speakers. Do you have other speakers also? So maybe I'll take one more and then yield to my colleagues. Sounds like a good plan. Representative Angela Moore is recognized for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the general lady you. I do. In, is it not true that in talking about this particular bill that we're not talking about diseases but more viruses, which is what the vaccination would entail. Viruses not diseases. Even though kidney diseases are disease, but we're talking about the vaccines, is that true? Yes, many of the vaccines that are on this recommendation list protect against viral infections, including the measles, lumps, rebella, many other types of viruses. Thank you. And I will yield the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, good discussion. Lady has yielded the well. Repres, representative Nullowitz has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise before you today to share my concerns with HP 576. When I learned about this legislation, I went back and I watched the committee meeting where the bill was heard. It was not a very long meeting. It's about the right length, kind of meeting you watch when you're folding laundry, because I know I'm not the only person here who folds my hand. I'm not the only person here who folds my hand. I'm not the only person here who folds my hand. I'm not the only person here who folds my hand. I'm not the only person here who folds laundry while they catch up on committee meetings. I agree that preventing discrimination with regards to organ transplants is a valid policy concern. What concerns me about this bill, though, is that during the hearing, it was clear that this legislation is a solution in search of a problem. This was clarified during the hearing that no patient in Georgia has been denied a transplant on the basis of their COVID vaccination status. The hearing made it clear that this bill is little more than a vehicle for false and dangerous narratives that further perpetuate vaccine hesitancy. And vaccine hesitancy is something that should deeply concern us all. In Georgia, the data is clear that our vaccination rates are declining. This is the case in Cobb County where I live. We just heard this at an delegation meeting on Friday. This is the case in most counties in Georgia. What's even more frightening is that in Georgia, we have had occurrences of diseases, of lethal diseases, that are completely preventable with vaccines, preventable diseases, like measles. There were two new cases in Georgia that we know of last month, preventable diseases like pertussis, whipping cough. There were eight cases in Georgia last month. And let me be clear, these aren't harmless childhood illnesses. Thinking that these are harmless childhood illnesses is an illusion that is afforded to us by the fact that we have these life-saving, miraculous vaccines. These are lethal diseases that kill babies. These are lethal diseases pertussis will literally take your babies breath away. These are lethal diseases like measles that will cause a pregnant woman to miscarry. We're seeing this increasingly often. It's not limited to vaccines. A lawmaker will hear a concern. Maybe a constituent will call them. Maybe they'll see it on social media. Again, they're not limited to vaccines. Not limited to public health. They'll hear a concern that's based on a rumor. Somebody might have heard it from someone they trust. Maybe it's rooted in someone's political agenda. And instead of responding with facts, with the reality of the situation, instead we take it upon ourselves to present legislation to address the fear. In this case, it's the premise that people are worried that the COVID vaccines might be harmful. They're not. That the vaccines might be, and this came up in the hearing. The vaccines might be, quote, experimental. They're not. This is well established. And the concern that someone in Georgia was denied a life-saving transplant based solely on their COVID vaccine status. This did not happen. If we have a preschool child, and they come to us, and they share their fear, their certainty, that there is a monster under their bed. Maybe someone who they trust and respect told them there was a monster under their bed. Maybe it was their big sister. Maybe it was the middle schooler who lives next door. They're like, yeah, there's totally a monster under your bed. Do we respond to that child's concern by telling that sweet child, gosh, you might be on to something. Maybe there is something sinister to that shadow you saw when you lifted up that dust ruffle. Maybe we need to pass a lot to make sure that monster doesn't gobble you up in the night. I guess as a parent, if you don't ever value sleeping another uninterrupted night, that could be your approach. But I would guess that most of us would instead take the approach of shining light on the situation. We would call those dust bunnies out for what they are. We need to do better. All of us need to do better. We are obligated to help Georgia face fear, whether those fears, whatever those fears might be, with facts. We shine the light on the dust bunnies. We show people they're not a monster trying to gobble them up. It's just some lint. Unfortunately, my concern is that HP 576 only serves to validate flawed beliefs and perpetuate mistrust in vaccines. And the reality is that the lethal perils that result from a continued decline in vaccinated Georgians from this vaccine hesitancy. Unlike that monster under your kids bed, it's terrifyingly real. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representative Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise in opposition to House Bill 576. Because there's a dangerous bill that have an effect of wasting a very scarce yet lifesaving resource in exchange for politics. Now, I actually believe there are people here who read this bill and truly believe that this bill addresses medical discrimination. And I can understand that as there are actual and definite examples of medical discrimination in our society. And those should be addressed. But the guidelines that dictate who is eligible for an organ transplant are actually based on the fact that we do not have an unlimited stock pile of organs waiting for a body to be transplanted into. That's not how organ transplantation works. Instead, there are over 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant. Over 100,000 people who are sitting on a list and they're hoping to get that phone call that they found a match and that they can come in and get their organ. And while they are waiting, 17 people per day, 17 people per day will die waiting on that list. So when we give an organ to someone, we want to make sure that it goes to someone who will take all the necessary precautions to live a healthy life. And we want the best outcomes for that organ because once we give it to them, we can't give it to someone else. If they pass away, if they get a preventable disease, we cannot now take that same organ and give it to someone else who's on the waiting list. That organ dies with them. Also, as many of you know, I teach anatomy and physiology so I can't turn down an opportunity to educate in moments like these. Because there's an actual reason why we require people to be up to date on certain vaccines in order to be eligible to receive a transplant. So let me give you a real quick crash course in immunology. So everyone knows, if you look at your fingers, everyone knows that fingerprints are unique to us. That's why we use it oftentimes to identify us. But did you know that inside of your body, we also have an internal fingerprint. Our organs have certain markers on them that make them our organs. And so we have this so that our immune system, which is responsible for finding against things that should not be in our body, doesn't attack our own body. This immune system also attacks things like bacteria and viruses that get into our body when they shouldn't be there. So these vaccines actually help our immune system by giving the immune system the information that it needs to fight against these germs so that they can't destroy our bodies. This is the reason why people don't die or become severely or permanently ill from certain preventable diseases. So our immune system is really good at attacking things that don't belong. And it also notices when an organ comes from another source, and it actually believes that that organ does not belong. So because it notices that the fingerprint on that transplanted organ doesn't match the fingerprint on all the rest of the organs in your body, the immune system will try to attack it. This is referred to as organ rejection. So to prevent organ rejection, transplant patients must take something called immunosuppressants. So basically we have to dampen their immune system so the immune system doesn't attack the very thing that we transplanted into our body to save our life. These immunosuppressants are stopping us from attacking that transplant, but at the same time it now makes it harder for us to fight off the infections that most people can walk around and never even know they came in contact with. So the best way to be able to fight these germs is to be up to date on all vaccines before you get the organ transplant. This increases your likelihood of living a nice, healthy life with that organ that has given you a second lease on life. So this guideline for requiring certain vaccines prior to organ transplantation is not mean spirited at all. This guideline is to make sure that the gift of a transplant is a gift that many, which is a gift that many will never unfortunately get an opportunity to receive and many will unfortunately die waiting for this gift. We want to make sure that this gift will be used for as long as it could as it could based on the factors that we can control. Listen, the COVID-19 vaccine is not the monster under the bed that it is being made out to be. And I have to bring this up because it came up in committee. The COVID-19 pandemic did happen. It was not a figment of our imagination and many of us lost loved ones or community members due to this deadly virus. And that should not be ignored. So I cannot go on without at least saying that the pandemic happened. It was real. Vaccines in general are not the boogie men that they are being made out to be by some that have nefarious intentions. Vaccines like and alongside organ transplant save lives. And with that Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Leader, if stration is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. This issue as can sometimes happen here at the Capitol is being described here at submit is something very different than what the bill is about. So if you review the legislation and you hear from the member who asked a question earlier who described a constituent, a Georgian who was seeking a kidney transplant and was not able for consideration because or would not be able to be considered to be considered to receive it because of the vaccine status. And why did that Georgian not have the vaccine? It's because of pre existing conditions was determined with that Georgians doctor that that would not be best for that patient. So just think about that. Think about you being in need of an organ transplant and with your discussions with your doctor. It's not best for you to get the vaccine. But then you are prevented from being considered for a transplant on that basis. And this bill is not about the issue that that's being argued here in this well. The bill is about should that patient be solely prevented from getting the transplant solely thrown off the list based upon vaccine status for this vaccine. And you see existing law existing law is you cannot be you cannot be prevented from getting an organ transplant solely based upon disability as defined by the Americans with disability act. That's existing law already. The question about is this patient best suited and organs are so precious and we have to existing law says you cannot discriminate against disability. And what we're saying here is you cannot discriminate solely based upon vaccination status. So if there are other conditions other things going on pre existing conditions, things that need to be taken into consideration by doctors, those can still be considered. The only basis to deny someone a life saving organ is vaccine status. We're saying as a matter of public policy, that's unacceptable because we're aware of Georgians like the one that representative described who had no choice. And we cannot get the vaccine described earlier about the narrative. Let's talk about the narrative. This is not furthering a narrative from this well is not addressing patient access, which is what we're talking about in this bill. This is about patient access and making sure that Georgians are able to get the health care that they need. It's not about other issues and it's not to be blown, not submit beyond the language that's in this legislation. Look at this bill Georgians who are in difficult positions about needing organ transplant should not be discriminated against based upon vaccine status. And that being the sole consideration is going to prevent our constituents from getting the health care that we need. The bill is simple as that and not urge your favorable consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to yield for a question. You have a couple of questions. So let's have one from your counterpart. Representative James Beverly, I'd recognize for a question, Mr. Leader. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Leader of the U. Yes, sir. Several questions. How many conditions exist that would prevent someone from receiving an organ transplant? How many different ways in which a doctor says, hey, you can't get this transplant? There are many considerations that are given as to up the fitness for a patient to receive an organ transplant. I think that wide consideration is appropriate. It should not be, you should not be limited from receiving an organ solely based upon one condition, which is exactly what this bill seeks to prevent. Thank you. Gentlemen, you yield as well. Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to. Are you familiar with HIPAA and what the compliance for HIPAA means? Could you explain to everyone else what HIPAA means? So that we're on the same page and we're seeing from the same sheet of music before I ask my subsequent question. Sure. So it's difficult for me to anticipate maybe what specific aspect you're asking about, but my basic knowledge of HIPAA is its privacy with respect to medical records and that's federal law. Thank you. So what I would say, what I would suggest to the general assembly and my question to you would be this, are we absolutely sure based on the gentleman's testimony that the sole reason why this person was not given an organ was because of this, because if we're going to comply with HIPAA, that person does not have to disclose what exactly could have happened which prevented them from receiving an organ. Could that not be the case? So first of all, answer in two parts. First of all, I don't know the specifics of how information is received, but it would be my expectation with medical history and information that physicians need to make their determinations. They're not prevented from receiving information necessary for privacy issues, but I will say that I think the specific issue that was raised presents a very important consideration for us to take here. That if there are a variety of conditions being considered, which I heard the member in the well previously speak to, and the importance of making these determinations, one sole single factor should not be used as the basis to, as a matter of policy, refuse that patient's access to life-saving organs. Thank you, Mr. Leader. And the last thing is just as a follow-up to what you just said. The reminder to stand is based on our learned scholars and the folk who are in the well, is that there's a litany of things that have to happen for someone who's precluded from getting an organ. That litany of things would not explain to us, and we don't know quite frankly if that was explained to the patient who actually was denied. What we can only assume is that that person was denied for one sole reason, but the scholars who stood in that well said that's not how it works. So we have a solution looking for a problem, which may or may not have exist because we would never know what happens based on HIPAA. So to the leader, I would just respond that in the rules committee, where this bill was presented by the sponsor, it was my understanding that this is an issue currently, that there is a current policy, at least by one of the providers in this area, that if there is a, if a patient is unable to provide proof of vaccination, that that patient would then be prevented from being considered for an organ transplant on that sole basis. So this is an existing problem, and this bill will fix it. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, you for another question? Yes, sir. I'll take one more. Okay. Well, you and your seatmate could have figured this out, but I'll recognize with Berchett for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman, you? Yes, sir. Is it true that a person can be unvaccinated and donate organs? Yes, sir. That's, that's my understanding. I'm, I'm not an expert on the process, but, but a lack of vaccination record does not prevent a donors organs from being received and utilized. So, so you can give your organs away, but you can be an unvaccinated, but you cannot receive organs if you need them based on your vaccination status currently in the state law. That's, that is my understanding. Right. And, and I would, I would just go back to this issue is really about access for those who need life-saving organs. Should they be prevented from getting what they need solely based upon vaccination status? Which may not have even been a choice to them as we heard from the, from the member earlier. Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge the members favorable consideration and I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, that completes the discussion. I have a robust discussion. Thank you members on both sides of the issue for your questions and your input on this very important subject. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose is representative Gullet rise? Probably between inquiry. Is it true that I currently have a COVID vaccination? I'm sure it is if gentlemen so speaks. Further Parliamentary inquiry? State your inquiry. Isn't also true when you not only do we state that the American Journal of Transplantation says that 36% require a vaccination before transplant. If you just Google it and look at news articles, CNN, not my favorite news source, has an article that says more organ transplant centers require patients to get COVID-19 vaccine or get bumped down the wait list. Isn't that true? I'm sure it sounds like the gentleman's convinced that it's true for what purpose is whip part rise. Parliamentary inquiry? State inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that the politicization of healthcare like this bill is why Georgia is last in healthcare in this state, in this country? I'm sure the gentleman understands his facts. I don't need to do that. Do just that. What purpose is representative Lisa Campbell rise? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Parliamentary inquiry? State inquiry. Is it not true that which is different than what a previous representatives have shared that on lines 89 and lines 90 of this bill? This bill does delete a qualified recipient from the language of consideration for organ transplants, making line earlier 61 invalid. And so that in fact this does become an exclusive part of that review and consideration process. I'm sure the lady is a diligent reader of legislation and she knows of what she speaks. For what purpose does representative more rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. State inquiry. Isn't it true that the majority of people of color are already on a list that is not priority here in the state of Georgia for transplantation? I'm sure the lady believes what she speaks takes. Is there further inquiry here? Yes, thank you. Isn't it also true that my son has had a transplant, kidney transplant that was rejected here in the state of Georgia? I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. I'm going to take one more. Parliamentary inquiry. We've certainly have a lot of facts out here for us to sit on. What purpose is chairman Corbett rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's not true without the passage of this bill. If my granddaughter who did not take the vaccine, she was five years old at the time, needed a transplant. I could, they could possibly deny her of that transplant if I wanted to give her a kidney. Is that not true? I'm sure the gentleman has read this bill thoroughly and believes what he speaks. All members voted. Have all members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, House Bill 576, the yeas are 98, the nays are 71, the bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Thank you members for your participation. We're going to recess for lunch, but a couple of announcements that will impact our afternoon need to be made.
