So say of the Lord, that's what Psalms 30.5 tells us. While we know that is true, it can be tough to realize as we come together to share our collective grief today. Today we mourn the untimely passing of one of our own, a member of our house family, representative, Tish, Nagis. I want to thank Governor Kim, the Governor Jones and our friends in the Senate for the sympathy in this hour of loss, the loss in this house. As speaker, I want to extend our prayers to her husband and children and all those that have been blessed enough to have known her. To celebrate her life and honor her memory, I want to invite my Lord and Lady of the James Beverly, representative Linda Gays and representative Carlton Howard to join me on the roster. Please come up. I want to go into the roster. The roster leader? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Tish was a good woman. He was a kind, kind, kind, kind, kind, so. Mr. Speaker, my loss was worse because we feel grief and my grief is only a couple with sadness because I was great. You know, I'm reminded of a song and I think Tish and Body, this song by Mahalia Jackson, if I can help somebody. When it goes as I pass along, if I could cheer somebody with a word or a song, if I could show someone they're traveling wrong, then my living will not be in vain. If I could do my duty as a Christian art, if I can bring salvation to a world once bright, if I can spread love's message as the Master taught, then my living will not be in vain. We will miss her presence. Absolutely, but her living was not in vain because she showed us the way to love, to live, to embrace this great state of Georgia and this House of Representatives. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to see a few words. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for my colleagues in this great house. In this day here in Georgia, we get to say to a colleague who loved, who lived a life and an aunt has left the legacy of service. Tish was a mother, a wife, an aunt, a sister, a friend, a legislator. Her work is indelible. She's made a mark in South Fulton and Fayette County that won't be erased. Her shoulders are big enough for us to come behind and stand with that and do the work of people in the people's house. How good and pleasant it is today to dwell together with our brethren as we mourn the loss of a great angel. May the Lord bless and keep her family, her husband, children, made this freshman class remember what she placed inside of us. She was determined, she was beautiful, she was dedicated to disassembly, to the people's house. I believe we are blessed in this transition because we get to put humanity in divinity, and the work of service together today as we just remember a woman who was worth our standing today to say never goodbye but we'll see you soon. Thank you. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it is one of those sad days that we come to share with our friends and colleagues. As a pastor, one of the things I've tried to do over 26 years is to explain to those who have lost loved ones, I've tried to explain to them the wise of death, why now, why I teach why this way. I've tried to do that for 26 years and I've yet to be able to explain the wise of death. But what I've learned to do is not to continue to ask the why questions or try to answer the why questions, what I've learned to do is to point them to the who, to the one who, the one who says through the psalmist that he says that God is our refuge.

of their present help in times of trouble like this. That's who we depend on in times like this. I point them to the who, the who that Apostle Paul talks about, Apostle Paul talks about him, our God, he talks about him as the God of all comfort, even when we don't understand he can bring us comfort in times like this. I talk to them, I talk to them rather than answering the question about why I point them to the one who said, come unto me, all ye that labor and the heaven laden. And he says, I'll give you rest, I'll give you peace. And what's good about it is he talks to us as a congregation as a people, but it's a personal invitation. He says, come unto me, all, all of you individually, we can come to him. The pains that I've seen and felt in the group text from this wonderful freshman class all night long. He's speaking to us now saying, come, come unto me. It's a personal invitation and the good part about it, it's inclusive, doesn't leave anybody out. All of us can go to him individually and get that peace and get that rest. But then his promise, his promise that he gives to us and the promise is simply this, I will. You may not all happen at the same time, but I will give you peace. You will have the peace not only with God, but you will also have the peace of God. And I will close by saying and I will share with some of the class members for lunch today. I didn't get to no tissue, represent the tissue that well, but I didn't exchange with her. And I was telling a good friend, yeah, together that the thing that I talked to her about was one night they had a little party downtown. And when she got back the next morning, I had the video and she was about as happy as she can be dancing. That's all I can remember, our interchanges. That's a happy moment. And I will share to you that one of the song, lead a Beverly alluded to a song, but there's another song that I would point you to in times like this. It simply says this one of the lines. And one of the courses says this precious memories, how they linger, how they ever flood my soul. In the stillness of the midnight, precious secret scenes unfold. God bless you. I love this place, not because of the place, but because of the people, because of this family. It's days like this. When we lose ones that are near to us, that are close to us in so many ways, they share our commitment to public service. Just as we lost Speaker Roslin, names we lose, Tish, as a whole in the heart of this house, it will not be easily healed, but what a beautiful lady. She's right there where we all want to be. Right there at the right hand of the Lord. We're going to miss her. We're going to think about her. And we're going to grieve, but I especially want to pray for her family, her immediate family, this freshman class family, all of us in this family, but especially her family and her children. As Representative Howard knows, it's hard to lose a brother. I've done that. It's been hard to lose brothers in this house, but it's also very, very hard to lose a sister. And we've done just that. It's all remember each other. It's all remember this family. It's grieving. It's helped them make it through. Now when that this family will do whatever needs to be done to support them. I love all of you and thank you for caring. If you'll bow with me for a moment of silence. Thank you God for bless us with people, Lord, with loved ones, all of us, your children, serving together, living together, working together, and caring about each other. Amen. You may be seated. We're going to carry on with our next order of business today, and that's going to be, as is our custom. We will begin our day with scripture reading, and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 67th House District, Representative Glace. Representative Glace. Good morning again speaker and my great colleagues in this house. It is not by chance, but divinity and humanity comes together in our chaplain of today is a good friend of over three decades. Apostle Dr. Lerese Howell. He has served 46 years in ministry. He's been a church organizer. He's been a church developer. He's been our pastoral counseling. He has spent many years serving this country, starting in the Air Force and then continuing as chaplain. He retired, Lieutenant Colonel. He has a PhD from Hebrew University, Biblical Center in Jerusalem, where he studied Biblical archaeology and Biblical history. His master's of divinity is from Kenner Theological Center, here in Atlanta, Georgia, Emory and he has a BA from Georgia State in philosophy and he got his associates degree from Atlanta Metropolitan State College. He certified as a clinical specialist. He's the graduate of the Air Force University. Most of all, I want to tell you about his family. His dear wife, if she would stand, is here, Minister Bernahauer. We love you and we thank you for coming and supporting your husband. There are two faithful servants with him, his sister and evangelist. If you would stand in his head, deacon, deacon, headly, or with us today. They serve. They serve at New Horizons, ministries in faith in Fairburn, Georgia, where they started the ministry in 1996. What's important today is that he served us in the Vietnam War. He thought it not robbery to come home and serve his country on a continuous basis in the ministry. He has been a friend and now he gets to share his family with us for so many years. The ministry of Christ. None other than my dear friend, Apostle Dr. Luis Hauer. Thank you, sir. Thank you for having me. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I see that there are some people here that are smarter than me. You invited me and I appreciated it. It means you got good sense. To the speaker of the house, great leader, great man of that loves his family and God, to you, House of Representatives. I know I have a few minutes, but I want to say to God first, be the glory that I'm even standing here, having almost gotten killed in the army three times in Vietnam. It's no accident I'm here. And when the Lord called me seven years later, I went to Atlanta Metro College and onto Georgia State. And then I didn't think it was smart enough to go to Emory, but I got a scholarship and went anyway. And I did graduate. And then Dr. Flemmis gave me another grad to come to Jerusalem. And I remember, I can't understand up now, so I need to footnote that, I need to go to the hip surgeries and one knee. But I remember when I was young like that, I ran up Masada, ran down the mountain of Gaza, and went over to Jerusalem in Tel Aviv, down through Samaritan on down to the Dead Sea, and sat down on the water of the Dead Sea in the sand. God has blessed me to be in conference with General Swartzkov in Colorado Springs, Colorado. And I worked directly with General, part of the first female two-star general, and I told at the University of Air University in Montgomery where I retired. When you give your life to God, He brings you places as I say in our church, you'll do things you've never done. To become somebody you would have never become. To go somewhere you would have never thought you would go. I had no inkling of imagination. I'd be standing here with the speak of this house, and you're the great representatives. It was not a part of my prayers. It was a part of what God has done. So it is my prayer today, Michael and Gabriel, that you will assist me in what I am to say to your people. And I will do that inclusively in my prayer. Shall we pray? Before we pray, I, we've already acknowledged my wife, but I want to go home, so I love you, honey. You're going to get me in trouble now. I love you, baby. My sister and my dearest, somebody got some sense in here, don't do me. David said in Psalm 23, you've heard verse a bit of y'all already know, and I'm also glad that I've heard the scriptures and the presence of God has invited here. David said in this one scripture, inform your people to an unequivocal faith, an unequivocal truth. Let God restore our soul and lead your people in the path of righteousness for your name's sake. So here I am, God, standing before your people in this high place, place of honor, steam and value lead us through the chambers of your most holy and righteous will. Let your will unlock the mysteries of our minds and strengthen our courage to see the implements of just laws, teach us how to empower all humanity to live in this land with dreams, aspirations and hopes for brighter future slash calls. We know eternal God of Zion that you are God and a God of righteousness, you're just and you holy. We have always looked to you as all humanity. Look for greater power than themselves because as one rise and fall, another one rises. So guide us God through humanity from generations to generations from shores to shores, from land to land. No matter how deep the waters of circumstances you have guided us through God, you're still God. We pray for peace. We pray for hope without despair, always seeking for that which is good and acceptable in our sight. It's okay to say hallelujah. Life is a tragedy. I'm alright without you, Almighty God. I pray it shows us the way the truth and the light. Show us how to operate in word and deed and submit to your divine will. Your people await on this house represented to thrive in inclusivity with an unselfishness to hear the cries of all Georgians. Therefore let your presence parade the halls of every chamber, every office, and grant the truth to withstand every hurricane of life and grant us an order of your prevailing love to prove the test of any adversity. There is your presence in stewardship coordinated with deeds in this house of representative. You told Isaiah to write in the 21st chapter, verse 5, 6, and 7, the Hebrew nation prepare a table. Lay out a carpet. They eat. They drink. Rise up, O princes. All your shields. For this is what the Lord says to me. Go post a lookout and have him report what he sees or she sees. When you see the chariots with teams of horsemen, riders of donkeys, riders on camels, you must be alert, fully alert. The book of Deuteronomy, I advocate that God is a jealous God, yet a righteous God who calls one out of darkness into his marvelous light. Speaker of this great house, representatives of these, their communities, awaken and see that one comes and another in goals. Yet our community advocates for those who will stand for truth, those who will stand for justice. We nourish the visions and dreams and aspirations and beg the question God, what must we do with representative-tish labor of community service? She labored with such valour and truth and wisdom, and now she has fallen. But one said, I don't know what to ask about. Death is only a separation from this planet, but presence with God to go into the upper changels of the echelons and see what God has in store for us. Yes, we pray for her family, her children. We pray for their healing, but please God, teach us your leaders how to walk through the valley shadow of death, as David said, with integrity, honesty and purpose. You, God and you, God alone, help us to go home to our families, our communities with a clear heart. Somebody need to give you praise here, and a righteous mind. Somebody need to open a mouth, and knowing we have done our best as a nation, as elected officials through the adversities of life, as a community servant to help someone believe in a future that speaks volumes of hope and not fear. John 16, 27, Lord, you told us, peace, love, one another. Peace I give unto you, I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Do not be afraid, and as I come closer to my closing, I am wondering in here who is connecting to your love, God. I am seeking to see your presence in here. Am I not true Holy Spirit, angels of the most high God? We know God is the beginning and ending of life. We all have to choose to erect values of service to help those who need a voice of reconciliation, a spiral of hope, a lifeline to keep from drowning in despair. May your voice, your voice, representatives, your voice speak of the house. May the voice of implementing just laws that beam a light in the hearts of many who erect or who elected you to represent their families, the government, the religions, the practice, and fire department of schools for safety of our children. May we always be mindful of your love, God, and rest your... I cares, I cares on you, God. And I say, at last, help us to be mindful of your love and honor you, God. No matter where we go, eternal God, for we believe this is our key to greatness that leads us to fulfillment. Amen. I may have been a little long, but I stood up over 10 hours with God, and they didn't write this press, so I hope you heard it. I did very, very, very, very. My pleasure, leaders, to provide a united state of America and to the Republic of the West End, for a lot of nation and for a lot of indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. You may meet the pastor in the south any room, our chapel of the day, and have a photo, and get to know him. He's a fine man.

Just today afternoon, when we learned of our tragic laws, I reached out to some good friends.

of hours at Mercy Care, who function as FQHC, which this house has supported over the years. They do great work around the state. Mercy Care works with the homeless population and uninsured just down the street. And they graciously allowed us to have two of their grief counselors. Some of y'all have met them this morning, but I want to introduce you and let you know that they will be available as long as you may need them. Or on another day, whatever that need may be, that they will be available. The two of them are Reverend Alley, Holiness Rowland. She's a chaplain and Dr. Reed, Beatrie, he's a psychiatrist. Would you give them show them our debt of gratitude for them being here? We're also going to go ahead and introduce the doctor of the day right now. Chairman Stan Gutherr, if you'll come up and introduce our doctor of the day. My apologies, Representative Will Wade. We'll let the better look in gentlemen come up in just a second. House that I'm excited to introduce today, Stan, but before I do, this doctor is a family practice medicine doctor in my district. He also happens to be my doctor. And he's already told me he's going to make sure to have me scheduled for an appointment in early April when we get out of here. It's obvious that I need to go take a visit and get my annual inspection is what I call it, but but in all seriousness, he's a great doctor and we're very honored to have him in this house and I'm honored to introduce his dad, Representative Stan Gutherr. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I feel like I must report a conspiracy. Extended down from the Speaker's office to the clerk's office, down to my office, and across the hall to the Senate Chamber. So I'm notifying buddy to look to that conspiracy. There you go. Because when I walked in this morning, I had no idea my son was going to be here. And the instigator of this conspiracy is my wife right back there. I think most of y'all knew about this and I didn't know it all. So y'all are all part of it too. But I thank you on that. I just want to say about my son. Of course he is a doctor. Better be. He's been doing it for a while. But as you can see, he got Rita's jeans. He's taller and I am better looking. All that. That's smarter. But what what what jeans I gave to him were, I'll give you an example of his personality. He did a study abroad in New Zealand and down there they have the second highest bungee jump in the world. And we've received a photograph of him diving off of that with the bands attached, thank goodness. But that's the kind of person he is. So he's he's always been that way since a little kid, a little daredevil. But he's a great person. I'm very proud of my son. It's an honor to be here today. Last time I was in this room I was 11 years old serving as a page. So it's good to be back. But so providing medical care for you today is just a small token of my appreciation for all you do. Having a grandfather and now a father in the house I've seen firsthand hard work and the dedication and the time commitment that it takes. So it's really amazing. We deeply appreciate our long-standing relationship between the General Assembly and the medical community and our common goal of just serving our community, making it a better place. So for that, thank you. Thank you for all you do for the great state of Georgia and come see me if you don't need anything. Thanks. Thank you Dr. Guthre. We're blessed to have you. Thanks for serving us today. Members, we're moving on to the local calendar. There are, how many? Two. Several.

Thank you and as a speaker said they do put their lives on the line even with servicing land owners and then protecting our forest from wildfires every day and it's something that we recognize is important to our state for the forestry commission. Forestry is important to our state and I will tell you this you know my my experience is not has not 100% been with the forestry commission I came from the private sector here about two two years ago and I will let you know as leaders that it matters your attitude toward business toward the forest industry and that gets talked about on a regular basis around boardrooms from publicly traded companies on a regular basis. There are people watching what you do they appreciate the friendly business climate and the support that you give for forestry in the state I know that because I was part of those conversations just two years ago in my previous role. I'll just wrap up in those two years that I've been here Georgia what I've learned has got something really special in the Georgia Forestry commission. They are a can do kind of folks they get up and they figure out how to do their job and figure out how to serve land owners and you guys should be proud of them I know I am proud of them we recognize this important work we go to work with that mentality every day so that we can serve our agency and we can serve our state and we can serve our forest land owners and a great sector across our state every every day. I'll just wrap up and say again thank you for celebrating with us if we can ever be of service to you this is completely overwhelming and if we can ever be of service to you I hope you will reach out to us and give us a chance to help. You guys have a great rest of your day and thank you so much. I want to remind you of something about Georgia Forestry as I will put you in the state of Georgia Forestry. I want to remind you of something about Georgia Forestry as our population expands they have something they call the urban interface and that's when people build their homes out in more rural Georgia but close to town where the forest grows is right next to their homes these folks protect those homes and that urban interface so they do more a lot more than protect large tracks of forest land owners. They protect our homes of many many Georgia so we owe them a great gratitude. Now we'll move on to morning orders. Chairman Petrie has recognized for a morning order. You have one minute chairman Petrie and I want one more chairman.

And so he and his wife Meredith talked about that and agreed to do it and so I am really honored today to have Chase Hilton. Here is my page and Chase and his mother Meredith and Representative Scott Hilton standing in the back. Please take a look at them and give them your applause.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 19? House Bill 19, our rose in the burns of the 159 Jones, the 47th of the situation, the 100th hatched to the 150th. To be titled an act to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2023 and ending June 30th, 2024. This bill I've referred to the committee on appropriations that committee recommends a disbilled to pass by committee substitute. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, the chair resolves the house into a committee of the whole house for the purpose of considering House Bill 19, the General Appropriations Bill. The chair appoints the General of the 104th majority leader, the frustration as chairman to preside over the committee of the whole. Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 155th district chairman Matt Hatchett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Good afternoon. You know with the business we handled first this morning, this is not important. However, we must go on with our work. HB 19, the fiscal year 24 budget is set by revenue estimate of $32.4 million. Did I say that wrong? $32 billion. That's a 7.4% increase or $2.2 billion of the original FY23 budget. You know, I've learned a few things since I took this job. I got a lot of new friends. We all laugh, but seriously, I met with many of you who ask and our friends in the hall on the issues that are most pressing for you and your constituents. I've learned that there are a lot of needs out there. Most of them are important, urgent, or both. And I've also learned that $32 billion doesn't go as far as you think it would. Do I wish we could have done more on many items? Absolutely, yes. But our job as appropriators is to live within our means and to weigh the many competing yet equally important policy, agency, and constituent needs and to pack all of that into the estimated revenue that we are given to work with. While the amended budget that you gave final passes to this.

Week largely focused on one-time investments. The big budget provides the opportunity to make impactful and permanent changes in state budget and policy. That's exactly what this House budget does. We harness the available revenue and program it in such a way to provide meaningful enhancements not only for this year but also a solid foundation for which to build upon in future years. There are a number of great initiatives that we were able to include in our version of the budget that you can be proud of, but our work is not done. We know that there are some priorities that need additional funding, specifically in behavioral health. We'll continue working with our partners in the Senate and with the governor to keep this momentum going and build upon the items funded in this House budget. I'm not going to walk through this budget line by line, applause. The budget's been on your desk since 9.40 yesterday morning and I've been available to answer any questions and you may have had since it came out of committee yesterday and so has the budget staff. But I would like to go over some key highlights. I'd like to begin with our state employees, both active and retired. They're the link between the money we appropriate and the services that our constituents not only expect but demand this state provide. There are more than 54,000 retirees and their beneficiaries who committed years of their lives to public service within the state of Georgia. Prior to last year, state retirees had not seen a cost of living adjustment since 2009. A few years ago, the state began to provide a small one-time payment in years that the market allowed to offset the lack of a regular COLA. The FY24 budget annualizes to $26.7 million that we funded in the amended budget to make that annual one-time adjustment permanent. The funding level in this budget provides for a $500 one-time benefit check and acknowledges the need for an increase in retiree benefit but does not compound or negatively impact the long-term fiscal soundness of the plan. As for our active employees, the governor is recommended a $2,000 cost of living adjustment for all employees. This builds upon the $5,000 play raise we provided last year. Compensation for state government positions has always been below their private sector counterparts. And in an economy where every business is struggling to find staffing, filling and retaining positions for state jobs has gotten even more difficult. I know I don't have to tell you that money talks. We've heard from agency heads that these salary adjustments are helping them recruit and restate retained staff, but we know there's more work to do. As you heard in subcommittees, the House targets additional salary enhancements in DBHCD, forestry and driver services to address retention in high turnover or hard to staff positions. The House was also able to add $13.1 million in targeted salary adjustments of an additional $2,000 per state law enforcement officers across agencies. This salary adjustment is intended to increase competitiveness with surrounding states and other law enforcement agencies. But also acknowledges the inherent dangers of the job and the increasing call to beauty and their willingness to step up in turbulent times. Continuing along the lines of public safety, the House provides $1.25 million for new state patrol satellite posts in the Buckhead area of the City of Atlanta to address crime and promote a faster incident response on the north side of Atlanta. This ad includes up to 20 motor unit troopers as well as the Nighthawks DUI task force. $2.7 million for a new cold case special to unit in the GBI. The new unit includes 13 agents, two criminal intelligence analysts and two digital forensic investigators to address the nearly 570 homicide cases that the agency is well to provide assistance to local law enforcement agencies with their cold case as requested. $1.4 million for 21 additional positions in the forensic services division of GBI to address the backlog of more than 40,000 pieces of evidence with the highest areas of need in the firearm, chemistry and toxicology sections. And $240,000 in new and existing funds is provided to establish a loan repayment program for medical examiners employed by the GBI in order to recruit and retain medical examiners in the midst of a national shortage. To support victims of crime, the House includes $2.5 million for sexual assault, nurse examiner, coordinator positions at each of the 28 sexual assault centers across this state, more than doubling the base funding of 1.5 million for these centers. $4.5 million to correct the structural problem in the crime victims' emergency fund to provide state funding for positions in operating expenses to administer the fund. Thus freeing up fees collected to help cover expenses for victims of violent crime. You'll recall that earlier this week, the House has sent a degree to an additional $8 million in the amended 23 budget to shore up this fund. The prosecuting attorneys' budget includes nearly $5 million for one victim advocate in each circuit. The amended budget included an infusion of funds for domestic violence shelters for operations and security needs. The FY20 budget maintains base funding of nearly $13 million to support shelter organizations. Within the Department of Corrections, the House provides for $5.3 million for $3 per DM increase for county correctional institutions. These are state prisoners housed in local facilities and this increases the per DM from $22 to $25 per DM per inmate. $6.8 million is provided for salary adjustments for private prison correctional officers and other support employees to ensure parity and pay adjustments with state prison staff. Economic development. We added $1.5 million in the House budget for the Department of Ag to continue the implementation of the Royal Dairy Act, implement funding for the state agriculture response team, which is charged with responding to animal disease outbreaks like avian flu and provide staffing and operations to administer and enforce sole amendment rules. The House restores funding for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for facility improvements including grounds and exhibit space enhancements. This brings the total appropriation for the Center for FY24 to $740,245. In addition to the $2,000 cost of living adjustment, the House provides the Forestry Commission with $3.1 million for an additional $4,000 pay raise to support recruitment and retention efforts by bringing pay even with the Florida Forestry Service. These funds are particularly important in communities near the border who are competing with foresters in Florida. I wish they were still here. They probably applaud. The FY24 budget fully funds the QBE program, totaling $13.1 billion in state funds. The most state funds ever provided to K-12 education. Coming out of the pandemic, we're all dealing with inflated prices and food is no exception. These are not able to learn if they're hungry. The House version of the budget includes $6.3 million in the Department of Education budget to cover the cost of breakfast and lunch for reduced price students. This is expected to provide free breakfast for 32,000 children and free lunch for 64,000 children. The House adds $1.7 million to fully fund charter facility grants. We've been working for several years to fully implement this program and an FY24 will now be funding facility grants of $100,000 per school. Many of these schools are lease space or in older facilities and do not draw down regular capital outlay funding like traditional schools. Fully funding this grant prevents these schools from diverting funds away from direct instruction in order to cover their rent or capital needs. This one's close to me. $262,000 for communities and schools to recognize additional participation in nine school systems. This time proven program is a collaboration of local school systems and community partners who work together to support students academically and non-academic to improve their attendance behavior, academic performance retention and graduation. The House budget includes $2.8 million for an increase in the benefit multiplier for nearly 20,000 retirees of the public school employees retirement system who spent years of work as school bus drivers, lunchroom workers and custodians. Under general government, the House budget includes $100,000 for the Council of American Indian Concerns. It includes $550,000 for a data plan contract for poll pads for the Secretary of State Office for Elections as well as the House half or $2 million of the funds requested by the Secretary of State for battery replacement on elections equipment. That's bond number 91. $584,055 is provided to establish the State Election Board as a separate program within the agency including funding for two dedicated investigators. And to address the licensure and complaint volume, the budget also includes $191,915 for two analysts and a full-time educator for the Georgia Board of Nursing as well as 308,000 and $959 to provide five additional analysts to help with other licensing boards. The House adds an additional $1.4 million to the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission for positions and operations associated with the Commission's expanding enforcement and regulation duties. The Department of Driver Services receives over $2.3 million to target high turnover at certain customer service centers. Now in health. Numerous Medicaid rate increases are included in the House budget. Further supporting health care providers, these include additional support for providers of primary care and OBGYN, home and community-based services, EMS and speech and audiology therapy that totals $35 million. The House budget includes $2.8 million in Medicaid to provide adult basic dental services. Currently, the State only provides for emergency dental services. That's a program near and dear to Chairman Housen. The House provides substantial additional support for graduate medical education in Georgia, including a total of $5.2 million for residencies and fellowships. $2.8 million for hospitals in southwest Georgia starting up new residency programs. And $3.4 million to support loan repayment for providers, practicing in rural areas and educating future providers. The House is building on previous work done by this chamber by adding three new federally qualified health centers, including one in primary care, one in behavioral health, and one school-based health center. Further additional funding is put into support charity clinics, statewide, as well as additional $500 for Mercy Care Atlanta to support more patients after the closure of Atlanta Medical Center. This budget continues to support the State's public-private partnerships with both Mercer and Morehouse Schools of Medicine to help ensure an adequate supply of physicians in Georgia. The budget continues to plan for funding a portion of Mercer's Medical School campus in Columbus, and for Morehouse School of Medicine, $1.5 million is going to support expanding the medical school class size, as well as another $240,000 to help start a rural OBGYN program. Additionally, previously funded psychiatric slots are being moved to leverage more federal dollars. In public health, the House is providing $363,675 in new funds to continue the support of the Sickle Cell Foundation for a total investment of $1.4 million in FY24 and $50,000 in new funds for the Council on Lupus Education and Awareness for increased research, education, and services. Additionally, the House funds $1.7 million to start a home visiting pilot in at-risk and underserved communities that will focus on pregnancy and early childhood to improve birth outcomes, reduce preterm deliveries, and decrease infant and maternal mortality. Now in higher ed, the House includes more than $2 million in the Ag Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension in the Board of Regents for additions that support the Ag Ministry, including five positions at the Demonstration Farm in Perry, three faculty positions to serve peach and citrus industries, a vertical farming greenhouse planning study, three research technicians positions to support peanut breeding and funds for seven additional extension agents. It seems like I should say in a partridge in a pear tree, but ill-affects there, maybe I should have said in a peach tree. 1.4 million dollars is provided to expand the K-12 rural Georgia Computer Science pilot program and $775,000 to expand the Archway partnership into five additional communities. The FY24 budget provides the Georgia Public Library service with $556,796 in additional funds to increase the materials grant for public libraries from 60 cents to 65 cents per capita. The Georgia Commission on the Holocaust receives $344,500 in the House version of the budget for operations of the Anne Frank Holocaust Education Center. Supporting the Center in the New Exhibit was important to a number of you and I'm glad we could include it in the FY24 budget. There's $8.2 million in TCSG to implement year one of a three-year plan for increased credit our earnings for aviation, CDL, and nursing to reflect the high cost nature of providing these programs. I've heard from a number of you who recognize the important role that your technical colleges play in providing a skilled workforce and this plan acknowledges the additional funding needed to deliver these programs. In the Georgia Student Finance Commission, the A to C is instructed to utilize reserve funds to increase the tuition equalization grant or TEG award amount from $900 to $1,000. The tuition equalization grants are provided to eligible Georgia students attending private institutions throughout the state and were awarded to over 24,000 students in 2022. Lottery. The House supports the integrity of the Zell Miller Scholars. We made an extremely difficult decision more than 10 years ago to differentiate between award levels. Students who've been working towards the Zell Scholarship deserve to have their hard working knowledge and a higher payment. The House budget provides the hope scholarship at 95% of the Zell amount rather than the full 100%. Having the factor rate from 90 to 95 provides additional funding to every student who receives hope, which is more than 128,000 students. In doing so, the House was able to address two additional needs not contemplated in the Governor's budget. The House version provides an adjustment to the private hope Zell Scholarship bringing the award up to $3,100 for Zell Scholars and making the hope private scholarship at 95% of the Zell private award. This add a 15.3 million positive impacts more than 15,000 students at private post-secondary institutions who are Georgians throughout the state. The House budget also redirects $11.9 million in lottery funds to address the increased costs in funding the employer share for state health benefit plan for public pre-K teachers. As a result of the increased employer contribution implemented in January 23 to shore up the plan, school systems that provide pre-K will receive an increase in their state health benefit billings for more than 3,800 pre-K teachers and assistant teachers without an associated appropriation to cover the expense. The House version provides funding toward this expense. Human services. Now y'all need to hear this one. The House version adds an additional $51.3 million to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities budget over the Governor's recommendation for a total increase of $120 million over the FY23 original budget. Getting on the momentum of the last budget cycle of adding 513 new now comp waivers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, the House annualizes those waiver slots. Agrees with the Governor's recommendation to add 250 waivers and FY24 and adds 125 slots and administrative support for a total of 375 new waivers and FY24 and a total increase in funding of $19 million. The House builds upon the Governor's recommendation and provides $29 million to support the establishment of behavioral health crisis centers in Augusta, Dublin, Fulton County and Rome. We added $2.2 million for additional $9.88 administration needs and support the Governor's recommendation of $6.2 million for additional mobile crisis teams to meet the increased need brought about by the $9.88 hotline. The House also adds $1 million for the multi-agency treatment for children match teams to support collaboration across state agencies to meet the treatment needs of children. We know that the Department has additional needs to continue ramping up response teams and will work with our partners in the Senate and the Governor's Office to address those. $1.4 million is provided for additional forensic evaluators, peer mentors, as well as a salary adjustment to address recruitment and retention. And $4.6 million is provided for the Georgia Housing voucher program and peer service provided by the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network. We provide a continuation funding of $825,000 to address homelessness in the Atlanta area. $8 million is provided to annualize private psychiatric contract beds and $10.1 million is provided to increase salaries for state psychiatric hospital staff to bring them closer to market salary. Last year we made a huge investment in staff and we know that's translated into the Department being able to fill and retain critical positions to bring beds back online. This ad builds on that momentum. We also acknowledge the need to fund the Provider Rates Study and look forward to working with the Governor and the Senate to develop a plan and funding for that implementation. The inclusive post-secondary education or IPC program is a college transitional program for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities and receives additional funding in two places in the House budget. In DPHD, $200,000 is provided for staffing support and expansion. There are currently 139 students attending IPC programs at eight universities. State funds provided through DPHD provide support to these students including academic support, life skills and job training. In Georgia, in the Georgia Student Finance Commission, $955,830 is provided to create new IPC grant to provide tuition assistance to these students is provided for an HB185 that passes House earlier this session. The Department of Human Services is appropriated $6.8 million for services for older Georgians including enhanced capacity for the long-term care on MUDSMAN program, respite care programs for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and over 2,500 slides for non-medicate home and community-based services. This House adds $11 million to fully fund the Department's staffing needs for the unwinding of Medicaid. In the transportation budget, $20.1 million is included in the local maintenance and improvement grants, LMEG, to phase in the percent of motor fuel funds appropriated to LMEG from 10% to 15% over a five-year period. LMEG is currently funded at $200 million and can increase to $300 million in the next five years to address maintenance on local roads. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge all the hard work that's gotten us to this point on the floor. Our subcommittees and chairs spent hours meeting and listening to testimony from agencies, advocates and constituents and making thoughtful recommendations about what to include in this House version of the budget. Thank you. I'd like to also recognize this budget staff who helped and craft this budget during the day, but continue the work long after we've all gone home. Thank you to Christine, Tara, Sarah, Abby, Amber, Molly, Courtney and David. And I save the best for last. Thank you to Ashley Newton in my office who keeps me straight. We also thank the Senate and the governor's office on the work that we've already done together on the budget that we did past just Monday and in advance for the job still left to do to finish the budget in the days and weeks ahead. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration on HB19 and we'll yield for any questions. Chair recognizes the minority caucus with representative Park for a question. Thank you, Leader of Stration. Chairman Hatchett, thank you for your hard work on this bill. Would you be so kind as to yield to a few questions? Yes, sir. On section 12.2.1, why is $1.5 million eliminated for the two compensation resolutions that we passed last year? Is $1.5 million eliminated for the two compensation resolutions? I think the answer to that is those.

have not been funded as of yet is I'm looking for a little. Okay, in fact it shows the actual cost that we paid which evidently was less than what we did what was included in last year's budget. Okay, I'm happy to follow up just for further clarification afterwards. Thank you. On 17.7.2, I saw that there was a reduction in the F map for Medicaid aged blind to disable that resulted in the state having to appropriate about 102 million dollars. Is it not true that if Georgia expanded access to health care for this population up to 138% of the federal poverty level that we could receive an F map of up to 90% that would help the state save hundreds of millions of dollars as we saw in the supplemental FY 23 budget? I don't have the exact numbers that you have but I'm sure you believe that to be true. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I got a few more questions if you further you. Thank you, sir. On section 24.17.5, I'm incredibly grateful and thankful that we are seeing a $2,000 increase for teachers and for state employees throughout the budget. I saw that for law enforcement across the budget, again the House recommended law enforcement officers, especially for of recruitment and retention purposes receiving a total of $4,000. I was wondering if you'd be able to commit to continuing the bipartisan efforts to ensure that we're investing in our teachers and that over the coming years we'll continue to work together to ensure that our teachers and George are some of the best paid in the country. I will commit to you and I think this budget probably reflects an increase of around $512 million to support our public school teachers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On sections 44.7, 44.9 and 44.10 regarding both the hope scholarship and the hope grant. As you mentioned, the House proposal does fall short of the governor's promise to ensure that the hope scholarship and the hope grant would be fully funded by 100% in his state of the state address. Does the governor accept the House's proposal of falling short of that commitment that he made in the state of the state here on the House? Mr. Wheelbicke, I can't comment on whether the governor's support set or not, but I don't know if you were here when we went through the tough times to make changes in hope. I was and it was, you know, it was running out of money. The fund was running out of money. And we had to make hard decisions and the decisions at the time was that we would still continue to support those students that have shown exceptional work in high school and to award them with the 100% that it was at the present time. And that you would still receive hope awards as a regular hope recipient at a lower level. So that's, that's, this is an increase from 90 to 95. And I hope that we can, it's my hope that we can continue to allow those that have worked exceptionally hard to receive some sort of reward for what they've done. Thank you. Does the chairman yield for one final question? Is it not true that again, I greatly appreciate your hard work and that I plan on voting yes to this budget to ensure that we can continue to work in a bipartisan manner to be good stewards of Georgia tax pair of dollars and demonstrate fiscal responsibility. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you yield for other questions? Mr. Chair, yes, sir, chair recognizes chairman David Knight for a question. Thank you. This is gentleman you. Yes. My friend, is it not true that the technical college system plays a vital role in the workforce and the economic development that this state specifically by offering demand in these high career programs? Yes, sir. Isn't it further true that some of these programs have a very high cost to the education such as nursing, the CDL and aviation? And is it further true, sir, that we have increased the credit hour earnings for these programs, therefore helping out these high demand areas? Yes, we have taken that step and I believe we've added we've added back to a cut and we've added eight point two million dollars to address that situation. Thank you. This one has year one of a three year program. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Do you yield? Yes. Chair recognizes chairman Clay Perkel for a question. Thing, Mr. Chairman, does Jim and you? Yes, sir. So I wrote a couple of these questions down. So I got two questions. They're fairly closely related. I can read them both or I had to write them down as I wouldn't forget them. I'll ask you both and of the questions at once. Is it not true that for the first time we're increasing the L may beyond that a minimum 10% required by statute? And is it also not further true in light of your comments regarding us living within our means that we have both the capacity and the need to advance additional transportation projects if there were additional funding opportunities? Yes, I totally agree. You know, we do have the authority to raise L may funds from 10% to 20% and I think this is a fair step to increase that over up to 15% to allow our locals to do more resurfacing in our local communities. And thank you. Thank you, sir. Do you yield, Mr. Chairman? I'll take a couple more. Chair recognizes representative Maynard for a question. I was couldn't wait to get a question from representative Maynard. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Does the do you yield? Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. So I see that we are giving the Department of Public Safety 1.25 million for the satellite posts in the bucket area. And so my district is between nine to 10 miles just south of that. Do you think public safety with that satellite office could also serve my community if it is not serving the bucket community? I'm sure that the lady could discuss that with the Colonel and see what she can do to convince that. Thank you. You yield, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Leader, I know I'm standing between the weekend and people's families. And I will yield the well and ask for your favoral consideration of HB 19. The gentleman has yielded the well. And at this time, the chair recognizes Chairman Hatchett for a motion. Mr. Chair, I move that the House bill, that House bill 19 do pass by committee substitute. This time, the chair recognizes Chairwoman Katie Dempsey for a second. Mr. Chairman, I rise to second the message, the passage of HB 19 crafted with fidelity and rich with opportunity for Georgians all across our state. Chairwoman Dempsey seconds the motion. If this time we'll call the question on House bill 19. All in favor will say aye and all opposed will say no. This time, all in favor signify by saying aye. All opposed say no. The eyes have it and House bill 19 passes by committee substitute. This time, the chair recognizes the gentleman from the 150th floor. The House bill 19 passes by committee substitute. This time, the chair recognizes the gentleman from the 150th district chairman Matt Hatchett. Mr. Chair, as chairman of the committee of the whole House, you're instructed to report the action of the committee of the whole House to the House. Chair, recognize the majority of the leader's frustration. Mr. Chair, recognize the majority of the leader's frustration. Mr. Speaker, the committee of the whole House has had under consideration House bill 19 and has instructed me as its chairman to report the same back to the House with the recommendation that House bill 19 passes by committee substitute. The report of the committee of the whole House is received. The committee of the whole House has had under consideration House bill 19 and has reported the same back to the House with the recommendation that House bill 19 do pass by committee substitute. The committee of the whole House is hereby dissolved. We do have a speaker on the bill. The chair recognizes Representative Stacy Abrams. That was a fraud in slip one. I know you all know each other well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's happened before and it will happen again. It's all good. My friend, Stacy Abrams. Not by me. Thank you again, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. Let me start by saying I am going to be voting yes on this budget. Let me also recognize that it's Thursday afternoon and some of you all have a ways to drive. But some things are too important not to bring to light. Let me also acknowledge that I am thrilled that we are increasing the award for the regular hope grant and the regular hope scholarship from 90% to 95%. That is good and that's why I will be voting yes. But I want us to recognize what we're doing and what we could do and the hopes that those who ultimately end up on the eventual conference committee or our friends across the hall or the governor's office will take to heart when can be voted yes. We will take to heart when considering what ultimately comes before us at the end of the session. When this session started and the governor made his recommendation to move hope grants and scholarships to 100%. I came to this well and I said thank you. This whole house stood up and clapped. We had not fully funded the hope grant or the hope scholarship since 2011 and that was a big deal. The difference from what the governor has recommended and what is in this budget that we're going to vote on today is $26 million. $26 million is a lot of money anytime you've got a million on the end of something that's real money. But we've got to put it in perspective. The difference for the scholarship is $25 million. The difference for the grant which goes to our students who attend our technical college system is $1.3 million. $1.3 million that we are withholding. $25 million that we're withholding from the scholarships. My friend Chairman Hatchett said that money doesn't always go as far as you think it should and sometimes that's true. But not here. We have the money to return the full promise of hope to all of our hope scholars, not just those with a 1200 SAT score. My friend said we need to preserve the integrity of the Zo Miller Scholars. We need to recognize that they were told that if they worked hard and got the 1200 SAT in the higher GPA that they would get 100% of their tuition covered. That's exactly what they're going to get. We made them a promise. If you do this, you get that. In 2011, I was here when those so-called hard decisions were made and we cut hope scholarships and hope grants for others. At the time, we cut the grant for anyone who didn't have a 3.0 GPA which was the first time we'd ever tried to impose a GPA requirement on the grant. Now luckily, in the wisdom of this body over a couple of years, we took that back. But we were told at the time that the reason that we were going to lower the hope scholarship amount for those without the 3.8 for those without the 1200 SAT was not because we wanted to reward those with the 1200 SAT with more was that we didn't have enough to fully fund tuition for all those hope scholars for everyone. So we had to make choices. And it was the wisdom of this body to have that higher amount for those that had the higher GPA and the higher SAT score. I disagreed with that. I thought that there were different priorities that we should have focused on. But nevertheless, that's what was happening. But we never ever said. No one in this well said we want to differentiate between these groups because we think those with a 1200 SAT score should have it and those without it shouldn't. We said we don't have enough money to do it for everybody. So right now, we're only going to do it for those with the rigor. But there was always the ability to do it for all the other hope scholars to if there was money. That's what we talked about. That's why the factor rate was invented. And that's why the governor always had the ability to move that up and down depending on how the lottery was doing. Y'all the lottery's doing great. The other thing we did in 2011 was we changed the reserve requirement. So we are required to hold 50% of the prior year deposits. Right now, that's about $800 million. That's what we have to hold in reserves. That's great. We want to have reserves. We want to make sure that the money is there. Some of y'all may not know. We are currently holding $1.9 billion in reserves. Billion with a B. We're required to hold $800 million. We're holding $1.9 billion. That means we're holding $1.1 billion more than the law requires. I started out by telling you the difference between what the governor recommended and what we're doing is $26 million. That's 2% of the extra reserves that we are holding that we are not required by law to hold. 2%. Why would we deprive tuition coverage for all hope scholars? All of them have met a merit requirement. Every single one of them has a 3.0. Every single one of them is putting in the time and effort. It's that some of them don't have a 1,200 SAT score. We can debate the SAT all day long. But I will tell you that all hope scholars all across this state are worthy of our investment at them at 100% if we can afford it. Not just those with a 1,200 SAT. This is very personal to me. I was one of the first classes of hope scholars in this state back in the 90s. I was a good student. I had a 3.8 GPA. Higher than the 3.7 you have to have. This is the second time at least in this well that I've talked about my SAT score. I barely had a 1,000 on the SAT. Not because I wasn't smart. Not because I didn't work hard. There are just some things that come out in these tests that those that grow up in poor households or those like me that group in households with our college graduates. It's just different. We test different. It doesn't mean we're not going to get to college and kill it because ladies and gentlemen I did. I was worthy of my state's investment and there are kids all across this state that are worthy of this investment and I'll tell you. Those kids that don't have the 1,200 SAT. They're more likely to come from households that were there going to be the first person in their family to go to college. They're more likely to come from household incomes less than $40,000 in income. They're more likely to come from the rural parts of our state ladies and gentlemen. They are worthy. I'm sure there are some that are thinking states it's 5%. They need skin in the game. They've got skin in the game. You'll they're paying fees. They're paying housing. They don't pick up the phone at night and tell mom and dad that they max out the credit card again and they need more money because guess what? Mom and dad don't have it. If you don't have a lot, 5% is a lot. If it's $300, if it's $500 and you don't have it, it might as well be a million dollars. We have $1.1 billion that we don't have to hold and we are going to deprive the students of this state that have earned hope because we want to treat the zeal miller scholars a little bit better. Let me talk a little bit about integrity. In 2011, when we made those changes, when we changed, just to recap, before the changes in 2011, if you had a 3.0 GPA, you got 100% of your tuition and your fees covered at Georgia Public Colleges and universities. We changed the law that said that to say, if you have a 3.7 and you have a 12 hundred SAT, now you're going to have full tuition but everyone else will have a percent and we'll let you know. There were some of us here at the time that obviously didn't want this to happen at all but begged. At least can we grandfather in the students that are in high school now, the students that have been told their entire academic careers that if you have a 3.0, your tuition is going to be covered. Or even if we can't do it for the kids that are in high school, can we at least do it for the students that have already started college that are in their freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior year, where we've said, if you do this, we're going to cover you. No. That ladies and gentlemen was a broken promise. Again, we never promised these zeal miller kids you're going to get more. All we ever promised them was if you meet these rigor requirements, you're going to get 100%. And we told the other hope scholars that if we had the funds, we would make sure they had it. We never said we're going to treat you different for the sake of treating you different and that's what we're doing today. So again, I'm voting for this budget because 95% is better than 90. But I hope that those in this body that end up on the conference committee and those across the hall and those in the governor's office will take to heart what I've shared here today. And there's no reason not to spend it because ladies and gentlemen, Georgia did not approve the lottery for the sake of having a lottery. They approved it to support education. There is no benefit to education for piling up 1.1 billion in extra reserves beyond what the law says that we have to hold. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The lady representing the Stacy Evans has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does representative Jan Jones rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that a 5% of the tuition for a full load for two semesters at TCSG equals $120? That's a good question, lady. But I'm sure the lady has some insight into that. Is it not further true that after we revamped hope in 11 after the great recession that the reserve had fallen to around a half a billion dollars, we were burning a couple hundred million a year which was what led to the higher reserve requirement, the change to the zeal miller and regular zeal to protect hope for future generations. And that furthermore, we found that the TCSG enrollment dropped primarily of older adults who were taking courses not to receive a certification to go to work, but primarily because it was free. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. She was here and she voted and she certainly knows about policy and about our budget. So I'm sure that what the lady says is correct and I'm sure she believes that. What purpose is represented bird rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true no society can sustain itself if entitlement becomes the prevailing mindset of this society? And is it not also true a famous quote? The problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money. I'm sure the lady believes what she states. What purpose is represented stacey Evans rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stage inquiry. Mr. Speaker isn't it true that Georgians all across this state don't do things not only that they want to do but things that they need to do because they don't have 125 dollars in their checking accounts. I'm sure the lady believes what she says states. And further inquiry. State your inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Isn't it true that after we added a GPA requirement to the hope grant for the first time and enrollment at TCSG dropped 25% isn't it true that when we again lowered that GPA requirement that tens that thousands of students came back? I'm sure the lady believes that the statements she just made want to take one last inquiry. What purpose is represented Ramon rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that those who work in college counseling who try to help students finish out their college careers have found that students drop out sometimes because they could not afford their textbooks, would literally be as little as $50 and up to $500. I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks and certainly believes of what she speaks. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 167. The nays 1, this bill having receded requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. If I may, for all the members of the House, for our House budget and research office, we want to show you our appreciation and tell you how much we appreciate y'all's work, with the Sona amended budget or this big budget. I know y'all spend many, many hours working with committees, with your chairs and thanks to the chairs or the appropriations. We owe you a debt of gratitude and to you, Mr. Chairman, it's your first budget. It's a pretty good one too. You're doing great work and you've been dedicated for months upon months to do this work and you are appreciated. Let's show them our appreciation. Thank you. For what purpose is represented hatchet rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move the House bill 19 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Representative hatchet moves at HB19, House bill 19 be immediately transmitted to the Senate is their objection. Here he none, it is so ordered. For what purpose is representative house to rise? Power metric inquiry. Is it not true that our chairman did a wonderful, wonderful job on this budget and is it not true there's a lot of difference between an entitlement and compassion and this bill showed a lot of compassion to the people of this state. Thank you. I'm sure the lady thoroughly believes in what she speaks and we appreciate her work on the budget as well. We're moving on to afternoon orders at this time.
