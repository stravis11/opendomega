TRANSCRIPT
----------
Hello everyone. My name is Senator Colton Moore. I represent Northwest Georgia.
I appreciate that. Thank you.
I appreciate each and every one of you, thank you for coming to your capital today, I

was best for a country that we all live in. This is about protecting our children. This
is about protecting our freedom, protecting our rights. Congratulations to you. We need
more people like this young man in office. Lord, I'm praying very hard for my friend,
Donald Trump. You know that Lord. Now bless us. Give us justice. Help us God. In Jesus' name
And by the power of your Holy Spirit, amen.
My friends, I call this press conference today because we need to set the record straight
on a few things.
My fellow Senate colleagues have published a statement and they've recognized to their
constituents that we do have a problem.
Maybe they read in the paper, the AJC or the University of Georgia's poll that recognizes
that 83% of Georgians across this state recognize that what is happening right now with
District Attorney Fahny Willis is politicization.
That's what it is.
The most prestigious office in this state he calls and references me a grifter and a scammer.
My friends, I represent 200,000 hard work in Georgians and Northwest Georgia.
The people that I represent that duly elected me, they sweat hard for their tax dollars,
and they don't want their tax dollars funding this type of corrupt government power.
I challenge the governor to go to Northwest Georgia, find anyone working hard for their
tax dollars and ask them, do you want your tax money funding district attorney, Fannie
Willis?
You know, it's very disingenuous to say that, well, she only makes $120,000 a year and
that if we pull that away, we would have to pull that away from every district attorney.
Well, let me be more clear.
When I say defund Fannie Willis, I mean defund all of her Georgia State tax dollars besides
the $1 that we are constitutionally required to give her.
You see, this governor wants to elaborate that we have a separation of powers.
What we do, but any high school kid coming out of government class understands that we
also have a thing called checks and balances.
My role as a senator is to call a special session on behalf of my constituents and any
any Georgian who feels that their tax dollars shouldn't be going to Fahne Willis.
Because we, as a legislature, have no power to do anything until we are in session.
And that's why we must have session now because we must investigate Fahne Willis.
How in the world can my friends that call themselves Democrats and champion themselves
and criminal justice reform ignore the fact that half of the inmates at the Fulton County
jail have yet to be charged with a crime.
And there are innocent people who are dying of bedbugs in that facility.
How in the world can the citizens of Fulton County demand justice and not get it when
they see things like young thug and young slime going to the courtroom for a year and yet
to get through bondore and pick a jury, but yet this district attorney said she's going
to take down these political prisoners in six months.
The millions of dollars that are being spent, both federally and through the state of
Georgia and through local Fulton County tax dollars, are funding this type of corruption.
And what is so embarrassing, what is so embarrassing is Congress has gotten a head start and investigating
and defunding Fahny Willis way further ahead than we are here in the Georgia legislature.
Very embarrassing.
Those same senators also said 72 hours after the governor says that any machine can be hacked,
they say that we are the number one state for election integrity.
It's unbelievable.
What's also unbelievable is the constitutional crisis that we are in.
When I talk to my fellow Senator and they are afraid to speak out, because they are worried
that they are going to find themselves in the crosshairs of this rogue district attorney.
What happened to checks and balances, what happened to separation of powers?
You see, those Senators, they're duly elected to represent the 200,000 people that they
represent, but those 200,000 people are being disenfranchised in our Republic because
their senators have cowered down. My friends, I ask that we go forward and continue putting
pressure on these legislators because the legislative branch is the saving grace, but
it cannot take advantage of its extraordinary constitutional power until we are in session.
And I'm going to be open to any questions and all questions, but I have a few people,
Georgians who would like to say a few words. I want to start with you, Bruce LaVelle.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
It's truly an honor. It's really hard to come behind a young, is this guy incredible?
How old are you? 29 years old. Oh my gosh, that is so incredible.
Listen, I'm here on behalf of representing two close friends of mine.
Georgia is a friend of mine and of course y'all know Donald John Trump is a very
close friend also. So that in that order, let me tell you why. I'm a four-generation
Georgian. And when I look around and I've been blessed to travel the world, my
father was a retired sergeant major. He went on to the Lord. He's from New
and in Georgia. We traveled this great world and I was privileged to go to the
Far East, the Middle East, as well as this great nation. And it's sad to see what's
happening in this great nation. And I say that because we were the city that
landed the Olympics ladies and gentlemen, think about that. We were a city that
was too busy to hate. Listen carefully. Too busy to hate meaning Democrats and Republicans
came together. You know, my business here for 30 years, some of the news people, y'all
know me for years, y'all know my character. Everybody knows the LaVale's, okay? So when
I come up here and speak about our great state of Georgia, I'm very passionate about it.
I showed up to the sound with $34. And I met Maynard Jackson in the restroom at Cyclorama.
Here's the true story, at the urinals, yes, at the urinals, yes, and he looked over
and I said, wow, the manor Jackson, I was invited to the Land Association of Black Journalism,
yes, the conservative, yes, remember, Republicans, Democrats got along, okay, and he says, you
know now is the time to build a business, a black business especially, 1994 I had my
ribbon cutting, six years later I was a millionaire, and so when I, thank you, so when I see all
All the chaos when I saw the beautiful Atlanta with bout to lose through the riots and all
the other things and all the craziness going on.
We watched TV, we see what's going on, San Francisco, Oakland, New York and all across
the country, ladies and gentlemen, but let me tell you something, we're not short from
the same thing they're going through.
And how it starts right now, we have a DA right now who was born in Englewood, California
who was predominantly raised in Washington, D.C.
Now listen carefully guys, and the reason why we're here right now having this conference
and the reason why we're at now is because we have both sides of the aisle, watch this,
channel two listen carefully, that both sides of the aisle are infected with pay to play
in special interest, okay, that's why we're right there.
You can't govern when you owe favors, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
That's why you have a close friend of mine named Donald John Trump, who's in 60% polling
right now out of all the craziness they're throwing at him, okay?
Because he made an oath and he keeps constantly saying, I don't want your money, I don't
need your money, I just want to do what's right for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, from the State House, to the State Senate, to the Congress, to the
governor's mansion, all the way down to county commission, to the doll catcher.
Listen carefully.
The next ballot election, the next election we have, ladies and gentlemen, picked that
person who is she that's not tied to special interest.
It's very important because this is why we're in this mess right now.
And where I'm going with this, Mallory hooked me when I'm ready, when you're ready.
92% of Fawni Willis' funding comes from 44 states out of this country.
That means only 8% are fundraising in this community.
What does that tell you right there?
Now guys, this is serious.
Two years ago, I covered with Fox News, I went down to University Boulevard and this
Wendy's was still smoldering.
They burnt it to the ground.
Y'all know what happened.
All of these outsiders came in.
I spent three hours on the ground talking to the local people
because I used to mentor Carver High School down the road
along with Harper Hartra High School.
So I know this community.
And they said, well, Mr. Vella, we didn't do this.
These other people come from all over, burn this down.
And y'all know who burned that Wendy's down.
Y'all know who did.
They look like us.
They look like me.
No, no.
So here we are.
And by the grace of God, Atlanta was saved
because some few courageous conservatives stepped in
and said enough is enough.
There's no protesting 11, 12 o'clock at night, ladies and gentlemen.
I have never seen that.
OK?
And the reason why we had that is because we allow
wokeness to come inside our great city.
The city that was too busy to hate.
Listen carefully.
But I say this, instead of going on a witch hunt
on a perfect phone call, ladies and gentlemen,
we have never had an election in the nation's history
where the country was shut down and said,
we'll just send you a mail-in ballot.
Come on, somebody.
All the military people in this room,
including my dad, Alma uncles, who served from Korea,
World War II, all the way to Vietnam.
The absentee ballot was designed for the military soldier
and the people who were incapacitated.
So when you're an incumbent president like Donald John Trump,
who want more votes than the previous before.
I am one of those 80 plus million voters that you and everyone watching this that represent
this great movement.
And you come in here and say, well, wait a minute, I got more votes.
Let me call up some folks and question the election.
Okay?
Challenge the election.
questions you have mail-in ballots my father had a mail-in ballot he's been
dead four years how did that get mail to me come on somebody so you're gonna
tell me that the nation has never shut down in the history okay we all
agree to that you're gonna tell me if you won the lottery and I said well I
just put it in the mail no you will kill yourself to come down there and get
that lottery ticket. So to play around with a precious ballot and it was just
flowing around every it's it's okay to challenge the election. Ladies
you have the election was over. Let me call Brad up. Brad I know I won. I know
there's 11,000. Go back and look. That's called questioning. That's called asking
questions. When I think about that, I think about the great Reverend A.D. King, that was
my sister, Alvita King's daddy, who started the movement, ladies and gentlemen, and started
with Kentucky, okay, on housing. And all during that tenure, my uncles, who was Dr. Noel
Melville had a church down here in Second Avenue who all marched in the SCLC who all marched
to say, hey, we want to vote and to get persecuted and to be had their truck blown up, had their
houses threatened, their family threatened.
That's voter suppression, ladies and gentlemen.
That's voter suppression.
But here we are now, here we are now, a sitting U.S. president can't call and say, wait a
minute.
Wait a minute.
something's not right here but then you have a DA that runs on a campaign I'm
gonna get Trump I'm gonna get Trump now listen carefully guys I'm gonna get
you have a DA saying they're gonna run on a platform to get what if that was you
Rudy Giuliani good friend of mine known for years set on that courthouse
steps he told you whether you vote Democrat Republic or not this pindling
swings ladies and gentlemen and this could be you this could be your cousin
This could be your brother. This could be your mother. Right is right, wrong is wrong.
And if we can't as a nation question our precious voting processes. Who are we to judge other
countries? Who are we? I can't see for the stick in my own eye. That's scripture.
Great! Who are we? Now guys, we have the same thing going on in New York. We had the same
thing going on in Maryland. We had the same thing. And I'm going to tell you guys what I said
early in the speech. I'm going to sit down, Mallory. When you have elected official that
has consumed himself or herself in pay to play, listen carefully, ladies and gentlemen,
are compromised. There is some right across in that building right there, Democrats and
Republicans who are involved in pay to play. Senator Moore, that's why they're scared,
bro. That's us. Well, we can't do that, Senator Moore. Yeah, you can't because you're
by play to pay. You all see what's going on. So when you have a person that says I'm not going
to take your money, I don't need your money, let that be you. And ladies and gentlemen, I'm inspiring
the great men and women in this room. And if this gets out there, and I, it's to put your name
on the ballot and join the great America First Movement. America First Movement is for one blood,
one nation under God, not Republican, not Democrat, Angela, as you said, but one blood, one nation
under God. That's who we are. That's who we are. So watch this real quick and closing. And
I want everyone to listen to this very carefully. What I'm about to say, because this is going
to apply to everyone in here and everyone watching this video or the news tonight. Exactly.
if you if you're at home and you make yourself a cup of coffee and you walk out
and you look out your window and you see your neighbor's house being robbed
and looted and you sit quiet and you say why don't want to get involved that's
you right here that's you if you allow this craziness to come in this great
city that's been so good to us to allow the spirit to come in here and to
unravel everything that yes my good friend the mainer Jackson's the Andy
Young's Dr. Nolan Lavelle Dr. Adi King Dr. King everyone that helped build
this is this acceptable within by God we got to do something about it but
guess what funny we're saying the only one there's many more we want people
that care about Georgia we want people that love Georgia we want people that
get along each other how we landed the world stage that says, man, this city is too busy
to hate.
We got to bring the world stage to the Olympics here in Atlanta, Georgia.
The largest airport in the world.
The Great Morehouse, the Great AU Centers, the Great Spellman Colleges, the Great Georgia
Tax, the Great UGA, the West Georgia College, the Middle Georgia's, all the University
the great military bases that we have. I'm going to tell you like this, going forward.
And I share this because y'all know me. There's many people know me. The news, everybody,
my jewelry company for 30 years, everybody's wearing a watch, a ring, or something in this
community. And I don't want to call them names because y'all will come after them and
Bruce mentioned your name in the press conference and they'll try to terrorize them. But we know
who they are. How we amend this and how we fix this is that ballot, ladies and gentlemen,
we got to keep fighting. We got to early vote. We got to do everything we can. We got to
get the message out and say enough's enough. We don't want to lose our great city and
our great nation. God bless.
Good morning. Thank you all for being out here today. All right,
rights come from God and should we be questioning God's rights? I am Charlie
Spurred State Representative District 20 from Cherokee County. I am also the
chairman of our Georgia Freedom Caucus and it was started. The Georgia Freedom
caucus started about 18 months ago here in Georgia, and we were the first ones from that
was birthed out of the federal government in 2015 when the Freedom Caucus started at
the federal level.
With people like Jim Dement, Mark Meadows, you name it Jim Jordan, all of those guys
who are on the side of conservatism.
So that is how we started here in Georgia.
We were the first, and now we're in about 11 states, hope to be in a lot more states
in the next several months.
And we do a four-way test.
One is, does it grow government?
Does it raise taxes?
Does it increase regulation?
And does it infringe on personal liberties?
The most important of all.
The purpose of this press conference
is to petition the governor and our leaders
to call for a special session to defund and investigate
Fanny Willis.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
We have the power to provide oversight and if appropriate impeachment.
If we can charge a president of the United States of America on indictment charges,
I am telling you folks on the First Amendment, they're coming after you and me. It is only a matter
of time. The First Amendment is the cornerstone of our Constitution.
And we have the right to have the first amendment to say what we please.
So many others have said things they didn't want to give up their seat when they lost because
they said there was a fraudulent election.
And now our president of the United States said there was fraud or there was misplacement
of votes then we should not let him be indicted.
So I am thrilled that each and every one of you are here today.
You are warriors.
You are patriots and thank you ever so much.
We must keep up the fight.
I'm Jenny Beth Martin, the honorary chairman of Tea Party Patriots Action.
We are here today to write a wrong.
In the district attorney indicted 19 people for trying to make sure our election was free
and fair, that was wrong.
When she said people who followed the advice of legal counsel to ensure a free and fair
election were actually engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the election, she was wrong.
And she said people could not exercise their first amendment rights to free speech and
to petition the government for redress of grievances she was wrong.
And every single day that goes by, that innocent people have to prepare to defend themselves
in trial, that is wrong.
Attorney Fannie Lewis has abused her power of office for partisan political purposes and
that is wrong. Her wrongful prosecution, which I actually think is a persecution, must
be defunded and an investigation must ensue. And if that investigation leads to an impeachment
So be it.
The Constitution of Georgia gives the legislature the power of the purse.
The Constitution of Georgia gives the legislature the power to impeach.
The Constitution of Georgia gives the governor the power to call a special session.
Together, the legislature and the governor must call a special session and must write this
wrong now.
And in the meantime, we are not going to allow this district attorney's abuse of her office
to stop us from standing up for our first amendment rights.
We are going to keep speaking up, assimilating together, and petitioning our government for
redress of grievances.
We're going to take some questions.
I'm going to give the mic back to Senator Colson Moore.
If there's any from the media or the beautiful faces that are here, go for it.
Senator Moore?
Yes, ma'am. That's what we're going to continue to do. Absolutely. I got a hand in the back. Yes, sir.
When is anyone going to question this? I'm one of the people who saw fraud in hot county. I have to fill out an affidavit.
You want to know the governor who must be like OJ looking for Nicole's murderer. He hasn't called me. His people haven't called me.
be a state trooper has who called me my phone must not work it works for everybody
else but it doesn't work for the governor and then we got what's going on in
this county she is attempting to take away our election rights what are you
going to do and let's be honest what prosecutor is going to do the right thing
and let's get her right sir your your concerns are the same concerns that my
constituents have and that is why I'm pushing so hard for this special session. That's why I have
spent money and some of my fellow Senators districts reminding their constituents that they are
sitting on the sidelines calling themselves conservatives and not jumping into the action
because they are discounting the power of their office. They are elected to serve in a legislature
that has the oversight capability, but until they jump into the action and call for a special
session themselves, then, you know, we live in two worlds.
Sir, they won't do it until there's three times this room.
How many people are on your feed-in Facebook?
Is everybody who's out there?
And you see Trump, this Trump, that, oh, he's my guy.
Where are they?
There's so many of them.
But there ain't a thousand of us.
You know my co-pager.
Sir, we're going to have to move on to the next question.
Mr. Pritchard.
Sir, Senator, my question to you
is the state, the state Republican Senate caucus.
You have been called out.
There's been a lot of talk in the media.
You may be expelled from the caucus.
You may have broken rules sanctioned.
As the caucus met, have you received something official?
Are there rules that they claim you broke?
Do you think they're going to remove you
from the Georgia State Senate Republican caucus?
Well, I think that's a great question.
We do go into caucus behind closed doors, starting on Monday
for three days.
It'll be the first time that the Senate Republican caucus has met officially as a caucus since
this has went down.
My answer to your question and my answer to my fellow Republicans is make my day vote
me out of the caucus.
So I have asked that question to the majority leader, I have yet to get an answer.
They say they're still looking into that.
I think they're saying that maybe I'm impugning one's character, but I certainly think that
My character has been impugned on both sides of that.
So obviously, for me, this is much bigger
than my relationship with my fellow senator.
It's much bigger than the Republican party.
It's much bigger than President Donald Trump.
This is about basic fundamental First Amendment rights
to question the integrity of an election.
Remember, it took 19 days to certify the election results,
any reasonable person with common sense
seeing that there's 40,000 affidavits of fraud.
Sitting at the governor's desk,
those individuals have a first amendment right
to question that election.
So.
Hi.
How can I say something like that?
That's good, we'll say it again.
I think I will take a couple questions from the press.
If you'd say your name and who you're with, please.
Senator Moore, my name is Jeff Baamey.
I'm with the associated press.
How many signatures do you have on your petition
from Senators and House members?
So there's three. There's three total, which is very disappointing.
Our caucus, I think there's 20 something that signed on between the House and the summit.
There's Senator Brandon Beach, myself, and Representative Charlize Burrard, who you see here.
Very disappointing.
Sir.
Hold on one second, folks. We got another question.
any evidence that Penny will is could bring that might convince you that any of these suspects
are guilty or are not. Absolutely not. That's right. What I want to do in my investigation,
you know, there's a lot of corruption that seems very obvious. Why in the world did this
indictment come out hours before the grand jury ever concluded? There's a lot of that
have been indicted that feel that they were found themselves in the process and a very
corrupt way themselves and they're willing to come and testify, some of those that are
indicted. So, you know, how much coordination has she had with the Department of Justice
in D.C., you know, former speaker in Georgia Newt Gingrich claims that he believes that
Washington D.C. was calling Fannie Willis and saying expedite this indictment. Those
Those are the types of questions that the legislature needs to be investigating.
There is no evidence that I have seen that would suggest anything of the such.
And I don't know if you've all read the indictment, but when I read the indictment, it's the
most poorly written indictment that I think you could possibly have.
I mean, some of the evidence is nothing more than a tweet making a false statement.
Well, when somebody honestly believes that the election is stolen, is that a false statement?
No, that's a persecution of their First Amendment rights.
Right, all right.
Right, all right.
That may be your radio.
Part of the response from some of your fellow Republicans is the use of the prosecuting attorney's
qualifications commission.
Do you respond to that?
Yeah, absolutely.
I was the only Republican to vote against it.
And the reason why I voted against it was for very reasons that we stand in today.
This commission, right, is a bunch of unelected bureaucrats.
We as a legislature are giving them the power of the legislature to investigate and impeach,
and that's why it's being challenged constitutionally. So for all those legislators who say that
this is the saving grace. Now I certainly hope Fannie Willis is the first one to go before it.
But the commission has never met, and the law also states that once the commission does meet,
they have to establish rules, and those rules have to be approved by the Supreme Court,
so the time frame of which that can be done is up in the air. Whereas we know that we have
have the legislative authority to do the same thing
that prosecutorial commission can do,
because think about this.
How does a legislature legislate itself out of power?
It can't do that, constitutionally.
So sure, we have the power, we've granted it
to this prosecutorial commission,
but that means we've got the power to do the same thing
today, we just need a special session.
Good job, good job, good job, good job, good job.
We're going to continue to call,
or I'm going to continue to call,
and I'm sure other colleagues are as well,
to call for this special session up until we are in session.
And at that point, I will motion to amend the budget
and de-fund Fannie Willis and we'll have a roll call vote
right there on the Senate chamber.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
just like the representing 98 percent of the state doesn't agree with you, the special
section that's necessary.
Would you say that or would would when the president
from the media that was going to shoot out of the rest of the state and those lawmakers
who have made that decision?
Well, I would refraiser question to the Uniparty does not agree with me, but the constituents
of which they represent do agree with me.
We're happy.
We're happy.
We're happy.
We're happy.
We're happy.
We're happy.
Yeah.
Are you with the media, sir?
I know, sir.
We'll give another media question.
We'll come back to you.
Senator, just to follow up on my earlier question, if lawmakers themselves were to call a special
session, there are 102 Republicans in the House and need 1008 signatures.
How are you going to commit six Democrats as I met the decision?
Well, how did we convince Representative Misha Mayner to leave the Democratic Party and become
a Republican?
How did that happen?
to discount what is going on in Atlanta and to say that Democrats will never come across
as being very disingenuous.
Why am I not having an argument with Democrats who claim to be for criminal justice reform?
Why am I having this argument with my fellow Republican and that's what keeps me up at
night?
So the special session does nothing to eliminate the case.
The case would still continue.
The thing that the special session puts a check and balance on is it's able to defund it
hopefully, right? And then if you pull the money away, then Fulton County Commission and Washington DC
have to decide do we substitute all of those dollars? Does the Fulton County citizen think well my
neighbor on this side is getting robbed? My other neighbor on this side is getting murdered
and I don't see any justice in my community. Do I want my tax dollars funding this political
persecution or do I want my tax dollars taking care of justice? So that will be a question for them.
But what I also want to do, though, is take advantage of that investigative oversight
that we have, right?
The ethics committee of both the Senate and the House, under Georgia Code 28-1-16, has
subpoena power.
And I want to bring in Fahny Willis and other people in her office, in addition to many
documents that we need to see and investigate and inquire into the nature of, I would love
nothing more than to see some of my fellow senators, who are some of the best trial attorneys
in this state, cross-examine district attorney Fannie Willis in that session.
Okay, so I'm going to come back to you.
According to Katherine Echoberg, I can't pronounce her name properly, but she met with
a rapist group a few weeks after the election and she had come up with 384,000
and voters on the voter roll, and Rackensburg admitted to that sounds about right.
There was no further investigation, and allegedly, according to Catholic Echeverk, 67,000 of those voters voted.
That's about 14 to 15 percent of the people that are not eligible vote voted.
The news is not out there. I'll treat you to vote.
Do you have that information on hand?
No, sir, but the information that you give is very common.
I have received probably 50 letters in the last two weeks of people documenting what
they saw in the 2020 election to be fraud, and these are Georgians across the...
From Rapidsburg's own mouth, he never followed up with an investigation.
Two thousand years ago.
Sir, to answer your question, while all those things were horrendous in 2020, what I am
focused on right now is what has become even more horrendous, is where we are taking
political prisoners who are questioning the very things that you talk about, which is
taking it to a whole nother level of authoritarianism, and then something else, we'll talk about
at the rally here in just a minute if that's okay yeah yes ma'am. You know so we're
talking about authoritarianism and that's what we see right now taking these political prisoners
But what I think a lot of people in Georgia have missed is during the fish fry
Down at the eighth district. We had people who were escorted out
By armed police officers
For merely expressing their first amendment rights and wearing a t-shirt that said paper ballot, please
And this was at the direction of you know our governor to my understanding
Which is very disheartening very disturbing that we live in this state in this time
I'm going to take one more question from the media, and then we're going to have to go.
Are you with the media, sir?
Right.
Sir, can I ask you a question, and I'm going to make a point.
If we do not have a First Amendment right, and we do not have an election ability to
take political prisoners for questioning an election, the oath is meaningless.
So if the unit party, Republicans and Democrats, fail on their vote to follow the law beyond
the state of Georgia, what other measures do we have if we are taken over by enemies
for and the best in both parties to cancel our voice, who beyond the state of Georgia
has authority over the entire crew of that restaurant.
Sir, I'm just like you.
I don't have an answer to that.
And unfortunately, that's why it's so critical and important that we take action now.
Because once we lose these rights, we will never get them back, and there is nowhere else
to go.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's that, to the media, I will be available for interviews after
this.
To all of you, please join us at Liberty Plaza here at High New.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
