It is New Americans Day at the Capitol and I wanted to welcome the New Americans as well as the Coalition of Refugee Service Agenties here. About one in eight Georgia workers are foreign-born and that includes myself as well as colleagues in both parties. Many of them are here today if they would stand up if they aren't already standing up. And I personally wanted to thank you for being here, for taking part in our democracy in a way that so many of us in our ancestral countries would never ever be able to do because we weren't born into it or hold the wrong views. And this way I also want to recognize that what is a right for all of us is something that is both deeply held as a privilege as well as something that can be quite daunting because of the power that it holds both when it is there and when it is absent. So thank you again for being here. I hope you feel welcome and not totally scared the way I did when I was first at the Capitol and with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you and a great group to recognize. Thank you for doing that. Representative Anderson recognized. Oh, you're going to bring Chairman Gunter with you. He's a good man. Chairman Gunter and Representative Anderson are recognized. Let me prepare the microphone here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I would like to recognize a group we have here today that came all the way down from the farthest, most northeast, Nether regions of the state of Georgia. We have a group from Raven County. I believe they're over here to my ride. If y'all stand up and let us recognize you, we've got 22 people total, mostly students from Raven County High School to Luna Falls and Raven got in the Kuchis School, both the high school group and the Forward Raven Youth Leadership Group along with Mr. Rick's story and Mr. Justin Schutt, their shaperones today. So if y'all will help me in welcoming them to the people's house, thank you. Absolutely, welcome. Glad to have y'all come back soon. Remember to any bread, Thomas is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is Engineer's Day at the Capitol. I'd like to thank the American Council for Engineering companies for putting this together. Engineers combine creativity, ingenuity to make the innovations of Georgians enjoy every day. With 23,590 active licensed professional engineers in Georgia, the industry contributes almost 8.7 billion to our state annually and employs 34,000 people throughout the industry. Their work ensures that we have clean water, reliable power, safe buildings, durable roads and bridges. We have several engineers in the gallery today. They please stand up so we can acknowledge them for everything that they do for our community. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, without a yield of well. That concludes our morning orders. We're going to move on to the rules calendar. Move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 10191019? House Resolution 1019, by the way, of Saints of the 180th, Jasper's the 11th, Ridley, the 22nd and others, a resolution supporting increased protections for America's borders and for other purposes. This resolution haven't been referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Before I recognize, Chairman Saints to present the bill in his wisdom, the rules committee has allowed us to debate this question, pursue it to House Rule 33.3. Time will be allocated to those and to the presenter, the Chairman, the sponsor. We have a minority report and we have folks signed up to speak in favor of and opposed to the proposition. So with that, we will get it started. We'll ask Chairman Saints to present the bill. He must have got locked out when I locked the door as I guess. Sure. Chairman Saints is recognized to present House Resolution 1019. Members, if you will, give the gentleman in the well your attention. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That any room is empty. I can see it. If you have conversations going on in the chamber, you need to take them to the any room. Are members take your seats? Members, please take your seats. Chairman Saints. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, members, on the floor. The House Resolution 1019 is a simple bill that makes clear that Georgia is leading where our federal government is failing. They're failing to secure our southern border. They're failing to ensure the safety of our families all around this state and around this nation. And they're failing to properly address the drug epidemic that has been plighting our communities. House Resolution 1019 simply empowers our governor to provide the resources necessary in the state-led coalition to secure the southern border. With that, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take any questions if there are any. You have some questions I yield. The lady to your left, excuse me, I'm sorry. Minority will has a question represented part. I apologize, my bad. Not at all, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that Donald Trump explicitly caught for Republicans to vote against the bipartisan national security agreement border bill, even though it would have massively eased illegal immigration? I'm proud of President Trump's record of ensuring our border wall when those in the other party did not want it and did not find it necessary when President Biden called attention to our southern border a distraction from important items are facing our nation. I'm proud he led then and I'm proud that our state is now leading where our federal government is failing. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. Is it not true that Republican United States senators within the past week, they succumb to pressures from former President Donald Trump that stopped the advancement of a bipartisan United States Senate bill that would have sent billions of dollars to the border for security purposes, and which rather than actually fix the problem with bipartisan support, it seems Republicans at the federal and state level are now wanting to perpetuate a problem for political gain. Is that not true? Mr. Minority with, I think the bill presented in Congress is as flimsy as this tissue sitting before you, and I'm proud that our state is not going to let detraction and distraction from our federal counterparts take effect in ensuring that our state addresses in partnership with Republican governors all around the nation securing our southern border. Thank you. Gentlemen, yield? I yield for one more question. Thank you. He hit his button, missed first, so chairman Corbett to your right. Extremely recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. He hit his button, missed first, so chairman Corbett to your right. Extremely recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do, for a friend. Is it not true that instead of billback better, if we would put it back like he found it, would it be much better off? Is that not true? I think a lot of things could be better during the previous detracting the previous four years and going back to economic growth and prosperity. We face both in all Georgians and minority Georgians as well. We're all better off with the pre-buildback something. With that, Mr. Speaker, all yield to well. There's no questions. We have a couple of speakers on this bill, so the gentleman is yielded the well. Now we have 30 minutes allocated for those that are opposed to the bill. It's how the chair will allocate the time, so we'll start with those opposed, representative Ramon. Are you ready? The lady is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I rise before you in strong opposition to House Resolution 1019. I'm an immigrant. I am somebody who came to this country when I was seven years old and my parents and I have been living in Georgia ever since. This was all the way back in 2001. We were incredibly lucky, and the keyword here is lucky, that we were not snagged by an inefficient immigration system that we have not been fixing for decades. There are people that I personally know that have come around the same time that I have or before us that we're not as lucky. They have been doing everything right, just like we try to do everything right, and because they happen to be assigned to the wrong agent, happen to be assigned to the wrong office, happen to be assigned to a different judge. They're in a very, very different immigration status than mine. These are people that I love. These are people that I know. And instead of working to ensure that they no longer have to constantly live in stress and fear about what the next week is going to bring, and focus on contributing to the communities that they love and have thrived in, were worried about messaging for a male or this election cycle. Because here's the reality. Unlike the overwhelming majority of people in this chamber, I've actually worked on projects related to the border. Does that surprise you? It shouldn't. And as somebody who's done work related to the border, I can tell you and assure you that contrary to what you heard from this while right here, 10 million people are not flooding across our borders. It's physically not possible. Literally not possible. What we see at our borders is not what you guys are seeing on TV. Because remember, and we see this all the time in our profession, I can watch one part of a screen and completely ignore everything else. I can edit videos to make things look better or worse than they actually are. But here's what I did see at the border. That was a problem that was fixed. We had unaccompanied children coming to the border that were being trafficked. Right? And you know what this administration did at the very beginning? They fixed that problem. It was the first time a child didn't die in our custody in four years. Yes, children died at the border because of bad policies that were great for maleers, phenomenal for maleers. Amazing for political talking points. But children died. There were people that came in and fixed it. People whose names we will never know. So instead of talking about that, instead of recognizing, hey, things have become incredibly inefficient and dangerous and we need to fix it. We've seen deals on the table that I'll be honest with you or deals that I am completely opposed to. But deals that, for my understanding, people that want that kind of a border fix should have wanted. Instead they rejected it. Time and time and time again. But I will tell you this. We are not going to fix our fentanyl crisis. We're not going to fix our immigration crisis. We're not going to fix our quote unquote border crisis if we continue down this path. Because the other thing about this resolution specifically that concerns me, in addition to the fact that it tends to restate facts that are incorrect, is the fact that it is leading us down a dangerous road as it relates to our constitution, as it relates to the separation of powers, as it relates to our responsibility as a state versus as a country. I know that sometimes we end up so caught up in our political atmosphere that we forget there are real implications both legal and other implications for real people. But these things are real. When we start talking about mobilizing the National Guard in certain states against federal agents, that should be concerning. What precedent are you setting? I mean, imagine for five seconds that a different political party than your own controlled state that you care about, which is this one. And imagine that they had done that. Everybody would be rightfully up in arms. There is a reason we have the separation of powers. There is a reason we have this delineation of responsibility. And if we continue down this road, if we continue to escape, go people who all they want to do is provide for their families. Who, back in the day, used to come...

here, work on our farms and then go home because the border allowed for that, because our immigration system allowed for that. Now they can't do that. And they are forced to choose between providing for their families or letting them starve. And we have to choose as business owners and as farm owners to either let our crops die and not provide the services we promise our customers or we can fix this problem. So I hope, sincerely hope, that for a lot of you, you will rethink this resolution. I think it's dangerous. I think that it might be great for politics, but I think it's bad for people. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the law. The lady has yielded representatives Jasmine Clark has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues. Today I rise to speak to the people who constantly find themselves, their families and their communities in the crossfire of political warfare. When I ran for the Georgia State House of Representatives, I ran to support state policy that improves the quality of life for all Georgians. I ran to improve people's access to health care to protect reproductive rights, to improve our schools, things like that. What I did not run for was to carry water for the former president and his hateful rhetoric. I came here to be solution oriented and to push to policies that increase the quality of life for all in our state. That is why I cannot support a resolution today that attempts to prop Donald Trump up as some sort of hero. Under the Trump administration, there was no significant comprehensive immigration reform. Only talks of building walls and profiling anyone with brown skin or a Spanish sounding name as possibly being undocumented and likely being a criminal. I will not place on a pedestal a man who was responsible for one of the darkest days in our nation's history as a violent mob led an insurrection and an attempt to disrupt our democratic processes just because that man could not accept the results of an election. Out of this resolution, I will point out that the people in Congress that are more interested in actually solving the problem than kissing the ring of Trump have come up with bipartisan immigration reforms. Is it everything that I want? Absolutely not. However, it is a compromise that gives a little and takes a little, but it is more than what this resolution that we are voting on today provides. And this bipartisan bill, ironically, is supported by the U.S. Border Patrol Union. And to be clear, this union, this group of people, these are the same people that actually supported Trump in 2020. Even they say that this bipartisan deal is a good thing. So instead of voting for this resolution, which doubles down on hatred and divisiveness and elevates Trump as some sort of savior and will undoubtedly be used for campaign purposes to prop up mega-republicans and attack democratic candidates like myself, I will highlight and support bipartisan solution-oriented proposals that will actually get the job done. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Representative Becky Evans is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to House Resolution 1019. Although this resolution does not have the force of law, and even though we are here in Georgia and the Georgia House, we have no jurisdiction over the American border with Mexico or with Canada for that matter, I do want to take a moment to address the false narrative that Republicans are spreading. Although my colleagues are trying to build a narrative that they are the party for immigration management and border security, the facts here show that this is false. History and facts show us that time and time again it is Republicans that have failed to secure our border. By failing to consider comprehensive immigration reform. Let's go back to May of 2006 when Republicans controlled both the U.S. House and the Senate, writing in the hills to where it gave us the rundown, House Republicans passed an enforcement only bill known as the Sincin-Brenner Bill, and the Senate passed the bipartisan Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act. But both bills under Republican leadership were never-conferenced or never reconciled. Then in 2007, when Democrats controlled the U.S. Senate, the Senate debated the Kennedy Keele Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, they debated this bill for a month on the floor, but failed to overcome a Republican filibuster. Then Senator Biden was a yes vote for that legislation. In 2013, the U.S. Senate taking the lead again through the bipartisan gang of eight brought forward the Border Security Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act. This was a massive and comprehensive bill with 67 votes, but the Republican-controlled House refused to take it up. In 2018, the government shut down. After negotiations between President Trump and the Senate Democrats to pair dream or legislation with enforcement provisions, failed. There were several opportunities for securing the border, none of which compared to the most recent debacle that we just witnessed when President Biden requested funding for American allies facing the greatest wars and threats to their very existence, along with border security measures. Border security measures that included asylum reform, border wall funding, emergency border authorities, $48 million for fighting fentanyl trafficking, and asylum work eligibility. But Republicans said no. Now let's focus on what this resolution is asking us to do. We can all get behind increasing protection for American supporters and ending illegal immigration and smuggling and ending this fentanyl crisis. We cannot, however, support donating Georgia's resources to another state without sufficient consideration and debate. This resolution is not the path we should take, legally or politically or practically. Congressional Republicans have said, as you just heard, we can't support funding for Ukraine before we secure our borders, and Democrats said, let's deal. We've heard that this was a big conversation between Democrats to say, are we going to do this? But Democrats did say, let's deal. And over the last four months, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators negotiated a thorough and conservative approach to border security. But yielding to demands from former President Trump, who apparently doesn't see the illogic and trying to blame Democrats for the situation at the border, while blocking efforts undertaken by Republicans and Democrats to fix the situation, as the American people want and deserve. While the MAGA base may not notice that it is Trump and the Republicans that just blocked a solution, the rest of the American public will. And the Republican Republicans do unfortunately appeal to non-action versus taking action in the face of Trump's dictates, which keep us gridlocked when we should be working for the good of the people. In this latest deal, President Biden led on border security. The U.S. Republicans failed the American people. This act will do nothing to secure the border and I urge you to vote no on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representative Park Cannon is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am here against this measure and I ask you to vote against it. Do you know what I am saying? That is why you do not know what you do. I am proud of being a Georgian who speaks Spanish and loves Spanish speakers. That is why today I am asking to express my condolences to the Georgians who see how the government is used as a people of xenophobia is used. My fellow companions ask you how did this family arrive here? How? To immigrate. The estimated citizens of Georgia are essential that they know are values and respected and in this land that we all call home. No one deserves to live with fear or be persecuted by who they are. All deserve a free life of percussion and discrimination. The act of crossing the security and freedom is a fundamental human rights and reflects the fundamental values of what America represents. In our country we give the welcome to those who seek a better future, angelating peace and opportunities for them and their dear ones. The speed is a force and together we build stronger communities and prosperous when we will have our differences. The Scrucial Record that migration is a shared story with many in this nation and it is part of what we do great. At this crucial moment we must go to solidarity to support and protect those who seek security and refuge. Our commitment with justice and compassion is to extend our hands and friends to those who need it. Empendent de enbete de su origen o procedencia. So I ask you today, did anyone understand what I just said? There might be a few who understood who might speak Spanish in here. But for those of you who did not understand I ask you to vote no because you do not understand of which you are putting forward this measure today and I yield the well. The lady has yielded the rep well. Reps. En Campbell has recognized to speak to the bill. Reps. En Campbell. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I stand at the well to oppose HR 1019, a disrespectful piece of legislation that not only says political and cultural division but is chocked full of blatant campaign rhetoric which is against the rules of this chamber and misleading information about a serious, sentinel crisis. Not only is this resolution anti-American, it is loaded with hateful, anti-public safety, anti-government and anti-legal immigration policies. By taking 535 immigration actions over its first three years, I am proud to share that our President Biden and his administration has already outpaced the 472 immigration related executive actions undertaken in all four years of the former President's term. And partly as a result of these legal efforts, legal immigration is returning to and in some cases surpassing pre-pandemic levels, including refugee admissions on pace to reach the highs of the 1990s. A new border process seeking to discourage irregular arrivals has been adopted. These are positive changes that have been made. Temporary humanitarian protections have been extended to hundreds of thousands of migrants. And enforcement priorities have been focused on narrower categories of unauthorized immigrants. These are the facts about what is happening in America today. And combined, these changes have helped bolster the U.S. economy and reduce fears of seemingly arbitrary enforcement against removable non-citizens. In addition to completely ignoring the recent bipartisan congressional response to control illegal immigration, this resolution furthers misinformation about fentanyl. And yes, we all know that fentanyl overdoses tragically caused tens of thousands of preventable deaths last year. And many politicians who want to end U.S. asylum law claim that immigrants, as does this resolution crossing the border, illegally are responsible. A more accurate summary is that fentanyl is overwhelmingly smuggled by U.S. citizens almost entirely and sadly for U.S. consumers. Here are the facts. Fentanyl smuggling is ultimately funded by U.S. consumers who pay for illicit opioids nearly 99% of our U.S. citizens. In 2021, U.S. citizens were 86.3% of convicted fentanyl drug traffickers, 10 times greater than convictions of illegal immigrants for the same offense. More than 90% of fentanyl seizures occur at legal crossing points or interior vehicle checkpoints, not illegal migration routes. So U.S. citizens who are usually subject to less scrutiny when crossing but legally are the best smugglers. Unfortunately, the location of smuggling makes sense because hard drugs at ports of entity are about 97% less likely to be stopped than people crossing illegally between them. And just 0.02% of the people arrested by border patrol for crossing illegally possessed any fentanyl whatsoever. And these are the facts. And the government exacerbated this problem by banning most legal cross-border traffic in 2020 and 2021. Rather than put forward legislation to help solve this growing crisis and problem, sponsors of this legislation are engaging in fear-mongering, wasting our tax dollars and our time today with their presidential campaign politics. After collapse of a bipartisan border security bill, Republicans have flip-flop on the issue of national security, opposing their own painstakingly drafted solution because they want chaos at the border. And rather than pull Georgians together, this resolution seeks to divide Georgians and Americans. And on this new American day at the Capitol, I want to reassure our newly immigrated citizen guests today that you are welcome here in this chamber. Georgians, sponsors of this bill, could have spent their time wisely contacting their elected representatives in DC and encouraged passage of the bipartisan Senate bill instead of publishing this resolution. And finally, I want to share a little of my personal story. I was born in El Paso and with personal family experiences from the Texas border. And this is another area of the immigration story that is being overlooked in this resolution. First, businesses and coalitions in Texas support legal immigration. And new research from the economic contributions of immigrants in El Paso was released this year by Texans for Economic Growth, a statewide 145-plus member business coalition powered by the American Immigration Council in partnership with the Borderplex Alliance and the Texas Association of Business, which underscores the crucial role that legal immigrants play in Texas' sixth largest city. And from the report they state, El Paso has always been a city of immigrants. Immigrants in Texas contribute billions to our GDP. They help drive our economy and create jobs for all Texans. In El Paso, immigrants make up a large part of the workforce. They are our teachers, our doctors, our lawyers, and our business owners. They're an integral part of our city and our economy. Immigrants are a key part of our workforce and they are positive to our city, our state, and our nation. Today I remain proud to support our American President Joe Biden and I'm committed to working together to build bipartisan positive legal immigration programs, policies, and infrastructure that address legal and illegal immigration. And I urge everyone in this chamber to stand up for America and vote no on this resolution. Thank you. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. That completes those opposed. Now we have those in favor that will speak in favor. You will have up to 30 minutes. Governor's floor leader, Representative Will Wade, is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Wade. Thank you, Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. I'm Paula Georgians and fellow Americans. I rise today to tell you why I believe this is an important resolution. And why Georgia should support the efforts in Texas at the border. The number one responsibility of our federal government is to execute the law and keep Americans safe. Joe Biden and DC Liberals have failed to live up to this responsibility, which is why we need to be united to defeat this issue and not working against ourselves. Because of the failure in DC, it's unfortunate, but every state is now a border state. More than 8.5 million illegal immigrants have crossed the border since Joe Biden became president. Governor Kim has visited the border five times and spent time with our National Guard Troops station there. These are our fellow Georgians, folks. The Georgia National Guard has maintained a continuous presence at the U.S. Southern border in Texas since 2019, which also includes a senior officer, one of our very own major generals. Currently conducting aerial surveillance of the Southern border, which allows us to cover more ground and notify border patrol agents of any illegal activity to help in the effort to do what to execute the law. Under Governor Kim, Georgia joined the American Governor's border strike task force. A task force that was created because the federal government has failed to do its job. This is formed to increase collaboration, improve intelligence, invest in analysis, combat human smuggling, and to stop drug flow in our states. Governor Abbott and the state of Texas has Georgia's full support. States have a right of self-defense. These are some of the threats that we are now dealing with as state legislators in this state and in other states across this country. The deadly drugs seized at the border just in November of 2023, over 1,700 pounds of fentanyl, nearly 16,000 pounds of methamphetamines. 169 people on the terror watch list were encountered at the Southern border just in fiscal year 2023, an all-time record high. Fentanyl seizures just in Georgia due to the borders not being secured. In 2022, fentanyl seizures totaled 13,063 grams and 2,541 pills were seized. That's what we seized. What's still out there, folks? In 2023, those seizures totaled 20,251 grams to 7,000 gram increase and additionally 991 pills were seized. This is a national security issue, folks. This is bigger than just immigration. This is about the safety of our children and our grandchildren and our future generation. I support Governor Kimpin his effort and we must make sure that we send a resounding message that we believe in the rule of law and that we want to protect our fellow Georgians and Americans. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, as you did well, Chairman Jasper is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I rise to speak in support of House Resolution 1019. Thank you, floor leader, for all those facts that you put along with it. I'm proud to support our Governor who stood with 12 other governors. Two weeks ago recently in support of Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, in defense of their border. To find folks that I'm honored to represent, they're concerned, they're outraged and they want concrete action to curb the invasion of our counties and their southern borders. It is a fact that millions of people across our border illegally in the past few years. The Biden administration has stood by his cartels and others have human traffic and untold number of immigrants. Including many of them in modern day slavery. These cartels have also been an unbelievable pipeline of illegal drugs, toxic drugs that have killed people in your community and mine. My concern was very concrete at the other day when I saw a video of who I felt were very military looking Chinese men walking into our country. They were joined by Middle Eastern men who were certainly not from Central America. The current administration has turned a blind eye to what these illegal immigrants might do to our country. I can foresee untold sleeper sales that will attack our country, create new gangs in our state and further push drugs into our community. As a resolution clearly states, Texas has the right in our national constitution to protect their border. While then protecting their border, they protect our country and our state for the scourge of illegal drugs, slavery and whatever it brings with it. I like most of the people in this room as a descendant of an immigrant, a legal immigrant that came here to be a part of something great. And as my constituents have no problems with legal, logical immigration policy that maintains a secure border, I will agree they need to do reform in DC. But I want to say again, I recognize and support Governor Kim in his actions to support our neighbors in Texas and assist them in protecting our nation's border in our state. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you are the well, Chairman Petrie, you recognize to speak to the bill. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wasn't going to speak today, but I've heard so many things that I felt like I felt compelled to speak to. First of all, let's take up this issue of this week's U.S. Senate bill that failed. All right, first of all, I want everyone here to recognize something. You can Google this if you'd like. Section 212F of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. My friends, the President of the United States already today, right now, has absolute authority to restrict or suspend entry into the United States by proclamation. Okay, just look that up. This is an issue I'm pretty knowledgeable. My friends, first of all, if you really believe passing a new bill on it to try to keep illegal immigrants out of this country would be enforced by the Biden administration, well, you're living in fantasy land because they're ignoring all of our illegal immigration bills today. Having said that, let me tell you more about this bill. The bill and the Senate that failed due to Republicans rightly ignoring it. First of all, it was a complete hoax. What it did was expand the authority to allow bureaucrats to award asylum without even using judges. There's a multitude of reasons. You can look at the funding, how little was really about immigration, and how much of it was moreover about the borders of other nations across the globe. Let's just get our facts straight on that. There's been some comments made about national security. I want to mention to you. I just sat there at my desk, Googling, looking up a few things, three recent articles. These are all from February. Pakistani illegal immigrant on the terror watch list. I'm sure I can read this. Given free day of release in U.S., February 9th, Fed's now Afghan illegal immigrant on terror watch list, February 13th. Illegal immigrant admits past terrorism ties after crossing border memo shows as February 8th.

My friends, this is an issue of national security, it's an issue of public safety. This is a real issue. Listen, I heard some conversation in here where we oftentimes misuse the language. The topic here today is illegal aliens. It is not immigrants. Okay, there's a huge difference. Immigrants do not require amnesty. And so immigrants are not the conversation today. The topic is illegal immigration, illegal aliens. So, you know, we talk a lot in this chamber about human trafficking, right? We pass a lot of bills. We talk about human trafficking. We talk about fentanyl, 100,000 deaths a year from fentanyl. We talk a lot about that. But it seems like we don't care that almost all of that fentanyl is coming across the border. Human trafficking, how much of that is coming across the border? A great deal of it. We talk about crime. I mentioned to you about three weeks in here, the almost 1600 criminal aliens with ice detainers alone. That doesn't mention, that's not all of them, just those at ice detainers, in the Georgia Correctional System for violent crimes. We talk about housing in here. We talk about housing, workforce housing, all the time, don't we? And yet 10 million people have been allowed to move into the country illegally. How does that affect housing? We talk about all these things that are important to the people we actually were elected to represent. And we don't recognize shame on us if we don't recognize how this issue today affects those people that we represent. Mr. Speaker, I've heard a lot today. I'm going to leave it at that. I mentioned the other day, 67% decrease in deportations of criminal aliens by the Biden administration. I've heard my friends on the other side of the day talk about how important it is that they deal with border security in this country. And there's not a person in this room, not one. Not a person in this state, not a person in this country that believes that is true. The first thing this president did when he took office was make that border less secure, and everybody knows it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Gentlemen, yielded the well. Representative Hilton has recognized and speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let's make a no mistake. There is a humanitarian crisis at our southern border right now. And this is the direct result of the Biden administration's actions. Day one, trying to end the remain in Mexico, beginning a catch and release policy. They're actually fighting against state's efforts, Texas' efforts to implement policies to secure our border. A nation without borders is not a nation at all. It places Georgia citizens at risk. It places all of us at risk. There's been a lot of talk about Congress. Congress has passed all the laws they need. We just need an administration who is willing to actually enforce the laws that we already have in place and not work against them. There's been talk about fentanyl. 1,500 Americans, 1,500 Americans die every single week from fentanyl overdose, and that's getting worse and worse under the Biden administration. Everyone in this room has been touched by it. My family had family members in the state of Ohio, 18-year-old young man, bright future, football player, incredible student, like a bad dose one night, overdose on fentanyl is now dead. It touched our family. It touches all of our families here in this room today. But this is a bipartisan issue. There should be no debate on this. This became an issue when mayors of Chicago, mayors of New York, mayors of every major city across our country have reached out to the Biden administration and it said, stop, reverse it. What are you doing? This is arming us and our citizens. Democratic cities have woken up to the issue and said enough is enough. But why is this important to us in this room here today? We live in one of the most diverse, greatest states in this country. I have the distinct honor of representing one of the most diverse districts in our state. My district is comprised of hardworking Asians, Indians, Hispanics who have all come to Georgia and done it the right way. And what the Biden administration is doing is a slap in the face to them who have come here and done it the right way. And I urge you to vote yes on House Resolution 1019. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, as you did the well, Chairman Carpenter is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Speaker. I'm sick and tired of this crap. I'm gonna vote for this resolution because the federal government continues to wet the bed at the border. It is ironic that the Democrats at the federal level have decided to make a deal on this issue. When in fact, there was a deal seven years ago on the table that would allow the DACA students in this state a pathway to citizenship and they chose not to take it because they did not want to protect the Southern border. Neither side on this issue wants to solve it. I have been working tirelessly for five years on legislation to educate these individuals. So federal government fixed the border and my friends in this room helped me show these individuals that we see your value and that we know Georgia's a better place with you. Protect the border. General, as you did the well, representing Martinez is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To quote my colleague, I'm sick of this crap. All right. We have rules on our language. So let's keep it where it should be. All right, take it. I wasn't ready to come speak to this bill just today, but you don't want to get a Latino fired up. Very, very impressive, Representative Cannon. I know Spanish too, but I'm not gonna pander to my community. I respect this body. I respect the state. And in this country, we speak English. My parents came here from Cuba. You guys know, I take this very personal. Many years ago when I was a boy, and I support immigrants. My parents waited in line to get that green card to follow the American dream. I was pointing Puerto Rico. You guys know that? They did it legally. Legally, legally. I love my immigrant. I got a lot of immigrants, including my family, plain friends, but they're here legally, legally. Let me tell you what's going on in the border right now. Just in the month of December, just in the month of December. You guys remember back in the day, I'm sure you all know, that my deal, boat lift, burial, Cuban folks came from Cuba. In Miami, I was a young boy when those burial, a boat lift, Cubans came, boats, 90 miles from Cuba to keep west, 100,000. That was a wave. That was a wave. That was huge back in the day. That was huge for the Miami-Dade County community. You know what the numbers are now? Just in October of 2023, just in one month, 240,000, just in one month, and counters at the border. November, 242,000. Remember Cuba, in a span of years, 100,000. In December, we broke it all time record, December, two months ago. 300,000, 200,000 illegally. Now I'm gonna tell you something, these are not my Latino friends that are the only ones that are coming in that border. These are not the only ones. These are not the Hispanic population. We got in 2023, we got 24,000, overall encounters coming from China. China, coming from China. 21,000 of those, 21,000 of the 24, are single adults. They're not little kids, they're not moms. There's a single adults that are coming. So far this year, we got two months, two months into 2024, 9,000, overall encounters from China, just China alone, 9,000 out of those, 8,000, 8,000 are single adults. I wonder what they're up to. I wonder what those single adults from China are up to. We don't know, we're gonna only guess, but those are encounters, we're there not being checked. Mr. Speaker, I come up here, I wasn't ready to speak, but I come up here in support of House Resolution 1019, because let me tell you, as a Latino, have been for over 50 years. I speak to my friends, you know who's, for that, you know who's against illegal immigration? You know who's against illegal Hispanic community? My people, because like my parents, they waited in line, they did it the right way. They did it the right way. They don't like somebody just all of a sudden skipping the line, how would you like it if you're standing in the lunch line? And you stood there for about an hour, and all of a sudden somebody cuts in front of you. You haven't had it to win yet. Well, that's how Hispanic feels. The ones that came here legally, and they follow the laws, this is the country of laws. If we don't obey our laws, we're done. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you. Gentlemen, as you did the well, I'll remind all members, every one of us. I did not think the gentleman's comment was disrespectful, but the rules of this house require us not to call a member of this house by name. And I expect the members of this house to comply with the rules of etiquette in this house. We debate these very strong, we all have very strong feelings about issues that come before us. So I ask every member of this house to comply with those rules as we go through the next 20 days of this session, or since we're all on notice, your time at the well will be suspended. Fair enough, we do have a minority report, but first, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none, the previous question is ordered. Now we have a minority report. Whip part, you have up to 30 minutes to present your 20 minutes. I was giving you extra 10 minutes there. Man, I like you a lot, but you only get 20. You have 20 minutes to present the minority report. Whip part. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I will apologize ahead of time for some of how my remarks may come across. This is ridiculous. What a waste of time that we are on legislative day 20, debating a resolution of the majority of the party, the main point of which is to condemn our current president on lines 39 and 40. What a shame that this is the priority of the majority party, essentially because the governor I hear is having a press conference at three o'clock today and wants us to do his will and furthering his politics as opposed to addressing the real challenges that Georgians face today. Now, as I had asked in my first question to the sponsor of this bill, is it not hypocritical to say that there is this huge problem at our southern border and yet at the same time prevent any sort of real bipartisan action in Congress to send billions of dollars for enforcement purposes because the twice impeached president Donald Trump commanded the Republican Party to do his bidding. You know, for me, growing up in Georgia, I had a lot of family members who are Republican. But not today's Republican Party. This issue is yet another reminder that today's Republican Party that there does not seem to be patriots, that there does not seem to be men and women of courage willing to stand up to a dictator to do what's best for this country, to do what's best for America and protect our southern border. Just like Republicans spewed lies about Democrats not caring about public safety, lies about how we all want to defund the police. Yet again, more lies in that Democrats don't care about the southern border. That Democrats want to invite illegal immigration when there are physical actions taken, yet ignored clearly by members here in this body, by talking heads out in the media because they want to put politics and the pursuit of power before the best interest of Americans. That, to me, is a shame and a reminder of what we as Georgians and as Americans need to do this November to ensure we are electing good men and women who will put America and Georgia first, not a twice impeached president above all, above all ours. Now, again, from my perspective, it seems very clear that Republicans here in the state house and in Congress are more interested in playing politics than supporting real solutions at the border. And let's look at history. Every time a border solution has come up before Congress over the last 25 years, it's the Republican Party that has stood in the way. Recognizing that states and states across the nation are reckoning with an increase in illegal immigration at 2019 levels under, again, twice impeached Donald Trump, President Biden and bipartisan United States senators, delivered a tangible, negotiated, and tactical solution to the Senate and the House of Representatives via the National Security Agreement. The Biden administration and Senate negotiators who crafted this agreement are providing Americans with a serious opportunity to address border security and make progress on fixing elements of our broken immigration system. Yet again, it was twice impeached Donald Trump, who directed MAGA Republicans who apparently seemed to be more and more members of this body, directed y'all to kill the toughest and fairest reforms to secure the border in decades, because he thinks it will help him politically. That bill has picked up support across the political spectrum, including Trump's allies like the Border Patrol Union, who endorsed Trump's campaign for President twice, along with the Chamber of Commerce. By Republicans now withdrawing their support for immediate immigration reform in the National Security Agreement, which included the bipartisan immigration deal, Republicans are exacerbating the immigration issue which creates real harm for American citizens and our global allies. The adverse effect is that Republicans doing this will increase dependency on public assistance by undocumented migrants by refusing them to grant work authority. House Resolution 2019 tells a lie. This resolution that y'all are jamming through the legislative process tells a lie. In 2023, the Biden administration used previously appropriated funds to continue strengthening infrastructure along the southern border. To truly solve the border challenge, we must change our silent immigration systems and appropriate more funds for our Border Patrol officers. And yet, Republicans are actively engaged in blocking efforts to provide any solution because increasing illegal immigration gives them a political advantage even though it causes real harm to border states. Rather than focusing on tangible actionable bipartisan solutions, Republicans would rather bow down to re-elect a twice impeached man named Donald Trump who says he will be dictated only on day one. What's happened to y'all's party? Is that where y'all are taking this country? Is that where y'all want to take this country? Unacceptable. Again, over and over and over again by y'all's actions, you demonstrate politics over people, power over the best interests of we the people. Republicans, y'all have made it clear as to how you want to proceed on this issue and many others. How long will y'all continue to follow this twice impeached demagogue to the detriment of this country? Democrats have put forward a serious solution to this problem. And yet again, on this issue and like so many others, as a Democrat, I proudly and warmly welcome y'all to join us and bipartisan solutions for the state of Georgia and here for our country. Now, I want to walk through this resolution a bit to go through a few provisions I found concerning, to say the least. Let's look online 21 to 24. I encourage members to look up what Article 1, Section 10, Class 3 of the United States Constitution says and whether or not the United States Constitution acknowledges the state's sovereign interests in protecting their borders. That's new to me. I cannot believe that Republican members here in this body are misconstruing here in this resolution what the United States Constitution is saying. The state of Texas has declared an invasion and it's invoked its Constitutional authority to defend and protect itself. For me, that's reminiscent of succession of the formal Confederacy. You don't like what the federal government is doing so y'all are going to do whatever it is that y'all want. Now, as Georgia being a part of the former Confederacy, I hope today's Republican party that controls this entire state and all three branches of government isn't manifesting a new Confederacy. That is engaged in efforts that the former Confederacy engaged in. Again, we have a federalist system of government in which states and our federal government should be working in cooperation for the best interests of our country. Not to politicize critically important issues along with the safety of American lives that are at issue here. Now, in this resolution, it mentions Operation Loan Star in which I'm sure that the members here in this body who vote yes support that operation, Operation Loan Star. Let's take a look at what this Operation Loan Star does. Operation Loan Star is causing massive human rights violations. Whether you want to call them immigrants or aliens, these are people. How many times do I hear from members in this body about Jesus, about loving your neighbor, and yet in a heartbeat for political gain, you will dehumanize people. Treat them worse than animals in this Operation Loan Star, denying water to people in humane traps. Pregnant women having miscarriages, five people drowned in a week in the name of border security. Separating families is what today's Republican party is all about. Separating families in the name of border security. Is that what you all think will make America great? Let's talk about fentanyl. Did you all know that only 10% of fentanyl is actually coming through Texas? 10% whereas 90% is coming from other states. I agree with my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle. I look forward to doing everything possible to stop the flow of fentanyl. But let's not misconstrue the facts for political gain. Let's take real action to address these issues for the benefit of those we serve. Now, I remain increasingly alarmed as demonstrated by this bill, along with other pieces of legislation that have been introduced and are being heard in committee, that demonstrates xenophobia, a hostility to immigrants, a hostility to refugees and asylum seekers. Are y'all all talk and no action when it comes to your faith? Do you leave your faith at the door before you walk into this body in pursuit of your politics? And every effort possible for y'all to maintain power? That as I've mentioned before is unrepresentative of our great diversifying state? The shame. The words we use, especially as leaders, have an impact. I recall during the outbreak of the pandemic, the worst public health crisis in this country's history, Republican leaders including the twice impeached President Donald Trump using the term China virus. By scapegoating Asian Americans broadly for a virus that killed more than a million Americans in less than two and a half years, that led to a spike of hate crimes and violence and discrimination against Asian Americans. Words have power. And our voters have to understand the power that they have to hold our elected officials accountable. So long as we remain a democracy, it is we the people who maintain control and it's ultimately we the people who will determine the future of our state and our country to ensure we are not going backwards, to ensure that we are embracing our diverse future, embracing everybody who makes this country great, as opposed to attacking others simply for political gain. Now, I'll close with this. I'd like to bring you all's attention to lines 28 to lines 30, where it says the American people continue to suffer due to an adequacy of actions taken by the federal government and so it falls upon other public servants to speak against such injustice and to act decisively to rectify it. You know, when I first read this language, what it reminded me of was Georgians. Georgians today who are suffering from the failures of today's Republican party to address health care in this state. I know and unfortunately I remain surprised at how easily mistruth and lies are spread here in this body. I've been told that for more than 10 to 15 years Medicaid expansion, the Affordable Care Act has been demonized by the Republican party. And so more time is needed to get members to come across on the issue. We need more time to ensure Republicans aren't going to be primaryed this March in just a few weeks. So we can't take action on this issue because our politicians matter more than the hundreds of thousands of Georgians who continue to suffer by the failure of Republican politicians here in the state of Georgia. And so just like this resolution calls upon other public servants to speak against such injustice and to act decisively. I call upon the people of Georgia to stand up and speak against such injustices and to vote this November to rectify such injustice that continues to be perpetuated by today's majority party. For all these reasons and more I urge members of this body to vote against this terrible ridiculous resolution HR 1019 and with that Mr. Speaker I will yield the wealth. The gentleman has yielded the well that concludes the Montaure Report. Now we will have 20 minutes for the chair's time. Chairman Jake Collins is recognized. Speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I won't take all of the chairman's time. I'm going to yield that in just a few moments. You know, ladies and gentlemen, I come from a long line of plain spoken men and women not well spoken men and women. So I won't spend a lot of time down here in the well, but I do want to say this. The Public Safety Committee and Homeland Security Committee heard this resolution last week and we voted it out. An unsecured border is a clear and present danger to the public safety of this state and to every state. I dare say that when most of you go home in the evening and you settle in, you lock your door because you want to keep your home safe.

your family safe. This situation at the border has become a crisis, a national crisis, a federal crisis, and something has to be done about it. I'm glad to stand here today and support our governor and support the efforts of this state to help secure that border, to make our community safer. You know as a funeral director that's what I do as a profession. That's how I make my living. There are several other members of that profession that are here today that can also speak about the rise of fentanyl this. It is unbelievable how many deaths that we see in our communities from fentanyl. We all know that fentanyl is manufactured in China and Mexico and to believe that those two countries don't funnel that stuff into our country and our state. You live in a pipe drain and to believe that an unsecure border has no impact on fentanyl and illegal drugs coming through this state. You're living in a foothold's paradise ladies and gentlemen. It is true the Republican Party does support law enforcement. We do support public safety. We do support public policy that protects our friends and neighbors and minority communities that protects our friends and neighbors in rural Georgia and North Georgia and all across this state. We do and we welcome you to come to our party and help us support those initiatives because yes we are guilty of public safety initiatives in our party. I also want to say that if we all got up today we walked down the sidewalk here and walked a few blocks over to the federal courtroom, the federal, the Russell Federal Building. You know before we get in that that federal building we would be scanned. We may have to produce an ID if we win the certain areas. We're checked for weapons, we're checked for drugs. That's a federal piece of property. But if you want to walk across our border at any time, simply walk across. We're not betting these people. We're not taking any kind of action to make sure that organized crime is not coming across the border. We know it is. All this resolution is doing is simply supporting our governor and his efforts to secure our border. My friend from the coast represented Petri was right when he said his remarks earlier. Before I yield a balance in my time I do want to quote a president who I thought did a heck of a good job when he was in office. He said we must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal immigration. That was President Bill Clinton. Mr. Speaker I yield the balance of my time to the author of the bill of the resolution. The gentleman is yielded the well. Kevin Sains is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you my dear colleagues. A colleague a couple of speakers earlier ago was speaking a different language but it wasn't Spanish. It was liberal lunacy enclosed trying to elevate the prejudice that has encapsulated within the current policies highlighted by the minority party. A right to life without prosecution was one of the comments and that is true. Every human, every citizen in this nation has a right to life and there's no further detractor of life than the 1000 immigrants who have lost that life in the dangerous plea to cross illegally our southern border and they did so because the false narrative instituted by the party in charge in a federal level that there is hope that is not there. Another quote was that immigrants add to a stronger community. On that I can agree. Immigrants do add to a stronger community. We have a wealth in this state of legal immigrants who contribute to this state's benefit economic prosperity one of which being my mother which I would like to tell you the highlights of her story coming to our nation. She was she married my father in Costa Rica. He came back to be a cop in South Florida where she had to spend on a cop salary $30,000 to become a legally recognized resident of this state of this nation. There is no one who it insults further to say that our illegal immigration policy is combined with our legal immigration policy than the legal voters legal citizens in this state because they are the ones that have paid the biggest burden by our failed system. My dear friends on the comment that Georgia is not a border state. I will say that I am proud to represent Georgia's border the beautiful coastal line of South Georgia. However every state in this nation is a border state when it comes to the failed and broken Mexico U.S. border. This bill purely gives us an ability to ensure that the humanitarian issue the public safety issue that is addressed here is taken care of and with that I will yield the remainder of the time to representative Daniels. Gentlemen as you did the well representative Daniel has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We've heard a lot today from the Democrats in this chamber that they view the action we are taking today as putting politics before people and somehow that what we're doing is just an attempt to grab political control but I would like to remind them that Republicans are already in control in the state of Georgia and so while they're made for TV speeches might sound good on social media which we know we'll see later. It does not change that they're rhetoric on this and other issues. It's just a paragraph to gain control themselves. If the Democratic Party views us as simply being partisan when we stand up for Americans well then their voters need to take notice and unsecured border is dangerous for all Americans including those who have come here legally. I had a family member killed by an illegal alien in 2012 and there was no avenue for justice. I understand that the stakes at the border have never been higher and with record high national debt American taxpayers should not continue to be burdened with paying for illegal immigrants when we cannot even adequately provide health care through the VA for our veterans but if the Democrats don't care about our veterans how about our students. Democrat mayors have closed public schools to house illegal immigrants and depriving students of their fundamental right of all backgrounds to equality education. This is simple and open border will only continue to put Americans last. Thank you Mr. Speaker. The lady has yielded the well that concludes our remarks on House Resolution 1019. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the bill. Chair here's an unreported committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. What purpose does Chairman Chokus rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Yes, Mr. Speaker is in a true that all this talk about the closing of the borders is well speaking as of my grandparents were immigrants to this country and we have many people in this chamber who have immigrated from other countries and they need to look at the record of those countries as far as immigration. I don't think that there is another country in the world and that allows an open border to this degree and I can speak as and my ancestral home is Greece it has closed borders most of the borders if not all the borders in Europe have closed borders. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Anyway I support this legislation and I challenge our members to name a country that has open borders. Thank you. Good inquiry and I'll agree. Chairman Bonner for what purpose do you rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that in 2021 I had the opportunity to travel with Governor Camp to the border to visit with our national guard troops that are currently serving there and during the course of that visit we had an opportunity to hear from the customs and border patrol and we got to witness firsthand the horrors that are taking place in the border with bringing fit and all in and smuggling humans across our border. Sure the gentleman knows what he speaks he's the proud member of the guard and I know he's traveled to that border as well for what purpose does represented gamble rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that according to the daily signal more have been caught illegally crossing the southern border in one year of the Biden presidency than the entire Trump presidency. I don't know anything about daily signal but I'm sure the gentleman believes that. What purpose does representing represent the main arise. Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry. Is it not true that yesterday I presented in the education committee House Bill 127 that supported legal immigrant children to have interpretation services in their IEP program. Remember hearing mentioned of that so I'm sure the ladies correct. Is it further true Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. That legal immigrants from across the state of Georgia including some traveling more than four hours came to speak on behalf of the bill and is it not further true that as my other representatives has stated this bill is about legal versus illegal immigration and right now not only do legal immigrants and American citizens not think that is it is appropriate to give fifty three million dollar cash cards out as they're doing in New York to illegal immigrants versus there are American citizens that have needs that are not being addressed and that is why I'm supporting this bill. Is that true Mr. Speaker. I'm sure that's true there's lots of information flowing around this proposition for what purpose does representative Kenner rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that President Barack Obama deported more undocumented individuals than any other president. I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks or he would not have asked the question. For what purpose does chairlady house to arise? Probably entry inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that I've heard people talk about Republicans and Democrats and is it not true that we better think that we're Americans every once in a while first. I think that's probably a fact we can all agree on I hope. Well I think we've debated this question and then very thoroughly at this point so have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of house resolution 1019 the yeas are 98 the nays are 71 the resolution having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. For what purpose is representative Wilkerson rise. In accordance with House rule 143 I'd like to ask for reconsideration on the next legislative day. Chair is not going to recognize the gentleman for that motion. Okay we're moving on to some announcements that need to be made as we prepare for lunch. Chairman Parsons I think you have an announcement that impacts our lunch plans. Thank you Speaker. Give the gentleman your attention please. We have a EUT energy utilities and communications committee meeting scheduled for three I don't know how this will impact it. This schedule for three but if we're if we're late with the committee in there before us and I've asked them or tell them they can run late if they need to. We're scheduled for three and as shortly thereafter as possible energy utilities and telecommunications we do have a bill in there that we need to look at. Thank you. We'll probably be in this in this room Mr. Chairman throughout clock. Chairman Williamson is recognized for an announcement and then we'll have Chairman Stevens. Thank you Mr. Speaker. There will be a majority caucus lunch in immediately for our lunch break in room 403. Chairman Stevens is recognized for an announcement. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Following lunch at one fifteen in room 406 at CLOB the Economic Development Tourism Committee will meet we have a presentation from a Hyundai subsidiary for EV tolls electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles and when they're going to be produced. Is that an airplane or helicopter? Chairman Gutters recognized for an announcement. Do you have a stand-gatherer? Thank you Chairman Speaker the House Judiciary Committee was scheduled to have a meeting this afternoon starting I think at 130 we're going to move that now to upon adjournment when we get back from the recess. Thank you. We have one more announcement but members if you have a page you need to wow we have a lot of pages some of them are going to have to leave us so we're going to take some page photos immediately upon recess so if you have a page you need to find your way down front okay this House will stand in recess until 2 p.m. 2 p.m. and then we'll come back and complete the legislation of the day with this House will stand in
