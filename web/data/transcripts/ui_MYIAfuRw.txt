Good morning, hope everyone's had an enjoyable weekend.
Members will please come into the chamber and please take your seats.
Good morning.
The hour of convenient having arrived, all members will please take their seats, members
take your seats.
Mr. Clerk, will you ring that bell?
We're going to have the morning roll call, all members present will please vote
green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines.
You
All members voted.
I think all members have voted now, so Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines?
Doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayers by the chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Before I let Representative Liam introduce our pastor today, I want to remind all the
members, or let you know, I won't remind you, I mean if you probably do not know Carter
Barrett lost his mother early this morning, she had been in hospice care, but the pastor
is going to remember Carter's mother and certainly I know you all will reach out to Carter
and certainly remember her and that family in your prayers.
Chaplain this morning we'll be introduced by the gentleman from the 98th House District
representing Marvin Liam, representing Liam.
First condolences to Representative Barrett.
I think many of us know what it is like to lose a parent.
Good Monday morning, I have the honor
today of introducing one Reverend Dr. Rodrigo Cruz.
Reverend Cruz was born and raised in Monterey, Mexico,
where he actually practiced criminal law for several years.
but whether you see the legal profession as profane
or sacred and as a lawyer myself,
I waffle between the two depending on the day,
it can be no doubt that Reverend Cruz's next calling
was an even higher one into full-time ministry.
After Pastor Cruz and his family moved to the United States,
he received a master of divinity
from Asbury Theological Seminary
and a doctor of ministry from Wesley Theological Seminary.
And then in 2016, he launched the net,
a multi-ethnic church in Winnett County,
And then in July 2020, he was appointed to serve
as a superintendent in the North Georgia United Methodist
conference overseeing about 75 churches in Gwinnett,
Barrow, Walton, Akone, and Clark counties.
He remains the founding and lead pastor of the net,
which now has multiple campuses.
And one of those, the network campus, is in my district.
This church campus, including, of course,
Reverend Cruz and his colleagues,
Reverend Colmanares and others,
have been a light in my multicultural community.
It has been home to among many other things,
home first, Gwyneth, the first homeless shelter
by Gwyneth County, a recently rezoned future 72 units
site of affordable housing, and innumerable resources
for the community, including countless food drives
and COVID testing drives during the pandemic,
and co-hosting with me events,
and these are just in the last six months I realized,
everything from opioid overdose,
education and Narcan training to a stand-down event
for veterans to Tai Chi for seniors.
To me, Reverend Cruz and his church
are a living embodiment of the idea
encapsulated in many faith and lay teachings alike,
but including in the Book of Romans,
contribute to the needs of the saints,
extend hospitality to strangers.
With that, it is my honor to introduce Dr. Reverend Cruz.
very much. Good morning. Representative Lee, Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity.
I was told I could do this in Spanish, but then I was also told that for most of you,
your Spanish may be limited to ordering tacos and finding a restroom. So I will do this
in English, what at least in what I like to call my Southern version of English, as
a true native from the south, way, way south.
First of all, I want to thank you for your service.
Can imagine how complex your responsibilities are.
Not only being a public servant is hard, but it's also perhaps one of the least popular
jobs to have out there, given you have to be more popular that at least the person you
run against to get into this office, but I believe that once you're in this role, it seems
that no matter what decision you make, someone is going to be unhappy with it.
So I want to acknowledge that, I want to say thank you for your service and how do you
She's in the South and bless your heart as well.
But I do have a word of encouragement for you.
You see, as you begin 2024 and make decisions on behalf of the state, as you go through
your to-do list of all the things that you want to accomplish, I want to kindly encourage
you. Before you do anything to remember who you are. You see, I am a big believer
that when you remember who you are, that will influence what you do. One of my
favorite things in life is being at that. Me and my wife, we have five children
home and we are racing or trying to raise anything between a toddler in diapers and a senior
in high school. And I don't know what is harder. But you see, I did not become a father because
I like to change diapers. Dilling with crap, pardon my French, it just comes with a territory.
I became a father because of this opportunity
to impact someone's life.
So here she can become the best version of themselves
and influence our society.
I want to believe that whenever you decided to run for office,
it wasn't because you enjoyed dealing with diapers.
But it was because of this idea of being able
to impact people's lives.
So, we together can become the best version of ourselves and together influence this beautiful
state of Georgia.
You see, when you remember who you are, that influence, what you do.
So, as you go through 2024 and the opportunities present in front of you to do things, when
perhaps the opportunity present in front of you to do something that advanced your personal
agenda, I want to encourage you to remember that you are a public servant not to advance
your personal agenda, but to create legislation and policies that create a social fabric that
is grounded in equal opportunities, in justice, and fur treatment for all.
You see when the opportunity present in front of you to do something to please your friends,
that you remember that you became a public servant not to do that, but to represent those
who are at the margins, so they can be seen, heard, value, and treated with dignity.
You see when the opportunity present in front of you to represent your political party,
that you remember that you're in this place to represent every single citizen and resident
of the state of Georgia, and work eagerly with each other to dismantle any system that
is the value on people's life.
When you remember who you are, that influence what you do.
And I will finish with this.
You see, out of my five children, I have four boys and one girl.
And a couple of years ago, my baby girl
was being bullied in the school bus,
to the point that she refuses to ride the bus.
Again, so I gathered my boys, especially the older ones.
And I had a conversation with them.
So when you get in the bus tomorrow with your sister,
you have one assignment.
See, their mom was looking at me, giving me the eyes, telling
me, remember that you are a pastor.
And I'm a public school teacher.
watch out what you said and all I say my voice was, remember who you are, you'll know what to do.
I want to thank you one more time for your opportunity to be here.
I want to remind you that there is a church in Gwyneth County, the Ned Church.
There's over 450 churches across the state, United Methodist churches,
and we are praying daily, not for what you do, but for who you are. We use
time so we can pray together.
Go we need you thanks for the opportunity to be in your presence. It is a gift
that we do not take for granted. Go we certainly pray for a representative
buried and his family, for also the rest of the members of this house that
us, they're going through challenges that life brings to them. Especially I pray
for the unity of this body, that you will give them wisdom, discernment,
clarity, grace and courage to keep the main thing the main thing and that is the
better of the beautiful state of Georgia for the sake of others. We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
No, we'll invite you to, please.
Yeah, thanks.
First of all, it is the flag of the United States of America.
And to the Republic, which is the nation of the United States of America,
it is difficult to live in just as far as ever possible.
Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors.
Members, you may greet Dr. Cruz in the south any room.
Dr. Cruz, thank you for those words of direction and encouragement.
It's a way to start today.
Thank you so much.
Thanks for being here.
You

today is brought to us by representative Houston gains of the 120th he is doctor B. Rustin

of this house, that people's house, that this is the first day that we have young people
in the chamber, we have pages today.
So I hope you all will recognize those pages, give them your attention, and show good behavior.

Representative Schofield is recognized for a afternoon order in the morning, Representative
Schofield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. Without question, Georgia
laid to rest the phenomenal woman this weekend. Miss Diane Powell-Larsche. Diane was always
dedicated to making a difference. Those who knew Diane loved her. Diane was the owner
of large-shade communications, a public relation
and communication firm responsible for the 94th birthday
celebration of Dr. Joseph E. Laury as well as the 75th
birthday celebration of Congressman John Lewis
and so much more.
Diane created family food fest formerly known as Real Men
Cook to honor urban men on Father's Day.
Ever committed to serving the community, Diane
was the founding president of the Greater Atlanta
Section of the National Council of Negro Women.
She was the former Vice President and Outreach
for the Junior League, and she faithfully and tirelessly
served as a board member of the League of Women
Voters in Atlanta in the Fulton County chapter.
She also served as an active board member for over 20 years
on the Lupus Foundation of America Georgia chapter,
and she was a member of DeGmasinga Signifeta
in Coxerardians Corporated, I apologize, ladies.
Diane gave her time, talents, and treasure
to Atlanta until her final breath to our husband, Joe.
Thank you for sharing Diane with all of us,
and in so many special ways.
We will always carry Diane in our hearts.
Let us give a moment of silence and a smile
with our hearts for a life well-lived.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative.
Oh, she does.
You may be seated, members.
You have another morning order, okay?
Representative Scofield is recognized for an additional afternoon order in the morning.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Maternal mortality is not just an urban rule or suburban issue.
It's a human value, human rights issue that do to our failure as a state has acted not so
sufficiently to put this issue, making Georgia a state of emergency.
Maternal mortality and pregnancy associated, associated deaths,
Davis state, men, women, and families, the Maternal Mortality Review Committee reviewed
786 pregnancy-associated deaths and of the 786 pregnancy-associated deaths, 312 were determined
to be pregnancy-related deaths. So we can't turn a deaf ear, but it won't stop women from dying.
We can think it's not happening in our district, but I highly think that's a false narrative.
And let me be clear, we're not scaring black women from having babies.
We will continue to tell the truth.
We love our data and we have the data.
We have the funding, in fact, we have so much funding that we know
we can use some of this to fix the problem.
We have the brightest minds and the best people in this chamber, y'all.
So I'm curious, why do we still have a problem
with death of maternal mortality?
Colleagues, it's our responsibility and our time is now.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Representative Audine is recognized
for an afternoon order in the morning.
Representative Audine.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And he has some friends, just give them a minute to join you.
Members need to pay attention to the member and the will.
On December 29, 2023, Shania Kelly's green was shot by a stable at Walla 10 in the
holiday party.
She was 18 years of age, a loving daughter, a young mother of an eight-month son, a sister
and a friend to many, friends who loved her daily.
I attended her funeral yesterday.
As it was personal for me, as I celebrated my birthday,
just down the street from this tragedy that happened.
I have two kids her age.
I could not begin to imagine how the mother so young
could have lost her life.
Her mother, I heard her mother's words during the funeral,
knowing the grief and pain that she felt.
During the funeral ceremony, I learned that Shania
would have graduated this spring,
and wanted to pursue a career in Lash Tech
and dental hygiene professional.
I wanna thank the Winnock County Police
who have worked tirelessly investigating this shooting,
and know with the support of our community
who will bring the suspects to justice
once they are apprehended.
I thank God mostly because she knew Christ, and she is with the Lord today.
As a body I ask for your prayers for the family as they grieve, but let us do justice for
Fashonai's young son, who will grow up not knowing her, her grandparents, her large family.
I thank God for her uncle for constant communication.
Let us do something in Georgia for young kids and others that fall victim to similar situations.
Let's make a change in Georgia addressing violence that are impacting our kids.
Can we take a few moments of silence for Shaniaia Kellis-Green?
Amen.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Gardina.

If you will have, can I have your attention?
Across our state, people are having to put off
their elective surgery all over the state
because there's not enough blood.
We are desperately short in the state of Georgia
and therefore we really need people to help fix
that situation.
On Wednesday, this Wednesday, we're gonna have a blood drive
here at the Capitol again.
It'll be from 8 a.m. to 5.
the bloodmobile will be outside between the capital and the L.O.B.
So if you could plan to stop by and help the citizens of our state
by donating a pint of blood, we would really appreciate it.
It'll be raining that day probably, and I know you're sweet, but you won't melt.
And so if you will make plans to go do that, the other thing I would ask you,
This would be a great time to get a photo of you giving blood
and putting it out across your districts
about how desperate people are and they can call up the red cross
and ask where they can go and donate blood.
So why don't you take that opportunity and get a good photo
while you're giving blood and then put it out on your media.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield well.
Chair Lady, I have a question.
I bet there's plenty of blood in the state but it's just in other people's bodies and
we need to share it with those who need it, is that, would that be correct?
You are really right Mr. Speaker there is a lot of blood in Georgia but it's just in
people's bodies thank you for that so everybody I hope you will begin to share some of that
blood in your body.
I hope all the members will join in the effort on Wednesday.
