It's my honor to recognize a senator

pledge of allegiance and introduce the
chaplain of the day.
>> Hello. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Join me in the
pledge of the flag. Pledge allegiance to
the flag of the United States of America

one nation under God, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.
>> The Georgia flag. I pledge allegiance to
the Georgia flag, the principles of
which it stands, wisdom, justice,
moderation, courage.
>> Good deal. Well, thank you all. Thank
you, Mr. President. And it's my honor
today to uh to introduce the Reverend
Chris Humphre. He is the senior pastor
at Bainbridge First Baptist Church in
Decar County. And he's been the pastor
there since uh 2019. He's spent over 20
years in the ministry uh serving uh at
Calvary Baptist Church in Oel, Georgia
from 2006 to 2018 and Pinerove Baptist
in Gillsville, Georgia from 2002 to
2006. Uh, Pastor Humphrey's accepted
Christ on March the 10th and answered
the call to the ministry in 1999.
He is a graduate of Columbus State uh,
University where he received a bachelor
of arts and history degree and a master
of arts and religion from Liberty
University. uh his ministry objective
has been to fulfill the great commission
and to make sure his church is engaged
uh locally uh fulfilling uh God's
mission locally, nationally, and around
the world. And uh I can honestly say
I've listened to some of your ser
sermons, pastor, and I can I can hear
that in your voice. So I know you are
you are holding true to that. So thank
you. Uh he's obviously an avid Bulldog
fan, loves golf, loves pickle ball. Uh
but he couldn't do anything without the
support of his wife Kimberly and their
two children, Luke and Hope. And of
course, I met Pastor Humphrey's uh this
past summer at one of the Georgia
Baptist public affairs training events
down in uh in Bainbridge in Decar
County. And so uh it was great to be
down there and share with them. But what
really put him on my heart is uh so many
of my constituents that he has to
minister to down there in Decar County.
And uh have a lot of good friends down
there. He actually brought one of them
up with him. Darren Deal is over here
joining him for the drive, the 4-hour
drive up to keep him keep him company.
So, it's just an honor to have him here.
And um uh Reverend Humphre, I'll turn it
over to you. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
>> Well, good morning. Thank you so much uh
for having me today, Senator Walker, and
distinguished members of the Senate here
in Atlanta. We're so grateful for you
and your work. Uh, Senator Watson, thank
you so much for the opportunity uh to
stand before you. It's an honor today uh
for me to be here and I'm certainly
grateful to stand before you today. It's
very important that I let you know that
I am from uh Bainbridge, Georgia. Even
though I grew up in Atlanta, I live in
Bainbridge. Bainbridge matters in
Atlanta. And so, I just want to make
sure you guys know that. For all of my
friends in Bainbridge, they're very glad
that I just said that. And so thank you
so much uh for us uh and for what you
guys do up here. Now I know you have a
lot of work to do today and I just
simply want to offer a moment of
grounding for you because in this
chamber the pace is fast, the decisions
are heavy and the stakes are real for
the people that you serve. And I'm
reminded of something uniquely Georgian.
Growing up in Atlanta, when you're
hiking up Stone Mountain with a
particular group, you quickly learn that
the goal isn't just reaching the top,
but it's staying together on the way up.
So, if one person, for example, sprints
ahead, they miss the conversation. And
if someone lags behind, they miss the
encouragement. So, the real value is
found in walking together step by step.
This image echoes but powerful line from
scripture. In Micah chapter 6:8, we're
encouraged. What does the Lord require
of you? But to do justice, to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.
You see, justice shapes our decisions.
Mercy shapes our hearts. But humility
shapes our pace, how we walk with God,
and how we walk with one another. And if
there's any place where pace matters,
it's right here. you know, because of
the work that you do. It isn't just
about policy. It is about people. It's
about neighbors. It's about families.
It's about communities and futures. And
walking humbly together keeps us mindful
of those people. So, as we begin today,
I invite you to take a breath, you know,
to steady your pace to remember the one
who walks with you and the people who
walk behind each and every boat that you
cast. The Bible emphasizes that those
who live in fellowship with a holy God
and his people must live in a way which
reflects his holiness. He mentioned in
this passage, we love mercy. Mercy is a
rich word which includes the idea of
faithful love and action. Since I'm from
a farmer's town, there was a farmer who
once discovered that there was a group
of neighborhood kids who trampled part
of his garden while cutting through his
property. rows of young plants were
crushed. He was frustrated because he
depended on that garden. The next day,
he saw the same kids walking by. But
instead of scolding them, he walked out
with a basket of fresh vegetables and
simply said, "Looks like y'all took a
shortcut yesterday." So, I figured if
you're going to pass through my garden,
you might as well taste what's growing
here. The kids were stunned. There was
no lecture, no anger, just unexpected
kindness. Over the next weeks, the same
kids began stopping by to help him weed,
water, and plant. The shortcut became a
place of relationship. The garden grew,
and so did their hearts. What does mercy
tell us? It doesn't ignore wrong. Mercy
transforms wrong by responding with a
goodness the other people didn't earn.
In Micah 6:8, it says to love mercy, not
to tolerate mercy, not occasionally show
mercy, but we should love it. We should
delight in it because it reflects the
heart of God toward us. Why does it
matter? Well, it breaks circles of
retaliation. We open doors for healing.
We create space for God to work in ways
justice alone never could. And we remind
people of the mercy we ourselves live on
each and every day. So walking with God
stresses that man must remember that he
is man and that God is God. The proud
man will find God will resist him. There
was a pastor once who told his
congregation that he had finally
mastered humility. He even announced,
"I've written a book about it. Humility
and how I have achieved it." The next
day, one of the deacons pulled him aside
and said, "Pastor, you might want to
rethink that title." The pastor grand
and replied, "Well, I was going to call
it walking humbly with God, but the
publisher said that it didn't sound
nearly as impressive."
And the deacon responded and said,
"Exactly. That's the point. Public
service is a calling that makes much of
us uh think with our heart. Every
decision you make affects the lives that
you may never meet. And the weight of
the responsibility can be heavy." And
Micah suggests in these grounding words,
God does not ask for perfection. He asks
for orientation that our work be rooted
in justice shaped by mercy and carried
out with humility. Justice keeps us
committed to fairness even when it's
costly. Mercy softens our heart toward
those who struggle or disagree with us.
Humility reminds us that leadership is
not about elevating ourselves, but
elevating the common good. So when these
three virtues guide our steps, our work
more than policy, it becomes service
that honors God and blesses people.
Please know that we pray for you and we
hope the absolute best for you as you
discern and make decisions for our
state. Let's go to the Lord in prayer
for Father, we grant our legislators
wisdom that is steady, compassion that
is deep, and humility that is sincere.
strengthen them to lead with integrity
and listen with patience and to act with
courage. May their work bring peace,
justice, and hope to the people they
serve. Amen. God bless you guys.
>> It's an excellent message. Thank you.
All right. And it's time for the
introduce the doctor of the day. And I
will call on the senator from the 52nd
to introduce our doctor of the day.
Chairman, how you
>> how you doing? Good. Good.
>> Yeah, good to see you. Nice to see you.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I have uh one
of our internal medicine family
physicians from Rome here. And um I
should add that my own family physician
of the last 38 years retired December
31st, so I may be calling on him here in
the near future. But Dr. John Pitman is
originally from Commerce, Georgia, went
to Presbyterian College in South
Carolina, then to Mercer, and then did
his residency at Emory University and
worked in South Carolina for a while, I
believe North Side Hospital, but since
2007, we've gotten him over to Rome,
Georgia, and have kept him over there um
and working hard in our community.
Um and he has been part of uh the
faculty with u the residency program
there at uh Redmond Advent Hospital as
well as the Philadelphia College of
Medicine as well and and numerous other
appointments he's been on that are that
have too many to number. But anyway,
we're glad to have him here as a doctor
today. Um I've had some others that have
been here that have had some exciting
things happen. uh some of them right
outside the Senate floor, but maybe
we'll keep it calm today hopefully.
Anyway, thank you for being here and say
a couple of words to the Senate.
>> Sure will.
>> Uh thank you very much for that uh
introduction. It's very kind and thank
you for letting me serve you today as
the doctor of the day. It's quite the
honor and thank you for your service uh
the fine work that you'll do today and
in the upcoming part of this legislative
session. So, thank you very much for
that. And thank you very much uh for
your attention to the health care of our
fine Georgia citizens. It has not gone
unnoticed and is very much appreciated.
Have a great day.
We have with us today some special
guests. The secretary will read a
resolution.
Senate resolution 596 recognizing Big
Brothers Big Sisters agencies across
Georgia and commending their work in
supporting students and families across
the state of Georgia and for other
purposes. Whereas Big Brothers, Big
Sisters agencies across Georgia are
dedicated to helping young people
realize their full potential through
positive, sustained mentor relationships
that support academic success,
strengthen families, and build safer,
more connected communities. And
whereas the Big Brothers, Big Brothers,
Big Sisters agencies, school-based, and
community based programs have produced
measurable improvements in student
attendance, academic performance, and
sense of belonging. Now therefore, be it
resolved by the Senate that the members
of this body recognize Big Brothers, Big
Sisters agencies across Georgia for
their leadership in supporting youth,
families, and schools across the state.
Commend the Level Up program for its
proven impact in reducing chronic
absenteeism and strengthening student
success in Georgia schools. Acknowledge
the essential role of mentorship in
promoting academic achievement, family
stability, and long-term community
well-being. and support the continued
expansion of this mentorshipbased
program that increases attendance,
improves engagement, and builds brighter
futures for children across the state of
Georgia. Mr. President, that completes
the order.
Is there objection to the adoption of
the resolution?
Chair hears none and the resolution is
adopted.
I'd like to call upon the senator from
the 36 to introduce our special guest.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I
am so happy to bring to you today uh
folks who are doing the great work with
big brothers, big sisters uh and to pass
this resolution that commends them. Uh
we have with us today uh folks who are
very dedicated to this program and you
know this is a mentorship program and
the mentors
benefit richly as do the mentees and I I
I've heard the other day the head of the
national uh big brothers big sisters who
was being interviewed uh on uh a
national program and he pointed out that
sometimes the the mentors want to meet
even more often than the mentees are
able to handle that. It's that it's that
kind of program. It's a life-changing
program uh for young people and equally
uh enriches the lives of those who
mentor them. Uh and here in Georgia, we
have a a uh uh Big Brothers Big Sisters
agencies all across the state. And with
us today are Big Brothers, Big Sisters
of Metro Atlanta uh who've come to be
recognized and to uh share a minute with
you about their work. And I know there
are many of us uh here uh in the chamber
in the Senate here in Georgia as well as
over in the House that have had personal
experience with Big Brothers Big
Sisters. I'm happy to uh
recognize and introduce and bring to the
uh podium uhwami Johnson senior who is
the CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of
Metro Atlanta and he is joined as well
here on uh on the uh roster by Pierre
Gaither who is the chief operating
officer of Big Brothers Big Sisters of
Metro Atlanta with deep roots in a
community that I represent here in town.
Betsy Fitzgerald, CEO of Big Brothers
Big Sisters of the Heart of Mon, uh is
with us today and Lindseay Foster, the
executive director of Big Brothers Big
Sisters of Northwest Georgia Mountains.
Uh so they uh they they cover the state
like the de uh that falls. I I am uh
pleased and proud to lift up the work uh
of this uh great organization here
across our state and uh invite uhwami
Johnson senior the CEO to address us.
Thank you.
>> Well, thank you, Senator, and thank you
all for your your service and your
support. Uh as you all know, we have a
team of folks here with Big Brothers and
Big Sisters. We have our representatives
here across the state who were just
introduced, but also our team who's up
in the gallery here and also our littles
who are serving as pages today. So,
they'll be supporting you all all day
long. And this is an amazing
life-changing experience for them. We
say that we are defenders of potential.
None of us got here without somebody
defending our potential. Collectively,
we serve close to 4,000 youth across 30
counties here in Georgia. We're making a
huge impact. We know that 98% of our
young people graduate high school on
time. 99% avoid the criminal justice
system and 83% feel much more connected
to school. You know us for our onetoone
model, but we've been very innovative in
launching new programs and one is level
up where we actually have paid mentors
working in school buildings every day.
We are embedding mentorship in public
education. This is a middle school
model. Our schools have the top
attendance. Chronic absenteeism is a big
issue in Georgia. We are combating that.
We're keeping kids in school.
Suspensions are down and kids are
thriving through mentorship in our
program. As the senator mentioned, both
sides benefit from mentorship, the
little and the big. And it also brings
people together from different worlds.
And we need that more and more in the
day and age that we live in. Bringing
different people together to support and
learn from each other. So, we appreciate
your support. We want to expand our
programs across the state. Our programs
work in urban, suburban, and rural and
we have impact. So, we'd love to partner
with you all and we appreciate your
support in doing that.
>> I'd like to present the resolution to
you on behalf of the Georgia Senate uh
Quaame and again applaud the work. All
of us know somebody whose lives are
touched by this. Uh we appreciate uh the
invaluable contribution that this uh
nonprofit makes here across our state.
Thank you.
>> Thank you. Thank you.
We'll get our picture down there, I
guess.
Are there any unanimous consents?
Does any senator wish to rise on a point
of personal privilege?
I recognize a senator from the 39th
Thank you, Mr. President.
Today, more than 1,400 Georgians are
here at the Capitol for Addiction
Recovery Awareness Day 2026. They have
come from just down the street, less
than a mile from the gold dome, and from
more than five hours away just to be
present. These people are Georgia. They
represent the more than 900,000
Georgians living in recovery, mothers
and fathers, sons and daughters,
co-workers, neighbors, and friends. And
they also stand for the more than 1.4 4
million Georgians currently living with
active addiction in every community in
every district throughout our entire
state. There is no family, no workplace,
no school, college, university or house
of worship, not a single community that
has been spared the addiction epidemic.
As a co-chair of the general assembly's
working group on addiction and recovery
along with the senator from Columbus, I
have had the privilege of sitting with
providers, peer counselors, and people
living in recovery. And what I can tell
you is this. In Georgia, recovery is
real. It's real in the stories walking
these halls today. It's real in the
lives being rebuilt. It's real in the
families being restored. And I want to
thank every member of this chamber,
especially those who are part of the
bipartisan working group for continuing
to pass legislation that saves lives and
strengthens communities. And when you
see our friend Jeff Breedlove today,
know that he is here with more than
1,000 of our constituents. So if you
can, please take a moment to say hello
because the person you meet today is not
a headline or a statistic. They are a
survivor of the disease that is killing
more Georgians between the ages of 18
and 45 than anything else. And today
they are standing here visible,
courageous, and hopeful, reminding us
that in Georgia recovery is indeed real.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Chair recognizes the senator from the
16th
for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate
it. And I wanted to speak to you on SB
424 that was uh dropped yesterday. The
four is for Georgians. The 24 is for car
gold. And you can say what's gold about?
What does that have to do with it?
Interesting. If you will, let me kind of
give you just an overview to think
about. Uh our gold dome has 80 more than
80 ounces of gold on top of the roof.
That most of that came from Delana,
Georgia. You may not know that.
Interesting that gold is a tier one
asset for banks and currently gold
selling is is at $5,200 an ounce or more
right now. But how can the average
Georgian buy gold or can they buy gold?
Well, they can. And that's through
transactional gold. And I want to talk
about that just a second and make you
aware that transactional gold is the
ability to own gold on a fractional
basis. That means you can take a coin
such as a gold coin and you can take
your debit card and go to your gold
account and transfer value and buy
things at Chick-fil-A, wherever you want
to buy your um uh food or wherever you
would like to simply by having a
fraction. You can own it. You can put
$100 in. You could put $5,000 in, but
you don't have to buy the whole thing.
Well, how does this idea come? If you
look at it constitutionally, article
one, section 10 of the US Constitution
says states cannot create currency, but
they can have gold and silver
depositories in which their citizens can
place their gold or silver and the state
has oversight. Already Texas has its a
depository and five other states already
have gold and s transactional goal in
place. Florida this year signed over and
they now have transactional gold that
their people are going to be able to own
gold as a hedge against inflation and
what's going on with our debt.
Currently, we have $37 trillion in debt
and we are seeing this. We are seeing
inflation at a way we've never seen it
before. But making it practical is
having the ability to own it for
Georgians overseen by the state of
Georgia but have transactional
capability to be able to use that gold
in small amounts if I want to. Right now
if someone owns gold where do they put
it? Well in this way we would have it in
a depository supervised by the state of
Georgia by the treasur and then you
would have access to your goal through a
transactional side with a a card. I
believe this that we need to have
opportunities. And I think if you look
at this on the hat, it says another way
to pay. You know what? You can go in and
you can pay with your master card, your
Visa or whatever you would like to, but
you could have a debit card to your gold
account or silver account and transfer
money that way as well. I believe this
it's economic freedom for Georgians and
it is a way that you can pay and own
something that you could not own
normally but you could own it in small
denominations using a technology called
Glint which is already out and is
running right now. I just think this I
ask you to read if you will a little bit
about what's going on and I believe this
gold is a hedge against inflation that
every Georgian should have available to
them not just limited to those who are
wealthy and I thank you very much Mr.
President
>> chair recognized senator from the 43rd
for a point of personal privilege
Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning,
colleagues. I rise today
to
say happy 70th platinum wedding
anniversary to my parents.
>> I know.
Yeah. Go ahead. That's a good place.
That's a good place to clap.
I helped.
Uh they um got married on January 28th
of um 1956
um after my dad um came home from a um
army tour. Um he is a Korean War era
veteran. Um I know. Wow. Amazing. And I
just want to um acknowledge that um
we're celebrating them every day. Um but
today is so very special because they
are grandparents of 11,
great-grandparents of 16, and great
great grandparents of four. Um they are
retired and enjoy enjoying
um immediate family, church family, uh
friends and um the community and they
are leaders. Um they share their love
and their legacy lives in us. So happy
anniversary mom and dad. 70 years
strong. Thank you.
>> Chair recognizes a senator from the
28th. Senator, would you like to speak
from your desk or you want to come to
the well?
>> Okay.
Thank you.
>> Okay. Thank you.
Uh oh.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And excuse me for being so slow, but I'm
walking. Just in slow motion, but not on
purpose.
I rise to discuss
the weekend's events in Minnesota.
We all watched
as a 37year-old
veteran nurse, VA nurse was murdered in
cold blood.
And we all watched
as the majority defended him that
murdered because Donald Trump said they
should.
This morning I want to discuss how the
majority has defended gun rights for 30s
plus years and suddenly they do not care
when Trump says that they shouldn't
care.
Our rights are bigger than a president
rights are bigger than the majority's
agenda.
SR 605 asks us to commit to uh
protecting those rights. The majority
finds this so controversial, but the
idea that we should commit to protecting
rights
that they sent it to a committee.
Please let me know when we can protect
our rights.
Pass SR605
now. And you know, I've always stood for
saving lives and for justice. So, I
brought this to you this morning. But
this afternoon, we'll still be trying to
save lives because we will have um a
forum because people are here from all
over the state for saving lives and for
talking about um our autistic uh young
people and also about chase uh chasing
the police, chasing in neighborhoods and
people dying as a result. So, thank you
for listening,
Mr. Chairman. I yield the will. Thank
you.
Senators yielded the well.
Lots of points of personal privilege
today. Um,
I now call on the senator from the 15th,
the dean of the Senate
for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
As dean of the Senate, I've been had the
honor of being called. I certainly
appreciate that. a member of the
Veterans Hall of Fame. I come to the
podium this morning to express some
trouble observation that we witness
in our chamber in our country. I've
stood in the chamber for years defending
all rights. I fought to defend them
while serving in our armed forces. And
today I along with a lot of others mourn
the ease with which we set aside those
rights when it suits our political
convenience, especially when it benefits
our President Donald Trump. Across our
nation, we've seen a moment of profound
shock and controversy in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, where Alex Prey, a 37year-old
ICU nurse and US citizen, was shot and
killed by federal agents during an
immigration enforcement operation.
This tragedy has ignited widespread
debate with bystanders footage and
reporting raising serious questions
about how federal force was used. Viral
videos appears to contradict official
nar narratives and show Prey attempting
to help others not engaging in violence
when the shooting occurred.
Whether one agreed with his views or
not, Freddy was not chaos incarnate. He
was a citizen who voiced his opinion
legally carried a firearm under state
law and whose death has sparked calls
for investigation and accountability
from leaders across the political
spectrum. We may disagree on the full
reach of the Second Amendment, but we do
not disagree that every American has a
right to self-defense, to protest, and
to feel secure under our Constitution.
Here in Georgia, let us not wait for the
tragedy like the one that happened.
Let's not see that happen in our streets
before we choose to act. I urge all of
our colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, friends with whom I worked with
for years, to join me in protecting our
rights, not sidelining them when it's
inconvenient.
We should pass State Resolution 605 by
unanimous consent.
Let us reaffirm our commitment to our
civil liberties and to the very freedoms
that make this nation worth defending.
This is America.
I yield the well, Mr. President. Thank
you.
Chair recognizes the senator from the
26.
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and
gentlemen of the h of the senate
and thought about 37 years ago.
You know when I grew up in Mon Georgia,
I was born in a town called Tumisville
in Byron, Georgia.
And on the weekend, I always wanted to
go back to the country so I could hunt
with my cousin.
I never will forget
being 13 years old and he gave me a JC
Higgins double barrel 410
and I used to go shoot the squirrels out
the pecan trees and get a dollar for the
squing
school. Every payday I used to go to
Rosses
and buy a gun.
I bought a SKS for $49 in the box with
the bayonet and everything in it.
And when I had a fire at my house and
when the fireman got there, I said, "You
need to get to the basement cuz if you
don't, it's going to be like the 4th of
July."
But as I
go home and watch television
and I see
people
getting killed,
you said he had a gun, but you took the
gun
and then you shot him and he was face
down.
Now, yes, I'm a Democrat
and the majority of you in here are
Republicans,
but at some point in time, when do we do
what we need to do?
Donald Trump gets in his pants the same
way I do. One leg at a time.
He told you when he got reelected he was
going to be like a dictator.
No wonder he likes Putin
because Putin kills all of his
opposition.
And it seems as though this president
that we have
is doing a whole lot.
He's a president that's making plenty of
money.
Cryptocoin,
Prince of Saudi puts $2 billion in it.
He's making more money than you can
shake a stick at.
But we in here.
And many of us, those of you who are
old,
know back know what happened back in the
day.
I don't plan
to fight the Civil War all over again.
History tells us where we've been.
But I'm saying to all of you,
we don't need a federal detention center
in Georgia.
People are being stopped
because they don't speak English
or they look different.
Skin color
is part of the problem.
Now I've seen and watched on television
and you telling me I didn't see what I
saw.
The lady that got killed
wasn't trying to run over
the officer.
When you look at it, she was turning the
car to the right. The officer ran up and
shot in the head.
And you trying to say it's all right?
A nurse
who had a pistol toten permit.
Gun taken.
He's scuffling with ICE officers.
He's put on his stomach
and the next thing you know, you hear
six shots
and he's dead.
Something is wrong.
You the majority,
but sometime you have to stand up for
what's right.
As I said, many of you who are of the
age that I am
know what we went through in the south.
But it's time that we stand up
for human rights
and stand up for what's right.
I yield the way.
Senators yielded the well. I recognize
the senator from the 55th for a point of
personal privilege.
Senate rules allow five minutes, but you
don't have to use all five minutes.
Ladies and gentlemen of this
distinguished body, I rise to
speak to recent events.
On January 24th, heavily armed federal
immigration agents deployed by the
current president
ruthlessly
murdered an American citizen less than
two miles
from his home.
Alex Prey was a 37year-old nurse caring
for American veterans at the VA hospital
in Minnesota Minneapolis.
He was a lawful gun owner peacefully
attending a public protest.
This is the man that the current
administration is calling a terrorist.
At the time of his murder,
Alex was shielding a woman.
The administration said he was a danger
to law enforcement.
At the time of his murder,
Alex was legally carrying his firearm.
The current administration has said
possessing a firearm justifies border
patrol agents murdering
him.
At the time of his murder, Alex was
voicing his displeasure to violent
overreach he believed his government was
engaged in
like so many Americans before him have.
Even the National Rifle Association
spoke loudly this weekend,
saying that current administration
officials had to stop calling the
victims a terrorist simply because he
lawfully possessed a firearm.
For years, we heard that the good guy
with a gun stops the bad guy with a gun.
We can't have it both ways, my
colleagues.
Simply
protesting
peacefully
cannot evolve to a situation where
violence
is the rain of the day.
Why? Because democracy
is the resolution of our differences in
a nonviolent fashion.
The first amendment is so important
for this reason. It is the alternative
to the bullet. It is alternative to
countries where they are violently
overthrowing the government because
there are people that don't have a voice
that is being heard.
Democracy is so important because of the
right to vote, the right to peacefully
protest. Why? Because violence is the
language of the unheard.
If people cannot safely voice a
different opinion
through peaceful protests
or the vote, violence is the only
alternative. And we cannot give up this
great country. A country built on the
right. The first amendment is the right
to peacefully protest.
And the second amendment protects the
first amendment.
But we have turned it upside down. We
cannot have it both ways. And I
challenge my colleagues
because it makes no sense that we are
not passing a unanimous
Senate Resolution 605.
It makes no sense that we don't stand up
and we must change that whole narrative.
We must learn to live together as a as
or die and perish as fools. That is the
real crux of this matter and I stand
because we cannot allow injustice
anywhere to flourish unspoken and
unchallenged and that is the right to
peacefully protest.
First they came for the socialists and I
did not speak up because I was not a
socialist. Then they came for the trade
union unionists and I did not speak out
because I was not a trade unionist. Then
they came for the Jews and I did not
speak out because I was not a Jew. Then
they came for me and there was no one
left to speak for me. I challenge you my
colleagues. We must speak up for the
least, the lost and the left out. This
is America. This is the United States of
America. It is not the divided states of
America. Thank you very kindly. Thank
you very kindly. Thank you very kindly.
chair recognizes senator from the 11th
>> for a point of personal privilege.
You Mr. President, I just need the uh
record to show once again that I love my
wife. I need to wish her happy 20th
anniversary. Uh yes, thank y'all. and
and I want to uh publicly promise to her
no more transmissions for her car, no
more uh working cows on the weekends,
and and no more holding that pin uh for
the excavator while I'm working on it
either. So, uh the next 20 ought to be
better than these past 20. So, I love
you. Thank you for what you do for our
family and our farm. And we'll see you
this weekend.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator.
Uh clearly Emily must be a saint and we
greatly appreciate her sharing you with
us. So thank you very much. All right
and now I recognize the senator from the
six, our lustrious rules chair.
It has become tradition here in the
Georgia State Senate that when the
senator from the 11th comes and wishes
his wife happy anniversary
that it's a good reminder for me to
same. So Megan love you. I'm not making
any promises like the senator from the
11th did although the cattle thing is
probably safe. Uh but happy anniversary.
We're 19th so always right behind you.
>> God bless you Megan.
Uh now recognize the senator from the
ninth for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. Now, we're
back to the other programming today. So,
I rise today on a personal point of
privilege to
redirect us back to the tragedies of
this weekend and the tragedies that have
been happening in Minnesota.
On my way to the Capitol this morning, I
saw some signs just before you hit I20.
I don't know if y'all saw these folks.
They had signs up that read, "Resist.
Call your legislators."
And now people are active.
So, let me be clear about this. All the
Trump administration is accomp
accomplishing right now is mobilizing
voters. People are waking up to the
erosion of our democracy. People are
waking up to the fact that the Trump
administration and Republicans have
manufactured a crisis by demonizing
immigrants to distract from the real
problems that the Republican party has
failed to solve.
People can't afford housing. Health care
costs are rising. Families are feeling
the pinch every time they go and get
groceries. And instead of dress
addressing any of that, the Trump
administration has created a crisis,
hired government-paid thugs, all under
the facade of immigration enforcement.
Republicans seem perfectly fine with
unchecked ICE enforcement.
Republicans seem fine with Americans
feeling fear.
Republicans want chaos.
Republicans seem to be okay with
terrorizing our citizens.
We're seeing this in Minnesota. And I
want Georgians to understand, don't
think this can't happen in Georgia. ICS
is right here in Georgia. And yet many
Republicans remain silent
about holding ICE accountable.
What's especially troubling is
some of my Republican colleagues are
running for higher office. Governor,
Lieutenant Governor, attorney general.
Yet, not one has spoken out
about what is happening with ICE,
ISIS's unaccountability.
No one's speaking out about the outrage
of what is happening in Minnesota and
what could possibly happen here in
Georgia.
And let me remind this chamber of
something simple. Every single one of us
came from somewhere.
Whether by choice or by for or by force.
If anyone needs a reminder of where you
came from, go check your ancestry.
We all came here from somewhere.
And we used to be a nation that welcomed
all.
The Republican party has become the
party that excuses violence against US
citizens on US soil. What happened in
Minnesota was not caused by an
immigrant.
It was violence
committed by a US citizen
or US citizens against another US
citizen. And that's the truth.
And we need to acknowledge
that is wrong.
Now, Republicans refuse to commit to
protecting our First Amendment rights.
somehow defending the right to protest
has become too controversial for them.
Trump himself has suggested that
lawfully possessing a firearm justified
the death
of Alex Prey.
Let that sink in.
Now, Republicans are refusing to commit
uh commit to protecting our First
Amendments, right? To make an excuse for
Donald Trump in his administration.
We're in a state with polit permitless
carry.
And we're in a state where in the past,
Republicans in this body have always
defended that.
and the NRA.
You can't defend gun rights on one hand
and justify the execution of a US
citizen on the other. The hypocrisy is
unacceptable.
Today, we're asking our colleagues to
stand up for democracy and for the
people of this state by supporting
common sense legislation that protects
the constitutional rights of US citizens
and Georgians. SP 389 requiring visible
identification and no mask. SP 397
allowing legal action when
constitutional rights are violated. SP
391 prohibiting entry into schools
without a warrant. And SR 605 affirming
the right to protest and the right to
legally carry firearms. These are not
partisan bills. These are bills to
protect Georgians and protect our values
and our rights. Senator.
>> Yes, sir.
>> With all due respect,
your time has elapsed. So, I would ask
you to please yield the well.
>> I will yield the well. Just understand
that the pendulum is swinging and the
Democrats are coming. Thank you, Mr.
President. I yield the well.
>> Chair recognizes senator from the 56 for
a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. I've served in
this August chamber for some time, less
than a few of you, but more than most of
you. And I have to remind everybody
every couple of years, this is the
Georgia State Senate.
It's not the United States Senate. It's
not any one of the other 49 state
legislatores. It is the Georgia State
Senate. Now, whether you're trying to
get on the news or you're trying to run
for other office, everyone has a right
to come to this well, and we respect
that.
But what I haven't heard in the last
year, which just baffles me,
is the illegal criminal aliens
who did the following in Georgia.
Brought enough fentinel into this state
to kill half the state's population.
I didn't hear anyone come up to the well
and talk about that.
the hundreds of drug traffickers that we
took off the streets that are not
poisoning your communities, your
families, and your children.
How about the homicide, manslaughter,
the dozens of cases of child aggravated
molestation,
the child rape and imprisonment,
the battery of a child, the felony
murder convictions, the incest and child
molestations.
Don't come to this well and say
acknowledge something that happened in
another state when you're not
acknowledging the very things happening
in your state that are impacting your
community.
If you want to hold the press conference
or you want to waste all our time up
here talking about whatever you want to
talk about, God bless you. But you're a
Georgia state senator.
Keep your eye on the ball and let's
protect our communities. Thank you. I
yield the
Chair recognizes a senator from the 44th
for point of personal privilege.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. Perhaps I'll
be our last speaker, colleagues. Who
knows? Um, I do think it's important to
point out that
the pattern of behavior that we have
been witnessing in Minnesota and
Minneapolis actually is simply an
escalation of what's been going on for a
year now. Um, the federal government
under the Trump administration
has repeatedly violated fundamental
rights protected by the US Constitution.
They've attacked free expression.
They've crushed peaceful assembly.
They've choked the free press.
They've ignored judicial orders and due
process.
They've inflicted cruelty on detained
individuals.
Now, it's also that they've murdered two
Americans,
Alex Prey and Renee Good.
And the thing is, Alex Prey was
peacefully attending a public protest.
He legally possessed a concealed
firearm. It wasn't visible. He didn't
approach ICE agents brandishing a gun
despite Secretary Gnome's outrageous
comments to the contrary.
He was simply holding his phone, filming
the agents.
So, Alex Prey was doing exactly what
every law-abiding American gets to do.
He was exercising his constitutional
rights. He was following gun laws
written by Republican legislators.
He was carrying legally and protesting
peacefully. And for that, he was
murdered in cold blood.
And now, Republicans, starting with
President Trump, are blaming Alex for
his own death.
They are using his possession of a gun
to justify ICE agents killing him in the
streets of Minneapolis. And for good
measure, they've trashed his reputation,
smeared his name, and inflicted even
more pain on his grieving family. So,
let's be clear that this is not about
public safety. This is about power and
following the orders of the president.
So Trump, his administration,
and this Republican party have been
willing to turn their backs on the
first, fourth, fifth, and eth
amendments.
The first now trampling peaceful
protest. But what's truly unbelievable
is watching Republicans turn on their
favorite amendment, the Second
Amendment,
defending the killing of a citizen for
legally carrying a gun.
because Alex was legally armed. So, the
same politicians that made Kyle
Writtenhouse, a 17-year-old who went to
a protest illegally carrying an AR-15
and murdered two people, the same people
that made that guy a folk hero
are now silent.
The same politicians and Republican
party that have told us for decades that
more people carrying more guns in more
places makes all of us safer are now
silent as Prey is brutally murdered by
his own government because he had a gun.
That is hypocrisy. But far more than
that, that's authoritarianism.
So again, the administration is making
free speech, peaceful assembly, and
lawfully carrying a firearm offenses
punishable by death in America. And we
just don't we we you I know you think,
"Oh, they keep going on about it." Well,
that's because we don't hear Republicans
defending our rights, denouncing the
killings, and most importantly, standing
up to the Trump administration. We also
heard that we Democrats refused to name
Lake and Riley in in 2024, which is not
true because our former leader and
myself both expressed our disgust over
her murder. And for you, Senator from
the 56, yeah, we want to get criminals
off the streets, illegal alien criminals
and other criminals. We support that.
But we do not support
the running a muck of a federal
government at the orders of one man
who's installed only lieutenant minions
to carry out his orders within his
administration, trampling, destroying
the rights of Americans and killing them
for exercising those rights. And that's
why everyone's angry and that's why
everyone's scared. This is not what they
wanted and not what they voted for. The
Constitution is not a page of
suggestions. It is a foundation for our
society. Even though Donald Trump thinks
only his own morality is the only thing
that can that can stop him from doing
what he wants. That's what he said.
That's what he told the New York Times.
Well, I'm here to say actually it's the
Constitution and we do expect
Republican legislators to make that
clear for Georgians.
I urge a a hearing on SR 605
immediately. That is why uh the senator
from the 14th and Senate Democrats have
filed it. It reaffirms our
constitutional rights in the face of
these attacks
and I think it will be pretty telling if
we don't have a hearing on SR 605. Thank
you, Mr. President. I yield the well.
>> Senators yielded the well. Chair
recognizes senator from the 17th for a
point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Our constituents, colleagues, our
constituents send us to the capital for
one reason
above all others, to protect them and to
ensure their rights are respected and
defended. What we are saying today
should concern every one of us. SR 605
simply asks this body to affirm its
commitment to civil rights, including
the Second Amendment
rights that the majority so often claim
to champion. Yet, we refuse to do so.
Not because those rights lack value, but
because protecting them is politically
inconvenient for Donald Trump. We do not
have a king in this country. We have a
democracy. And if we intend to remain
one, then we must commit to defending
the rights of people, not bending them
to serve any single president. I commend
my United States Senator, Reverend
Raphael Waro, for representing all of us
well by traveling to Minneapolis to meet
with faith leaders and show his
commitment of protecting civil rights
for his constituency
and
the constituency across this nation.
Colleagues, I implore you today to be
champions of justice. Stand with persons
who are engaged in nonviolent resistance
and protest. Say no to ICE. No to murder
by federal agents. No to this
administration lying about Mr. Alex
Prieous being an assassin and domestic
terrorist. Yes, I am a Georgia state
senate senator and I stand here today to
say that injustice is wrong. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. said, and I quote,
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere. We are caught in an
inescapable
network of mutality tied in a single
garment of destiny. Whatever affects one
indirectly affects all indirectly,
emphasizing that we all have a
responsibility to act against
oppression. So today, I ask you to think
about justice." Mr. President, thank
you. And I yield the whale.
>> Senators yield to the well. Chair
recognizes the senator from the 30th for
a point of personal privilege.
>> Thank you, Mr. President.
I'll be brief. I just want to something
that concerns me here a little bit. When
we talk about law enforcement,
ra law enforcement, whether that be ICE,
whether it be our state troopers that we
see in the building, our county local
police, when we use terms like thugs,
murderers, and terrorists describe a law
enforcement agency,
we are rising the temperature and the
risk level for our state troopers, our
county deputies, and our local police.
I think we all support our local law
enforcement and our state law
enforcement.
I think what we are doing with some of
the language we're using is putting them
in a level that they a heightened risk
anyway on this job. I think we're
putting them in a more dangered area
than what they should be put in by using
this language.
When I hear the word terrorist, that's
concerning along with the other ones.
Um, we always talk about lowering the
temperature.
We need to lower this temperature to
make sure our law enforcement officers
are safe in this state. I'm going to do
everything I can in my power as a person
in this body to protect our law
enforcement officers and get them what
they need to do their job and do it
professionally and do it well, which I
think every single one of them in this
state does a dang good job. So to all
our state law enforcement officers, DNR,
GBI, county, city, thank you so much for
everything that you do and put your
lives on the line every day for us. So
thank you so much and I'll yield the
well.
>> Thank you, Senator Chair recognizes,
but he's the senator from the 35th, but
he's not in his seat.
I'm not sure he can be recognized if
he's not in his seat.
Oh, there he is. Chair recognizes
senator from the 35th point of personal
privilege. He did a very good job on
lawmakers last night along with our
other freshman senator from the 21st.
They represented the Senate proud.
>> All right. Thank you, Mr. President.
I have a a few burning questions from
everyone in this body.
Question number one,
have our politics become our idol?
What have we sacrificed
at his altar?
Back to question number one. Have our
politics become our idol.
Follow-up question. What have we
sacrificed at his altar?
It seems that many of us have
potentially sacrificed our principles
at his altar.
Some of us may have on occasion
sacrificed courage,
sacrificed morals.
But I want all of us to really ask
ourselves that question.
Have our politics become
our idol?
After that question, it's probably good
to ask if uh that idol created this
world. Does that idol hold this world
together?
Millions of things have to go just right
just for every person in this room to
take a breath.
Are we going to give our idols credit
for that?
I ask that we acknowledge where we're
going to put our trust, where we put our
faith, and dare I say, where we put our
security.
I don't claim to have all the answers,
but if we can start from that point of
agreement,
then we can get some things done and
show the rest of the country how to move
forward in this space. I yield the well.
Chair recognize the minority leader
Senator from the 22nd for a point of
personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief.
I just want to read one quite one thing.
I actually had not planned to come up
today, but when I heard about the fact
that we're in the Georgia Senate, maybe
we should not deal with this.
Over the summer, there was an opinion
written that I think every lawyer ought
to put in their lapel or in their inside
pocket. It was written by Judge
Wilkerson who was a Reagan appointee
still on the bench 80 years old Reagan
appointee and they were dealing with the
Garcia case and they ruled against the
administration.
This one paragraph I think actually
still fits even what we're talking about
today and the seriousness of it and why
no matter where you are, you should take
it seriously.
And what he says is this.
He says, "It is, as we have noted, all
too possible to see in this case, we can
say in this particular case we're
dealing with right now, an incipient
crisis, but it may be present, but it
may present an opportunity as well. We,
the judiciary and America, yet cling to
the hope that is not naive to believe
our good brethren in the executive
branch, perceive the rule of law as
vital to the American ethos." This case
presents dear unique opportunity to
vindicate that value and to summon the
best that is within us while there is
still time. That is an amazing powerful
statement from a federal court of
appeals judge Reagan appointee to say
while there is still time. He is telling
us that bench was telling us
there is a crisis going on in America.
Please wake up. It's not about where you
are. It affects all of us. And what he
said in that opinion fits exactly what
we're talking about today. when he talks
about the case. He was talking about the
Garcia case there, but he could be
talking about this case right here.
While there is still time, an amazing
powerful statement from a federal court
judge Reagan appointee. While there is
still time, forget about the what
aboutism, what you didn't say over here,
what you didn't say over here. While
there is still time to save this
democracy, that is what he said. And I
think that anybody and especially
attorneys in this day and age ought to
keep that close to them and understand
what this fight is about while there's
still time. Thank you and I yield the
welcome.
>> Are there any other senators wish to
rise for a point of personal privilege?
Any other senators?
Chair recognizes a senator from the
29th.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
I I guess listening to all of this
chatter and be clear that's what it was.
As everybody came up and spoke,
I saw one individual that went to the
same police academy I went to.
I saw one individual that went to the
firefighters academy and worked
alongside public safety. And then what I
saw scattered about amongst those groups
were politicians,
people looking for the opportunity.
But I'll tell you something that I
learned well before I went to the police
academy. Something that I learned in my
Georgia class that I had to pass when I
was in junior high school, which is
middle school to some of you in the
room. And what I learned in my social
studies class is something called due
process.
And what I heard today is that every
American who does not wear a badge
has the right to due process.
But if you do wear a badge, you have a
right to the jury of a bunch of Georgia
state senators
who watch, and I quote, viral videos
who listen to rhetoric throughout
the news cycle on the internet and their
favorite targeted silo channel, on their
favorite website, or their favorite
print publication that may still be in
existence.
But I'm going to hit you with a news
flash. The men and women of law
enforcement, they don't get to sit
behind their desk, press their button,
write their speech, grab a laptop or a
cell phone, and read from it while
they're in a critical incident. They
don't get to do that. And you know what
that means? That means that 99.999%
of the time, their training is going to
kick in and they're going to make the
right decision. And that means that
fraction that is left over,
a mistake
can be made.
I said a mistake, not an intentional
thing.
the lawyers, the attorneys, those with
law degrees that stood up here and
spoke, I was amazed at how you avoided
due process where if we were talking
about somebody charged with rape, if we
were charged with somebody charged with
murder, if we were talking about
somebody charged with anything else
under title 16 or even title 40,
you'd be holding a press conference and
screaming about due process, the right
to a jury trial, the right to discovery.
I had heard a one of our colleagues come
up here and talk about being struck by a
car. Apparently, he wasn't on the scene
when we see law enforcement officers who
are ran over by automobiles and killed.
He's never seen law enforcement officers
be intentionally ran over when the
vehicle's used as a weapon against law
enforcement officers. And I will tell
you, most law enforcement officers I
know are pretty tough men and women, and
they can handle some pretty tough
adversaries,
but you're never going to beat an
automobile. I can promise you that. I'm
not asking you not to have your opinion.
I'm not asking you to like law
enforcement. And please, for the
hypocrites in the room, which there are
many, I have seen year after year after
year after year, you frothing at the
opportunity to demonize the men and
women who wear the badge,
unless one of them dies,
unless a member of their family dies,
and then everybody wants to dawn a black
veil and pretend that they are law
enforcement's best friend.
And that is not the case. And sadly, it
is not the case in this chamber. It is
not the case in this building, and it is
not the case around this city and other
cities like it. But I've told you before
what I am, and that's what I will always
be. I'm a part of that fraternity. And I
will always be. And until I see you
sitting in a use of force class with me,
until I see you rolling around on the
ground training with me, until I see you
try to handcuff me and realize that
three of you can't
without it becoming extremely violent
and I'm going to get my legs in,
then please do not judge my brothers and
sisters while they're out doing their
job. Ask all the questions you want to
ask, but do not judge. That's for a jury
to do, not you.
And to the senator from the 35th, you
are absolutely right. Sometimes politics
becomes people's gods.
That's why people who claim to be
ministers can stand in the pull pit and
support the murder of unborn children.
And with that, Mr. Chair, Mr. President,
I yield the well.
>> Chair recognizes the senator from the
33rd for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. President, my fellow
senators, colleagues, friends, and
y'all.
This is not my wedding anniversary as
the other senators here came forth, but
it is the fifth anniversary of me and my
girlfriend, Linda. And I want to say,
Linda, I hadn't forgotten you. But while
I'm up here, I want to encourage us to
think about ways we can move together
forward in order to resolve this
situation that's going on because it's
not a good reflection on any of us. I
don't care what your persuasion is, but
I think now moving forward that we
should start dialoguing on how we can
come together and prevent situations
like this from happening in the future.
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield. Well,
thank you, Senator.
You have before you a consent calendar
of privilege resolutions.
Does any senator wish to remove a
resolution from the consent calendar?

the resolutions on the consent calendar?

the consent calendar are adopted.
Thank you, Mr. President. I ask
unanimous consent that HB 377 be
withdrawn from the committee on rules

>> Chair recognizes Senator from the 50th
to speak to his motion.
This one's good job.
>> Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today
to ask that we agree to the House
substitute to Senate Bill 148. Uh, this
Senate bill started out as a project
that myself and the senator from the
fifth were working on for several years
dealing with outdoor education. This
bill passed unanimously last year, went
over to the House. Um, on a personal
note, I was able to benefit greatly from
an outdoor classroom at North Habsham
Middle School. Uh, shout out to my
seventh grade middle school teacher,
Miss Hunt. And I think uh, today's
students should also benefit from that
same opportunity.
Additionally, as this bill progressed,
uh, some other very good items were
placed on the bill. Uh, one deals with
AED requirements, making it easier for
schools to have those automated defiill
devices, external defibrills, excuse me.
Uh, it also when it was in the house, a
provision was added dealing with hunter
safety instruction.
Senator, please suspend for a minute.
All right, senators. This is a important
piece of legislation. Uh if we agree to
it as final passage, I want you all to
understand what it does and I would
appreciate you giving the senator from
the 50th the respect of of being quiet
and listening to him. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President. And lastly, I
want to thank Senator from 31st, senator
from the fourth,
and the senator from I can't remember
his number.
48, excuse me. Uh, this bill also will
be a huge step to supporting our
teachers, uh, which this will allow them
to go from 3 days of personal leave to 5
days of personal leave per school year.
With that, Mr. President, I'm happy to
yield for any questions.
>> You have a question from the Senator the

me is a bipartisan bill. have been

bill and I want to congre thanks to

a little bit while to get it done but uh

>> Chair recognizes the senator from the
41st to speak to the motion.
Thank you, Mr. President. Uh, I rise to
speak to SB 14 170 today. Um, it was a
beautiful bipartisan bill that
originated in this body. Uh and the
House saw fit to use it as a vehicle to
pass something um else which is to
provide um should we choose to
appropriate the funds to provide a fund
for rural hospitals to be able to
purchase generators in the event of they
need generators. Again, this is subject
to appropriations. So if we as a body
decide that that's not how we want to
spend our money, we don't have to.
With that, I will yield for all the
questions.
>> No questions. Senator,
>> thank you. I ask for your favorable uh
consideration on the passage.
>> I apologize.
>> Chair recognizes Senator from the 52nd
for a question.
>> Thank you. Will the senator yield?
>> I sure will. Um, is senator where I do
work in a hospital in in a operating
room and do appreciate it when the
generator comes on at that time. And is
this does the senator have a list of how
many hospitals do not have a backup
generator at this time?
>> No, sir. Senator, I do not have a list.
Um, but I I assure you that anybody
who's laying on the bed when you are
beside them is appreciative as well for
those generators that come on.
Um, is a senator aware that from what
I've seen that that number is zero right
now that don't have a backup generator?
>> Uh, Senator, I am honored to carry a
house vehicle today. This is not uh
originating from my beautiful brain. Uh,
so it's I am apologize that I perhaps do
not have all the information that you
would like for me to have.
>> All right. I just am wondering if this
is a solution in search of a problem.
But thank you for your comments.
>> I I'll simply remind us if we choose if
there's no money to be appropriated for
it, then it doesn't do any good. But
should we find ourselves needing to
appropriate the funds for it, we will
have enacted enacted the law to make it
possible. So, um I do ask for your
favorable consideration, but I certainly
hear uh the senator's concerns.
>> No further questions. Senator
I yield the will. Oh, I'm sorry.
>> Late arriving questions. Senator from
the 32nd.
>> About that, Senator, do you yield?
>> I will yield.
>> Um, Senator, are you aware that federal
law already requires hospitals to have
generators?
>> I am certainly aware of that, ma'am.
>> So, can you would you yield for another
question?
>> Happy to yield. Um, so can you explain
how this bill
is uh not redundant to what already
exists for hospitals? Well, it seems to
me that our colleagues in the House uh
found that it was fit and right to pass
a bill that allows for some funding
resources from the state uh should I
guess these rural hospitals need some
back filling. I'm grateful for the work
of my house colleagues. I do not know
that they were aware of the minds of the
federal government at the time, but uh
here we do have a bill from the house
that is certainly good intentions and
certainly does no harm, which I think as
a physician you uh value. So the bill
does no harm and that's why I'm here to
stand in support of it.
>> Thank you.
>> All right, Senator.
>> Okay, I will yield the well.
>> Okay.
