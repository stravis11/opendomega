House can come to order.
Members will please take your seats.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 916, 916?
Hospital 916, by Rooms and adjourns 159.
Jones in the 47th administration of 104th
and hatched to the 155th.
To be entitled to act to make and provide appropriations
for the state fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2024
and ending June 30th, 2025.
And to make and provide such appropriations
for the operation of the state government
and its department's boards and bureaus.
Still, I'm referring to the committee on appropriations.
Does that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute?
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a committee of the
whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 916, the General Appropriations
bill. The chair appoints the gentleman of the 104th House District Majority Leader
Restoration as chairman to preside over the committee of the whole
Mr. Leader
Thank you miss speaker the chair recognizes the gentleman from the
the 155th District Chairman Matt Hatchett to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Leader.
You know earlier today there was a lot of talk about queens and festivals and I happen
to live where we have a huge festival, the whole month of March, it's the St. Patrick's
festival. And I was trying to figure out what I could say when all that was going on.
And I couldn't say I was a queen, but I've come up with this call me the leprechaun. I should
have had my green jacket today. Today I present House Bill 916, the fiscal year 2025
budget and is set by revenue estimate of $36.1 billion and increase of $3.6 billion or
11.3% over the fiscal year 2024 original budget.
The amended budget is used to make one-time adjustments, some are housekeeping items and
others are workload adjustments.
These past two budget cycles, as we previously discussed,
have provided unprecedented opportunities
to make one-time strategic investments
in our state's infrastructure, be it technology projects
or capital needs.
This base budget provides the opportunity
to make impactful and permanent changes
in the state budget and policy.
It provided the budget as recommended by the governor did just that.
It provided a good foundation and we support and thank the governor for including a number
of items that were priorities of the General Assembly that we would not be able to fund
on our own.
You'll see throughout the document that many of the House priorities we included in the
budget last year are repeated in fiscal 2025 budget.
That's because these priorities reflect the needs of Georgians.
We know what the needs are because our constituents, friends and neighbors tell us at church, the grocery
store, at community events, over the phone and by email.
The needs of Georgians haven't changed in the last year, so neither have our priorities.
The budget is how we tell them we hear you.
We really and truly have one job at the State Capitol, and that is to be the appropriators.
If we can't do that, then why are we here?
There are a number of good items in this budget, 1170 lines of changes to be exact.
Because when you get caught in the weeds of each line item, you miss the powerful cumulative
effect of the good in this document.
So let me give you the highlights.
You don't have to sit through very many budget hearings to understand that agency attrition
is a problem.
As I mentioned in my remarks during the amended budget, the slow and steady increases in
state salary, both across the board and targeted increases in state salary in our most critical
positions is moving the needle on state employment, employee recruitment and retention.
The governor's budget includes in the House agrees with over $250 million to provide
state employees with a 4% pay raise.
The governor's budget also includes additional $3,000 salary adjustments for law enforcement
and correctional officers above the 4% along the priority of this house.
This brings the new starting salary to nearly $45,000 for correctional officers and $64,000
for a state trooper.
The budget also includes targeted salary adjustments
for other high turnover or difficult to fill positions,
including for case workers, child welfare, child support,
and elder abuse at the Department of Human Services.
Nurses and compliance specialists
who license and inspect our long-term care facilities
and consumer protection workers at the Department of Ag
to inspect and ensure the safety of our food and crime lab scientists and technicians
and regional investigative personnel at the GBI working to process evidence and bring
justice to crime victims.
Justice cannot be served if there is not an adequate and seasoned supply of prosecuting
attorneys to successfully bring charges against those who break the laws of this state and
seat to harm others. Over the course of several meetings, we've been stunned by the testimony
of the Prosecuting Attorney's Council. Statewide, the vacancy rate for assistant district
attorneys or ADA's is 10%. But a further look into the data reveals that 11 circuits currently
We have a vacancy rate greater than 25%, with one circuit currently with a vacancy rate
of 63%, with only three of eight positions filled.
The five-year average turnover is nearly 25%.
There may be a combination of factors contributing to these statistics including leadership and
workload, but there's no doubt with a starting salary of $58,000 compensation
is absolutely a factor.
To move the needle and bring stability to DA's offices
across the state, PAC has requested
and the House has fully funded their request
for $15.2 million to lift the whole salary schedule
and bring the starting salary for ADA's
to a more competitive $71,000 to be clear.
This is an adjustment is not for the district attorneys
themselves, but for the ADA's who are involved in the day-to-day prosecution.
The House also funds $2.5 million for targeted salary adjustments to address recruitment
and retention issues for staff and attorneys at the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals,
recognizing that these courts have a constitutional obligation to complete their
docket within the term and cannot do so without adequate support and professional staff.
The House also funds $3.2 million for the Department of Law to fully implement a pay raise
adjustment initiated last year to stabilize a turnover within that department.
You've already debated and approved House Bill 947 to change the structure of judicial
compensation for superior court judges, appellate judges, and the judges of the Georgia Supreme
Court.
This budget provides $10.6 million to phase in the salary increase over a two-year period.
The budget also includes a $2,500 pay increase for teachers.
Since the beginning of this administration, the base teacher salary will have increased
by nearly $10,000 and Georgia continues to dominate the southeast in the average teacher
salary.
it all into education, in addition to the more than $380 million in regular formula growth
for QBE and equalization, the House wholeheartedly supports the governor's unprecedented investments
in people transportation and school security.
With QBE fully funded, our attention now turns to the other formula that is a partnership
between the state and local school systems that has historically been underfunded until
now. This budget includes an infusion of $204 million to reflect current
bus count and mileage figures not updated in more than a decade and an
increase in operating to 40% of cost. This investment more than doubles the
state spending for people transportation and benefits all systems rural and
urban, small, and large.
We all know that a lot has changed since many of us were in school, and there's nothing
that's more important than the safety of the children who are entrusted to our care.
That's why over the past several years, the General Assembly has made direct investments
to enhance the safety and security of our public school buildings, $85 million in one
time appropriations since fiscal year 2019. But no money has been appropriated for ongoing
security needs until now. Recognizing that many school systems have their own police department
and others contract with city or county law enforcement agencies for services,
that expense has solely been borne by local school systems. The state provides $104 million
to provide a permanent funding stream of $45,000 per school to enhance school security
services and personnel.
Last year, this body attempted to fund something new.
The student share of the cost of reduced price breakfast and lunch.
While the state money for this endeavor didn't make it across the finish line, the Department
of educational is able to use one-time federal funds to meet this expense for children and
I thank the superintendent and the board for making that happen.
Not much has changed since last year.
Food prices are still high and kids are still not able to learn if they're hungry.
I heard from many of you last year in this item was one of the items you were most proud
of that that we funded in the budget. Many of you have personally shared with me the
difference this funding makes in your community. And that's why the house version of the budget
again includes $6.3 million in the Department of Education budget to cover the cost of
breakfast and lunch for reduced price students. This is expected to cover the cost of more
than 15 million meals for students.
This budget makes a huge investment in the health care infrastructure of our state.
I want to thank the governor for leading the way with $146 million for full funding of
three provider rate studies for the now comp waiver, independent care, and elderly disabled
and behavioral health provider rate adjustments.
Adequately compensating providers ensures access to care.
That's why the House funds $27 million in Medicaid provider rate adjustments,
including the Georgia Pediatric Program or GAP,
speech therapists, audiologists, physical therapists and occupational therapists, primary
care physicians and obstetricians and optometrist to name a few.
The House also provides $9.6 million to include basic dental care as a coverage service for
the Medicaid population.
I know this initiative is important to many of you who are determined to make this coverage
a reality for your constituents.
This House fully supports the Governor's recommendation of $1.5 million in the Department
of Community Help for new positions to monitor, evaluate, and improve the care management
organization oversight.
This will be one of the things that we will remember we have done.
health continues to be a priority of this house. And that's reflected in this budget
with $2 million dedicated to the Apex program to expand mental health services in schools.
$3.2 million for jail-based competency restoration programs in Dodge and Cobb counties. And $3.2 million
in DBHCD to operationalize a new crisis stabilization unit in making design to support adults with
intellectual and developmental disabilities. Georgia cannot receive the behavioral health
resources they need without an adequate network of providers. That's why this house budget
includes one and a half million dollars to establish the David Rosston Center for behavioral
health and developmental disabilities at the University of Georgia.
This center will offer degrees to boost the pipeline of professionals needed to work
in behavioral health and serve as a clearing house for research and best practices.
Continuing in human services, the house provides $8.9 million for a 3% provider increase
for child-caring institutions, child-placing agencies, foster parents, and relative caregivers
to recognize the rising cost of providing this service.
Additionally, $1 million is provided for additional supports for the court-appointed special advocates
or CASA, and $1.2 million for Georgia family connections.
We've all heard a lot over the past several years about the VOCA cliff.
Let me be clear about something.
This budget does not backfill the VOCA funds.
What this budget does is use state money to find more than $20.4 million in state mandated
services and expectations for domestic, violent shelters, sexual assault centers and child
advocacy centers, recognizing the vital and needed services that they provide to Georgians
who are in their most vulnerable place.
The House also provides $2.7 million to support the operations of the Georgia Crime Victims
emergency fund. The fund should be used for just that to offset the cost of
services needed to help victims of crime's recover and move forward.
There's been a lot of talk this session about housing. There are several house
changes that relate to housing homelessness and needed supports that span
across several agencies and policy areas in this budget, $1 million in the Department
of Community Affairs to create the Accountable Housing Initiative.
This new initiative will provide funds for organizations that help homeless individuals
obtain stable immediate housing in the short term in order to achieve affordable housing
in the long term.
This funding is in addition to the $3.8 million the House agreed with the governor to fund
in the state housing trust fund to pursue new federal grant opportunities for homelessness
services and $6 million in one Georgia to continue the workforce housing program.
In D.B.H.D., $2.9 million is provided to support Georgia's experiencing homelessness by funding
over 300 new housing voucher slots $425,000 is provided for behavioral health and support
services for those experiencing homelessness and $125,000, $121,250 for the Department of
Veteran Services to hire a coordinator to work with veterans experiencing homelessness.
All of this funding, which totals around $14 million, is in addition to the $2.9 million
added in the amended budget for the State Housing Trust Fund to leverage federal funds
for the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program.
In closing, I'd like to offer thanks to all those that make this budget happen.
Christine Murdoch and her entire house budget and research team.
They spend countless hours during session and after session gathering as our speaker likes
to say the facts on our many agencies and budget requests. To the Appropriations Committee
Vice-Chairs, thank you for digging deep to bring great items forward for consideration
into this document. And I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge
Representative is Parkle in Houston for their many years of support to the budget.
And I'm going to break away from protocol.
Clay, I think I think you understand the transportation budget better than anyone in the state.
And Miss Penny, no one, and I mean no one, has more love for the people of this state
than you, and it shows every day as you dig down on issues for all Georgians, you are
truly a conservative leader with a heart of gold.

stress try. All right. It's chairman to yield for questions. Yes sir. Chair

needed FQHCs throughout the state? Yes that is correct. Does the gentleman
further yield? Yes ma'am. Is it not true that we included increase for Medicaid reimbursement
for very needed physicians and therapists and things throughout the state and it's going
to help us to increase the number of doctors and providers in the area of Medicaid? Yes it
is and it's a known fact that we constantly are losing providers because we don't reimburse
them enough. And do you further yield? Yes. And finally, doesn't this budget help us

Yes.
Is it not further true that this budget includes a $2,500 salary increase or a bonus for pre-K teachers,
along with K through 12 public education teachers?
Yes, it does and you know right now I think our average teacher pay is around $67,000.
and this will actually take the average teacher pay
to just under $70,000 a year, leading the southeast
and many other states in the union.
This is in a minute for a few more questions.
Yes, sir.
Is it not true that this budget fully funds a hope scholarship
and the hope grant and includes $100 million
for school security?
Yes.

We'll move on to afternoon orders.
Cheerleady Darling Taylor is recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I want to share a brief history of
an outstanding woman in American history, Sandra Day O'Connor. She was an
American attorney, politician and jurors, who served on the U.S. Supreme Court
from 1981 to 2006. O'Connor was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and
became the first woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. She was
confirmed unanimously. Before her tenure on the court, she was an Arizona State
judge and earlier an elected legislator in Arizona, serving as the first
female majority leader in a state senate. During her term on the court she was
known for her well-researched opinions. O'Connor was regarded among the most
powerful women in the world. After retiring, Justice O'Connor succeeded Henry Kissinger
as the chancellor of William & Mary College. She remained an active advocate for
for judicial justice and the rule of law.
In recognition of her lifetime accomplishments,
President Obama awarded Justice O'Connor
the nation's highest civil honor,
the presidential medal of freedom.
I would like to leave you with some words of wisdom from her.
Quote, do the best you can in every task,
no matter how unimportant you may seem at the time.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.

Thank you, Representative.
Okay, we have a great announcement that concerns this house.

Jim and Powell.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House,
we stand here today to be proud to present to this House
the Governor's Cup trophy for the annual golf tournament
between the House, the Lower Body, the Senate,
the Governor's Office, and the lobbyist or the business people
of the State of Georgia.
This tournament was started back in the mid-90s and of course you'll be happy to know that your house teams
have predominantly won most years. Now there's a few years that there was a little cheatnet went on.
You know I continue to tell people about golf what a great character builder it is
if you play by the rules. But a few times it's one and it's questionable because if you lose a ball
you don't, you're supposed to add a stroke and not take one off.
This past year it was played again down at the Shelman's Bluff course and Chairman DeLochis
course of course.
And we were victorious in that at a hard fault struggle.
The Senate, certain members of the Senate, did make a considerable wager to the House
team and some people in the house team predominantly the captain took that that
wager and they still hadn't paid that bet as best I can tell but you know
that's all right they've got a little bit of time before I come to Will and I
really talk about folks who don't pay debts or who might cheat it to Game of
God so I would tell you for each and every member of this house we've had
dance off contest, we've had basketball tournaments of a good friend in nature, but we take this
pretty serious about golf. Because golf is one of those sports that builds character. We have a
golfing industry in this state that brings in about $6 billion plus, not to say or forget that we
have two of the most famous golf facilities in the whole world of gusting national being one
and each lake being another.
And Georgia is a golfing state.
So on behalf of this team, go house.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Good.
The members of the house, there's a resolution here
to be signed, creating golf day next.
I believe it's next week or week after.
And remember how much golf contributes
our economy, not including getting people out of the way from doing stupid things while
they're hitting the golf ball.
Congratulations golf team.
Mr. Chairman, if you will just give us the names of those unpaid waivers, as unpaid
bench, we'll hold their bills.
They certainly won't move forward.
That's awesome, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Gladney, talking about Augusta, is represented to speak to a afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
In honor of Women's Day, Women's History Day, Women's History Month, honoring Ambassador
Dr. Sharon Brown, who joins us today accompanied by her husband, Dr. LC Miles, both of Augusta.
We celebrate her today in recognition of women's history.
She's not only a survivor of her own first-hand horrific dark experience of human traffic
and exploitation, but she has bravely turned that tragic circumstance into an empowering
opportunity to inspire others through her humanitarian work at the United States Office
of Victims of Crime and Center for Human Trafficking, among many, many other organizations
that the speaker would not allow me to have time to say them all.
Her book and life story can be found how I found the power of my voice in the Library
of Congress. Please recognize and honor Ambassador Dr. Sharon Brown. Thank you so much. We will
honor you with this resolution signed by my colleagues who support that struggle for women. Thank you
so much for being here today. You can meet us in the Annie Room for a picture. Thank you for being here.
