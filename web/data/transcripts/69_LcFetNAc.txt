TRANSCRIPT
----------
They are of convening having arrived.
All members of this house will please report to their assigned seats.
All members of the house will please report to their seats.
Mr. Clerk, we're in the mail.
All right, we're about to have the morning roll call.
We are about to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Well,
good morning. I guess this is the equivalent of a Friday, huh? Yeah. Okay. We will begin
our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman
from the 21st House District Representative Brad Thomas, Representative Thomas.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I'm proud to introduce to you my friend and constituent
pastor Fred Goodwin. Before receiving a dramatic call to the ordained
ministry as an Anglican priest, Pastor Fred graduated from the U.S.
Naval Academy in 1975 and flew carrier-based aircraft. He served as a youth
pastor, senior pastor, national teacher, and he and his wife, who was also his
high school sweetheart, Jill made their home in Cherokee County. They have three
married sons and eight grandchildren. Pastor Fred is a leader in our community serving
as senior pastor. He's president of the Cherokee ministerial association before
retiring in 2019 and currently he serves the chairman of the board of serve
international. Serb international is a Cherokee based ministry that last year served
8.5 million meals and as they shared their love of Christ. Also he coaches
He coaches pastors. He's a middle school track, assistant track coach. And on a personal
note, I've always believed that God brings people together when he knows that you need
each other. And God brought pastor Fred into my life. And I told you that he was a friend,
but he's more than a friend of me, he's confident.
As I struggle and I have my own tribulations in life,
he's the one person I know that I can call
and to be there for me and to help guide me through.
And it is really an honor today
for me to introduce all of him to you.
Thank you.
Brad, I'd really love to meet that man.
Sounds very interesting.
Mr. Speaker, Brad Distinguished Representatives
and guess, it really isn't honor to be here with you today.
You can probably imagine, after nearly 40 years
of ordained ministry, I could wax many, many hours,
if I were given that time, on any scripture passage
that you like and tell many stories.
But I'd love to go back even before that,
because 50 years ago this year, I did start as a plea,
but the Naval Academy.
And I found that structured discipline,
having been raised by a Marine Corps sergeant
from the Second World War, fit my lifestyle.
I love the challenge.
And even though it was plea beer,
as many of you freshman representatives know,
they it's a lot to learn.
Yet I was doing well.
And yet there was a question that was asked of me
by one of my classmates near the end of that first year
that I shall never forget.
We had just finished our workout in lightweight crew.
We were standing by the boat house, and he turned to me and said, Fred, why do you take
this game so seriously?
And I had absolutely no idea what he's talking about.
So I said, what game are you talking about?
And he said, Fred, it's all a game.
What's remarkable is he never went any further.
And that question never got out of the insides of my being.
So I finished up my remaining three years of the Academy, did very well.
Graduated with honors was on the fast track for the space program.
As Brad said, married my high school, sweetheart Jill 10 days later, off to flight training.
Got my wings as a backseater and reported to duty in San Diego, flying S3 anti-submarine
aircraft off of carriers.
And once again, just getting all the checks in the box, you all know the game.
got to get the check in the box and getting all those evaluations that said
early command and everything else. Until that one day I was flying a mission of
tracking Soviet submarines about 300 miles off the coast of Southern California.
It was a secret mission so we were not filed in those days with FAA or anyone
else. Dropping sonobois which are listening devices into the water, flying
about 200 feet off the deck and listening and we were indeed tracking a Soviet
missile submarine.
When suddenly there was a sound in the aircraft like a shotgun going off and I leaned forward
from my back seat and saw that our windshield cracked.
The next words I heard I'll never forget, the pilot said to me, Fred, if this glass
implodes, that is if the glass comes in on us, get you in the sensor out.
The sensor was the enlisted man sitting next to me who processed all the technical equipment.
I was a mission specialist, and what the pilot was essentially doing is telling me that
if the glass came in, the two of them would already be dead, and he was given me permission
to eject out of the aircraft.
I began crying out, Mayday, Mayday, November Golf 702.
Mayday, Mayday, November Golf 702, and of course no one responded.
No one knew we were there, and we drove to the horizon, and therefore our radio signal
didn't get there.
We could quickly check the radar and found we didn't have any ships on the horizon.
We were also flying over sharp, infested waters.
The survival rate of the ejection seat in the S3 was not that good.
And it was an interesting time in life, you can imagine.
Eventually, as we climbed to the lighter altitudes in the hopes that the air would not destroy
our windscreen.
My arms came off the primary ejection harness over my head, and one arm went between my legs
for the auxiliary harness to eject, allowing me to take my hand and get below my torso harness
into my flight suit and pull out a little book I'd been given by the Gideons when I graduated
from the Academy.
And I turned to the one song I remembered reading, and I read the Lord as my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leaves me beside quiet waters.
He restores my soul.
And as I continued crying out Mayday, Mayday without any response, I realized the next face
I probably would encounter was the face of Jesus, the Christ.
And I knew at that moment I was not ready.
I'd lived my life for myself, for my goals, for my dreams, and taught my wife to do the
same, to live for my goals, my dreams.
I had mastered the game.
Now I was confronted with a vastly different reality.
I wasn't sure about my destination.
And as you all know, I'm sure if you don't know your destination, how will you
ever get there. We just spend our lives wandering. Yes, eventually, the Los Angeles
Tower heard our Mayday and asked, what are your intentions in November golf? And I
replied, sir, we just want to get home. When we finally got home, reached the
beach as we called it. I began to commit myself to figuring out what life was
really all about, because it clearly wasn't about me anymore. After considering many
careers, yes, including politics, I realized God wanted something else. And some months
later, on my knees, I said, Lord, I'm yours. I need you in my life. So yes, I committed
to a vastly different path.
And when I was offered an opportunity
to get educated in a specific program for this space program,
I replied, no, thank you.
I have another purpose in life.
I'm here to remind you today that you all
have a very special purpose in life.
We who know this language refer to it as a calling.
And we realized this not about how much we accomplished
in a given day, though you all have
accomplish much. It's not about pleasing everybody because we never can. It isn't
necessarily feeling good about what people think about us because while their
opinion is nice, the ultimate opinion is the one who died for us, who rose for us.
The one in whose presence we will one day stand and hopefully and willingly
drop to our knees. My brothers and sisters, I like you. Try to serve. I serve
Christ by trying to serve other people, serving malnourished people around the
world and trying to get food to the hungry and well right now or in four counties.
And if you need to get food then contact Brad Thomas and he'll give you my
My contaction will get some food for your people.
Because ultimately what matters is not everybody else's opinion, or whether we had a good
day, but whether our audience of one is pleased, isn't that right?
So I'm here to remind you of the one who will be standing waiting for you when it's all
done.
I'm here to remind you that we have one who died for us.
rose to give us hope and a new life. I invite you to recommit yourself to what really matters.
It's where we work together. It's where we serve others. And when the end of the day,
we turn to Lord and say, Lord, I hope you're pleased with me. And if not,
the word forgive me because I want you to be pleased tomorrow. Would you please stand
as I pray over you? Blessed and holy Father, we need you. We need your blessing. We can
get distracted by so many needs in this world. And so Father, I ask the anointing of your
Holy Spirit now in the Holy Name of Jesus.
Upon these, your servants, these leaders upon whom we all
endure to depend, they would continue to work together,
but they would continue to encourage each other,
that they would make the decisions that need to be made,
to be agents of blessing, hope, and life.
Lord, we need you, and we need these, your leaders,
so bless them now in the holy name of Jesus. Amen. I invite you to draw your attention to the flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
which stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today, I would like to honor a bullet-canny woman, Linda Brannon-Williamson, whose dream
was to leave a legacy that would encourage and prepare young women in Southeast Georgia
for a professional role in leadership.
was a great example of selfless service, devotion to her family, her church, her community,
and a job that she loved with Georgia Power.
She never missed an opportunity to encourage others and met life with a smile.
During her lifetime she broke professional barriers for women with respect, honor, and humility.
In Linda's last year of life, she shared her dream with two of her best friends and expressed
regret that cancer was not going to allow her to develop her ideas. Those friends encouraged
Linda to move forward her dream and make it a reality. Linda gained renewed strength and
energy and she researched successful foundation boards and she even had the privilege of
appointing the founding board members. I'm proud to say that I was appointed by her and
and continue to serve on this board today.
Cancer did not win.
The LBW Foundation was established in August of 2014,
and the first graduating class was in 2015.
The Academy has graduated a class every year since.
In 2019, this Academy expanded into Rome, Georgia.
And in future years, other plans have
been made for other expansions across the state of Georgia.
In this same year, the LBW Foundation
received the Innovation and Community Leadership Award
from UGA's JW Fanding Institute for Leadership.
This institute facilitates the Academy every year,
bringing premier content and speakers
to each of the eight sessions.
I have hosted one of the sessions annually
since 2015 and many of you have participated in it
to bring the class to the Capitol to hear legislators
and other professional women to share a bit
about their journey into leadership.
Nominees come from Academy alumni, board members,
businesses, and community members.
Yes, we lost Linda, but hertering lives on
and will continue to impact future generations
of great leaders.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Lynn Smith for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
My capsule of history for women's history month is about a woman known as Susan Cobb,
Milton Ackinson.
She was the first lady of Georgia as the wife of Governor William Yates Ackinson, who
service governor from 1894 to 1898. She used her position to advocate for state
funding for women to attend college, which led to the Georgia College and
State University. From there she went into the insurance business and later in
life she served as the post-Mrs. Inunin, a title given to her by President
Theodore Roosevelt. First Lady Ackinson was not only a visionary but a
And a leader for her time, a time where women did not have the right to vote.
I'm certain if she could see noon and now in 2021, she would be pleased to know that
her legacy of service is being followed by one of her descendants, Luanne Connell, my
neighbor and friend.
She is still carrying the torch for the well-being and advancement of women.
And that is a circle of life with history to know that your legacy can live on.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Scothield
for a morning order.
All right.
Just trying to get him all up here.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
Each year, I stand before you to recognize Lupus Advocacy Day.
Each year, the House and Senate stand together to publicly support and acknowledge over 55,000
Georgians living with or impacted by Lupus.
I am very thankful and appreciative of my colleagues.
This year, our event will be held virtually at 7pm tonight, but we as members of the
Georgia General Assembly have a House Senate Resolution Governor's
Proclamation and we wear our lupus capes in solidarity of the strength that it
takes to live with lupus. Our work continues. Mr. Speaker, this flood of purple
yields the well.
Chair recognizes the representative Hutchinson for a morning order.
Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson for a morning
order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today we come down to the well to thank our legislative delegation at the federal level
for the hard work they did in passing the American rescue plan.
So that will provide immediate relief to middle class
Georgians across the state.
I know there's some concern about the fact
that we might not be able to cut taxes,
but I think everybody will appreciate the $10,200
that will not be taxed unemployment.
That's a real tax cut to Georgians, almost $600.
They'll appreciate the stimulus checks that they'll be getting.
They'll appreciate the help to our local restaurants.
I think they'll appreciate all those things.
I just want to say thank you and that we look forward
working with this whole house as we have some great legislation in deciding what we're
going to do with five billion five billion dollars and with that I yield the well thank
you chair recognizes representative McLeod for a morning order thank you mr.
speaker and big up to my colleague today I've come to the well to declare that
The leadership has come back to the United States of America and to let you know that
health is on the way.
With the American Rescue Act, Georgia will receive $5 billion.
My County Gwyneth will receive $181 million.
Gwyneth County Public School System will receive $279 million.
$79 million.
The American Rescue Plan cuts the cost to expand Medicaid so that between 350,000 to 500,000
Georgians could gain access to health care.
This package also provides billions of dollars to disadvantaged farmers, especially black
farmers.
Experts say this is one of the most impactful legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Farm Bureau stated that $10.4 billion out of the American Rescue Plan will support
agriculture.
So I want to correct the record.
Yesterday my colleague tasted that the Rescue Plan would prevent us from giving tax credits
to farmers.
This is false.
Yes my friends, help us on the way.
Americans deserve a return on investment.
all after the communities have been impacted by the COVID-19 virus. And again, this is the first
anniversary of the fact that the pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020, to be an epidemic,
a pandemic. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson
We're a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I apologize for being late
Today on the one-year anniversary of shutting down the state for COVID I bring to you a
future chef and future
pop star
Michael
Who is a kind, respectful, fun loving and family-oriented boy who enjoys spending time with family
helping others and working with organizations that provides meals to those in need.
Colleagues, Michael is one of the hundreds of beautiful children that are available for adoption today in Georgia.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
Okay, we're about to go on to the rules calendar.
Before we go to the rules calendar, I got something I just need to say.
You know, last week, the rules chairman from the other lesser chamber came over to visit.
We gave him a warm and gracious welcome, but you know, no good deed goes unpunished.
So, he understand he went to the well yesterday to complain about this chamber.
And you know, nobody disrespects this house.
I have sent a message over there that, you know, I think they're afraid of the dark
in this over there because they don't like to work after it gets dark.
they proved that cross-over day. And I understand now why they voted down the compensation bill because
I guess they think they're being paid too much for what they do as it is.
So, but I've asked Chairman Smith to move some Senate activity and he has.
So we have one bill on the rules calendar today.
Clark will read the caption to Senate Bill 4.
Senate Bill 4, Westerner Cropatric of 32nd Roberts in the 29th red of the 33rd
Berk of the 11th and Watson in the 1st.
We title an act to amend chapter 5 of the title 26.
The fiscal Georgia annotated relating to drug abuse treatment and education programs.
So to prohibit patient brokering this bill,
I'm referring to the committee on insurance.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes representative Reeves
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I don't know if I'm excited or scared now
that I'm in here on the first Senate bill.
I have the session here for the House,
but I mean, my God, these Senate bills need lots of work.
They need a lot of work.
yesterday in my subcommittee, we started some of those processes and good Lord they need
a lot of work, but I am happy to tell y'all that this Senate Bill 4 is actually, this
is a great bill. It's a bill that's actually personal to me. Myself and Senator Kirkpatrick
have been working on this issue for several years. We have a non-profit recovery center
in Cobb County that's called the Davis Direction Foundation and it was one of our school counselors,
a very active person in the community, lost her son who was a student at KSU to a heroin overdose,
and she's dedicated the rest of her life to addiction recovery. And she has started the Davis
Direction Foundation in the zone in Cobb County and has become a leader in the state of Georgia
that she's set a model that the rest of the state is following.
And she's frankly developed a voice on the national scale.
But with the rise of how we treat substance abuse differently
and how our different approach to recovery,
instead of criminalizing, we focus on recovery.
Anytime an industry develops, there's always bad players.
There's always bad players that come up
and figure out how they can make a buck.
One of the issues that I've been dealing with in my district
is the concept of these sober man houses
that are totally unregulated,
where there's not necessarily anything good going on there,
but there's somebody that's getting
to build an insurance company.
So instead of flipping houses these days,
we just turn them into sober man houses.
There is a lot of aspects of this industry that are shady.
And there are two, there's patient brokowing
with referrals where people are essentially committing
what should be fraudulent acts and making money,
figuring out how to make money.
And then significantly, there's this drug testing.
Many of you might be aware there's
what we call multi-panel drug screens,
where they take one drug screen and it tests
for five or seven different substances.
And because you've got insurance involved in all this,
which is a good thing, there are some testers
that are breaking if it's a five-panel drug screen,
even though it comes from one year in screen,
they're breaking it into five separate tests
and they're building accordingly.
And that's just wrong, they've figured there've been ways
that folks have figured out loopholes
on how to gain the system on this.
Florida, which is a state that much like Georgia
has suffered with substance abuse in a lot of ways.
And a few years ago, the state of Florida passed a bill
that did the same exact things that we're doing in this bill.
And ironically, what happened was a lot of those players
in Florida just moved on up across the state line
and set up shop in Georgia.
And now they're essentially predators.
And this is going to allow the state
to regulate these things and the Department of Insurance.
So this is a great bill and I'll yield for questions,
Mr. Speaker.
Do you yield for questions?
I do.
Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson
to your ride up in the gallery for a question.
Thank you.
Do you yield?
I do.
Is it not true that I am a mental health provider who also
provides addiction treatment?
If the general lady says speaks, yes.
I do so say since 2002, I have been a mental health provider
who also provides substance abuse treatment.
Is it not further true that I am contacted constantly
to offer referrals for a fee.
If you say speak, yes.
I do, and I just wanna say thank you
for bringing up this bill
because this is a problem that really needed
to be addressed in Georgia, so I appreciate you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative.
I'll yield for one more question if I can ask you.
Chair recognizes Representative Williamson
to your right for a question.
Mr. General, Neil.
I do.
Is it not further to a representative
that these sober houses are a blight
on all of our communities across Georgia,
and the ultimate harm is being done
to those men and women that these houses
are purportedly there to serve.
Is that not true?
It is true, and the problem with these sober houses,
I have a neighborhood in my district
where about five or seven have popped up in the neighborhood,
and it's frankly changed the nature of the neighborhood.
These are because the Constitution considers addiction recovery to be a disability, these
sober houses enjoy a constitutional protection that makes it very difficult for local communities
by zoning and other methods to control this.
And so they're really fitting through a loophole that, frankly, we need Congress to act
on that.
But what this is doing is we're trying to figure out all the ways that we can bring accountability
through regulation. It's a multi-step process and we'll continue to see legislation like this,
but thank you for your question. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well.
Gentlemen has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting
the committee substitute. The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee
is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote
aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
What purpose does representative mom to hand rise?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Rule 138 and I'd like to be excused from this vote.
Gentlemen, has that right and the journal will so reflect?
Have all members voted?
have all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 4.
The eyes are 151, the nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed. What purpose does Chairman Martin rise to make a
motion to state your motion? I move that Senate resolution 154 be moved to the
committee on house higher education from the committee on insurance both
chairs agree. Clerk will read the caption. Senate resolution number 154 by
Senator R.O. of 36, sub-steadler of the 52nd malls, the 53rd and Butler of the 55th, a resolution
creating a joint study committee for strengthening Georgia's future workforce.
On the gentleman's motion that Senate Resolution 154 be transferred from the insurance committee
to the Higher Education Committee. Is there objection? Is there objection? The Chair
hears none and it is so ordered. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons for a motion.

Chairman Parsons moves that this House agree to the Senate Substitute to House Bill
156.
The clerk will read the caption.
House Bill 156 by Representative Parsons, the 44th Martin, the 49th Kelly, the 16th and
others to be titled an act to amend title 38 and title and 50 of the fiscal
to Georgia annotated relating to military emergency management and veteran
affairs in state government. Chair recognizes Chairman Parsons to explain his
motion. Thank you Speaker Rustin. We we passed House Bill 156 out this
chamber about two or three weeks ago unanimously. You will recall this is a
bill that sets up a process for agencies, state agencies, county, local government agencies
to report cyber attacks, breaches, cyber ransomware attacks, things of that nature to the director
of emergency management and home and security. The Senate passed a bill with no changes
to the language that we adopted over here. There were two things added that are very important
and I completely agree with and I would ask you to agree also.
We added that there'd be nothing in this code section
that would relieve any agency or any utility
from notifying customers if there had been a breach
that involved them.
And it also added this, which is very important, I think.
If the governor makes a determination
that a memorandum of agreement with one or more
of the major military commands established in the state
would substantially enhance the education or job placement of Georgians in the areas
of science, technology, engineering, math, or cybersecurity, he's authorized to enter
into such agreement and any state expenditures would have to be provided in accordance
with the appropriations.
And that's it.
That's the bill.
That's the changes that were made in the Senate.
Mr. Speaker, for any questions, I'll be glad to try to answer them.
You do not have any questions.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that the House and you agree
with the Senate substitute to House Bill 156.
I yield well.

Mr. Clerk, please read House Rule 1.10 and 1.11.

For two days in a row, the chair has received complaints that members are either
own cell phones or their cell phones are going off during the devotion.
Now, I know I'm a little bit lenient on during session, but I am not going to tolerate the
use of a cell phone or hearing a cell phone during the devotion each day.
I'm just not.
So I want you to be mindful of that tomorrow.
And I also want you to reflect a little bit.
This is what I read the room for.
But the last two, a couple of three days, I am convinced that the most dangerous place in Georgia
is in front of the any-room doors right before we lock the door to do the devotion.
If you're on the other side of that door, you can get killed.
And I bring that up and we laugh about it, but if you know, we bring
ministers from all over the state here and they're sitting up here watching
the Exodus and it's not a good look. So I just wanted to call your attention to that. Thank you
for letting me talk about that a little bit. Clark will read the caption to a group of privileged

Everyone, I think you know now that Sunday is a big day because we spring forward an
