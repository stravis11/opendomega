As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 117th House District Representative Lauren Daniel. Representative Daniel. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, all. I came with lots of prepared remarks. Somebody told me, berevity was best, but not in this case. I have lots of nice things to say. So buckle in and listen please. I rise before you this morning to introduce to you somebody. I consider a dear friend. Oddly enough, he's been coming as our chaplain of the day for over 30 years. That's older than I am. I hope that he's been here more days than I have. But I hope that he does have something to offer to you today, and the same way he's offered a lot to my life and my family's life. Dr. Benny Tate has many accolades. He leads thousands of people and oversees many, many ministries. But actually brought with me a quote from one of his Sunday messages that I'd like to share. And it says, the world views success by what you gain, but significance is measured by the impact your life has on other people. And I think this quote sums up who Pastor Benny is pretty well. And I have no doubt that heaven will be bigger because of his impact. It is my honor to introduce to you today my pastor, Dr. Benny Tate. Welcome. God bless you. Good morning. It's great to be here. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Daniel, after that introduction, I'm looking forward to hearing myself. Hey, man. She was very kind. I have been coming. I have been coming for better than 30 years. And I remember the first time I came, I was just as nervous as could be. I mean, I was a... Mr. Speaker, I was so nervous. I mean, I really was. And I kind of felt like that young preacher that got his first pastor in the heels of Kentucky. And his first Sunday there, he was going to preach. And he preached on the dangers of tobacco. And after the service was over, the chairman of the Deacon said, we need to talk. Do you realize where you're at? You're in Kentucky. Tobacco is a cash crop here. He said, oh, I just wasn't aware. So the second Sunday he got up, he preached on the dangers of alcohol. And the chairman of the Deacon said, we need to talk. A lot of our people work at the Budweiser distribution plant. He said, I just didn't know. I just didn't know. The third week he got up, he preached on the dangers of gambling. And the chairman of the Deacon said, we need to talk. You've got to understand that we have the program here. And it pays for our children's education. And you just don't need to go there. And so the fourth week he got up, he preached on the dangers of scuba diving in international water. I say, man. So I'm just honored to get to be here. And I just, hey, listen, I appreciate you making me welcome. But I wish you would do me a favor. Would you make welcome the eighth grade class at our academy, our school. They're in the balcony today. It's the Rock Springs Christian Academy. Thank you. Thank you. I want to share one verse of scripture with you. And just, I'll say to you, what Elizabeth Taylor said to her eighth husband, I'm not going to keep you long. I'll be brief. And the first scripture in John chapter 15 verse seven says this, if you abide in me and my words abide in you, you should ask what you will. And it should be done into you. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you will ask what you will. And it should be done unto you. I get this wonderful privilege today to speak to you wonderful people. And I appreciate your service. I were great state. But I get this wonderful privilege because our founding fathers met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in Independence Hall. And for about after about five weeks, they had been debating about state rights. And they just couldn't agree on the Constitution. And there was a man by the name of Benjamin Franklin, who stood and he said these words. He said, we need the father of life to illuminate our minds. And Benjamin Franklin said, if if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without God noticing it, do we really think a nation can rise without his aid? And he said, men, we need to pray. And that started this tradition that I get the privilege today of sharing with you. This privilege of starting this session with prayer. I think we can all agree that Abraham Lincoln was a great president. He led our nation probably during the most difficult time. And Abraham Lincoln said these words. He said, I've been driven to my knees by an overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My wisdom and all about me seemed insufficient in the day. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it should be done. Three simple steps. Step number one, it's so important that we abide. It's so important that we stay close to God no matter what. Stay close to God. I heard about a couple, Chester and his wife. They were in their 80s and one day they were driving and they saw this young couple, kind of like Speaker Daniel. Kind of like you and Zach. And she was setting right up under him. Right up under him. You couldn't tell it. One person was driving the automobile or two. And that older couple in their 80s, she looked over at Chester. That was his name. And she said, Chester, I remember when it used to be that way with us. Chester said, I do too. And I haven't moved. And delegation, what I've learned we can be as close to God as we want to be. If you abide in me and my words abide in you and then step number two, ask, ask. I want to say this as serving as representatives. James warning five says, if any man or woman likes wisdom, letting mask of God, what's the answer for our prayers getting answered? We've got to abide. And then ladies and gentlemen, we've got to ask. We've got to ask God to help us. I heard about a little boy that said to his mom and daddy. He said, mom and daddy, I would have. I'd like a baby brother or sister. And they said, well, Johnny, you got to pray. You got to pray. So Johnny prayed one month and Johnny prayed two months and Johnny prayed three months. And he did what we do a lot of times. He just gave up and stopped. And six months passed and the father said to Johnny, Johnny, come go with me. And he got in the truck and he took him down to the local hospital. And they went into a room and there was his mother in that room, brother speaker. And she was holding a baby. And they pulled the curtain back a little more and she was holding a second baby. And they pulled the curtain back a little more and she was holding a third baby. And the dad looked over at Johnny and he said, Johnny, aren't you glad you prayed? He said, oh, yes, daddy. And aren't you glad I stopped after three months? See, here's what we've got to do. We've got to abide. We've got to ask. And then God will answer. Then God will answer. I'm so grateful that God does answer our prayers. David Livingston was a great missionary in a Psalm Africa. And of all places to go, a Psalm Africa, that's where the headhunters were. But David Livingston was ministering there in a Psalm Africa one night. And a gentleman came to him and said, the headhunters have surrounded you. You're going to die tonight. And David Livingston said, I didn't know what to do. So I just prayed. I just prayed. He said, I thought for sure myself and a few of my men would die. But we didn't. He said the next morning, the sun arose and he said, I realized that we were going to live. And he said a year later, I saw the chief of that tribe. And that chief had become a believer. And he said, that's wonderful. You became a believer. He said, I want to ask you something. He said, why didn't you attack us on that knot? He said, oh, we came to attack you. But said, when we came to attack you, your camp was surrounded by 47 warriors. And he said, we saw those 47 warriors. And they had a sword in one hand and a lot in the other hand. So we knew we were no match for those 47 warriors. So we retreated. David Livingston said three years later, I was in Scotland in a church. And he said, I told that story. And he said after the story, a man met me in the forer. And he said, I'm over the men's ministry here. Just like Speaker Burns oversees the Sunday school at his church. He said, I'm over the men's ministry here. And he said, did that happen on January the 14th, 1856? And Speaker Livingston said that was the date. He said, why did you know that? How did you know that? He said, well, a group of us men gathered here that knot. We gathered for Bible study. And God placed on my heart. We need to pray. We need to pray for missionary David Livingston. And he said, we gathered that knot and we prayed. And after the knot was over, we signed a registry. And there was 47 of us men that gathered here to pray. And I got up one morning to rush into the day. I had so much to accomplish. I didn't have time to pray. Problems just tumble about me or ever came each task. Why doesn't God help me? He replied, you didn't ask. I tried to come into God's presence. I used all my keys at the lock. But God gently and lovingly chided, oh, my child, you didn't knock. I got up this very morning. I paused before entering the day. I was so much to accomplish, I had to take time to pray. Let's pray. Lord, as I bow my head and my heart in your presence, I thank you for this day. I thank you for speaker John Burns. I thank you for representative, Lord Daniel. I thank you for the wonderful men and women that serve in this body. Lord, it's a sacrifice. They sacrifice their families. They sacrifice a great cause for myself and fellow Georgians. So today, I just...

Pray your blessing upon this body. I pray God that you would bless them and keep them. Make your face to shine upon them. Be gracious and to them. Lift your countenance upon them. Give them your peace. Would your grace and your strength rest upon their families. For we pray this prayer in the name of above every name. That's the name of your son, our Savior, Jesus the Lamb of glory, till you come we pray. Amen. If you would indulge on me for one second before the pledge, George Washington said, we can't govern without God and the Bible. That's our first president who, by the way, didn't believe in parties, but said because the problem is the time will come, people will put parties before people. But he did believe in the Word of God. We can't govern without God and the Bible. And it's more on our privilege to present this copy of God's Word to a precious, precious man that being speaker John Burns. God bless you, Stinger. Thank you, Stinger. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation should have God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. We're going to take that picture. Thank you, members. Thank you, Dr. Tate. I'll tell you, I'm always inspired over the years when I've been here and you brought the message, but I'm also inspired by the journal that we have, that we can go back and review our chaplains of the day over the year when I go back and read your messages. Thank you for what you do for your congregation. Thank you for doing what you do for God's people. We appreciate you. And welcome to Rox Ranks, young people in the outskirts. Doorkeep is pleased and unlock the doors. Members may greet Dr. Tate in the south any room and have a photo if you sure desire. Thank you. Chairman Tarvan.

House bill 132 by Roestling of Jenkins 136 to be titled an act to amend Code Section 8223, the fiscal to Georgia, and tentative related amendment and revision of codes generally. So it's required the department to amend the Georgia state minimum standard codes to authorize certain uses of ungraded lumber. This bill ever further committing an act of culture and consumer affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Now I know you all solved a lot of problems this morning. I'll y'all know a lot of talking. Let's give the gentleman in the well. You're full attention. Let's solve this one. Representative Jenkins. Present the bill. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I rise to present House bill 132. This bill modifies Georgia building codes to allow for the use of ungraded lumber in the production or for structural purposes. To produce, to construct un-inhabited residential and agricultural outbuildings. So this bill came before the House last year and passed. It went to the Senate and in the Senate Ag Committee, the language of the bill was changed slightly to make it better. Make it make the language line up better with Georgia building codes. And it was passed by the Senate in the current version you're looking at. And we just didn't get it back for an agree. We ran out of time on sunny day. So that's why you're seeing it again. The our industry stakeholders are on board with this bill. We haven't, you know, I'm not aware of any opposition within the industry. And that includes my presentation, pending your questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Good job. Thank you. Yes sir. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Chairman House. Chairman House and you want to vote? There you go. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill, the yeas were 173, the nay zero. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to it. HB85. House Bill 85, members. In the coop, there's a 45th to be titled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 24, Title 33. The fiscal to George Antietta, ruling the general provisions regarding insurance. The bill requires health benefit policy coverage for biomarker testing is supported by medical and scientific evidence. This bill ever refer to the committee on insurance. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair recognizes Chair Lady Cooper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House. It is a real pleasure for me to bring this bill today because this is a bill that will help many and many Georgians get more effective health care. And I think the speaker for putting an emphasis on health care this year, approving the special committee that is run by Butch Parish, and one of the things we're trying to do is look at impediments to people getting the health care their needs. This is about biomarkers and biomarker test. Science has gotten to the point where on certain special cancers and autoimmune illnesses, not all of them, but on some of them at this point, that they can do a biomarker test until which treatment will be the most effective on helping you survive the cancer that you have. This is a cost saving measure, and it is certainly a cost saving as far as the detrimental and the harsh treatments that have been used before on cancer patients especially. What you do is you do the biomarker is a diagnostic test. It is not a treatment. Once the doctor gets the biomarker results back, then they can decide which cancer fits the cancer the patient has. So on certain bill, on certain cancers. So it is a cost saving and really what it is. It gets the right medicine to the patient at the right time. And the right time is as soon as they are diagnosed and have a biomarker test that they don't have to suffer getting the wrong medication wrong because they don't know what will be effective. And it is one of the old types of treatments, but they will get the treatments the most effective for them. So with that Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to ask a couple of questions. Thank you. You do have a question. Lady O'Yill. Yes sir. I will. Representative Reese has a question to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. Does it lady Eill? Yes I will. Is it true that this bill will help improve cancer detection and treatment in the black community amongst our elderly and the most marginalized groups and Georgia? Yes it will. They are the ones most likely that to be the ones that the biomarker test would not be approved by the insurance companies or because they have no insurance. Does it lady further you? Yes. And we not agree that this bill will embody the love, care, compassion and equality deeply rooted in our great state's history. It would certainly do that. And with the lady Eill one final time. One more. Isn't it abundantly clear that the Public Health Committee, chair graciously by the gracious woman in the well, is the most productive and efficient committee under the Gold Dawn? Okay. I would certainly agree with the member that it is one of the very best and certainly one of the ones that is trying to provide the belt's healthcare for Georgia. Thank you. Representative Reese you read that exactly like she wrote it. I'm sure. Exactly. The lady Eill for one more question. I'll yield for one more, Mr. Speaker. Chair lady, still Cox in the back. Do you yield? I yield. Isn't it true, Chairman Cooper, that this will also improve the outcomes and anguish for parents of children suffering from cancer in our state? Certainly will. If they have one of the cancers that can that has multiple treatment options, it would keep them from having to try something that is not specific to their cancer. Get the treatments, have the treatment fail, elongate the process and possibly lead them to further harm from the cancer by spreading or even death when they would be a by using the biomarkers. The doctor would know immediately if there was one specific medicine that would begin to help them from the very start of treatment. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you very much. The lady will yield for one more question. One more. One more, Mr. Speaker. The lady from the one-thirteenth representative Henderson to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the general lady yield? I yield. Wouldn't this bill help many, many women from children, up to adults, male and female, live a cancer-free life? Certainly would make that possible, it's more likely to make that a possibility. Thank you. Thank you. And with that I ask for your favorable vote on this bill and with that I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your presentation and thank you members for those questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, please unlock the machine. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 172. The nays 2. The bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to HB87, please. House Bill 87, my reps, that have earned one of the 30 second and others to be entitled to amend. Chapter 2 with Title 20, the official to George Antietta, really in the elementary and secondary education. So as to revise and repeal certain provisions for alternative charter schools, this bill will have a further committee on education. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The chairman of education is recognized to present the bill, chairman Irwin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I enthusiastically stand before you today to ask you to seriously consider House Bill 87. This bill establishes completion schools for our state. This is drop out recovery. We currently do this with three schools that run statewide. They are called, and in some of your systems, you'll know them as mountain-ed, foothills, and coastal plains. We have set up a governing structure that has seven zones in this state. We currently have one region or a large part of our state that is underserved for these nontraditional kids that are at risk of dropping out or have dropped out. Southwest part of our state and central west part of our state doesn't currently have any option for these type of programs. The traditional school functions in the evening for a student that might not fit the same box that most kids fit in. That would be your eight o'clock to three o'clock timeline. We are developing these completion schools and allowing the current ones that we have that are LEAs to continue to function to serve our kids. I look at this as a net to catch those children that try to vanish and drop out after 16 years old and give them a different option. It also, I look at it as workforce development if you read through it and also an opportunity if they get their high school diploma to, to enlist in our military. As many of you are aware that if you don't have your high school diploma, you cannot enlist into our military. With that in this bill, colleagues that there's quite a bit, but Mr. Speaker, I will yield for questions. Gentlemen, you have a question? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes that gentlemen to your left from the 130 second. Chairman Prince. Chairman Brian Prince. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that in our today, in our public school systems, that we have programs very similar to what you're proposing here, that non-traditional hours for completion of a high school diploma. It is true, and especially a large system takes advantage of allowing that, a smaller system where they might only have 10 to 15 children, becomes very difficult for them to have these programs. Thank you. Chairman Yeeho. Yes, sir. Representative Holly has recognized for a question. Probably, Anquies. Yes, sir. Yes, thank you. I was wondering, while I definitely believe that this is something that will be positive, especially to give a lot of our workforce the opportunity to get new talent in there, to allow for those students who could really shine to give them another opportunity to really excel, I wanted to know what might be your counter to anyone who might say that to have a special school like this is doing a little bit too much that instead they need to pull themselves up other bootstraps. I guess my answer would be that the system has worked with these children, and there is no other alternatives. So, so many of them today are currently representative, seeing that this is a shining star and sending them. We did a study committee on this summer, and we paid attention to how some of the larger systems are even taking advantage of these schools where they have the option to send their own kids because they are so large. But good question, thank you. Chairman Yeeho for another question. I do. The lady, the representative Glaze, the lady from the 67th, recognized for a question, you're left. Chairman Erwin, may I ask a question? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that in Georgia, we are in need of workers, skilled workers? Is it not true also in Georgia that as we go and cast a net and bring in those who have not finished high school that we have more workers in the talent pipeline? Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. Is it not true that as this state continues to be in the ninth year of being the best state to do business in, to encourage a bill like this would also continue the work that we have done as a state of the state of the state of the state of the state.

Being the best place to work as we build out this pipeline Yes, ma'am I Guilt. Thank you Representative you take another question, Mr Yes, one more chair lady camp has a question Recognize for a question to your left. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am I Have a lot of emotion about this and I'd like to thank you for bringing this bill in my district Which is a small district of about 3500 students Where I served on the school board we implemented a plan similar to this for our little district and we increased our graduation rate to 96% so thank you for bringing this measure great. Thank you representative camp and With that, mr. Speaker, I'd ask a favorable Consideration House bill 87 and I'll yield the well Thank you for your presentation. There were several more questions, but at this time we're going to recognize The speaker pro-tim of this house to speak to the bill speaker pro-tim Jones Thank you, mr. Speaker and I just wanted to give a little more Information on this so that when you go back to your district you're a little more armed and from a layman's perspective kind of how to explain this But first I want to thank a former chair of the Education Committee Matt Dubneck who championed us in Helping to solve this issue and now education chairman Chris Irwin who has done an outstanding job, but also Chairman Jasper's and Will Wade as well representative Wade we've worked on this for three years and From a layman Representatives perspective what I the way I would explain it back home is School systems that want to do this themselves have that ability now and will continue to so if they don't want to participate in these schools They don't have to this is this is local control at its most ultimate level These schools though will operate as state state authorized schools by the state Board of Education and I'll give the example of Cherokee Cherokee participates now We're making it so that Cherokee's Superintendent and all the other superintendent say in the mountain ed zone would serve as the board of directors They would determine QBE funding would flow through them to the Alternative school and they would collectively decide on what the local share would be these are low-cost schools that are currently Overfunded so they'll work with Alternative school in what is the appropriate amount of funding for the schools that are primarily operated at night primarily Internet-based with retired teachers that offer the supports they have very capable and experienced teachers that serve as the counselors and the teachers as Chairman Irwin said we have deficits in the state of where this is available But it's actually also in the metro area my own school system in Fulton County does not offer a model like this and to be honest My experience over the few years we've worked on this Really it became very clear to me. We do a really lousy job with students that are Particularly once they reach 18 I mean if you reach 17 or 18 and 18 and you drop out There's primarily nothing for you. You're just kind of go off your way What this bill does is it treats students in two different categories one is During their four years of high school so you might quit when you're 17 But you're not actually deemed to drop out by the feds or by the state until you've four years of a lapse you can think of it as College football eligibility you get so many years where you get four years of eligibility to graduate After that time you are deemed to drop out and at that point for the most part most school systems Never see you again. What these schools will offer is up until the age of roughly 18 You'll be a student enrolled at your local school system You will have the opportunity to receive your services at this school So it is financially Responsible because it will be funded the way we fund schools now through a combination of state funding and local funding The three that we have now are fully funded at the state level and to be perfectly honest if we keep that model Those of you who don't have this model will never get it because it'll be too expensive to replicate and to sustain it So we tried to come up with a model that was replicable Sustainable and accountable and but once you reach the age reach the age of 18 You could directly go and enroll in one of these schools until the age of 22 So you'd have four years that you could take accelerated classes to get your high school degree You could work during the day you could work some nights, but it's on a sort of go as you learn pace We have nothing like this other than those three in the state now by and large and so it I in my opinion I think it may be the most significant education bill we passed this year because it will provide school choice to those in another I guess another option. I won't use the loaded work It another option for students that are either behind on their credits at risk of dropping out or who Have already dropped out and they will I'm really I'm excited about this we've worked with superintendents all over the state and For the most part the superintendents are excited because They will be at the table helping determine Sort of the curriculum and how these will operate to serve their region and it is a regional model Which I think will best make sure that it works for that area of the state and with that Mr. Speaker I will answer any questions if there are any Thank you. I know the lady knows of what she speaks when it comes education So thank you for that Chair recognizes the lady from the 77th Representing by now for a question to your left. Thank you. Does the lady you yes, I do I think that the idea of the concept it sounds really good My question is though if most of those students that will come to you are students who have had problems in school And so if the only teacher they have is on the computer will they have any in-person help because They'll have different learning disabilities to help them. Yeah, they do have teachers there So it's it's internet based in the sense that it's go at your own pace because students may come in and out of this So you know they may come here to get credit recovery and then go back to their school They may come because they don't fit in at their school They or maybe they need to work to support their family So it has an internet based element from the curriculum, but they definitely have on-site teachers and They they primarily teach in high schools that are already in place at night or Underutilized facilities, but there are teachers and counselors as well and just one more question Well, they're schooled to district get the credit for them graduating for their graduation rate So that that was an element that was very important to me and to Well to all of us on the study committee frankly That you you want the accountability for the graduation and the test scores Up until age 18 to go back to the home school So that the incentives are in the right place What you don't want is it to in any way shape or form be able to be a dumping ground Where you send students because all of a sudden your graduation rate goes up because you send the very kids It might drop out a way you wanted it to track back and and then this Version it absolutely does. Thank you Ladies yield for another question. Yes, Mr. Speaker The gentleman from the 61st representing Bruce in the back on your left Yes, I do I Want to make sure I understand the money To pay for this there's a come out of money. They would normally go to a Local public school So the so the QBE the state funding formula a student say from South Fulton one of the schools down there where you live would the student would earn whatever they would earn from QBE the school Fulton County schools would receive that money and If there is one of these schools in the metropolitan area of which we don't really have now But we hope one will form they would that school would invoice the completion school would invoice Fulton County For their QBE any grants that they earn and any federal funding that they earn and then the superintendents that form that the board of that Special school would get together with the special school to determine what the local funding that they would have Already spent on the student anyway back at the home school would then also flow to The special school okay with a lady here one more time certainly what so if I thought I heard you say that the student could go back and forth between the their home school and There and this alternative school But the money doesn't go back and forth is that correct? Well the money in a way it would because for example if that we have two student Counts a year in the fall and in the spring so if the student was at the alternative or the completion school in the fall Their QBE and federal funding would flow to You know whatever the school was Milton High School And then Milton High School would transfer it to the alternative or to the completion school if in the spring They move back to their home school then they wouldn't be built for it would stay there It's not right but the money from the other school will not go back to the other schools They wouldn't return the money it would right earned you like per semester okay And I will mr. Speaker also mentioned I've had a few questions about charter schools It wouldn't affect a charter school or say a homeless population except to the degree if you're 18 to 22 and You're a homeless student You could personally go and roll in In one of these alternative schools that the one that serves your area if you're a Locally authorized charter school it would operate no differently. You could send students there just as Say the traditional school down the street if you're state authorized charter school You could choose to participate as well because they're still your students the school systems in the schools own the students They utilize these for services up until the age of 18 With a lady here for a couple more. Yes, sir. I will Chair recognizes chairman Martin to your right for a question Lady you yes, well first I'm gonna put this in the form of a question I would assign to speak on the well But it isn't it true that this is one of the best ways and the ladies as we're reiterated this that we can apply state dollars to get these folks across the finish line Is that not true? Is that not what the committee found? I believe it's true We did it in a in a financially responsible way But with the priority that we you know we owe students up until the age of 22 by federal law to offer them services to help them graduate And is an ulcer tree that this body along with former senator tippens passed an addition to this for for those that same population in our technical school technical colleges Another opportunity. So it's again our commitment to honor that constitutional obligation of these individuals first Before we before we go any place else. I believe that's true Just a couple more Madam protein, okay, let's take one from the lady from the 50 set 50 second right in front of you representative Roberts Thank you mr. Speaker Will Lee you sure This program sounds fantastic. I have a family member who we are trying to just get her through the finish line due to all kinds of issues learning and My question is how do we encourage our school districts to embrace this new program? Well, the first is we we need to in the areas of the state that don't have one now We anticipated that in the legislation and it allows by appropriation The appropriations committee would have to decide to do this to seed money so that they could go ahead and And and higher teachers because you have to hire teachers before you turn in your student count to receive money back from the state You have to rent facilities You know higher people and so our Desire is certainly that there would eventually be at least seven of these and and then The superintendents are pretty tight group is what I found through chairman or one and They're very aware of this their superintendents now in Southwest Georgia that are have already indicated support and trying to form one of these And I think there'll be a bottoms up the superintendents if the superintendents believe that this helps their student and their Graduation rate there's every incentive in the way the models design for them to Find someone to start one of these up and support them And I think it'll probably come from retired superintendents or folks who have worked in this realm And the ones that exist have already pledged their commitment to help with that effort as well in terms of training so that we can have I mean our goal is that every student in Georgia at risk of dropping out or behind in their credits and having a hard time Catching up in the traditional model will have an access to this Thank you to everyone who worked on this Madam, Madam Pro Tem there's one more question. You've kind of had a more of an urban flavor. I have a Representative from rule Georgia who would like to ask a question and that's why I'm gonna answer the question from rule Representative from 168 Representative Williams this gonna be the last question. Yes Thank you with the gentle lady you yes, ma'am. Yes, sir Is it not true that we have a very successful program in Liberty County? Has been around a while and is it not further true that I've had the opportunity to visit and speak with Students there and for various reasons they were not able to continue in traditional schools But is it not true that work not for schools like this? They would not be able to get their high school diplomas and hopefully move on to a very fruitful life That that is true and in fact I believe you're referring to there's a program through the DJJ For students that are incarcerated that foot hills one of the three existing ones offer services And we anticipate this spreading statewide Foot hills will continue to operate those their grandfather in the legislation outside of their region and And this would be a way for the state To partner with these schools to provide services to other incarcerated students through DJJ and other programs and with that Mr. Speaker I'll yield the well and if you have any further questions, please feel free to talk to Chairman or one or myself. Thank you Thank you for that information. That was very thorough explanation of the bill and Very thorough questions. Thank you members for paying attention and being interested in a very important subject Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here's none the committee's substitute is adopted Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine Have all members voted Have all members voted if so the clerk will unlock the machine On the passage of the bill the yeas were 170 the nays are zero The bill haven't received your requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Mr. Clerk will you read the caption? To house bill 91 House bill 91 by a representative of way to the ninth and others to be taught on act to amend Chapter five a title title 53 the fish go to George antenna relating to probate So as required personal representatives to send notices to beneficiaries Regarding the issuance of letters testimentary or letters of administration It's bill ever further committee on judiciary that committee recommends this bill do pass chair Recognizes representative will wait to present the bill Thank you speaker and I do owe you an apology. You're a proud Georgia Southern University graduate and so was my my guess so Forgive me for that My dad accepted my dad was a Georgia state graduate. So thank you sir All right colleagues. I'm happy to bring this bill back. I presented this bill last year and we we passed this bill as you read it last year and we just ran out of time on sunny dot this did have unanimous support from the committee process and fairly simple just to correct a couple of things within this title area requires notice to benefit sherry's just as in the case of ares and And air is obviously someone who would take Without a will but generally immediate family and beneficiaries a person or a party specifically named in a will So it could be a church or a nonprofit Those kind of things and so the second part Recognizes financial investment Financial institution investment accounts that they would be allowed to be passed in a beneficiary Outside of probate just like a joint checking account savings account those kind of things The banking industry and the credit union industry were agreeable to that section two and Happy to answer any questions and I appreciate and I hope you will provide a favorable vote for this Legislation. Thank you. The gentleman will you yield for a question? I will so yield. I thought you probably would anticipate this one The lady from the 150th house district Representative Bentley has a question Thank you, mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman yield. I yield to my friend Thank you, and this is serious question. I know you mentioned that you brought this bill last year But I've had some changes in my life since last year and Can you explain to me? I'm starting to get you to speak to you before but can you explain to me Now that I am going to be named a personal representative of a family members state What does this bill actually mean for me? Certainly, that is a fantastic question And I had a similar situation and I had to perform that function for my family And what this will allow is that you will be required to provide notification within the probate process In writing to the air and they beneficiary so all we're adding is beneficiaries will receive notification in the same manner to which an executive or an executive trickster is required to notify an air I'm sorry mr. Speaker I can't hear his answer can if be okay if you can repeat it please I'm happy to repeat from my friend. So this will require that you would provide written notification to any name to beneficiaries in the will As in current law you're required to provide written notification to any named ares So it just clears up that both beneficiaries and ares are to receive written notification that they've been named Through the probate process and that responsibility will fall on the executor of the estate when that applies So with the personal representative or a zecker to continue their duties as a executor or they have to wait until that beneficiary Send forms back acknowledging that there is a wheel and they've been listed You don't have to there there is no specific requirement for there to be a verification that they've received it You will provide when you file the probate to the testation process um or the Tested minary process that you will show where you provided that notification and that will be sufficient for the probate court Great questions. I want to thank you. Thank you General you have one more question. How you'll for one more Represident Taylor from the 90s second has a question Thank you to your left as a gentleman yield. I do have yield The last thing is in your states that the bill I mean that the any representative who fails to provide this notice Maybe started to appear before the court and must show cause why they should continue to act as representative What is the counter accident that if they're not able to provide that cause? So I believe um What this is would allow the court to ensure that their responsibility is being carried out so that the folks that have been named and that the person who's Last will and testament is supposed to be carried out that it will have the opportunity for them to come forth I think it would just be from a standard judgment. There would be issue to to act or in a worst case scenario The judge could find somebody else to serve as the executive or executive tricks in those extreme situations I think they'd be very rare But that that process already exists and we're not making any changes to what judges would be able to do do the probate process Sure one last um, so you're if I'm understanding these correctly the Estate is being if I have a wheel and I'd left who I want to be in charge of that the administrator that will You're saying that the court can remove me because I don't file or notify the other beneficiarities If if you do not notify an air currently at law that you that is already the case You are required to meet those fiduciary responsibilities and there's a process that the court would go through and it would it would not be instantaneous The the bill lays out the timeline timeline is not changed from existing law Thank you, sir. Thank you appreciate the questions and Speaker there are no further questions. I appreciate your favorable consideration. I yield the well There you have no further questions. Thank you for a thorough explanation Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's done the previous question is ordered Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill Chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine You Have all members voted Have all members voted If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the yeas were 171 the nay zero the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Ladies and gentlemen of the house we have a former member Represent the buddy harden in his wife Linda Welcome Is good to see you both Let's come up and get a picture we want to approve where you've been The clerk will read the caption to hb 182 Hp 182 by representative reads the 99th and others to be entitled to enact tort one of the article one of chapter two the title 44 the fiscal to George antenna relating according to deeds and other real property transactions So it's a revised provisions securing defective deeds and other instruments this bill I refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends this bill do pass Chair recognize representative reads to present the bill man you're up here all the time representative reads Thank you mr. Speaker House colleagues Request your approval of house bill 182. This is a one-page bill from the House judiciary committee It was requested by the state bar of George's Board of Governors as well as real property law section in response to a federal court opinion last year that jeopardized security interests and mortgages on acknowledged deeds acknowledge real estate deeds there Two different types of deeds. There was some 2015 legislation and in the federal courts reading it jeopardizes security interest in acknowledged deeds This bill would fix it and our request your approval of it and yield for questions Gentlemen yield for a question. Yes, mr. Speaker I'm not surprised you have a question or two here representative. I think it's appropriate That the gentleman from the 125th House district Representative Barry Flemme has a question for you Thank. Thank you mr. Speaker to the gentleman in the well My question relates to how This bill would affect a piece of property which was subject to the rule against perpetuities But before you answer that I would like for you to explain to us the rule against perpetuities and how it works please This here that That that's the That's the rule that says if there is a restrictive covenant on a piece of property that lasts more than 20 years That it can be stricken by the court. Is that correct? Well, I'm asking you the question This Representative Fleming this bill in no way affects the ruling as perpetuities in Georgia If you don't know the definition how can you tell me it doesn't affect We have reviewed it carefully along with lenders commercial real estate closing lawyers And I assure you this bill has a narrow scope just on acknowledged deeds Whether or not they're covered by the rule against perpetuities. Well, I guess we're just going to have to our trust our attorney on this one Right that that is thank you Yes, sir. Thank you, Representative Jim a yield for another question. Yes, mr. Speaker represented Fleming I think we're going to have some clarification on the rule against perpetuities right on perpetuities right here We're going to recognize the gentleman from the sixth Representative Jason Ridley to weigh in on this weighty subject There's a gentleman yield Yes Mr. Baker I hate this point everybody. I don't use words that I can't spell This is your first bill is it not it is it is can you explain to me how it's day 19 This is your first bill, but you've been in the well 21 times Yeah, important business from going at county Gentlemen you or another question. Yes, mr. Speaker Let's go back

the lady in the back of the room from the 150th representative Bentley for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Serious question. Oftentimes I have families who can't afford to pay for their funerals and they want to give me the D to their property to cover the funeral bill. What does this bill that you're introducing House Bill 182? How is that going to think when I have families want to give their D over to me to help pay for their funeral bill? I am glad you asked because if someone goes to a real estate closing in Roberta, Georgia or Reynolds, Georgia or Butler, Fort Valley and they leave a real estate closing that their bank and their lawyer has said is okay and there's a clerical error on that acknowledged deed years later there can be a relation back to the closing and everything safe years later. So it would make sure that when you leave the closing an error can get corrected without anybody losing money or losing property. So that means I will get my money for the funeral home and time for the funeral on Saturday I don't have to wait to absolutely absolutely. So that means I can go by a big hat after the funeral right? That's right. If your banker and your closing lawyer say the deal is done this bill will protect making sure that's the case. Well thank you. Thank you for your work on the bill. Thank you. Someone has one more question I think you need to answer. From a fellow practitioner you're the gentleman from the 123rd chief deputy will leverage is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes. I just, what, Bershit now we're discussing. We wanted to make sure that the gentleman is aware you cannot also sign up to speak to your bill later today after you give me a testimony. Absolutely understood. Thank you. I'm a co-sponsoring. You're very welcome. Thank you for sponsoring the bill and thank you for your performance today. It's very impressive. Thank you. The gentleman you have one more. This one's really serious and I know it's been well thought out. The gentleman from the 161st House District chairman Hitchens to your left. Well the gentleman you. Yes. Is it not true as I've already been stated that even though this year first bill you've been up here many times previously? Yes is true and I hear of what the gentleman speaks. We'll take note of that. And when I had the first bill this year after I explained it I had no questions and you got up to speak to it to clarify what I said and you got about ten questions. Thank you for supporting the Georgia ports. Throughout the German Hitchens that's remarkable. Do you have a question from the gentleman from the 144th Representative Washburn if you'd care to yield? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Washburn to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the gentleman you for a question. Yes. This is actually a serious question, Representative. Relative to the ruling perpetuity and the restrictive governance issue is it not true that that can be stricken if it has not been extended formally? Absolutely. The Court can strike a deed based on the ruling against perpetuities. But if those restrict governance have been extended then the Court doesn't have the right strike then. Is that not correct? Correct. Pursuant to all this body passed in the 1980s. Thank you. See, see no further questions I yield. Excellent choice. Excellent choice. Great discretion. It's going to be a tough decision. But is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. What purpose does Representative Chairman Martin rise? A parliamentary inquiry. Is it true that the gentleman presented the last bill is a part of our delegation. We're happy to have him up in North Georgia. Is it true that in his defense I would let the members of the body have it served here before he got his trained and former representative Wendell Willard. It's not all his fault. Well, that explains a lot of things. Thank you, Chairman Martin. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. All the passage of the bill, the yeas were 171 and we all note there was one nay. 171 to 1. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. You can't make it up. Congratulations. We'll move on to afternoon orders at this time. Representative Kendrick, you're recognized for an afternoon order. Give the lady in the well. Your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. The day is finally here for my fourth tech for all policy conference. We have a VIP reception that is going to be featuring our very own chairman, Todd Jones, of the Technology and Infrastructure Innovation Committee at ATDC, which is near Georgia Tech. From 4 to 6 p.m., we're going to have a great time speaking with leaders in technology in our state. And we will have food, very delicious food there. So please join us.

So if you meet me at Atlanta City Hall on the second floor in city council chambers, then we will hear from the mayor of Atlanta about the work he's doing in technology workforce development. So please join me and we'll have a lunch as well at Atlanta City Hall at 12 p.m. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Kendrick. Representative Tanya Miller is recognized for an afternoon order. Good to see you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I'm honored to rise today to recognize on this day in black history the first black men elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1868, collectively known as the original 33. They represented a broad cross section of Georgia. Each of the original 33 was a Republican and helped establish the first Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate. This majority was short lived, however, because one of the first acts of the 1868 General Assembly, was to declare the 1868 election fraudulent and thus expel the original 33 from office. After expulsion, Representative Philip Joyner led several hundred black supporters in a march to Camilla, Georgia, where a group of armed men opened fire. When they arrived in the town square, they killed 14 and wounded at least 30 others. This tragic event is known as the Camilla massacre in Georgia history. Undeterred the original 33 appeal to the courts to be reinstated to office in 1869, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the men did in fact have the right to hold office. They returned to the General Assembly in 1870, but remained in office only a few short months before a back lash election brought in a majority determined to erase all of the gains black's had achieved in the era of reconstruction. One fourth of the members of the original 33 suffered beatings, arrest, and or were murdered. This powerful story is part of our state's history, and unless we know our full history, there's little opportunity for understanding. We should not be afraid of the shadows of our past instead. We honor the original 33 by shining a light on their story so that we can learn and so that we are inspired to do better. To paraphrase Mark Twain, history may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Members, I want you to continue to give your respectful attention to the hour next to afternoon orders. Representative Butler and Representative Huggley recognize for an afternoon order. And the rest of the Columbus Delegations welcome to join us. We rise to honor the memory of Mary Jane Gayler, the honorable Mary Jane Gayler who served in this house. She was born in Texas, attended college in Pennsylvania, married US Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gayler. They love to travel and the Army let them do that. They returned to Fort Benning and became an integral part of our community, and it was such a gift. Both of them gave un-un-tiringly of all the different kinds of interest that they had in our community. She joined Columbus State University as the librarian and an associate professor until the time in 1976 when she was elected to serve in this house. She served with great focus on rights for women and the well-being of women and children. And when she left office, she didn't go home and just sit down and quit. She continued her dedication of service to our community. She shared many interest and dedication to not only our community but our state. And she passed away February the 7th at the age of 98. She was my friend, my network lunch partner, a fellow lover of history and one of my very special mentors. And among the advice that she gave me when I first got elected that I also received from another friend was that if you don't care too much who gets the credit, you can get great things done. A wife, mother, grandmother, educator, historian, librarian, author, mentor, public servant, and Georgia State representative. Please join us in a moment of silence, thanking God for the gift of her wonderful life and for comfort for her family, three children, two grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. Amen. Thank you. A life will lived. What a great example for us all. Members, we need your attention for this next one as well. Representative Stevens, Powell, Corbett, Williams, and a host of friends will bring us some sad information about your friend of ours. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house. You know, in your service up here, you get a chance to meet some of the best people in the world, not just the ones you serve with, but also those who represent business industry and the lobbying efforts. Probably one of the most important and one of the best that I've ever known is the dean of the, as I call them, the legislative engineers Bill Mori, who has represented the GADA for probably close to 50 years. We had a death in this family last night, Michael and Andrew's son, Michael, who was a special needs child, but a very special child at that, and young man passed away this morning. I would ask each and every one of you today to say a prayer for the family and to thank Almighty God, all the blessings that he's given all of us into this family. And if you might just give just a second of meditation for the Mori family. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Bill Mori is one of the finest men I know. The finest individuals and certainly the passing of Michael's heavy load on that family. So keep them in your prayers in the days in front of us, if you will.
