you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Final column to the right is where we ended up the I guess you could say it's the conference committee But there was not a formal conference committee done As you know this budget as the speaker just said is the one piece legislation that we are required to pass and I would argue it's the most important bill you have before you today But given the days calendar Another bills working to make to cross over I'm going to be as brief as I can This budget includes an infusion of 4.4 billion dollars of the original FY 2025 budget which we passed last year You can do a lot of good things with 4.4 billion dollars and we have But for me the centerpiece and the most important element of this budget is the storm relief package we crafted Together with the Senate the houses delivering a total hurricane relief package in this budget of $862 million Combined with the legislation drafted to provide tax relief for those Georgians Who will fill the impact of the storm for years to come The total relief provided under this dome this session is well over one billion dollars Thank you The house and Senate agreed with the governor storm relief package which addressed the most immediate and pressing issue of cleanup and recovery efforts Including 145 million dollars in the governor's emergency fine $299 million in the Department of Transportation to backfill lost revenue from the motor fuel suspension The cleanup debris and state roads and to repair and replace damaged infrastructure including signs and traffic lights And a hundred million dollars in direct ag and timber relief Working together the house and the Senate built upon the governor's package By including an additional 18 million dollars in the governor's emergency fine to help meet the state and local match of 25% Of the for the debris removal the house and Senate felt strongly about adding a hundred and eighty five million dollars in additional relief For the farmers and timber producers for a total and unprecedented appropriation of 285 million dollars These funds will provide loans and continue to breathe cleanup We know that there's pin up demand for these funds as Georgians that were in the path of the storm continue to rebuild and replant Agriculture and timber are important industries in our state and we want to support them But the reach of the lien went far greater than any of us could have ever imagined And people are still hurting The house and Senate agreed to provide a 25 million dollar 25 million dollars to the one Georgia authority to engage nonprofits to help rebuild the lives and communities of storm victims The house version of the amended budget recognized the unanticipated role that our community hospitals played in the storm response Going far beyond meeting the immediate medical needs Of their communities by utilizing their own limited resources to provide food water shelter and care to many who had lost everything The Senate agreed and this budget before you includes 22 million dollars for 27 hospitals and eight FQHCs in the major disaster declaration area To assist in their financial stabilization and recovery efforts Moving on to public safety And before I talk about the Department of Corrections I want to shine a light on a success story in the Department of Community Supervision That demonstrates a return on a vest on investment in our human capital our state employees Officers in the Department of Community Supervision are responsible for supervising offenders who are on probation or parole And for monitoring their reentry back into the community If you've been here for a few years like me You know that improving the recruitment and retention of state law enforcement officers across multiple agencies has been a priority Back in fiscal year 2021 officers in the Department were making a starting salary of 35,000 dollars Just four years later We've improved that starting rate by 20,000 dollars and it's having a positive impact on the agency Last year Turnover in the agency was just for percent Because of this improved retention additional funds are needed and the House and Senate added 4.5 million dollars to cover projected personnel service expenses for the rest of the year It's a good problem Now moving on to the corrections I told you several weeks ago that hurricane relief was a priority of this budget And addressing the needs of the Department of Corrections was the other Working together the House and Senate have agreed to a package of support of $345 million for the Department that prioritizes you staffing Safety and security and technology upgrades Like community supervision the Department of correction is also seeing improvements in recruitment and retention salary enhancements and marketing efforts are resulting in an increased number of hires and additional salary steps and compensation for longevity is also resulting in improved retention Because of this an infusion of 50.9 million dollars is needed for new correctional officer positions Which will be utilized to improve staff to offender ratios We've had a lot of conversations about funding for these modular units Which despite how the name may sound are actually maximum security prefabricated correctional units that hold 126 inmates each This out the House and Senate have agreed to fund four of these units as recommended by the governor at a cost of 80 million dollars These units along with an increased contract with our private prison partners for more bed space are part of the state's master plan to shift inmates Out of aging facilities temporarily so that long-ever-dee repairs and maintenance can occur The budget also includes 17 million dollars to continue the implementation of managed access systems and drone detection to fight contraband inside the wire In addition the house funded and Senate agreed to nearly 18 million dollars for new body cameras and taint tasers As well as a surveillance system improving the safety of both officers and defenders These safety tools link to an overwatch logistics unit So when either is turned on surveillance officers can immediately zero in on disturbances and send additional correctional officers if necessary The budget also includes funding for the department to continue contracts with consultants who can provide additional recommendations for cost savings and And safety improvements as well as oversee the implementation of enhancements funded in this budget There are a few other differences between this version of Hp67 and the one that passed this chamber a few weeks ago that I'd like to point out On economic development in addition to the 501 million in coastal service Surface water resources in jifa The final version of hp67 includes an additional 266 million dollars for sewer and water infrastructure for communities Not impacted by the surface water expansion resources These funds will go a long way in helping local governments access funds for water and wastewater to meet the needs of aging infrastructure The house and senate have agreed to an additional five million dollars to recapitalize the downtown development revolving loan program at the department of community affairs This fund will provide access to low interest loans to communities across the state for revitalization of their downtown areas If you're able to listen You were able to listen to the economic development subcommittee hearing You heard the agricultural commissioner talk about efforts and their rapid response to combat avian influenza This the other AI Related to that need during the bird flu event in January and February the poultry veterinary diagnostic lab ran in a two week period The number of tests normally run in six months This highlighted their need for additional equipment and this budget includes 90,000 dollars for two additional PCR machines So that the lab can stay ready to respond and support our poultry industry

In turning to health, there's $2.8 million is provided in the Medicaid budget for quality and synopayments at skilled nursing facilities across the state. We know there's a physician shortage in our state and one of the best strategies we have for solving that problem is through our residency programs. As we know that doctors are more likely to become established and stay near where they complete their residency. To that end, the Senate added in the House agreed to fund $21.5 million for new and expanding GMA programs in South Georgia. We hope to build upon this foundation in the 26th budget as well. In the Human Services budget, the House and Senate recognized an unmet need for our foster youth and added $38.5 million in Department of Human Services for growth and utilization, acknowledging the increased cost of foster care across the system. For our veterans, the House added $1 million to the Senate and the Senate managed for a total of $2 million to support the opening of a new sub-acute unit at the War Veterans Nursing Home in Millageville. This new unit plans to open in early 2026 and will provide intensive services for veterans with severe mental illness and traumatic brain injuries. In transportation, the House and the Senate agree to enhancements in the state's intermodal programs of rail and airport aid, with airport aid receiving $7.8 million and rail receiving $12.9 million to continue upgrading state-owned rail to class two standards. Many of the budget includes $265 million for local road projects, a slightly higher figure than when the budget left this house. Mr. Speaker, those are the highlights of the differences between the House and Senate on the amended budget and the proposed amendment. Are you for any questions and ask for your favorable consideration on the Senate's substitute to HB67 as amended by the House? And gentlemen, has a couple of questions to your left. We'll park right on the front. Has a question for you. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a gentleman yield. Yes, sir. So I greatly appreciate the hard work on the supplemental budget. I did have two questions. First on, I think it's 17.4.1. First let me express my appreciation for the House's appropriation of $35 million initially. The Senate of course proposed 15 and we saw ultimately an agreement of $21 million or at least a deduction with respect to grant programs for critical hospitals. Will those funds be added to the big budget or can you speak a little more in terms of the decrease in those grant programs? I'll speak to how we came up with this number. The number that we had when we did it first included all of the rural hospitals. The Senate then came back and said they only wanted to provide assistance to those that were actually in the path of the hurricane, the designated zones. There were about three or four different calculations and we settled on the 21.9. So I didn't disagree that that's probably was the major intent and the structure of the help for the hospitals evolved over even after we did our $35 million and it became more of a grant program so that's we could do what they asked. Thank you for the clarification. With respect to the Department of Corrections, likewise we saw some reductions in section 19 for pharmacy services, for repairs, maintenance personnel, contraband detection, with an increase in correction personnel. Could you again provide a little additional information and clarification as to the reasoning and whether or not we may see some of these appropriations in the big budget? So as the whole budget proceeds through the process, we're always getting as I call it later data, later data and the reductions are from later data that we received from the Governor's Office. The other increase in the staffing of corrections is their number. They are having more success at hiring and they do need more money strictly to fund positions that they are getting and have now through the end of the year and that number will continue to increase in 26 also. Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your hard work. I look forward to supporting this supplement. Thank you. Mr. Wip. You have another question. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, work eyes are to your left. Is recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Jim and you. Yes, sir. Is it not true that this provides critical financial lead to those families who are recognized by the federal government as disaster relief areas and that they can deduct qualified losses? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I think I have maybe spoken too much about the need in that part of our state from this well this year but you are absolutely correct. Jim, when you offer a couple more. Yes, sir. Representative Park Cannon right out in front of you to your left as a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chair, do you yield? Yes. Thank you for your work on this budget. I have a question about the 27.8.2. It's the Startup Funds for School of Safety, Threat Assessment. Can you tell us more about that program? We're ending up on 1.5 million for that. I think you will see, I think perhaps today, a lot more about that program is coming out of the Education Committee today. This is an initial start on the whole program and it gives them a little bit of a starting money to go ahead and start working on the whole Threat Assessment Program. Okay, thank you, do you further yield? Yes. And so that this bill you're saying that's coming will tell us how schools can qualify for that? Yes, I don't know the details on it but I know it's coming out of our education and Chairman Erwin could probably enlighten us all on that. Okay, thank you. Do you yield for one further question? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Section 38.1.2. This is a Public Awareness Campaign on the impacts of vaping, like to thank you on that. Will this be a multilingual public awareness campaign? I'm not aware of it being multilingual but as many things in this they evolve and I'm sure a request could be accepted for that. Mr. Chairman, we will hear the school safety bill tomorrow so that information will not be presented today. We can't share everything with you, Mr. Chairman. But now I probably missed listened earlier. No, you didn't. Representative Al Williams to your left in front of you is recognized for a question. Thank you, Speaker of the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. On behalf of Representative Andrew Jackson and the entire coastal delegation. We certainly want to thank you for your consideration of Savannah State University. Much needed. Thank you. We appreciate being able to help. Somebody in the back will say the representative Williams, this Savannah State University. Representative Barnes to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to say thank you for the additional nutrition services funds that you added on 22.2. How have we identified those 10 sites and how do the sites apply for the grant being that we only have. What was the last party? How does what? How do those sites apply for the grant? I'm sure they apply through an Department of Education and Decal, I'm sorry, and get it. But they have all the requirements and guidelines on that. Does the gentleman know all of them? Yes. I would like to say thank you for these funds for these summer meals as we did not have funds for summer meals last year. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, you have one more question to your right. The clear file situation, Representative Edna Jackson from the great city of Savannah. I recognize for a question. Mr. Chairman, do you yield? Yes, to the lady from Savannah. Thank you so much. And from these Savannah State University. I just wanted to say representative Val Williams has said what. But I wanted to say thank you for really recognizing that the oldest history, all of the history of the university. Thank you for helping us to do those things because we needed this money. $6.7 million is really going to help us to do some of the things that we need to do right away. Thank you, Representative. We met with the president of Savannah State last week. I think Savannah State University is headed in the right direction. Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker, with that I will. You have a question from Chairman of Transportation. He wants to congratulate you if you would take that one. I will. You all could have talked about this. You all sit close together. But Representative Jasper is recognized for a question if you will accept it. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It's Jill Maniel. I don't know. Well, yes sir. I will. If you don't, but I'm in whispered in your ear. It looks like if you look on page is 26 and 27. You know, this is a late just amazing commitment to all the different transportation projects across our state. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's been a pleasure working with the Governor to make sure we keep that going. Mr. Chairman, you have another further question. Do you accept the comment from behind you? Yes sir. I'd like to make one. If the gentleman will let me do that. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you personally and for Senator Tillery and Yalls Hart work in the Governor. This budget is a fiscally responsible and a service budget that makes investments all over this state. But I can assure you that the folks that were impacted and are currently being impacted by the resource of Hurricane Helene. This budget will make a difference. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your big heart, your compassion and your hard, hard work. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. But as many of us in here as not in our notes, so we might forget to mention it. But this lady sitting right here, Mr. Christine Murdoch, y'all don't know the hours she has worked, especially in the last week to get this done. So thank you. And all her staff. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman, as you were the well, is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment? Here's none. Chair, here's none in the House Amendment is adopted. On the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 67 as amended by the House, all those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 170. The nays are three. And the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 67 as amended by the Senate. The House proposes Representative Hatchett rise. To make a motion. To state your motion. I move that this House immediately transmit the Senate's substitute, the HB 67 as amended by the House immediately to the Senate. Representative Hatchett moves that HB 67 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Here in none, it is so ordered. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 32? House Resolution 32 by GRIPSIN of Estration 104th and others, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution so it has increased the maximum acreage to qualify an assessment and taxation as a bona fide conservation use property. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. And that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by Committee Substitute. Leader Estration is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House had bring before you here today H.R. 32. This resolution is a constitutional amendment consistent with legislation this body previously passed this session which would increase the cap on KUVA acreage to 4,000 acres from 2,000 acres to 4,000 acres. That's all that this would do. What asked for your favorable consideration? This is a critical measure for protection of family farmland in our state and for protection of conservation land within our state. Currently we have a situation where if acreage exceeds the cap, we're in a position where either that land has to be in multiple family members names or there's some other potential that that would be. Reutilized for a different purpose by passing H.R. 32 you voting in favor for it. It's a strong message of support for family farmland and Georgia preservation of land for purposes of farming and for conservation. I'd ask for your favorable consideration and Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen, I have no questions. I yield the welcome. Gentlemen, as you are the welcome, we will recognize we have someone to speak in favor. One of the members, Lady from Junction City, Rift A. Buttoner, has recognized to speak to the bill, or Rift A. D.B. Buttoner. You have 10 minutes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand in support of this resolution for a variety of reasons. I know a lot of people that live in town that have a quarter acre lot, I think 4000 acres is a lot of land and it is. But what happens in a lot of parts of our state is that there was farmland that was divided among large families. Many times it was a family that would have maybe 10, 15, 20 children. And as grandma and granddaddy passed away and it was divvyed out, and then maybe some of those people never married or had children and the numbers got smaller and smaller over time. What we found is what we will, what is seen happening across the state is that land that people acquired, bought from hard work, and bring down the land for many, many years is falling to fewer people instead of many people. And when that happens and you try to get a koova, you find yourself 250 acres over the 2000. When it was decided that they would check up the amount from 2000 to 4000, quite honestly it was just an arbitrary number to increase it. Most of the states in the United States do not have a cap on this because they want people planting trees and doing conservation on as much land as possible. And that's what this is about. It is a conservation use, it is to help people be able to afford to keep the land cleared, to do the prescribed burns, to plant the trees which are not cheap. And plant them and wait 20 years for their first crop, maybe 10 or 15 sometimes, but it's on average 15 to 20 years. So they're not cash crops that come around every year. And the last thing that I want to say about that is when we think about that this is something that's helping with conservation, it's not just helping the people out in the hinterlands of Georgia. When you have clean air anywhere in Georgia, when you have clean water anywhere in Georgia, it's because of forest land that's everywhere in Georgia. And we need to be sure that we help as much as possible. So I urge your favorable support of this resolution because it will help keep Georgia growing trees. It will help keep Georgia have communities that quite frankly, when you think about giving a tax break in a rural community, you think, well maybe that's hurting that community. But trees don't have to have police, trees don't have to have schools, trees don't have to have a lot of the things that high in neighborhoods do. And so we are keeping the farmlands and the treelands growing and that's what we want to have happen in Georgia for clean air and clean water. And with that Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote in favor of this and I yield the well. Ladies, yield the well and she knows of what she speaks. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Here in none the report the committee has agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Only adoption of House Resolution 32, the A's are 168, the A's are 5, the resolution every see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 473, 473? House Bill 473 by Representative Stevens in the 164th, and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 13 to title 16. The official go to Georgia and it's a relating to controlled substances, so else to provide for certain provisions relating to schedule one, control substances, this bill ever referred to the committee on health that committee recommends a disbile due pass. Chair Rick and my recognize, Jim, is it Garden City of Port Wentworth? Savannah. I was close. Representative gentleman from Savannah, Chairman Ron Stevens. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This you may recognize as our annual drug update that our department sends to us. It has to do with the Board of Pharmacy and also the drugs and narcotics. As you're flipping through, I've had somebody come down and ask what does this mean? First starting, the first four sections are talking about schedule one drugs. That's drugs that are typically highly abused and have no medical use. The first one there is an opiate. Very similar to in the same class as heroin. The second one is a mushroom. The third one is a stimulant, Ethyl Fena date. Some of you might recognize that as methyl Fena date, which of course is given for kids under the brand name of Ritalin. Again, the next one of course, it used to be an odor put in a natural gas to give some sort of odor so that you could tell if there was a leak. That's not used anymore. All the rest of these in Section 5 are dangerous drugs. You won't find these in your 7-11 store. But they do everything from cardiac myopathy, cancer, blood pressure all the way down the list. I'll be glad to tell you which one does if you're interested. But if not, I hope you'll go along and vote for the annual drug update bill. I'll take any questions if there aren't. If your year represents Sanchez, he's recognized for a question. Certainly. Does the gentleman yield? Sure. Thank you for this bill. Just a quick question. I saw that one of the things that are being added to the dangerous drug list, which means it includes a prescription. Is the monkey post vaccine? Can you just explain that? I'm sorry. Say that again. The monkey post-mpox vaccine, I believe. It's online, 79 if that's taken. That falls into all the vaccines and the class of categories. And of course, you'll also see below that. And you're probably going to be the next one to ask that. The allergy. There's a list of those that are in allergy extracts as well for peanut allergies. Got it. Those you won't find in 7-11 either. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you for another question. Representative McQueen to your left. Yes, ma'am. Hi, it is gentleman yield. Yes. So speaking about those allergens, specifically the peanut allergen powder, as someone who suffers from a severe peanut allergy, and I know that I have students who do as well, would that make it harder for us to get the treatments and the prescriptions that we need? Not at all. That's already in your physician's office, which by the way can dispense. So he already has this in his office. Your allergists, whenever you go to visit, those, this is standard in their office. Thank you. Gentlemen, ask them further questions. Thank you, Miss Speaker. All you know what? Gentlemen, as yield of the well, thank you for the presentation. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the other report of the committee's agreed to, shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 473? The yeas are 170 and the yeas are zero. This bill haven't received any requisite constitutional majority. Is there for passed? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 399-399? The House Bill 399 by Representative Oliver, 84th and others to be talented and active in the Arctic 1 and Chapter 7 of Title 44. The Fishcoated Georgia Anitetti relating to landlord and tenants in general, so it's required certain residential landlords to have in-state staff to manage tenants' communications related to such properties. This bill, that may refer to the committee on governmental affairs, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Oliver is recognized to present the bill. The ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to bring for your favorable consideration and hopefully your vote, House Bill 399, which addresses issue of accountability of the out-of-state large investors, large headphones, large moneyed entities that are purchasing significant portions of our single-family homes. This bill is passed across Georgia, particularly targeting the Atlanta area. Specifically, House Bill 399 says that any landlord who's not a resident of Georgia, who owns 25 or more single-family homes, shall employ a local broker, real estate agent, and have at least one person, at least one person, in Georgia, who can be identified as receiving complaints for the tenants of the significant numbers of single-family homes. I have worked with the community to improve this bill, and they have emphasized to me the opportunity that the real estate commission can have over the absentee landlords who are not repairing and not receiving and not implementing repairs as tenants are requesting. Last week, I shared with you an AJC article about the deaths of three children who died in Atlanta area, and the out-of-state landlord, that was apartments, and this bill 399 only applies to single-family homes, that was unidentified, would not answer, and could not be located in terms of the deaths of these three children. The issue of accountability of the out-of-state investor is a growing significance in our state, and I'd like to give you some specific numbers, and I asked the gentleman who controls the board up there to show us a map. There are two entities, invitation homes and progress residential, that end more than 10,000 homes each. There are seven entities that own a total of 51,000 single-family homes. When that county is the number one county for acquisition of single-family homes by these out-of-state investors, this map is not easy to read, but the top map, the darkest areas, are the house districts that have more than 50% of single-family homes owned by out-of-state investors, and the bottom map is the census tracks. These maps were prepared by geography professors at Georgia State. We also had hearings, thank you to the chairman of the government affairs committee, that brought to us academics from both Georgia State and Georgia Tech to discuss the significant impact on our economy of this purchase of single-family homes. Bringing it home to House District 84, there are 1,012 single-family homes in House District 84 that I represent that are owned by out-of-state investors, and 42.3% of those 1,012 homes are owned by an out-of-state investor. Why is this important? I think that we all know why it's important. In effects our economy in significant ways, if you are a single-family, young family looking to purchase a home, these investors are taking assets out of Georgia. They're making a profit on the rents charge, they're making a profits on the acceleration of values, and that profit is not being enjoyed and earned by Georgia families. The economy of the developer, if you're trying to develop a suburb, if you're trying to develop new housing stock, you are going to be competing with these entities who are going to raise the prices, take it away from your opportunity. It's even going to affect the governor who is trying to create workforce housing across Georgia. This is a big deal. I think that 390...

And is a small step. There are many of you who have talked with me about this issue. Both sides of the aisle, obviously. There are several other bills that Governor Maffer's Chair allowed us to have a good discussion about. And I'm delighted that more of us are recognizing the phenomena of loss of wealth from the individual families and from the businesses of Georgia. Thank you again for this opportunity to discuss this major issue. Let me personalize it a little more. For the last 80 years since World War II, when my two generations of the Oliver family purchased their first home during World War II, as my dad was going off to the Navy, in a small old neighborhood around within one mile of Emory University, we have held two generations, owned five homes since World War II, and each one of those homes close to the same community, where we had small businesses, we had good schools, we had safe neighborhoods, and we were able to acquire equities through these homes over a long period of time. When my parents' home in older neighborhood, they were not able to be there by themselves, and my mother came to live with me. The equity from that home allowed her to have full time home care in my home for many years in her 90s. I say this to you that this is an issue that affects all of us. It's an issue that I'm glad we're paying attention to, and Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to stand for questions. Thank you for your explanation of the bill. You have a couple of questions. Ladies, will she yield? Yes, sir. Representative Hefner to your left, how about midways back? Thank you, Representative. Did the General Lady yield? Yes, ma'am. So thank you. I will be supporting this bill because of what it offers renters, especially in the current system, natural disasters, where they need to have some immediacy and some response. But does the General Lady yield for a question? Yes, ma'am. Is it true that this bill does not interfere with the Federal Civil Service Members relief act, where those members who are military veterans or active duty are deployed and maintains all of their rights in terms of terminating leases, procuring mortgages, and notification. Is that not true? It is true, ma'am. Thank you very much for that good question. Thank you. To your right, Representative Beth Camp has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General Lady yield? Yes, ma'am. Thank you for bringing this bill. Is it true? Is it not true that what this bill does, it's very short, but it puts the purview of the Georgia Real Estate Commission over the property managers. So if someone is a bad actor, there is actually an entity that they can contact, and the people who are the bad actors, their license can be in jeopardy. And their ability to rent in our state could be compromised if they do not fulfill their duties as landlords. You're exactly right, and that's why this suggestion made to me by the realtors to increase the opportunity for enforcement was such a good idea. There's ongoing discussion about how this bill and these issues can be further improved. I appreciate the help that I've received from many of you, again, both parties, and I look forward to continuing this discussion. We know realtors in our community, and we know that they care about improving the values for families to enjoy the homes that they're purchasing. We have to put them a little bit more towards the center of these discussions and allow them to be protective of our constituents in these difficult issues of out of state ownership. Perhaps any feel or lie to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Speaker, does the general lady open? Yes, sir. Is it not true that establishing a locally based representative in a clear line of communication with out of state landlords would only serve but to increase response times and improve living conditions for children, youth, and families? I believe that's true. And it also creates enforcement for those out of state landlords who are not going to comply in the way that they code requires them. Housing codes require the new respond. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the bill. Mr. Speaker. You have another question to your right. Reptile to your home is recognized. If you'll take a question further to your right. Yes. Where around? Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it a general lady yield? Yes, ma'am. The second part where the person must be located within the state would a registered agent be somebody that would qualify in that situation? If they are the broker or the real state agent himself, herself, would qualify for that. That's correct. Thank you. But if it's an out of state, you know, you could have a real state agent at license in Tennessee and be governed by the real state commission of Georgia, even though you reside in Tennessee. We put that provision in so we would close a loophole of having somebody in Georgia available and identified to receive complaints by tenants. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted.

Mr. Bill, I refer to the Committee on Health. That committee recommends a disbill, do pass. I recognize to present the bill, Chair Lady Katie Dempsey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon. Many of you are here in 2022. When we passed the Mental Health Parity Act, HB1013, we still struggle. Proceed. That act endeavored to ensure that mental health and substance abuse treatment received the exact same insurance coverage as physical health services do. There are still struggles involved in this though. While we do have an online portal for challenges to be reported on, there is concern that the data may not be accurate. So this bill takes a step forward by adding a member to the Behavioral Health Coordinating Council. One member will be added. I serve on that council. And I think it will be a great thing for this to be added. The Commissioner of Insurance will be there and have a voice to represent the challenges that we face. It will also establish a parity compliance review panel made up of six members to actually put their muscle behind making sure that we are delivering what we promised in a bill back in 2022. It will hold insurers accountable for parity compliance creating a formal mechanism to review and address complaints. This bill is a significant step forward ensuring that mental health care is treated equally to physical health care with the insurance system of our state of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. If there are any questions, I'll be able to take them. Lady Hesse, further questions or no questions? If you are yielded well and asked for your favorable support to help true ordinance with true needs. Thank you for the bill. Lady Hesse, yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Period none of the previous questions ordered.

All in favor of the passage of the bill. Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no, Mr. Clerk? Will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted yes, so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 612, the yeas are 170 and the yeas are 2. This bill haven't received their requisite constitutional majority. Is there for a adopted? There for a passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 454-454? House Bill 4-5-4 by Representative Gaines, the 120th and others to be entitled and acted to amend chapter 3 and title 12. The official to George Anitani relating to parks historic areas, memorials and recreation. So as you create the Vince Dooley Battlefield Trust Fund and Vince Dooley Battlefield Trust Fund program. This bill then referred to the committee on Game Fishing Parks. That committee is recommend that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Athens, Representative Houston Gaines, is recognized to present the bill. Representative Gaines. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Please present House Bill 454, the Vince Dooley Battlefield Trust. A bill that will help us preserve some of our historic battlefields in Georgia. This legislation is named for the late great coach Vince Dooley, a lifelong history buff and a proponent of battlefield conservation. And a great friend of many of us here today. Coach Dooley loved history and he served on the board for the American Battlefield Trust. This bill will create a trust fund administered by the Department of Natural Resources. And importantly, it doesn't create any new administration or a new board to oversee this effort. The fund may include appropriations if we were to do so in the budget. It also would include public or private grants, gifts, donations or contributions dedicated to the fund. DNR would review and approve project proposals for matching grants for the purchase or permanent protective interests in our Georgia battlefields. This measure does require that any organization selected for grants must match $1 for dollar, any money given to the fund. Many other states up and down the East Coast have invested similar efforts that work to preserve historic battlefields, including Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and others. The federal government has done similar and often matches state and private funds. As we see more and more development creeping throughout our state, I think efforts to preserve these historic sites has never been more important. And doing so will help share and preserve our country's history and help educate future generations of Americans. Miss Speak, I'm happy to answer any questions. Chairman has a question to your left. Chairman Petrie, your extreme left. Chairman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is General Maniel. I do. My friend, is it not true that the tide was turned in the revolution by wars in the south and many of those battlefields are here in Georgia, Kettle Creek, Briar Creek, Siege of Savannah, Siege of Augusta, Menlike John Twigs and so many others, Lacklin, McIntosh. And we've really failed to recognize those sites as well as we could. You've given us an opportunity to do that. I want you to know how much I appreciate that. Well, thank you and appreciate your support and support of this body and would ask for everyone's favorable consideration. I'll run well. You can ask the representative. Donna, you have a question. It's okay to be your last one. Sorry, I just recognized another question. Does the gentleman you don't? Yes, sir. To my delegation, make it. Yes, sir. And I'm sorry I'm losing my voice, but is it not true that the VizDILi battlefield trust fund act will significantly aid in preserving our state historic battle. The general feels for the future generations to come. It does. Yes, sir. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you. General, we have so far the questions. Oh, you're the well. The gentleman is you, the well. Thank you for bringing the bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered here in another previous questions ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute here in none the committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill hearing none the report the committee has agreed to? Shall this bill now pass on in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine, on the passage of the bill, the yeas are of House Bill 544, 454, I'm sorry, the yeas are 157, the nays are 14, and this bill, having to see the records at constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 91, 9-1? House Bill 9-1 by rep. Cooper, the 45th and others to be entitled to amend Article 3, Chapter 50, Title 43 of the EFCH, George Annotated, relating to licensing so as to provide for a licensure for graduates of foreign colleges or schools of veterinary medicine who are abored, certified in specialty. This bill earned for the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Sharon Cooper is recognized to present the bill, Chair Lady Cooper. Good night. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I bring you the substitute to House Bill 91. Across our state, we are enduring here more vets, and we are especially in need of vets that are board certified, believe it or not. There's a three-year course, sometimes a four-year course, a course for vets, to further their education and become board certified in surgery and orthopedics, and all basically pretty much all the specialties we have in medicine. And this would allow vets that have gone to a foreign vet school, but most of them are already in this country, and they go to usually an American school for this four-year course or three-year course, and it would allow them to practice to be, and they are certified by one of the board certification approved boards in our state. They would be allowed to practice in the state of Georgia. If there are no questions, Mr. Figur, that's what the bill does, and I will yield the well. Thank you. Lady has no questions. Lady Gielder will. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objections to adopting the committee's substitute? Here none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here none of the committee has agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we will vote yes, all those opposed. We will vote no. Mr. Clerk, were you in line with the machine? Yes, I did. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked in the machine? On the passage of the House bill 91, the yeas are 169, the nays is zero. The bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority. The bill is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption to House bill 398? House bill 398 by Representative Hagen in 156. Another is to be entitled to the act to amend the chapter 22, the 26th of the fiscal day of Georgia annotated relay. The standards labeling and adulteration of food, so to authorize the production and sale of cottage food items with certain exemptions, requirements and disclosures. This bill I refer to the Committee on Act Culture, Consumer Affairs Act Committee recommends that this bill do pass. You got something you could put up in a minute. Tell us when you're ready. Representative Hagen is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If you will remember, if you were here last year, we passed this bill overwhelmingly out of this body. And I'm bringing you back to you now for your consideration again. This bill encourages small business growth and entrepreneurship by opening a new delivery string for our cottage food operators. If you remember, our cottage food operators are licensed through the Department of Ag. They produce non-potentially hazardous food goods, which means they don't require temperature control, because they are not capable of supporting the rapid growth of botulism and some other toxins. So these are safe foods, non-potentially hazardous. It's a booming industry for a lot of people. Currently, sales of cottage food products are only allowed directly to the consumer. This bill would allow sales via a third-party seller like a grocery store or a restaurant. And why does this matter? Because cottage food operators are at their very core just pure entrepreneurs. They get an idea, they go to their kitchen, and they see if they can make it work. They get licensed through the Department of Ag, and there's your business. So this is something that those of us that support small business would definitely want to encourage. It'll get their products in front of more of their potential consumers. And also, according to the Department of Agriculture, most, if not all of us, have got cottage food operators in our district. And they are very excited to potentially have another stream of delivery for their products. So Mr. Speaker, I would stand for a question if there is one, but I would also ask for your favorable consideration for this bill to encourage entrepreneurism and growth small businesses in our state. Lady has no question. Thank you very much. I yield the well. Ladies, yield to the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? No. It's a machine. No. It's a machine. It's a machine. It's a machine. All members voted for what purpose the represent can't rise. Parliamentary inquiry? The State of the inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true this bill ensures consumer protection protection by requiring proper labeling and disclosure for all cottage food products sold in Georgia. That's what I read. I thought it was a good deal. Thank you for the question. Have all members voted? All members vote? What purpose is representative Wilkerson rise? Parliament inquiry. State inquiry, sir. Is it not true that the delicious turtles that many of our members enjoy are cottage food products and I am very much appreciative to all those that have supported this bill. I know the gentleman knows the word he speaks and he's pretty good at those cottage food. Thank you for your benefit in this all. Mr. Clerk, I thank all the members of voter, all members of voter if so, will you please lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 398, HB 398, the yeas are 171 to nays or two.

House Bill 255, a representative of McLean of the hundred and ninth and others to be entitled to men code section 40, to 86 of the official go to Georgia and attendee relating a special license plates for voting or supporting certain worthy agencies funds or nonprofit corporations with proceeds, disperse the general fund.

I want you all to know that one 30th of the members in this House, you all know you all are trying to get those numbers together, but one 30th of the members one 30th of the members in this House are Delta's. That's good, six, so there's six Delta in this House. I want you all to realize, Representative Jackson is a Delta, Representative Davis is a Delta.

You all are going to bring it down, so I have Representative Bernal, Representative McQueen, and Representative Cummins. So those are the six that are Delta's in the House. And Representative Jones, I'm sorry, and Representative Jones, so I want you all to know that this is a tag that this will help them do the things they want to do in the community. Southern University is, you know, we have some great alumnus in the state of Georgia from Southern. The Keith Gammage who is the solicitor of Fullton County, he's from Southern University. I always tell people that Karen Cobb, who's also the judge and Cobb, Karen, excuse me, Wes, who's in Cobb County is the judge from Southern University. And always since, you know, we know about Lil'Bot Football, male blunt, the all-proud defensive back, he was a graduate of Southern University. No, I did not go to Southern University. I don't want, and I want to make sure make that clear, but when it was one of the schools that's a young high schooler I did apply to, but they didn't want any Oklahoma kids. Don't know why. But with that in mind, I'm going to speak to everyone to support these two great organizations because they do do a lot of things for the community as well as a lot of our students in Georgia go to Southern University. In fact, there were over 800 that applied last year and 350 plus were admitted. So with that in mind, Miss Bigger, I'll take any questions as long as they're not football. I don't know about that, Barbara, but you have a whole heap of questions. Miss Bigger, this is not my first meal, so I don't need all these questions, okay? And the other part of it, you're bigger than any of these want to ask you a question too. So, I think I best recognize that. Representative Barry is recognized for a question he's to your left, right in front of your seat, back there. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman to you. Yes, I will you for my sweet mate, my sweet mate, and somebody that I see roughly, no, yes, I think. So is it not true that you have not presented a bill in the minute, correct? I'm sorry.

The fiscal to Georgia and Tate relating to levy on business or practitioner within location or office in more than one jurisdiction allocating gross receipts and limits on levies using criteria for taxation. This bill remains worth committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The Reps. DeMonta hand is recognized to present House bill 141. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, today I rise to present House bill 141. This bill seeks to protect the financial privacy of businesses ensuring local governments continue to receive the revenue they need to function effectively. Currently when businesses report their gross receipts for the purposes of calculating local business taxes, they often are required to submit detailed financial records including tax returns, PNLs and other proprietary financial documents to local jurisdictions. This practice raises several concerns for small business owners and entrepreneurs across our state. Many business owners are understandably reluctant to disclose since the financial data to government entities, particularly when that information clues proprietary vendor relationships, competitive pricing details, payroll data and other confidential financial records. So under House bill 141 businesses will no longer be required to turn over their full financial records to local governments in order to determine their occupational tax liability instead a CPA who is bound by street ethical and financial issues standards could certify the gross receipts on behalf of the business. The local government will continue to create the required business occupation tax, ensuring no loss of revenue for the jurisdiction while also protecting the privacy of business owners. And will that Mr. Speaker, I will yield for questions. I will take one. Reps. Remind to your lift right at the center. I will recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker, it is a gentleman yield. So if for example the city had questions about any of the financial information, could they still request attack returns or is that mean they just can't request that at all? No, if a CPA certifies these results and the financial information, that is what they are going to get under this bill. The gentleman has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker, you are the well. The gentleman yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopt and committee substitute? Hearing none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the past of the bill? Hearing none of the report of the committee has agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the past of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All the passage of House Bill 141, the yeas are 158, the nays are 16, this bill, having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 165? House Bill 165, I represent a Franklin of the 160th and others to be entitled to amend, title 48 of the Fish Code of Georgia and it's added relating to revenue. And taxation, so as to repeal and reserve an income tax credit for business enterprises for lease motor vehicles. This bill I'm in for the committee and ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Lehman, representative Lehman Franklin has recognized to present the representative Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Because this is another way to try to help with the hurricane relief disaster that we've had. It's another attempt to do all that we can for those that were hurt. But basically what this bill does, it would extend the net casually lost deduction to non-automizers who would take the deduction on top of that standard deduction. So we currently do not conform to the federal standard deduction to say to conform with the federal intention to allow this deduction we would need the additional clarifying language. So having said all of that, basically if you don't qualify for your to itemize to see itemize return, you can take the this casualty deduction on your standard return. And that's all the bill does. Mr. Speaker, I'll take any questions that I may have. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you. You're the well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here you know the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here you know the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed on in favor of the passage of the bill. Will vote yes. All those opposed. Will vote no and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? So they don't like, they don't like, they don't like, they don't like, they don't like, they don't like. All members voted. All members voted. For what purpose does the representative camera arise? Parliament, in choir. Mr. Speaker, is it true that by updating our tax code with a fair standard deduction, we're strengthening the Georgia economy and putting more money back in the hands of working Georgians? I know the gentleman knows of what he speaks, whether you're in North Georgia or South Georgia. That fact holds. Have all members now voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 165, the yeas of 173, the nays are zero. This bill here is either requisite. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 262? House Bill 262.

That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Let's see, the author of this bill is a lady from rural South Georgia. Represented. The way just a minute now. I was going to say something nice about you, but I will. A lady from rural South Georgia knows a little bit about hospitals and health care. Would that be correct? I think she's a nurse. And at some point her life hasn't been a nurse. There is still a nurse. Once a nurse always a nurse, right? A representative, Angio, Stien has recognized to present the bill. Represented, voting. Now you're ready. No, you look like a veteran to me. I wouldn't have seen anything about it being your first time in the world. The teacher. The lady's recognized. Mr. Speaker, it is not my normal MO to correct my authority figure. But this is technically not my first time in the world. Ma'am. No, you have been to the well before, haven't you? Yes, sir. I've been to the well and this very house. You've asked several questions over there without asking, without pushing your button as well too. So you're a real veteran to this process. That might be because I've had a lot of help from my friend, Chas Cannon. And Brent Cox. But Mr. Speaker, can I call your attention to this picture over here? This picture was made in 1988. My senior year of high school, because I came here through Youth Assembly and debated bills all throughout high school. And that was the picture of the one and only time that I got my first bill passed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, or good evening, whatever it is this afternoon. I'm not even sure it's been such a long day. I bring to you House Bill 262. I'll be quick. This bill would establish a grant for rural hospitals to correct an obvious problem that Hurricane Helene unveiled during this path of destruction through Georgia last September. The current required minimum generating capacity proved to be woefully insufficient during this time of widespread disaster. With some hospitals going without power and water for a week or more. The criteria for this grant are as follows. Must be a rural hospital located in a rural community within one of the 41 counties included in the Governor's State of Emergency. After July 1, 2024, and it must contain fewer than 100 hospitals, I mean, sorry, fewer than 100 beds located in those counties with a population of less than 50,000 residents. There are potentially 30 qualified rural hospitals in those counties. The current financial state of these rural hospitals makes capital expenditures of increased inter-rater capacity prohibitive. On a personal note. Would you look at this next picture? That is a picture of my little 81-year-old daddy who almost lost his battle with a deadly bilateral pneumonia. At the point this picture was made, he was hospitalized for 49 days. He was scheduled to be discharged on September the 26th. Thankfully, the nurse at the hospital in Jeff Davis County said, I think that let's just see what this storm does before I send you home because your oxygen depended. Little did she know the wrath that it would bring the next day. And he spent 17 more days in the hospital because they didn't have power. That hospital went without power for seven days. They could not flush toilets. They could not wash hands. They had to reduce everything that only the little generators would operate and thankfully it operated the ventilators and the oxygen. So I know you're going to have fun with me with this bill. But at the end of the day, these hospitals are dependent on us and these communities are dependent on us. So I would greatly appreciate your favorable consideration. I will yield for questions reluctantly, Mr. Speaker. Well, we're going to see if the second time is a charm. I don't know if you passed it that first time when you were in this wheel a few years ago. This is a great bill. It's a great need. Our hospitals, whether in rural Georgia or urban Georgia, are lifeline as many of us. But you do have a couple of questions. If the ladies go next, I'll let you have a shot at them. All right. Let's do it. Then representative Gamble is a way, he's a boy. You got to him. Some people in this chamber do have a heart. Let's see about these other guys. Well, I said that too quickly because Representative Jason Ridley has recognized for a question to your right. Wait, Brown. You're way back here. Yes. Thank you. General recognized. This is General out of yield. Well, just remember this representative Ridley. My predecessor is sitting right over there and he's watching you. But yes, I will yield. Well, this kind of comes from him, believe it or not. Is it not true that the other day, and I guess this still stands the other day we had your bill on, but we had to go back and make a little adjustment to it. Is that correct? Yes, sir. That is correct. And on that morning, we got a call from Athens, Georgia from a certain little girl. And her, she said, y'all better not be mean to my mom. You sure did get that phone call. And so I'm not going to be mean to her, mama. Because her husband said, back there, he's bigger than me. Thank you for bringing this bill. It's a great bill. Thank you so much. Just lady Racken, deal for a question to representative Meeks to your right. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was generally the yield. Yes, sir. I do. On line 16 of 17, were you indicate that the hospital must have been a reason that was declared a disaster or state of emergency after July 1, 2024? Is it your intent that moving forward as another disaster is indeed experienced in some of these real communities that those hospitals would then qualify? Say that again now. Hit me with that one more time. On line 16 of 17, were it's 100 beds and located in a region of the state in which the governor declared a state of emergency after July 1, 2024? That's for those 41 counties that the governor declared a state of emergency after that date. Right, but moving forward, say this year we have another state of emergency issue with those hospitals and those communities in qualify? I would be open to that, but that's not what this bill directs to. Okay. It just says after July 1, 2024, I thought it would be indeed dead qualified. That's not what this bill is for. Right? Am I correct? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, sounds like a pretty good answer. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. You're not yielding the well, are you? No, sorry. I'm not here. Let's see. You have a lot of friends. Just get a good question from a lady from rural Georgia's World Representative Hagen has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate it. Do you yield? I do yield to my friend. Yes. Thank you for all your hard work on this. We have had many conversations about what should be included and how this would best serve the communities that need it most. And I'm wondering if you considered putting nursing homes, including nursing homes in this bill. I appreciate that question very much. I did consider it. It was brought to my attention. And I'm very tender to that because I had a grandmother that spent seven years there and my husband's grandmother spent many years there. So I am very sensitive to that. But specifically when times of crisis hit, I watched these hospitals. Nursing home patients need to come to the hospital when all transfer patients from the hospital to the nursing home. So this is our first line of defense. And to that point, there were actually people who brought portable home oxygen that were recharged. They actually brought those to the hospital so that they could get charged up. That is ground zero. That is the point where everything starts or the hospital. So thank you for that question. I appreciate that. I appreciate you bringing the bill. Just a couple more for Lady Otte. One from Representative Sharper to your left all the way to the back. Yes. All right. The gentleman lady, you? Yes, sir. My friend. I do. All right. You go to my friend and a good husband of your friend of your husband as well. But I've been in the medical field for over 35 years now. And I'm glad she brought up the situation about the nursing homes. I think there's something that we need to look forward to in the future because when you have a nursing home that goes down on multiple nursing homes, goes down, you don't have enough amlases or anything first responders to be able to go for one to check on those patients. And also, if that believe the nursing home and go to the hospital, that's the nightmare, especially when you have other emergencies going on. But I 100% support this bill. But I think in the future we need to also look at the nursing homes, get me the same grants. And thank you so much. Thank you so much. I want to make, I wanted to kind of piggyback off that in addition to people where I was in Covey County. We had a cardiac cath lab. It was shut down because we didn't, we could not operate it. There was not enough generating capacity to operate it. But over in Representative Work Hizer's district, one of his hospitals, they were in the same position that we were, that some of those machines are cryogenically cooled. And a machine called $600,000. The deductible for it was $598,000. There were within one hour of losing that entire machine, one hour of losing that entire machine. So it's in addition to equipment, medication, more than more than people. Thank you so much. Representative Todd Jones is interested in asking you a question. Would you yield to Representative Jones? To your right. Yes, sir. I do. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman leave yield? I am going to regret this, but yes, sir, I do. We have a very important scientific question. In 1985, Marty McFly learned that it took 1.21 jigglewats to go back to the future. We need to know how many one megawatt generators would it take to travel in time? Mr. Speaker, I think that today is a good day since I heard that Terry England has stood up. I think today is a good day to pay homage to our friend, Terry England, because I hear that he is a Jerry Clouder fan, just like me. And I'm going to pay homage to him with an old classic called the chauffeur and the professor. So I am going to defer that question to my professor who is Chairman John Corbett, and I will yield the will. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your time. We appreciate you staying with us. Can we do have a speaker on the bill? Speaking of favor, representing Mack Jackson, who knows a little bit about rural Georgia and rural issues. Representative Jackson, appreciate you speaking on the bill. The gentleman is recognized. Thank you, the speaker. Today I rise in support of House Bill 262. Hurricane Helene was possibly the most worse natural disaster in many of our lifetimes. The devastation and loss of lives, the loss of electricity was horrendous. The power outages necessitated the use of generators in most of our communities. It was a vital service, not only in the...

homes within our hospitals. And this legislation is a fix for critical assessed hospitals. But even though we're taking this necessary step, we must not forget our community health care centers who played a vital role in the recovery efforts following the hurricane. They too need the necessary backup generators, especially in our rural communities. So while I support House Bill 262, I'm advocating for generators for our community health care centers too. Thank you and I yield the well. Jim was yielded well. Yes, we have some more work to do in that area. That concludes our comments on House Bill 262. No further speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to report the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 262, the yeas are 173, the nays are zero. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. It's zero for pass. Congratulations. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption in a group of privileged resolutions?

Colleagues, please join me today in celebrating and honoring the life of my Wheeler High School classmate and a great Georgian, Amir Abdur Rahim. Coach Amir dedicated his life to basketball, not only as a player, but as an inspiring coach. As a head coach of Kennesaw State University, he led the basketball team to the program's first NCAA tournament appearance in 2023. He inspired countless individuals and truly wanted the best for his student athletes, not only on the basketball court, but in life. I still remember always looking up to him when we were in high school, not only because he was so much taller than me, but because he was a leader. Before his passing in October of last year, he was the head coach of the University of South Florida where he emphasized integrity and community engagement. He was a loving husband to his wife, a dedicated father to their three children, and shared his love for basketball with his brother, Sharif Abdur Rahim. He left us too young, but his legacy lives on. He will continue to be honored through initiatives such as the Love Winds Classic. I'm proud to present a resolution honoring him, and if you can join me in a moment of silence. Mr. Speaker, we're also joined by his mother Deborah, his sister, and a few of our classmates and friends here today. They can stand, and I like to give a round of applause and honoring and celebrating a mirror. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Members of your remain standing to the family. Thank you for being here. Life ended way too soon. When that standing gentleman is here, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank you for your support.

Members of your remain standing. She has some friends with her. Representative Scofield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House. On Thursday, March 27, my community lost a man with a huge heart and a measurable helping hand and a strong love for his community. Mr. Morrie's Davis was the owner of JMR Tireshop and Southeast Atlanta. He was gunned down by a man he employed, a person he was helping turn his life around in the right direction. Tragically, he was murdered in front of his own son who also worked with him. Morrie's was always extending out all of brands to help others. During the summer, I kept reminding myself I wanted to provide him and give him a resolution, honoring his service to the community and acknowledging him as a small business owner. I knew he had never been to the Capitol and would never come. So I said to him, wait, I said to myself, let me wait until I get back to the Capitol and I'll put the resolution in. About two weeks ago, he put air in my tires and I said to him, I want to do something nice for you because you're such a good person and a pill in the community. He laughed and then flashed a big smile and said, rep it ain't necessary. I'm just here to help. I didn't file the resolution thinking I had time before a sign he died. I'm sad at the missed opportunity. So this body, if something is laid on your heart for someone else to do it. To the family, Morrie's was loved. He loved his family. We talked about his children all the time. And even though he's gone, it was through JMR tires that he showed his love to the community. To the community, it's tough, but we'll heal together as we will truly miss a servant and friend to most. Let's bow our heads and send up a silent prayer for all who knew Morrie's. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you for that. And our best wishes and condos to the family. Representing baseball. Representing baseball and some friends are recognized for an effort. Thank you members for standing in your attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a reminder, we had this invitation some time ago, but then the ice and snow decided we had to cancel and you get another day for this. So I'm reminding you all that you are invited to the Ramadan F Tardiner, honoring Georgia's legislators and leaders. And that's going to be tomorrow at 5 p.m. Program stars at 5.30 down in the blue room at the freight depot. So please come and enjoy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you.
