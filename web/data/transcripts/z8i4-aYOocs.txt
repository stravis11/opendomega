You
So for me, if I can, because I always like ladies to go first, so I represent it a lot.
You want to start off?
It's actually representative bill.
Okay, I was just trying to be politically incorrect.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Well, good morning, members of the committee.
I'm here to present House Bill 254,
LC 491340S.
This bill modernizes legislation relating to legal organs.
This bill is brought because, you know,
we see a definite change in print media
in the modern world, just looked at a study here
that says by 2025, a full third of our newspapers
are projected to be lost by then.
And this particularly impacts rural Georgia,
where they're less papers to begin with.
And over the last few years,
we've had legal organs cease publication
and leaving counties without good options
for legal organs according to Georgia law.
So this visits that issue, it changes Georgia Law
to make it easier for these counties
to select a good legal organ.
The other part of this legislation
is addresses the errors that seem to be fairly prolific.
I have some research from Columbia County
that over the last five years, they've
decided 20 errors in publication that resulted in the
interruption of legal processes as a result of these errors.
So what this legislation does in section three is that it allows
the municipality or county to run the ad as currently required in the legal
But if the legal organ fails to publish the ad as as it was supposed to
They can now use electronic means to to back that up and proceed with the process
By with the the announcement on electronic means
So that change was section three the other thing that's addressed in this bill is under section two
this drastically increases the ad rates for legal organs, first 100 words, so have
been increased from $10 to $15 and on subsequent publications nine to
$14 per 100 words. So with that that's that's pretty much the bill from
beginning to end I'll stand for your questions. Or actually I guess I guess
a representative lot wants to present some Columbia County data for you.
If the chairman allows, I would like to do that.
Of course.
I know we spoke about that earlier.
I came because we are having difficulties in Columbia County.
And one example, just to explain why we even entered into this,
we requested through our legal organ and ad on May the 24th
and listed the dates for it to run.
On June the 1st, when it did not run, we sent an email
that said, please run beginning 6-8.
On June the 6th, we sent a note
that just said we've not received a response.
On June the 7th, we received a return letter back
that said, due to a recent transition,
the below add cannot run 6-8, are there alternate dates?
And all of this was for a sewer repair.
So we went from June the 1st until the week after June the 8th
because basically they could not get the ad done.
And we've had example of that over and over.
And so the request was made, and Representative Jacobs
did state clearly that the intent of this
is to not change any of the requirements
on our legal organs.
It's still required, and it doesn't
change any of the requirements of the legal organ.
They still must do all that they said they would do.
But this last, this third section just
allows for the digital ad placement to count as day one.
And that will help us continue on with our projects.
That's really my piece, and I'd be welcome.
I'd welcome any questions as well.
And I'm not sure which one of y'all wants to address this,
but I'll take your questions.
When I started looking at the bill,
and you mentioned in your testimony that there's
newspapers that are going out of business, out of circulation,
that presents a problem.
I believe the AJC even announced that they're going full digital.
They're not going to be publishing on newsprint anymore.
And you start looking at this.
I reached out to my local newspaper that does several newspapers
and several counties around me in most of my district.
We talked a little bit about it.
One of the things that I want to commend,
where's our Georgia Press Association folks,
said they, I want to commend the Georgia Press Association
for having a website that kind of combines
all of the legal ads in one location
where if you wanna go look at them that way,
I'm not gonna do it to your bill,
but I do know that in the future,
we probably wanna look at, you know, okay,
how do we take that Georgia Press Association
repository of all of the legal ads,
make that into something that we can use
as the statewide legal organ, searchable database,
electronic, everybody's got access to it.
But more importantly, let them print that every day
and send to 159 counties to 159 county clerks and do that.
We won't do it today, but I will tell you,
there's a lot of opportunities to make this a little more
technology savvy and a little bit more friendly.
The, I commend you on it.
I do have a question about when you mention the excessive increase,
You're the one that sponsored the bill.
I am.
I didn't realize I used that adjective,
but there is an increase.
You agree.
Yes, you didn't use an adjective out.
If that wasn't exactly it, it was,
you did say it was quite large or excessive.
So you want to touch on that.
How'd you reach that number?
That number is, these ad rates hadn't increased
in about 30 years.
And so these, I believe it was the press association
that helped us out to find where the increase
should be increased to on those ad rates.
Okay.
Yeah, you've got a couple of questions from it.
I'm sorry, get asked, I think the consumer pricing index
on that would have placed it over $18.
So we've cut back a little bit
and we just try to make a compromise in the middle.
Okay, yeah, I've got a couple of questions from our members,
our whip, Senator Robertson.
Good morning, I appreciate you all bringing this legislation.
Brief history, I learn how to read reading a newspaper
with my mom and I love newspapers.
Every Sunday, I buy as many as I can with my wife
and I go to brunch and I love them.
But my problem is is when I go to other cities,
Columbus, Asheville, other places on the visit,
As I walk around, I see these paper boxes that are newspapers.
And I get the newspapers out and they have some news articles in them,
but fairly quickly I realize these are radical or racist or something like that
publications that mix in news with a political slat and something like that.
So and they have a circulation beyond 100 per issue, of course.
So could one of these, if the local legal organ is not meeting
in all of its requirements, could they possibly qualify
to be a temporary avenue to get these legal notices in there?
So what they benefit from it?
So if the legal organ, if a legal organ that is specified
in Georgia code is not available, then
was it the probate judge sheriff in the Clerk of Superior Court,
The majority of those officers will select one that does have at least a hundred copies
per issue in their county and those members have that full discretion.
And yes, I am aware of media bias myself, we've all seen that.
Yes, and you and I have sat down and watched it together.
My concern is, and of course, it makes my opinion, I find the Harris County Journal I find
to be a legitimate newspaper, the Columbus ledger I find a legitimate newspaper.
But there's a newspaper in my district that I do not find to be a legitimate and they
print them out by the stacks, they go put them into the drug stores and other places if
people can grab them when they grab real newspapers
and as they walk out and by doing this
and understand it would be a temporary fix
because of the failure of the legal organ
but they could benefit from running these types of ads.
That is correct.
I just wanna make sure.
And I'll also say, and I think we all,
probably a lot of folks here are aware,
the house has tried to address this issue
for the last several sessions
I think there's been attempts with the Senate to solve some of these same problems and the
reality is this is the one that we've gotten out of our chamber to your chamber and it
will help a lot of people and that's, you know, I think there is a lot of work to be done
as you said on this matter.
I hope we can continue to work on this in the future but this is what we've been able
to get across the finish line to this committee today.
Thank you.
You mentioned that it was a sewer repair.
Was there sewage spill occurred because of the failure of the ad?
There was not in particular.
They were just doing a sewer repair at the time.
They were doing a sewer repair and had to post.
But in that was one example, again, he mentioned that we had them.
We've had them track them for the last five years,
and we have tried for many years to get some solution
to these problems, one being what you just discussed,
creating that interim legal organ and then of course this we have we we want to be
able to post on our county website and on the Georgia public notice website and have
that count so yeah we're really we're really just we're begging for a solution to all of
our delays. Thank you. Senator Stale you have a question?
The attorneys that I've spoken to about this bill, both Metro and rural, they've for the
last decade or more, they've been referring to either the local county website or public
notices or the toward public notice website because it's more reliable, it's more consistent,
doesn't have the issues that you suggested.
And as a former media guy myself,
it's very poorly kept secret that these ad rates
are what keep a lot of these small papers alive.
And legal notices are what pay for newspapers.
So given them a 50% pay increase,
because they haven't needed it for 30 years,
because they had higher circulations.
Now to a decrease in circulation,
now they want a fifth percent pay bump,
just kind of wondering the logic that went into that,
other than just, it was 30 years
and now they're wanting it.
Right, and it was explained to me essentially,
it's been 30 years and the cost of everything has gone up
and that was their basis to my understanding.
And I can add something to that.
Certainly the younger generation is still, you know,
is interested in the digital,
but I know in my community and a lot of rural communities,
we still have a very heavy population of people
that like Senator Robertson want to buy the paper.
So the circulations have decreased,
but we did not, it was not our intent in this legislation
to make the big change, to force all of those notices
to go elsewhere, or even allow all of those notices
to go elsewhere at this time,
just because we had to recognize
that there are a lot of people that do still rely
and really adore having a newspaper in their hand.
So we did kind of focus on the middle ground again.
So then as a follow up to that,
so because people like to have a hard paper in hand,
that's for news and shopping guides
and everything else like that,
not necessarily for legal notices,
which is the purpose of this.
I'm just wondering if we're giving
rural newspapers of a prop up for the handful of legal notices they get just to try to keep
some of those papers going.
And is this the vehicle that we're using to keep rural print media alive?
I would not suggest it was the vehicle.
I'm going to suggest it was the whole reason that Senator Robertson can read.
And so if that's what may happen, we want to keep Senator Robertson able to read.
I'm not sure that works, but Senator terrestive as you have a question.
Mr. Chairman, I'd also like to note that I believe the representative said that Mr.
Robertson was a certain generation that would rely on these print documents.
I don't know.
Maybe I heard that incorrectly.
You may have been implied.
I do appreciate the comments about the rates, but I think it is worth noting that if you
keep out with CPI, these rates would have been much higher, relative, right, $18 instead
of $15, and I do think that there are plenty of folks who rely on these legal notices being
in print, although not of my generation. And certainly want to support what we can but
also make sure that the process is updated and correct. So, Mr. Chairman, I'd love to
make a motion.
At the proper time I'll call on you to do that. Said we do have one witness that wants
to testify on the bill and that would be Mr. Todd Edwards from the Association of County
Commissioners Georgia. Okay. The Senator Svaz, your motion would be in order.
And if you would state your LC number. Okay, is there a second?
second from Senator Williams the all in favor please signify by saying aye
Senator Butler you know I hear you okay thank you the your motion passes
unanimously said the so congratulations who would you like to carry this bill
in the Senate Lee Anderson okay we're not sure if he can
green. Oh, I wanted to say that. Thank you very much. You all have a good day. Appreciate
you testimony. Thank you, Freddie. Colonel Hitchens, I believe you're up next with
House bill 437, if you don't mind.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I'm here on behalf of Substitute to House bill 437, LC365509S.
Do we have that?
Yeah, what was that LC number again?
LC.
I'm actually going to replace it.
The new substitute, LC-36-55-23S.
Thank you.
So now we're on the same page.
And essentially it's the same, but this is on behalf of the Department of Administrative
of services within the Department of Administrative,
administrative attach is a group called
the Georgia State and Demification Commission.
And the mission of the State and Demification Commission
is to provide monetary benefits to public safety officers
killed in the line of duty or permanently disabled.
And essentially all this bill does,
it's been in place for many years,
I served 12 years on the commission myself
and I know very much how it works.
And what this does is the commission is made up as the governor's chairman and about nine
department heads.
And with me today is Aldham Cole, who's the general counsel for DOES, and she's the one
that administers the program, but what this bill would do is it would change it from
the commission to being the responsibility of the commissioner of DOES.
and actually Ms. Cohen her current position would be a hearing officer and she would hear
the case. As they do it today she prepares the case she does all the all the legwork with
her staff and presents the case 99% of the time the commission goes along with whatever
recommendation they make. But she would be the hearing officer if the petitioners unsatisfied
with the result means the ability to petition it to the Commissioner of the Department of
Administrative Services. If they're unsatisfied there, they can move it to the Superior Court.
That's essentially it.
Committee members, are there any questions or a sponsor?
I don't know if there's coal or something.
Sir Robertson.
Mr. Chairman, I was just going to at the proper time.
Senator S. Vaz, you have a question.
Yes, the appeal process at the moment,
it would go through the commission
and then after the commission, what would be the?
In current status or what's proposed?
Current status is the department makes an initial decision.
We do, through our risk management services program,
we also run the state liability program.
This is something we are well versed on
as reviewing claims and back-to-plains
and making determinations.
And that initial determination can be appealed
to the commission, as Colonel Hitchin said,
we prepare and prep the commission for those meetings.
Those meetings are difficult to schedule,
given those folks that are sitting on those meetings.
This is really intended to streamline that process.
But ultimately, the appellants have the opportunity
to be heard in front of the decision maker,
which will now be the commissioner of DOAS.
And then we added that fourth or additional level
of appeal to Superior Court, which is not currently
exist in law as an additional protection
of oversight over the department's actions.
But this is something that is just intended
to get answers to these public safety officers
and their families in a more efficient and quicker manner.
Because right now it's a little bit more cumbersome
of a process to pull that commission together
for those decisions and those meetings.
Thank you, and that's what was at the heart of my question
was do they have the right to appeal to the court now?
And the answer is no.
Not directly in statute.
There's a legal argument that potentially we
haven't experienced that in the history of the commission
to my knowledge.
It hasn't been tested, but we're putting it and writing it
directly within the code.
It will be within our roles and regulations
that we will also promulgate pursuant to the bill
as well regarding and providing information
to the appellants as to how the new process will operate
and we will, of course, provide direction
around that of justice for your port as well.
And there's nothing in the bill right now,
but with COVID, they've become very backlogged.
They've got about triple the number of people
who've asked for a review because determination
about whether you've got COVID based on your activities
at work or whether you pick it up somewhere else
been very difficult to differentiate.
This would just be an expedient manner of panning them.
The governor and all the department
heads wouldn't be tied up routinely in trying to deal with these.
Like Mr. Chairman, how many people did you have a panel?
Well, as far as how many actual appeals
we received in the last four years,
we've only received six appeals that went
in front of the commission.
As for all Hitchens, as far as actual total claims,
the claims went from an average of about 15 per year
to closer to 50 per year during 2020 and 2021 and 2022.
We're starting to see a little bit of a drop now,
but that's kind of total claims versus appeal.
We just don't have very many of these appeal claims
coming up and therefore we generally try to have
at least two to pull together a commission meeting.
And so the results of that, because of the effort that goes into this commission meeting,
we've only had about one per year the last four years.
So this is just to get those answers a little bit quicker.
I notice that on our after January 1, 1990, are there any out there that perhaps 1989 that might be affected?
No, sir. I don't believe that we have any. So the way that the payment of these work is it's either a lump sum or it's a five year payment process.
So any claims from that far back would have been resolved by now. And we only have one pending appeal in the moment.
And I believe that was the actual occurrence of the death that my memory serving me well was 2021.
Thank you, Senator Robertson, you have a motion.
I do.
Quickly.
I want to tell the Colonel thank you for streamlining this process.
Very familiar with it.
And clearing up this bureaucracy will also save us some money.
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'd make a motion do pass.
And that LC number.
So reading test.
Yes, sir.
Large print.
Large print.
And in a certain age, it will definitely be large print.
The LC, I'm looking at is LC365523S is in Sierra.
Thank you.
We have a motion in a second from my vice chair.
So the all in favor, please signify by raising your hand.
Thank you.
I can see better than I can hear.
Congratulations, Carl.
Who's going to carry this bill for?
Senator Albrecht.
Senator Albrecht, okay.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I miss Cole.
If I could, if I will ask you to stay.
Okay, the mother of all bills said that we're going to have a hearing and a hearing only on it, but I do want to have, uh, come on up.
Representative said they, uh, we appreciate you coming up.
Is there a representative saying you all, you know, would you want my vice chairman to join you out there?
He looks better on TV up here.
You know, I have a great view of him right now, so I'd hate to lose it, but wherever he'd like to sit, I'm
I know that this will be the tag team show.
So, Representative Sains, why don't you help us kind of walk through the bill.
And the reason that just so you know, and I've got a couple of questions that I read through the bill.
And I look and I want to ask our committee members to between the hearing today and our next meeting
to ask you to each read through the bill and understand kind of what it does, because this is quite honestly, it creates the automatically 159 authorities in every county and can also creates one for every city.
So this is a very big step that when we start talking about this and it's not a bad purpose.
I get, you know, what they're trying to do, but it has the potential to create an awful lot, or it does create an awful lot of authorities.
Well, Chair Mr. Chairman, I have a simple little bill to bring them before the committee.
Just a couple of 23 pages, 25.
I would note, in terms of the Chairman is correct, in terms of the language of the bill, creation of local authorities.
That's typical language on authority legislation.
It must still be authorized by each locality.
So though the enabling legislation puts it as created, so it is correct, the practicality
of it is every city or county who wants the authority to be in use would have to approve
each authority.
Or else it's codified in law, but it is not active, I want to start with that because
I know that is a dramatic language in terms of that law.
I'll go back and talk about the premise and the policy intent of the commercial property
assessment, conservation, energy, and resiliency program that this legislation would enable.
We currently have that program in code under the downtown development authorities.
This only one has been able to work under that framework in Atlanta, given the size and
scope of that downtown development authority, is just shown not to be the place or the intent
of DDAs to go into this kind of financial mechanism as you can see it is complex.
This loan program would enable a private property owner to seek 100% private capital for
approving purposes in the bill, at a much lower rate than you typically get a
structure, and the approved purposes would be anything that is energy
efficient, which would be above required building code, and also particular
interest in my district, and I'm sure many others, if a natural disaster
happens, or to prepare for typical hurricanes, tornadoes, to build a building
a building that is more resilient to those natural disasters.
That would also be allowable.
I have a good example of the legislation, a developer, Jacobi development, who is revitalizing
the Gilman paper mill property in San Mary's, Georgia, which was once the largest employer
in the entire southeast below making.
has been a brownfield site for the last 15 or so years.
They came and asked for this legislation
because they saw this as a very good tool
in their arsenal and developing that.
Many other developers have seen it as well.
So though it is a complex bill,
I think the policy intent and the usability
to move our communities forward with private capital
is more than worth looking at.
The legislation itself is based on the resource recovery
development authority code section, so it's eight, we bring the language into this and
create that new authority. Currently we have economic development authority code section,
the DDA, resource recovery, and then this would be the new one for the CPS program. And
that is where the authority language comes in. The purpose of the authority, because
of Georgia's gratuities laws, we have to, in other states, they could be a pure transaction
just like a bank loan.
Because of the way our mechanisms work,
that's what requires the authority to be in place.
The local government would create.
The authority can be a city or a county.
For the purposes of this, it can mimic
your economic development authority board,
so it could practically function
under that same organization and staff members.
And then once it's in place,
that landowner who would like to use
that property owner would find the private capital provider
to use that C-PACE program.
The authority would approve it,
the local government that enabled the authority
would then have the requirement to approve it,
or deny it, so there are several filters here
to make sure it's in good.
And that local government and authority
can capture this or?
Yeah, well, I interrupt just a minute
and let's make some questions here.
and I've worked with a couple of development authorities.
When you look at a private equity coming into something like this,
and okay, you got a agreeable lender that says, hey, I'm going to let you borrow some money.
You know, they're taking advantage of the tax situation and the tax advantage
is of doing it through a local government.
is there why you're getting a better rate as the only thing I can assume.
Much better rate will help fund a project like this,
but when you do have an authority or any kind of government involved in it,
then I look at the taxpayers and they're on the hook for this.
Because if the project fails, at some point,
then you're going to have the taxpayers may end up having to eat that loan.
How do you protect the taxpayers?
So I don't want to miss state.
I think that's a great question.
If you're amenable to it, if I could ask George Ray
or one of his many, Earl Taylor, who is a specialized attorney
in this in authority and bond law to respond to that,
if you're a given to the chair.
Hey, I hope Taylor would dealt some bullets.
So the tax payers were not at risk of this statute.
But first of all, the authority obligation specifically provides that the tax payers
could never be taxed to pay the authority obligation.
The intergovernmental contract between the authority and the local government provides that
it has to be a limited obligation to the local government, payable only from the special
assessment that the commercial property owner approving their property agrees to put on
their property.
It's an only source of payment for these financial obligations is a special assessment commercial
property over the grays to put all the property. The general tax payers, the
general flood, could never be touched under this legislation the way it's
drafted. I'm not a lawyer so I'll admit that right up front but I was a county
manager in a county where the county did a bond and an intergovernmental
agreement to build a new hospital. Right, none of the tax payers were thinking
And they were on the hook until the hospital went down and the bonds weren't paid and
then they realized, oh wait, we got a couple million dollars to pay off on this deal.
And so for me, maybe we can talk after long since today is just a hearing.
Maybe you can get in better explanation for me on that.
That is a great concern for me, how do we protect those tax payers and moving this forward
and maybe you can explain it?
Yeah, there are intergovernmental contracts
that a developed authority can intergovernmental contract
to the city of Kentucky.
A city can play a candy can play
as up to 1 mil, a tax, a city can play
as up to 3 mil of tax to back a developed authority obligation.
That is not allowed under this bill, the hospital authority.
Example you gave me, the tax payers can have an intergovernmental
contract that pledges up to 7 mils of tax
for a hospital authority obligation.
none of that is permitted or this legislation,
the deposition of inter-government contract,
it's a limited obligation to the local government
people, only for the special assessment.
And I'll direct it to Representative Sainz.
I'm sorry, but on the bill, I looked at your makeup
of your authority members and you're pointing two
of the members and then those members can appoint
other members, if I remember right, reading somewhere in the language that how the authority
is made up.
So if it's a psycho-candy for a joint authority.
So a joint authority?
Yes.
So the joint authority, I don't believe the members could appoint other members.
The sponsoring line 184 with additional member to be appointed by the Board of Directors
themselves.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, in the case of a joint resiliency, each unit shall point two members with additional
members to be directed by directions themselves.
Yeah.
So, what that does, it gives each sponsoring government an equal number of members and
you got to have a tiebreaker.
It's so the sponsoring government's members
all have got to agree on his goodby the tiebreaker
the way the bill is designed.
So it's a sign, the way that I read the code,
it's a single member, additional one member
that to make it odd.
And I don't know if we want to tighten that language.
And that's where for me.
I'm just trying to ask some questions
because this truly adds a, every county, every city can create this authority and you
could literally, we could end up having hundreds of more authorities here.
One of the questions that I would ask would be because we have an authorities registration
requirement in Georgia.
Well, you've created all the authorities, but you haven't, they don't have the ability
to do transactions.
So, where does that fall into DCA's requirement that every authority, they have a report
for what's going on with their authority registration each year.
Will these authorities now that they're created, will they have to respond to DCA and how
does that work?
Yes.
One second.
Prior to that, I would say there is an amendment because we had had the discussion
and government affairs in the House in terms of the language that enabled all the authority
to be created after the response because I'm sure there is one.
We are amenable to make in the interim after we have this hearing to look at that language
if that might make the committee more amenable to modify that language to where it creates
all authorities instead of enables local government to create the authority.
I just wanted to state that because it was a concern and government affairs in the house
as well.
Yeah.
So the bill does create every city, county, authority and that's typically how general
law about authorities work. They lie dormant until the local government adopts an
activated resolution, activating the authority. So as those are lie dormant, there's no
requirement to register with DCA because it's not a legally activity. What's that
activated resolution adopted? It becomes active. Then it will fall under the
registration provisions of DCA and will register with DCA just like every
authority of Georgia does. And this is the, the general, the
development authorities clause, the Constitution authorizes the
general assembly to create development authorities. They
in 63, they, they created the, the development authorities law
78 resource recovery, development authorities law 81, the
downtown development authorities law, this will be the fourth
exercise of that power of the Constitution. And for me, one of
the questions that, that, you know, just comes to mind right on
this is, okay, why create all these new authorities?
Why don't we use the existing development authorities
and give them some additional powers to say,
hey, if the development authorities
so chooses to do this,
what would be wrong with allowing that development authority
to create this authority for energy
and efficiency and stabilization?
What?
That was my first question when it came
because that's probably my least favorite part of the bill.
I still like the policy enough to have moved it forward.
My understanding, and I'm sure Mr. Taylor can elaborate on this,
is the complexity of the sea-paced structure
and it being completely private capital.
It fit better in creating different code.
I understand it is possible if the committee does prefer
to do something under the economic development code,
but we then are giving economic development authorities
more broader powers.
So there is a benefit to look at it in the realm of right now local government can decide
if their community has this kind of power.
If we put it in code section for economic development authorities, those local communities
couldn't decide that that existing development authority having that added power.
So there's benefits and downfalls to both approaches.
But I do want to state if that is an approach the committee wants to look at there might
be a possibility to do so.
It's such a complicated program.
It really demands a son of authority.
It would take a major overhaul of development authority's
law.
For instance, development authorities don't have grant
powers.
They don't have development authorities.
We would have to open up a lot of things in the development
authority's law to do a pretty major rewrite.
Probably I know how to do it, but it would be a big undertaking
for the development authority's law.
We thought it was clear to go with this approach.
Yeah, I believe Senator Williams, you have a question.
Oh, was it Senator Butler, I'm sorry.
Whoever's, Mike 12.
It's 12.
Thank you, Ms. President.
You are what you mentioned 159 authorities.
Do you have a number as to how many would really create?
It's gonna be much less than that
because there are a lot of cities and counties
It probably will not use this program that we'll actually
activate.
The major cities, we'll use it.
Some of the smaller towns use it for the downtown redevelopment.
It could be used for agricultural purposes,
but I don't anticipate seeing these authorities
created in every city or activated in every city
getting a George.
Leader Butler said, if I'm going to interject,
in 159 counties, I don't want to forget, overlook their 537 cities.
So this automatically creates 537 authorities in each city if they choose and 159 counties.
So I don't want to, don't want to slide our GMA friends out there because, but it does
create the enabling legislation for every city and every county to do this.
And I would add, Mr. Chairman, I did clarify the language if the committee would prefer
and it doesn't seem to change the policy intent on line 157 to modify there is created
in and for each county municipal corporation in the state a public body corporate and political
to modify it and strike there is created in and for.
So to start at each online 157 and move in between and put may create municipal corporation
in this state may create a public body corporate and politic that would clarify that it is up
to that local government to create that authority we're enabling those local governments to
do so.
correct the the possibility is 537 plus 139 and I can't do that math in my head
but the the practicality is we're giving local control on on whether that's
necessary or not I don't know if that doesn't change the policy intent but it
might clarify the language for those looking through the process I like the
I'll hold that thought in just a minute.
I've got a block up, but it takes care of that.
It's a little more than that, but it gets rid of that.
Yeah, I've got a block up.
Since this isn't hearing only, I want to make sure that you understand there's a constitutional
question as to whether or not we can allow for local governments to create these authorities.
And so that'd be one of the things that we'll try to get clarification between this hearing
and the next potential hearing on the bill.
But for me, you know, there's a lot of things that are happening here in this legislation
that, and this is where for me, I just want to make sure that because I do have an
An enormous number of new members to the Senate said that this year I know some of them
have been here and they quite experienced but I know I have something that are brand
new to the Senate.
The importance of what we do in committee and making sure that we're familiar with what
the bill is going to do and whether it moves forward or not.
I don't take lightly and I want to make sure that each of y'all look at this and what's
going on with it.
I believe Senator Mallow, you have a question.
I do.
Thank you, Chairman again, and to the author of the bill, I know you spoke about the constitutionality.
My question is, would this be enabling state statute that could then be followed up?
Should a local government want to do that by a local act?
Would that be the process for that, for this to give the guardrails and for the establishment
have to come back by a local act, local legislation should.
I mean, it's a power they choose to do this
and require the members of that delegation to agree to it.
Would that be something to be considered in this?
That's the reason we have plenty of lawyers
in the building, because I can't answer that question
off the top of my head, but.
I know, Mr. Raleigh.
I'm really good with that assist our committee,
so I'll be a thought for consideration.
There'll be no need for local legislation.
There'll be a local resolution activating the authority,
but all of the guardrails and all the powers
are contained in the general legislation.
In other countries, now the question,
we're traveling under the development authorities clause
of the Georgia Constitution that gives the,
generally, the power to create development authorities.
And I would add, in terms of,
it didn't come up in the House Committee yet,
but I know many of our House members have left
and joined your body,
so that might have been the question that didn't get asked there.
But if that is a more comfortable statue I'm assuming
we can require the provision of local legislation
as an added filter if that is amenable to the committee
or preferred, but it is currently,
as Mr. Taylor mentioned, necessary as the bill is now.
Because this is a hearing,
I'm gonna be a little bit more forthcoming.
Basically, what's happening here is you have areas in the state, excuse me, where people
want to proceed with improvements to their property, they're wanting to do these things
for energy conservation, water conservation, whatever the case, these hardening structure.
And they're asking for a benefit by having some government-sponsored financing to allow
this to take place that improves their community and this is where for me. I don't begrudge the
concept of what's going on but I do want to make sure that everybody understands this is a
potentially very big expansion in what the government role is. So for me this is why I'm asking
my committee members to ask questions and participate in the discussion. Senator Williams,
Do you have a question?
Yes, sir.
I have served on a down-down development authority in the past.
What is different from this, is it the financing, is it the guaranteeing of the money?
Yes.
So what's different?
The program, if you cut through it all, if it were in Georgia, if it were in another
state, a property owner that wanted to make an energy or water savings improvement or
resiliency improvement would come to a local government and say, would you borrow money
above a half to approve a property to put a special assessment of a property to pay that
loan back.
Because the Georgia Court has failed in assessments for taxes, I can't do that in Georgia without
about a referendum every time we do a loan which would be just completely unwieldy, but
with an intergovernmental contract, I can avoid the referendum requirement.
So we need to create a development authority to go out and bar the money to get the
to the developer property owner to improve the property and then the local
government imposes a special assessment. It is in the Intergovernmental
Contract to pay the special assessment to the development authority to pay the
loan. So that is how the program works. We've got the authority legislation was
largely modeled on the resource recovery development authorities law which
was a tighter development authority statute than the general development
authority's law and it took some powers from the downtown development
authority's law like grant powers it added to be in and then I added the
article of assessments the cooperation article is modeled off of the the
cooperation law attached to the housing authorities law that allows these
and counties to provide financial assistance to their to their local housing
authorities. So this this language is all language that it pretty much comes from existing
legislation woven together to fit this program in Georgia. It is an existing development
authorities law would work Atlanta trying to do it with the downtown development authorities
law but it would work very well and the capital providers will use it because development
as far as really work to side for seat base,
at least outside the central business district.
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Taylor,
I said they ask for other questions,
represent sayings you want to continue your,
and I apologize for interrupting,
but this is where, for me,
I won't make sure my committee members,
if they have questions that we're doing that.
I, whatever enables the committee
to get their fact-finding mission in terms of understanding
the policy and the intent.
The only thing, the majority of my presentations
and concluded we do have a capital provider here
that could touch on the benefits of the interest rates
in terms of what, why we would be going through
the hassle of this, but I would add, it is 100,
because it was a big distinction for me
to sponsor the bill, though it is a government structured
and that comes with its own liabilities.
It's 100% private capital being infused,
not tax dollars on any level.
It is a government structure because of course,
there is a first right of refusal through using this.
That's what enables the capital providers
offering such a low rate because they're such a low risk.
And I would add to that in years prior,
when it was introduced, there was some pushback
by the banking association, the coalition
that's behind this policy had done a great job
in working with that sector and they are neutral on the bill.
And primarily, there is a provision for that for any property
that has a mortgage or has a loan with first right.
They would have to approve the use of this financing
prior to that financing being allowable.
So I think that's an important part to remember.
I know my vice chairman of the committee and who I think if the bill sees the light
today, he may be able to inform us a little bit more on some of the things, but if I could,
if I could ask the committee members to look over on page 22, line 533.
five thirty-three on page twenty-two. And you know if you're if you're going to create
authority you got to know what happens when authority goes away and I want you to read
that section right there and I'll ask Mr. Taylor to address it for us. Yes it actually
That comes is the identical language that was added to the development authority's law.
Previously once the authority was created in Georgia, like a development authority,
it just had professional existence.
And some of the cities and counties didn't make the board a point, but they existed,
they've been activated, but they weren't registered with DCA.
And so the development authority's law was amended to give a bit of avenue if they don't
use the authority or just become an active to dissolve it. So as low as the
authority has no discharge obligations either debt or contractual
obligations. This gives the local cities and counties the option to dissolve
the authority so they don't have to fool with the annual registration with
DCA etc. And just so everybody knows this authority it contemplates in here
that you can have employees of your authority and you know all of those calls so when you
start looking at you know there's a lot of moving parts in this bill that I want to
make sure that everybody is familiar with it and reads it and I know the hours getting
late so what I'm going to ask your homework assignment is take a look at this talk to some
of our folks here in the building that are much more familiar with it you know representative
I appreciate you bringing it, I see there's a potential upside to where it is and how it can benefit in some of these developments and people being able to get access to better funding for doing it.
But there's a cost to it, and for me, I don't want to make sure that we're protecting the public and what we would contemplate doing here on this legislation.
As Mr. Chayler said, we've only done these big authority bills three times before.
This will be number four and this will be a, this is a huge step.
So I don't take this job as Chairman Lightland.
I know you don't take it lightly as being a member of the committee.
So thank you much.
Any other final comments?
Representative Singh.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate this committee's time and I more than understand taking the time to
For example, the legislation I agree with you, it's a big step with what I would argue is a big benefit to our communities' tools and moving our communities forward, but I appreciate the time and look forward to the added discussion.
Thank you.
We stand adjourned.
