TRANSCRIPT
----------
I'm State Representative Sandra G. Scott, Server District 76 out of Clayton County.
Today we are here for HOA, COA, and POA Day at the Capitol.
The reason that we have come together is because we have received countless of calls and
emails from constituents across the state of Georgia,
talking about the unfair and unjust treatment
that they are receiving from the HOAs.
Now, I have introduced four bills that
is only calendar for this year that
deals with HOA in a variety of ways.
But the main thing that I am talking about in these bills
is that no one, I mean no one, should lose their home
because of fees and assessments trash our water.
No one should be losing their homes.
We have people that are losing their homes to HOAs
because of fees and assessment.
And we all know that when we bought a house,
the two things that we must pay, and that is our mortgage,
and our property tax, we should not be losing our homes
because of fees and assessment.
And that is what my bills are looking at,
because this is our American dream.
This is the American dream is home ownership.
It is the largest purchase you will make in life.
It's in home ownership, it's your home.
And you should not be losing it
because of taxes, fees, water bill, trash bills.
And now, I'm going to turn it over to Michael Shepherd.
Come on, Michael Shepherd.
Michael Shepherd.
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you all.
My name is Michael Shepard and I started the watch project which means working for accountability,
transparency and control for homeowners and that's something that's been lacking in the state of
Georgia. Everyone behind me has been coming to the Capitol for years. We've been reaching
out to our constituents on the Republican side, on the Democrat side. I'm sure they're tired of
hearing us. I'm tired of having to repeat the same problems that we've had in our community
and I'm just thankful that we've reached this day where Georgia stands on the forefront of the
the nation of potentially passing one of the strongest HOA oversight in the nation and
that makes me proud resident of this state.
Right now we are looking at SB 406, SB 107, SB 120, HB 1222, the whole alphabet.
We have a number of different laws right now which looks at creating an oversight commission
that looks at holding HOA boards accountable with training,
that's something that the state desperately needs and it's been lacking.
And I just want to state too that we have a numerous issues with,
we have numerous issues with HOA's committing payment allocation fraud,
taking people's check, returning it to them and forcing them into foreclosure.
It's absolutely criminal and it needs to be stopped.
We have HOA boards refusing to hold elections, refusing to hold meetings.
That's why I got in this fight.
I have a property at Peyton Place and the HOA refuse to have a meeting,
refuse to hand over insurance paperwork, refuse to close on homes
because the HOA board wanted those homes for themselves.
I decided to fight my lawsuit costs $40,000.
I'm still not done paying for that.
No resident in Georgia should have to pay $40,000 to have an election to get what's
owed to them.
That's not the American dream.
It's the American nightmare.
And I'm proud that all of these people are behind me right now.
And there's many people who unfortunately had to work who couldn't be here.
For those people, I'm glad I could show up today and say, we want change and it's on
the cusp.
And I demand legislators past that change to make Georgia the strongest state on H.O.A.
corruption, H.O.A. front, and H.O.A. abuse.
Good morning, I'm Representative Viola Davis and I serve House District 87 in Stone Mountain,
the Great County of the Cal. I'm standing here to explain to you why we had to have an
HOA, COA, POA, day at the Capitol.
Ask yourself if your constituent came to you and asked you,
what should they do?
They were laid on their assessment.
And somebody came and told away their car in punishment.
Should an HOA have the right to take a home on his car
because they're late on paying their assessment.
The average person would say, no.
Oh.
What would you say to a constituent
who's an elderly woman, have paid her assessment
everything on time and so much so that she gave you
two years of bank statements to prove it?
Yet she was still charged, lay fees,
she was still sent had to go to court over 20 times to keep her property. Should that elderly woman
lose her home? No. What about a disabled veteran who finally reached a time that he can retire?
And he's going to retire right here in Georgia only to have his home burned down and the insurance
money which was over 1.5 million was taken by the board and put into their personal account.
Should that homeowner lose their property?
These are some of the nightmares that we have been bombarded with.
And we are telling the people that we have to work together to protect and promote the
American dream of home ownership.
We have to remember that this is a massive, massive problem.
And the misery alone is producing a lot of money for those who do not want to operate
within the law. Let us move forward with representative
Scofield. Good morning. I'm State Representative Kim
Scofield representing District 63, Fulton County. Listen,
this is not just a political issue. This is a people issue.
And for over eight years, we've been fighting and standing to
that acts and demand that people pay attention to the people that are behind us, that want
the right to not lose their house because of lack of oversight and accountability.
We are speaking to the members of this body and this general assembly.
Don't just give the people fluff.
Let's get some real legislation that's going to protect homeowners that's going to protect
these egregious actions.
Listen.
know that there are some of the HOA, COA and POAs that think they're doing great jobs
and some of them are.
This message is for us to strengthen everything that make it right for the people of Georgia.
This is not an urban issue, this is not a suburban issue or a rural issue.
This is a people issue that needs to be addressed in this house now.
We are the people, and we demand action from this legislative body on not just putting
measures in place, but making real change.
So the people that have traveled to the people's house get some resolve, accountability, and
oversight.
Now we're here from State Representative, State Senator, Donzella James, State Senator.
I'm going to try to get up anyway, hey, I got you, okay, thank you, okay, you did look
You're going to get some of that more brown sugar, aren't you?
How did you get your hands raised?
I like it.
You look like a little boy anyway.
Sorry.
Good morning.
Good morning.
And it is a good morning because we have come together to solve our own horrible problems that are right here in the state of Georgia.
Not just in metropolitan Atlanta, but all 159 counties.
We have heard from everyone.
We've had five hearings that were official.
We had other hearings that we just all came together
on the House and Senate side.
I'm sending to Jones, all the James representing District 28,
but I'm the chair of the Urban Affairs Committee for the Senate.
Thank goodness on that committee,
we've been able to address the problem
of predatory HRAs, not all HRAs.
But we found out that there are
no stipulations, no rules about it.
They can do whatever they want to do
and write their covenant.
So what are they doing? They have no integrity with many of them. They don't follow their own rules and
bylaws and consequently people are losing their homes. They can sell your home on the courthouse steps
without even telling you we're going to do it. If you know that you have at least $2,000 worth of
leads and finds they can do that. And when I stand don't pay your H.O.A. dues in fact about
85% of the people who have problems the dues have nothing to do with it. It's other things like
the grass is not it's more than six inches tall. And then if you don't fix it within a week
then they can add a hundred dollars a day and they're doing this. So people have
worked so hard to buy their homes and to take care of their families and now
they have this horrible H.O.A.s that are stealing their homes right from
under them. So today I'm proud to speak about three of the bills that we have
have already introduced. Someone asked me why you have so many bills. Well we have so
many problems with HOA. We don't have any HOA reform. Most of the people who gave me suggestions
they wanted us to abolish HOA completely in Georgia because they have so many problems.
of course there are good HOAs, there are some who follow the rules.
So we are working today on many bills and the House members have mentioned there's already
but the House and Senators together on this.
We have to work together to solve this problem because it's not a state representative or
Senator or a Republican, a Democrat, a Black or White.
This is happening to everybody, all of us.
So I have good news that one bill finally is moving.
And last year I was able to pass the bill for a study
committee, and they put that study committee
in Senator Brass's hands.
And he saw all the people from his cow weta county
and other places having some serious problem,
even worse than some of the ones that we've been talking about.
So he was the chair, and he made me his co-chair.
We came up with many bills, but House City Bill 406
is the one that he authored.
And we call it the Georgia Property Owners Bill of Rights.
And it creates a state board for review of complaints regarding property owners' association
under the Secretary of State's office.
It will be in the nonprofit office.
Also, we've gotten clear on doing that if this bill passes.
It requires all POAs to register with the Secretary of State.
It gives the Secretary of State the power to suspend,
revoke, modify, limit all POAs and POA orders
fines assigned to the Senate.
Also, it covers all the COAs, kind of minions,
and all of the HLAs.
So we will finally, yes.
We will finally be able to, once this is passed,
you have fines against you and you already have problems,
but if you don't take care of that fine,
then they will multiply.
And also, they have the power not to even take any more
of your HOA fees.
So then that's another disaster,
because you're getting more and more,
you're climbing up the fence for a foreclosure
on your property, on your dream house.
This is not acceptable in the state of Georgia.
We are going to pass these bills I hope this year.
If not, we need to appeal to not only the governor
and the attorney general, we need to go all the way up
to DC and have them come down here and do something.
So this is just an answer from the five HOAs that we've had and the hard work of a lot
of the legislators in the House and the Senate.
So hopefully we will pass it.
I'm claiming the victory.
How about you?
Okay, are there any questions?
Yes.
So you mentioned Jeremy's press.
Yeah.
Why isn't that mean you mentioned this?
You may have heard of one.
But in general, I have some legislation.
a lot of people don't understand what is going on. They don't realize that when
you they say well they sign the contract. You sit down to buy your home then you
get this thing you have to sign for the HOA. You know many people don't even
know what they're signing and they want to know why am I paying extra money.
They're sitting in the closing right then. It's not anything you they told
them before that so a lot of people don't really understand and some of the
legislators say that their people are calling them saying don't pass this
because it's gonna hurt the landlord. Landlord, we have corporate investors who
are coming down and buying these houses and they are already in with the
management companies and it's only about three management companies that really
own all these other and over these HOAs. They might have another name but
there's a subsidiary of that one so that that's the main reason but I hope now
many of the people on the other side have started listening and coming to me
and saying tell me more about it so I'm we're trying to educate and
and motivate them to please look at this legislation.
We have so many people here today,
but we have rallied this morning.
Would even more people have to go to work.
So we are here.
We are coming together,
and we are gonna pass this legislation.
Any other questions?
This is a special win.
And HWA can start for closure from Monday,
mine from $10,000 to $4,000.
It's been some pushback and making that change
even if it's saved $4,000.
That was different after all.
Well, yes, this question was,
there have been suggestions of moving the $2,000 worth
of fines where you can, your house can be
full closed on to $4,000, but whether it's $2,000, $4,000
100,000. It doesn't matter. We need to not use that as as a reason to foreclose.
You want to say something?
That's what it takes to get the bill passed, to be able to do this year.
You know, we do need to chip away by doing some of these bills and passing them, but we can't,
I'm unbought and unbought and it's no way that I can say oh yeah let me just get
this part we need something strong and I'm so proud the senator who is the
chairperson of rules has this bill that is strong he has teeth in it already
of course a lot of them could be a lot stronger but maybe anything is going to
stop the foreclosures.
Any other questions?
Let me say that Senate Bill 406, adding the $4,000 threshold,
I would say that it is not bill efficient to the people.
If they couldn't pay the $2,000, they
can't pay the $4,000.
And we should not be charging any fines or fees that
will take a person home away from them.
Because that is the bottom line.
People are losing their homes through HOA,
COA is a POA because of fines and assessment.
And they have to write the charge you what they want to charge you.
And people don't really have to write the fight them
unless they go to court.
So I say that the bill need to be amended
because we should not have any type of threshold
and of fee, where a person can still lose their home.
Are there any other questions?
Yes, okay, yes sir.
We don't have the minds in there,
so we like to very clean our property
and then say, what do you clean it up?
Because they never come and do it.
We have like a fire used and we have to find it.
And we will work with you that, the bills that we have.
Do you see the fence?
Yes.
They never advance this in 1971, when they knew that.
They never paid that, they knew this.
It's many, it's many COAs and HOAs that promise the world.
But they never give you that bike trail or that not even
clean up.
It goes to them.
And that's what we're trying to do now.
Put some procedures in place.
So this won't happen.
I would love to talk to you right after this, okay?
Any other questions?
Okay, thank you all for coming.
