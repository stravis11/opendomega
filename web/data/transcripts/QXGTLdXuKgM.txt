It's a privilege I know only have three to five minutes and so for Baptist pastor that is a lot to a lot of pressure on me So today if you have your bibles or you can pull them up We're gonna look at Psalms 127 and talking about a life of a lasting legacy over the past six months. I had the I guess opportunity to Efficient both my father and my brothers funeral and during that time I have just been reminded of the importance of living a life that actually makes a impact in this world And so for you as senators in the great state of Georgia It's a great opportunity for you to represent the communities that you're from and I pray that during this Devotion today God would remind you of how your life can have a lasting legacy and Psalms 127 this is Solomon speaking here. He says unless the Lord builds the house those who build labor in vain and Unless the Lord watches over the city the watchman stay awake in vain It is in vain that you rise early and you go to bed late Eating the bread of anxious toil for you have given are he has given to you the beloved sleep The first thing that I want to encourage you with with a life of legacy is this you have to know the Lord You have to have a personal relationship with him again. He says unless the Lord builds the house We build it in labor and vain the second is this that it is daily dependency on his guidance as As I saw my son a lamp into our feet light into our path is what the word is supposed to be But he says again unless the Lord watches over the city the watchman stay awake in vain Verse two when it talks about in vain We rise early and go to the rest late and eat the bread of anxious toil There's been countless times my life has been spent on things that are lesser and has left me with anxiety Fear and stress But when we trust the Lord and partner with him we have his provision and we have his grace The last is this We have to find pleasure and his purpose is being fulfilled I love the part and verse three where he says for he gives his beloved in this word beloved here means Child loved by God for all of us that have a relationship with the Lord through Jesus We are his children and we're loved by God today as you are here I pray that you are building a lasting legacy that when your loved ones are at your funeral that they're able to say That this person had more than just an impact they had a kingdom impact the only way that's accomplished is through Knowing God and having a relationship with him Daily counting on his dependency to accomplish his tasks through your life and third Finding pleasure and his purpose is being fulfilled in and through you. Let's pray Father today we give you praise because you are the one that is worthy of it And God I thank you for the men and women that are represented here in this room today The communities that they represent all around our great state Lord I pray that Lord you've called them to this purpose in this task and I pray today that they would trust you That they would know you and Father they would follow you God I pray blessing over their lives.

Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. Glad it's Friday. I want to introduce to you today a couple folks from my hometown in Gainesville, Georgia and Hall County. I've got Dr. Catherine West with me this morning and Dr. West received her Bachelor of Arts and Neuroscience from Dartmouth College. She then completed a Master's in Science at Georgetown University before attending Emory School of Medicine, where she graduated Summa Cum Laude. She completed her emergency medicine residency at Carolina's Medical Center, serving as Chief Resident in her final year after residency. She joined the faculty at Carolina's Medical Center for three years before moving back to Georgia in 2019. There, she serves as the Associate Program Director for Emergency Medicine, the residency program at Northeast Georgia Medical. Dr. West enjoys taking care of members of her community and feels honored to be able to serve a diverse patient population every day. She believes that prioritizing education further advances the quality and availability of care in our community and is excited to help establish a new emergency medicine residency program. Her academic interests include education, simulation and ultrasound in her free time, Dr. West enjoys spending time outdoors with her family. Also, we have Nekelle Patel. He's a proof of concept here today. He's in the residency program there at, he's a second year resident at the program there at Northeast Georgia Medical Center. And I served on an advisory council there at the hospital for about four years and the program there is just amazing. So we really do appreciate everything that they're doing for our community. He hails from Columbus, Georgia. He went to med school in Maltry and came back to Gainesville just a couple years ago to do his residency. So welcome, Nekelle Patel and Ms. Catherine West, please. Hi everybody, like you just said, I'm Nekelle Patel, one of the second year residents over at Northeast Georgia Medical Center in the Emergency Medicine program. I just wanted to say thank you all very much. I know that you guys have been working very hard on funding for residency programs within Georgia. And I'd like to say that I'm kind of proof of concept that someone who has born and raised in Georgia can kind of get this medical education thanks to you guys and hopefully come back and kind of serve with you. So thanks. Thank you. Thank you.

We have special guests here, Rick Celebrating the young lady who's served here in this Capitol Building for over 25 years and Senator from the 19th is rightfully a show and illustrate what a great work she's done for us here at the Capitol and and all the many legislators that she served as administrative assistant for. Secretary Reed the caption please. Senate Resolution 281 by Senator Tillery of the 19th Strickland of the 42nd Hatchet of the 50th Hodges of the 3rd and Eccles of the 49th. A resolution recognizing and commending Talmad's James on the occasion of her retirement and further purposes. And whereas for the past 25 years she is diligently and conscientiously devoted countless hours of her time, talents and energy toward the betterment of the daily operations of the Georgia General Assembly. And whereas Talmad's James began her career with the House of Representatives in April of 1999, after previously serving as a session assistant in 1998. And whereas she faithfully assisted both the House and Senate members during her service in the Governor's Florida leaders office and she currently serves in the House Majority leaders office. And whereas she has been united in love and marriage to her husband, Leroy for more than 25 years and is the loving mother and grandmother of her two remarkable children, two wonderful step children and five outstanding grandchildren. And whereas Talmad's James will be sorely missed upon the occasion of her retirement on March 1, 2025. Now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize and commend Talmad's James for her two and a half decades of service to the citizens of the state of Georgia to congratulate her upon the grand occasion of her retirement and extent since she her best wishes for her continued help and happiness. Mr. President that completes the order. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution? Chair here is none and the resolution is adopted. Recognize the senator from the 19th to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you members of the Senate. Mr. Talmad's James has worked for our body in the Governor's Florida leaders office for 25 years and the members that you see standing behind me here are the members that have had the privilege and pleasure of working with Ms. Talmad's. While she was assigned to the House, she helped the Senate members just the same, helped us with constituent issues, other matters that come as you work with a floor leader. Office so all of us wanted to stand up here today and honor her on the day of her retirement. Ms. Talmad's is a heck of an athlete. She used to run around the Capitol and then run marathons and everything else afterwards. But her help in these years is requiring her to retire today actually. It's her last day. Up here on the podium with us, we also have her husband, Mr. Lee Roy. They've been married for 30 years. Is that right? 30 years. And two of her children, Onyx and Ebony and their friends who are up here too. And we just wanted to say Ms. Talmad's, it has been a pleasure. We are sorry that you have to leave us. We understand it's a hard decision for you. But we are better because you are here and thank you so much for everything you've given us and given this state. All I can say is thank you all very much. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve these 25 years. I've enjoyed working with the senators and House members and it's been my best honor to serve all these years. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We usually don't do special presentations on Friday but circumstances change those for the weekend. It's always an honor to stand up to celebrate the extraordinary legacy of a man who has been a friend, a mentor and an inspiration to me and so many others, ambassador, Andrew Young. But there's no better time than on this last day a Black History Month 2025 to recognize him. Ambassador Young has guided my journey in ways that words can hardly capture. His wisdom, unwavering faith, and deep commitment to justice have shaped not only my path, but also the path of countless leaders and change makers across generations. He has shown us how to lead with courage, how to serve with humility, and how to stand firm in the fight for equity and dignity for all people. And if that's not enough, he is a man of great wit. And even at age 92, he'll be 93 next month. He possesses a better memory than most of us in this room. So thank you, Ambassador Young, for your friendship, your mentorship, and unyielding commitment to making this world a better place for us all. May his legacy continue to inspire future generations to continue moving forward. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. And I have the great honor of sharing a little bit about a man who really doesn't need any introduction to anyone in this body or across this great state. Senator Andrew Young is a man whose life is deserving of our recognition today. So I am proud and honored to sponsor Andrew Young Day today. I just want to share with you a few historical facts about Ambassador Andrew Young, who I consider my mentor and my friend. He was born in 1932 in New Orleans. Though we claim him in Georgia as our own. His parents taught him the importance of giving back to the community a lesson he would carry throughout his remarkable journey. He pursued his education diligently earned a bachelor's of science from biology in biology from Howard University in 1951 and at a divinity degree from Hartford Theological Seminary in 1955. Ambassador Young wanted to be with us here today, but you got to understand at his young age as I always say he was unable to be here today, but I said Ambassador, we're going to recognize you anyway. You see Ambassador Young was a key aid to Martin Luther King, Jr. He became a strategist in pivoted protests, including the Birmingham campaign in the Marchion, Washington in 1963. He had draft a civil rights act of 1964 and even devoting rights act of 1965. Cornerstones of America and equality. From 1964 to 1968 he was a ZECD director at SCLC following Dr. King's assassination. Ambassador Young called, recalled that he gave purpose and substance to his life by serving none of the tutelage of Dr. King. His commitment to global progress led Jimmy Carter to a print him as a U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in 1977 and that's when our lives crossed paths. In his road he championed human rights and economic advancement in developing countries shaping U.S. foreign policy. You see Ambassador Young was in Don because he returned to the red clay of Georgia that he loved so very much. Here he served as the mayor of Atlanta for two terms from 1981 to 1990. His leadership brought in over 1100 businesses over $70 billion in foreign direct investments and generated over a million jobs beyond politics and Ambassador Andrew Young's dedication to service continued to shine even till this day. In 1994 President Bill Clinton perned him to oversee the $100 billion Southern Africa development fund. He co-founded good works in a national consulting group that promotes initiatives to improve conditions in Africa and in the Caribbean. Ambassador Young is just one of those kind of individuals that God sent to us once in a generation. And I am very thankful to have had the honor to know him along with my colleagues that stand with us today. You see it is his shoulders that we stand on in this great state of Georgia not just in Georgia but across these United States. And Mr. President is okay. Please share with us this 92nd tribute that we put together and thank you Megan for this 92nd tribute to our friend, my mentor. First black U.S. Congressman from the state of Georgia, mayor and even ambassador to the United States and Andrew Young. Thank you. And then it is easy for you to be a piece with your brother. And I have been learning to make peace with my enemy. And that was the year I went to college. It was also the year of Martin Luther King wanted to go. So since we were about 15, we have all been working and dreaming about how to bring peace on earth and goodwill to all men and women and children. But except it has been one way or the other that has been my life's work. Thank you. We love you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any unanimous concerns? Does any senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? Recognize the senator from the seventh point of personal privilege? Thank you, Mr. President. You might send it to fellow senators. You might notice you might have a goodie bag on your desk with some snacks. I would like to say a small like, um, which means peace to be upon you. Muslims all over the world recognize one another with this greeting. I am certainly grateful to share my culture with this body, with the Muslim and non-Muslims among us. I rise today to recognize that the holiest month of the year in this Islamic calendar begins tonight. Ramadan commemorates the revelation of the Holy Quran, which is the Muslims holy book. We fast each day from sun up to sundown with no food or water to deepen a spiritual connection with God. And we are encouraged to practice patience, cultivate compassion, and develop discipline. Many Muslims spend long nights at the mosque, breaking the fast with one another, praying long hours into the night. Muslims observe special night prayers during the month of Ramadan, spending lots of time at their local mosque. Usually people break their fast by eating a date in the tradition of Prophet Muhammad. The month ends with a major holiday called Ith al-Fatar. Ith is one of the two holidays in the Islamic year. And Muslims take the day off work or school to spend time with family and celebrate the end of Ramadan, which I will get to do with all of you. There are gift bags on your desk courtesy of the Georgia chapter of the council on American Islamic relations. And these bags contain snacks and a little page explaining the importance of Ramadan as some of the basics of Islam. I encourage you to read it. I hope the Senate can take this as an opportunity to learn more about Islam and Muslims as the second largest religion in Georgia after Christianity. Muslims are all over the state of Georgia and I encourage you to get in touch with the mosques in your district. Happy Ramadan. Thank you, and I yield below. We're going to have a Sunday from the 56th. Thank you, Mr. President. Today we're going to have the great honor to recognize and honor the incredible men and women who serve in emergency medical services. These dedicated professionals, our EMTs and paramedics, are critical first responders that work tirelessly and often in some of the most challenging conditions to provide life saving care when every second counts. I'm pleased up in the gallery today. We have several of those here, including Mr. Chad Black, who's a chairman of our Georgia EMS. Would all of those involved the EMS please rise so we can recognize you this morning? Thank you. A unanimous resolution was passed in their honor, their courage, skill, and unwavering commitment made a profound difference in each one of our districts. Whether responding to accidents, medical emergencies, or natural disasters, they are always ready day and night to serve those in need. On this EMS day, we extend our deepest gratitude to those everyday heroes. Their service reminds us the importance of preparedness, teamwork, compassion, and saving lives. What is not only so much about their dedication today, but continue to support and advocate for the resources they need and each one of our communities to complete their vital work. To all EMS professionals throughout our state, thank you for your service and your sacrifice and may God bless you. And specifically, we had some of our critical first responders in Cobb County, who were six of us in this Georgia Senate represent, respond to a house fire last night. And it was through the EMS and firefighters there that they were to help several people, although we lost one life. A couple of our firefighters were injured, but I'm thankful to report that they have minor injuries and will be okay. Another real-time example that happens each and every day where our EMS services are out there saving people's lives. Thank you and may God bless you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I believe there are some notth grade students here from Flint River Academy if they would stand. Flint River Academy is a private school in Maryweather County and another opportunity for parents to take control of their children's education. We appreciate all they do there for our students in District 29 and all they do to create good strong men and women to serve here in the state of Georgia as citizens and leaders. Please help me in welcoming and thanking the Flint River Academy of Maryweather County. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Thank you. They have some good athletes over at Flint River Academy. Glad to have. I recognize Senator from the 30th. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for that segue because we got some more outstanding athletes. I would like to recognize some outstanding athletes who are with us today in the gallery. I'm honored to have the Class A State Championship Team or competitive cheerleading team from Bremen High School joining us this morning. The Blue Doubles are led by the dedicated coaches Jessica Patterson and Taylor Griffin. If I could have the team stand, are they in the gallery with us? If y'all would, please give these young ladies and state champions a warm welcome from the Senate. Thank you all so much for being here and congratulations to your state title. We appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you. I recognize Senator from the 33rd. Thank you, Mr. President, my fellow Senators, colleagues, friends, and y'all. The Senator from the 6th and I are a coach here at the Taiwanese Caucus. And this Monday we will have, we will be serving lunch to anybody who wants to come down and join us and also meet the Council General from Taiwan. So don't forget, I'll remind you again next Monday, bring your appetite with you. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Senator from the 17th. I understand today, or actually tomorrow is a very special day for you tomorrow. Senator, she birthed day tomorrow. That's what I said. Everybody give the Senator from the 17th a big happy birthday round of applause. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I rise today to simply say that it is Georgia Caregivers Day today at the Capitol. We want to make sure that we let the caregivers know how important they are. They take care of their loved ones or take care of the persons that they need to all the time. And it's a real sacrifice, but they do it with love. You know, if you're a caregiver, you have to cut back on a lot of activities. You have to cut back on boards. You have to say, I really can't do it at this time. And you want to spend all that time with your family or with the person that you are giving care. And then once they pass, you say, I would do it all over again if I had to. So today, we want the citizens of Georgia to know that this is your day and you are the caregiver. And the Georgia State Senate are compassionate enough to say that we appreciate you. And we value you. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the will. Does any other Senate wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? We're going to have a sit in front of the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. Dear colleagues, today we have some Indian community that last day of that black history month, organizing a lunch today at the Building Bridges Community, connecting communities. You can be at the Capitol from 12 at this day at the Maze Room 1, I guess. Maze Room 1, please join us for the lunch. Thank you. Apply some Indian good food, I guess. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm happy to just let it go. I don't have it. Is it good? No, I don't have it. I think it's yours. I don't know. I got it. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise today on this point of personal privilege to address a couple of matters. Number one, today is February 28th, not only do we celebrate Dr. Reverend Dr. Andrew Young, it is his day, but this is a day that we recognize the power of a prayer.

a prayer that is a different type of prayer that I'm asking you to pray with me, those that are in support of a United States of America, one nation indivisible, indivisible with justice, not just for the rich and the powerful and the privileged and the billionaires in all the graphs but for all. This was the pleasure of allegiance that we had a moment ago. Today is February 28th. It will go down as a day where it makes no difference in certain quarters, but today I'm asking those of you who support diversity, equity and inclusion because we were included in the United States of America, not the divided states of America. And we come today asking you to view where you spend dollars as a sort of prayer. Today, if you believe in diversity, equity and inclusion, I'm asking you not to spend one dime or not one dollar today. And I know that's going to be hard for some people, but not one dime or not one dollar. Why because our nation is under attack, it's misguided and in Georgia. It's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstrapped, but it's cruel just to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps. More than 80,000 Georgians have their livelihood stripped away. Yes, they are threatened because we have more than 80,000 federal workers in Georgia. We have CDC workers. We have FAA workers. People that are being threatened, 80,000 people and they are an executive order saying, four people will lose their job and we will keep one. Four people will keep their job and we will keep one. This will cause a recession. This will call economic up evil. This will call frantic. People will not be able to pay their mortgages. People will not be able to pay their, just to take care of their kids, take care of their kids, take care of their kids, to go and make a livelihood for themselves. It will precipitate an economic chaos in our community and I'm asking you guys to stand up and stand up because unless someone stands up and allows injustice to proceed, it is a threat to justice everywhere. Thank you. I will voice again February 28th as a day to put a steering wheel on your dollars because your dollar is a type of prayer, a request for what you want and we want justice, equity, one nation, indivisible with justice for all, I yield the will. Senator from the ninth. I think this is our last one. Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of things I want to mention today. I want to recognize the coalition of Hindus of North America. They are visiting us today and they are here to help us celebrate Black History Month as we close and they are hosting their annual Building Bridges Connecting Communities event here at the Capitol. They are in Mez 1 today. They do have lunch. It's 12 o'clock so please stop by and go and greet our friends of the Kohana Hindus of North America. Go by and say hello. And finally I just want to say as we close on this celebration of Black History we are reminded that our history is more than a reflection of a path of the past. It's a call to action. It's a call to action for the future and where we want to be. And let's use the legacy of Black Trail Blazers who fought for justice and equity and opportunity. And let's do the work so we can continue what they put down for us and the work that they've done for all of us. So just think about that as we close out on our last day of Black History and with that Mr. President I yield the well. Thank you Senator. All right. Senator for the 19th.

Senator is passionate about what she speaks. And isn't it true therefore that that sort of. Exposes the normal rationale and those that are interested in perfecting legislation and having a robust legislative debate in this body should all vote against this motion. Senator you still will be able to debate the bill but you're you're dealing noted. All the passes of motion motion the a's are 31 the nays are 22 and the motion has prevailed.

Mr. President Senate committee on judiciary offers to follow substitute to send bill 88 a bill to be in time of the night to amend code section 15-6-2. The official go to Georgia annotated only to the number of judges of the spirit court. So that's a baried for a fourth judge of the spirit courts of the judicial and the Douglas judicial circuit. And for other purposes that can be seen on our Mr. President. I recognize the senator from the 30th. In this year first bill senator. Have you really? I think he's one of those house members that this thinks that seniority passes over here. Is that right? I would say some of the greatest bills that came through this body had my name on it in the past. I think I think this first time in the well. Guys. It was not but thank you Mr. President. I wrote your name down so I didn't miss it this time. I'm bringing forward Senate bill 88 for your consideration. It just adds a fourth spirit court judge to the Douglas County Judicial Circuit. The circuit is ranked number two for a judge and it's in the budget. I appreciate your favorable consideration on this bill and I would yield the well. Y'all will take me in the past why? I got distracted. Hold on now senator. Hold on. You do have a couple questions now senator. I mean I know you spent 11 years over in the house and you think you have this master didn't everything but you know. Do not have it master. I was trying to. I'll send it from 31st. Thank you Mr. President. Well the great well almost great senator from West Georgia yield. To my friend from West Georgia I will. I 20. Have you figured out senator the distinguish between the speaker and the president of the senate? Well to make sure I did I did write it down Mr. President not Mr. Speaker. So to make sure I did not make a mistake I did write it down. Do you know who's more powerful in this building? Is it the speaker or the president of the senate? By far is the president of this senate. Thank you great answer. The upper chamber. Thank you. I yield the well. Thank you for your effort. The senator has yielded. The senator has yielded. I tell you what. Senator from the six for what purpose do you rise? You want to speak to the bill? All right. Well come on Senator. Thank you Mr. President. President it's a little annoying when we got a house member come over here and yield the well without questions and I take offense to that. And I thought I'd come down here and point that out because I remember his campaign when he was running for senate and here he is this conservative guy small government guy and he brings us his first bill and what does it do? He grows government. He's growing government with his very first bill and then won't take questions on it and I'm offended. I yield the well. All right. Senator has yielded. Senator from the 27th your light song you wave. I know there was a lot of people had their lights on but they didn't get an opportunity to ask a question. Greg and I are senator from the 40th second right? Mr. President I move that SB 88 be recommitted to rules. I you know would you like to come wait would you like to would you like to come speak to your motion would you like to try to defend it? I would. You would where we go senator I think you might have heard no I know I'm senator the well the well this is not the house. My goodness. I will not be denied or allow you the ability not to attack me so let's go with it. I thought the senator from from the 6th asked me out of the well so I was abiding by my real chairman who I admire very much and appreciate so anyway let's go. You do you do have a couple questions senator from the 42nd you'd like to ask him a question. Does the senator yield for my good friend yes I yield. Senator of course everybody will see this now isn't it true that in committee we had to do a substitute on your bill to correct some dates. That is correct. Do you further yield? I do. Isn't it true that the dates were actually all set back for an additional six months mean that your home is this your home circuit it is your home circuit will have to wait another six months to get the new judge is that correct. That is correct. You further yield how did it? Isn't it true that all these dates got pushed back because while you used to have really good house politics your senate politics weren't so great. I will agree with that and I appreciate the chairman of the 19th and his wise wisdom and helping me on this bill to make sure I had the dates properly for the budget which he did an amazing job on for the budget for this body. Do you offer one more question? 100% I hate to do this but isn't it true that because of you and the fact that you represent this judicial circuit the citizens of this county will have to wait six more months to have additional justice for their court system. That's a good response I don't know if I can respond to that but thank you Mr. Chairman. Break it out as the center from the 19th. Thank you Mr. President Senator you yield. I yield to my friend. I have a couple of questions too also relating to dates. You're starting this circuit it appears for this new judgeship on July 1 of 2026. Is that correct? That is correct. Senator will you further yield? I will. Are you aware that if you were to delay that potentially by one well based on the current years who would name that appointment? One more time if I did. Based on your current bill and starting it January 1 20 of 26 who would name that appointee? First of all who would name it appointee I would I'm going to go with the governor but I could be wrong just by the way yes that question. Senator will you further yield? I will. Are you aware that there's another election at the end of 2026? Yes. Senator do you think that it might be wise to delay this bill one more year to perhaps allow someone else whom your friends with and working on your politics in the senate with to maybe make that appointment? That's a very good point but again I took the wise wisdom from the committee and my friends from the appropriations committee on how to properly have this bill drafted. Final question, Senator. Senator if I were to do an amendment that were to change the appointed date of this by one year for the reasons we've already discussed would you consider that amendment friendly? I would consider every amendment that you make friendly to my legislation, Senator. Thank you. I yield. Thank you. At this time I would ask for your federal consideration? We got one more question. Okay. Senator from the 8. Senator to you. To my good friend I yield. Senator isn't it true that you had your initial training in the legislature in the house? That is correct. So Senator before we vote on this bill in front of all our colleagues here do you now consider yourself fully rehabilitated? One hurt percent. Thank you so much. As you're federal consideration on the bill and I will yield the well. All right Senator. All right Senator. Are you going to withdraw your motion Senator from the point? Okay. All right good. He withdraws. All right. Any other Senator wish speak for against this measure? Hearing none. Is there objection to adoption of the committee substitute? Hearing none the committee substitute is adopted? Is there objection to agree to the committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The board's committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none and the main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of growing government bigger than it are he is and Carol County will vote yay all pose and a section and a lot of the machine. Recognize senator from six what purpose do you rise? Parliament are inquiring. Say you're inquiring. Mr. President is it not true that this bill does not affect Carol County? It's a different circuit. I believe the senator I believe the senator knows what he speaks. Greg and I are senator from 33rd of what purpose do you rise? Thank you Mr. President. Is it true that representatives from Cal County are like diapers? It must be changed often for the same reason. Wow. I don't know that's for each and every senator to decide. The bill is agreed to. On the passes of the bill the a's are 48. The a's are six. This bill has received the constitutional majority. Therefore passed by substitute. Moving on on the Senate bill 145 secretary. Senate bill 145 by senator Burns of the 23rd and others. Bill to be entitled to amend code section 15-6-2. The official code of Georgia and it related to the number of judges. The spear records has to provide for a six judge of the spear records of the Augustan judicial circuit to provide for the appointment of such additional judge by the governor to declare inherent authority to provide for a later matter to provide for effective days to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President and the committee on judiciary recommends this bill to pass or suspect which minutes are strictly in chairman. That can be the order Mr. President. We're going to ask senator from 23rd. Mr. President. Thank you Mr. President. Colleagues I bring you another good government bill. This is to add a six judge to the Augusta circuit which includes two of my counties Richmond and Burke. And I want you to know that my friend from the 30th did a great job and I need no hazing. So I would respectfully request your support for Senate Bill 145 and I yield. Senator. Thank you Mr. President. Does any other senator wish to speak for against a measure? Chair here is none. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered?

And further into the work of the code revision commission to repeal portions of said code or acts in amendment thereof which have become obsolete or have been declared to be unconstitutional. I've been preempted or superseded by subsequent laws to kind of high principles of law drive from decisions of the state Supreme Court to provide for other matters relating to revision, reenactments and publication of said code to provide for effect an event of conflicts to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President Senate committee on judiciary recommends that this bill do pass respectfully submitted Senator Strickland chairman that can be seen order Mr. President. We're going to as the senator from the 50th. Thank you Mr. President. I rise today to bring you Senate bill 153. This is the annual cleanup bill for the official code of Georgia. There's a committee that meets in between sessions that goes through and looks for typos, errors, any emissions throughout the code. And we pass this every year. Happy to answer any questions if anyone has any but if not, I ask for your favorable consideration. You do have a couple questions, Senator. Oh boy, we're going to have a Senate from the 14th. Thank you Mr. President, as a senator yield. I do. Senator, this bill seems to go into every title of the Georgia code to make some changes. That correct? That is correct. And typically when we are asking whether something's germane in this body we look to see whether it shows up in the same title correct? That's correct. Senator would you agree with me that a bill like this because it opens every single title is germane to every possible amendment? You have a great point. I think that's why we don't like to wait to the last minute to pass this one because this could turn into a big Christmas tree on Sunny Day. Has that ever happened before to your knowledge center? Not to my knowledge. Every time I carry this we try to get it out early. Taking notes for next year's senator. Thank you. Thank you. Bring it on Senator from the 29th. Thank you Mr. President. Senator, yield. I do. Senator, is it not true that you all were so thorough into this legislation that on page 54 of this legislation you went through and took out antiquated identifiers for those who work for shares by changing Sheriff Deputy to Deputy Sheriff? To my friend from the 29th, yes we have replaced Sheriff Deputy with Deputy Sheriff and that was this is in full support of the Georgia Sheriff Association and my good friend who's former law enforcement. I think this is the proper way to refer to Deputy Sheriff's. We appreciate your third assembly.

You spend a lot of time working on this legislation and I appreciate your time. Thank you. Yeah, no more questions. Thank you, Mr. President. I yielded. Well, does any senator which speak for against the measure? Chairs none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair has none of the previous questions ordered.

Secretary Lottman-Shing. On the passes of the bill, the yeas are 51 and the nays are 1 to bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Senate bill secretary Senate bill 152. Senate bill 152 by Senator Dole is all the 27th and others will be entitled to men article two of chapter two B of title 20 of the official heard of George annotated. The Georgia promise scholarship act says to provide that the biological adopted children of individuals who are foster parents and to meet certain conditions shall qualify for promise scholarship accounts. If they provide for such conditions, provide for definitions, provide for related matters to provide for effective date for repeal conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President Senate committee in education and youth recommended this bill to pass by substitute which likely submitted Senate payment for our district vice chairman. Mr. President Senate committee on education and youth offers to following substitute to Senate bill 152. Billed to be entitled to men chapter two B of title 20 of the official heard of George annotated will to promise scholarship accounts. so to provide that the biological or adopted children of individuals who are foster parents in a meet certain conditions of qualify for promise scholarship accounts and for other purposes. Mr. President, the minority portion of Senate Bill Wynn 52 has been attached. Let me see what Mr. President. I recognize Senate from 27th, the speech of the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I bring before you Senate Bill Wynn 52, which is a way to say thank you and acknowledge the work of our foster families in the state of Georgia. Quite simply what the bill does is allows the biological children and the adopted children of parents who have fostered children. Here in the state of Georgia to be eligible for the Georgia Promise Scholarship. I think most of us were in this chamber last year or perhaps even across the hall when we passed the Georgia Promise Scholarship. Registration actually opens tomorrow for this and the program goes into effect with next school year. And so we look forward to allowing these families to participate. Preemptively want to talk about what's probably an obvious question that was discussed in committee. And which is a fair question that was discussed in committee. And that is what about the foster children themselves? And we went through a number of steps to try to work this bill in its current form to include the foster families. But everything in the bill in the Georgia Promise Scholarship program is executed and managed by parents, the biological parents or the adopted parents of children. And so we are going to work in the off session to do the work that needs to be done to have that included. I believe there would be a study committee that will partially look at this issue as well. But I think it's also important to point out that defects currently has the ability. And in fact has over a hundred students that they have approved for placement in private schools. Some of those who the state actually is paying for due to the unique needs of those cases. And so defects is has a keen eye for the process of ensuring that those students are placed in the best educational outcome as it relates to the duration of their placement. In addition to that, the Georgia Promise Scholarship allows for homeschool expenses. And the defects foster program does not allow for homeschooling. So we're going to need to go in and do some extensive work to this bill to have that inclusion happen. I look forward to doing that next year. But as for the bill that is before you today, this is an important step to ensure that those people that take care of the most vulnerable in our population have an additional incentive to do so. And with that Mr. President, I'd be happy to answer any questions. You do have a few questions in there. We're going to have a senator from the second. Mr. President, Senator W. U. I do. Senator, I draw your attention to line 49. It says a foster parent means an individual who currently provides or at any time during the preceding 10 years has provided care, lodging supervision and maintenance for one or more children. Senator, if you were a foster parent in the preceding 10 years and you're not currently fostering the way that is written, is it not true that you then qualify to receive this scholarship? That is correct. Yes, Senator. Senator, you farther yield. I do. And Senator, so if the incentive is to get more people to foster, if you've already fostered a child and you currently don't have a child, why would we incentivize someone for work this already been passed? Well, we're going to continue to do that moving forward as well. So what this does is establishes a look back period for parents who are fostering currently, but may not be fostering next year for parents who foster next year or may not be fostering the year after. So we established this look back period to have that incentive in there for all parents who have fostered in the state of Georgia in the last 10 years. Happy to yield for your next question. And Senator, my final question if you yield. I do. If a parent is already fostered and they don't currently have children, there's no incentive in this bill that if they get the voucher that will make them or ask them to foster within the next year because they've already done at the preceding 10 years. So my question is, Senator, when will the voucher end for a foster parent after they stop fostering a child? So the voucher, of course, is for the student, not for the parent, but the way the program works is once you are in the program for all of those students you remain in the program unless you're your family and your parents decide that you they wish to remove you from the program and place you in your local public school. We're going to have a center from the 44th. Thank you, Mr. President. Will the chairman yield? I do. Thank you so much. Just have a few questions about the workings of the program since as we know, it's kind of just starting. Can you please explain to me what system is set up within the Georgia Promise Scholarship Act or authority to prevent fraudulent or wasteful uses of the money? Yes, so every there's a list of approved expenses that the commission has already made. There is then a third party administrator that when a request for repayment is made or request for payment is made to the commission, they reconcile that against the list of approved expenses and that is ultimately approved by the third party administrator and the funding that the payment is made. Thank you. Now, I went back and looked at SB 233, I think is the number. And reading in line 520, it says the education savings authorities shall not adopt a system that relies solely on reimbursing parents for out of pocket expenses. So you would agree with me that receipts, for example, of a service already used are not a prerequisite to receiving the money under this program. Would you not? Senator, I don't really didn't follow the question I prefer if we could talk about the actual bill is before us. I'm getting there because your I believe that your bill is is is feeding into SB 233 unless I'm sorely mistaken, which I don't know. No, you're not. No, you're not sorely mistaken, Senator, but what we're doing in this bill and I know you guys want to spend a lot of time relitigating what happened last year. What we're doing in this bill is having a carve out for foster families to allow them. I should say an eligibility expansion for foster families to allow them to participate in the program. Well, I would like to read you the line again that I read you from the bill that I believe you were the author of last year. Isn't that correct? Yes, but yes, all right. Senator, Senator, I haven't yielded. We debated that bill last year and I know you're desperate to read debate that bill today, but I'm happy to have conversation with you about the bill that is before us. That what you are talking about is already settled law and is best left for a conversation perhaps with legislative council or around the bill if we- Would you agree with me, Senator, that this the system in 233 operates differently for example, than our health savings accounts where we have to submit receipts for already used services versus what's in in 233. Isn't that true? The way that the accounts are set up is that yes, you're allowed to pay for tuition before a student attend school because that's the way that tuition is paid for. Or other expenses, am I right? It's not just tuition, isn't that correct? Correct. There's a list of approved expenses that are contemplated in the bill that have been refined by the commission. And Mr. Chairman, isn't it also true that there's another way to get certain services or expenses paid for under the promise scholarship to rubric which is actually outside the list of approved expenses if you were able to get a majority of a parent committee to approve that expense, isn't that correct? There are there is a way to make it to have approved expenses approved by the committee. I think that's what you were asking. Yes, I didn't apologize, didn't follow all of that. Yes, Senator, I think you did understand me. Thank you. Are you aware that in Florida families have used this taxpayer money for annual passes to Disney World and Universal Studios? I'm not familiar with that in Florida. I can tell you I am familiar that Florida's program was so successful that was originally implemented under Chick Governor Bush that just a couple of years ago, Governor of Santa's in the Florida legislature expanded it from its limited use to be a universal program in Florida and they have appropriated about 10 times as much funding as we have to our current program. Yes, Senator? Yes, that is true. I know you also aware that families have also used it to purchase big screen TVs, PlayStation 5s and stand up paddle boards with taxpayer money. Senator, it sounds like we might need Elon Musk to go down to Florida and look into what they're doing down there. I know that Governor of Santa's has implemented a Doge Florida bill and I would probably say that in all areas of government we can find examples of misappropriation of funds. And would I would link arms with you and find any ways to find those? Thank you so much for yielding. I just have a couple more questions if you'd continue to yield, please. Following up on the line of questioning from the senator from the second, would you agree with me that the language in today's bill, the way it's written does say that a family could have a foster child for a day, then say, you know, it didn't work out and then receive the taxpayer funded voucher for the next 15 years. Senator, I think we could imagine edge cases in which that would be the case, but I know that the 2300 families who are currently fostering in the state of Georgia are not doing it for their daily stipend that they currently get paid, but they are doing it for love of the children and for desire to see some of the most vulnerable children in our state be taken care of as we know those are thousands and thousands of children. And these families are often stretched thin with their ability multiple placements. There are families in this chamber who have been generous enough to foster children. I would not want to go down the path of preemptively aligning those families and say that they are somehow in it for the money senator. Thank you senator, but you do agree it sounded like that the scenario I laid out actually could happen. Someone could have a child under your bill. I agree that you did agree that that could occur. Am I correct? I'd send it. I understand you don't that it will believe it's going to be everybody, but it is correct that that could occur. Senator, do you yield? Okay, okay. You are as this. Let's finish up. Correct. I believe I already said that I think that there's a you could manufacture a scenario which that's the case, but I think that's a gross alignment of the foster families in the state of Georgia. And I frankly don't even feel that it's proper to prescribe that intent to the foster families. Thank you. Senator, is it in fact true that you are against fraud, waste and abuse in government programs? 100% senator. Senator, it's sort of scenes that given what you just said, you are not following the intention of actually making sure that there is not fraud, waste and abuse in government programs because you just agreed that that scenario could occur where someone maybe not a current foster family actually does sign up for the program to simply abuse it. Isn't that correct? No, Senator, that's not correct. I think that to say that because it is possible that people can find ways to defraud a system that we're not going to put a system in place is really a logical leap that is more or less a desperate attempt to relitigate the passage of this bill that hopefully about 18,000 families will soon be taking advantage of. Should we make it easy? Should we perhaps find out what Elon Musk thinks about this program? Senator, ask if he could yield, please. I'm happy to yield Mr. President. That was my final question. Should we make it easy? It seems to me that perhaps we need to consult Elon Musk who may indeed find that setting up systems wouldn't it be true that our right for abuse may not be advisable use of government of government money. Senator, isn't that true? Senator, I am glad to hear you acknowledge the expertise of Elon Musk to find ways for our abuse in government. I will tell you that he is very busy doing right now at the federal level and when he is done looking into millions and billions of dollars of payments, some of which apparently were earmarked for Stacey Abrams. I would be more than happy to have him take a cursory look at Georgia where I think he will find that we run a pretty efficient government here in Georgia. But even with that, I'm certain that the most brilliant minds in America will be able to find ways for our abuse at any level of government senator. Rick and I have Senator from the 41st. Thank you Mr. President. Mr. Chairman, do you yield? I do. So I'm looking at your definition of biological or adopted child and what that means who can apply and I heard your opening statement about wanting to work with foster children. Senator, are you aware that they are children who are neither foster children nor biological nor adopted? Are you aware that there are other legal positions that children find themselves in? Senator, I'm sure that you know what she's speaking. Yes, so it is isn't it true that I am the permanent guardian of two beautiful children currently today? I'm sure you know what you speak. Under your current bill. I've been able to meet one of yours but I think not the other one but the one that I did meet wasn't a beautiful. Thank you. I appreciate that. He is not my genes but still. I'm just concerned that the reach of your bill does not include children like my own who are permanent guardians and I want to acknowledge my parents. We're not relitigating our previous bill from last year but last year's bill you do make it such that those children who are legal guardians, who are custodians that they do meet the qualifications for the promise scholarship if they meet the other ones. But in this bill you've limited only to biological and adopted children. Isn't it true that there are a number of foster parents who become permanent guardians of their foster children but do not go through the adoption process? Senator, I would be happy to work with you in the house to make a change to this so that we make that change and it comes back over you can vote against it. I would be happy to work with that amendment on the floor right now but I am not making future commitments about voting for this bill. Thank you, Senator. We're going to have a senator from the 25th. Mr. General Manu. Thank you, sir. I have a couple down in Millageville over the span of their lifetime. They have fostered 58 children. I want to thank you for bringing this bill and all your hard work. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, Senator. We're going to have a senator from 48. Thank you, Mr. President. Just the chairman yield. I do, Senator. Senator, I'd like to direct you to the minority report that's on everyone's desk. I think it gives some clarification to the senator from the 42nd. Okay. I have a copy of it here. The 5th paragraph, first sentence, the false promise scholarship. I'm not sure what that is as a proper noun, false promise scholarship. But if we read the first sentence in the third paragraph which states, we barely understand how this program works. So perhaps you and the senator from the 42nd could sit down and talk about this and you could help her understand so we wouldn't be discussing bills from last year. Senator, you're still in part of my clothes but yes, I usually, you know, we get our daily news updates now we're getting our daily minority reports. I usually don't agree with what's in the minority report but never has a true or sentence been written in a minority report. We barely understand how this program works. Thank you, senator. Thank you. Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Does any of the senator wish to speak for against the measure? So I understand we do have a minority report. Senator, from the 38th, are you presenting the minority report? You should do present a lot of these for a freshman senator. All these good veteran senators you got over there and you're always up here doing the minority report. The floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. First before I begin, I want to commend you, Mr. President, on a very nice event last night for Black History Month. It was very well attended at a great time. Colleagues, I rise to speak against this bill. We've heard many of the reasons why this bill should not be voted for today. This bill purports to reward foster care parents. But the sad reality is it forgets the one thing where we're rewarding them for forgets the kids. The kids are literally excluded from this bill. This morning I tried to go to legislative council to put together an amendment, a very simple amendment. But as we saw this morning, this bill was engrossed and we were not able to do that. That one simple amendment was going to be to insert the word foster prior to the word biological. Right now, we are given a $6,500 scholarship to students who are the adopted and biological children of foster parents. But we are not giving that same scholarship to the very foster children they will have in their households. So I want you to put yourself in the shoes of these foster kids. As we all know, typically foster children feel ostracized. They come into a household where there are already relationships developed, where they may feel a little jealousy in terms of the environment in which they're in. And now we're telling them to come into this house. The children of the parents can go to the private school that's down the street to the school that they have deemed to be the better school for their children. But we're telling the foster children, no, you have to go to the school that I have found to be ineffective for my own kids. This is wrong. I understand wanting to reward foster parents. And as I understand, 2,300 families are fostering children. That is commendable. And God bless them for the work that they are doing. This is truly God's work. But if we want to reward these parents, this is not the right way to do that. On February 14th, the list of schools that are eligible for families to now receive the scholarship was released. Tomorrow, they can start applying for that. What we're telling families is that they can now skip all of the families who actually qualify because they are in a failing school. And the school that they are currently in the middle of the school, which was not shared, allows them to skip ahead of the line. They now get to get in front of all of those children that would be eligible for this scholarship. So this is not about the voucher. This is really actually about fairness. And it's just not the right thing to do. I'm going to be from two amazing, lovely parents that are fostering kids. And I asked them three questions. One, where does their children currently go to school? Their children already go to private schools. Two, is there schools on this list? Their answer was no. Or they don't know. Actually one parent said that they go their zone for some really good schools. And then the final question I asked was will $6,500 cover the full tuition? The answer was no. This is unnecessary right now. When we talk about the fact that we don't understand the basics of the bill as it's already been passed, the fact that this list was produced multiple times. The governor's office of student achievement is still trying to figure this out. It hasn't even been rolled out and we're already trying to expand it. And I can also understand the argument that hey, let's make this available for all parents. That's an understandable argument to make. And if that's the case, then we probably should do that. Instead of passing a bill that is truly unfair and saying hey, we're going to reward you for fostering. We're going to use unfortunately foster children as pawns for you to get this voucher. But you can't use it for the kids that are in your household because you're fostering them. My understanding is that foster children are on average in a household for 24 months. So the argument can't be, hey, whether they're not in the family's home long enough. So it would be too difficult to make this work. And if the argument is, you know, we have to work and try to figure this out with defects and how we can make this work, then let's wait and make it work. But let's not pass an unfair bill that is allowing for favoritism in a household. I'll close with this. I was blessed to be raised by my great grandmother. And Graham was sweet and, you know, she was a pistol. But Graham showed favoritism. And I was that favorite. And I would feel so bad at times for some of my cousins because they felt ostracized by Graham. We're now making foster kids, those kids that are being ostracized as a relate to them being sent to the school that their parents think is a good school. This is wrong. So if we want to talk about fairness, let's do that. If we want to make a real difference in the lives of our foster children, let's help them get a leg up and not brush them to the side like we're doing in this bill. With that, I will pause for questions if there are any. Otherwise, Mr. President, I will yield the will. You have no questions. All right. Thank you. Senator, that was we, we, okay. The rules are once we have the final report, then we close the base. I'm sorry, Senator. Senator from the 27th. It's time to close the base. Thank you, Mr. President. I believe when I, well, went on, I believe I know that when I referenced families in this chamber who have given up their time and treasure to take care of the most vulnerable children in our society, one of those families is the family of our appropriations chairman. I believe that he was going to outline the process that you go through between interviews and home visits and interviews and home visits and the long process that you go through to have the opportunity to bring these vulnerable children into your home and share with me the stories of a young boy that was able to be part of his home. I think that that gets to the heart of what we're talking about here. And the attempt to dishonor those families or say that, you know, that well isn't it possible that something can happen really loses heart of the focus of the issue. The focus of the issue is twofold. One, no matter what we do around the issues of choices and options for education, whether it's charter schools, whether it's homeschooling, whether it's school choice, the Democrat party stands in opposition to it. I think that's a very important thing to do. Yesterday, it was children of active duty military families that they voted against. Today will be foster kids that they voted against. Yesterday, it was home school kids that they didn't want to have the opportunity to take the PSAT and the SAT at school and have a fee that was waived if the students are in that school also have the fee waived. The students are active from the mandated government one size fits all regardless of the outcome education process in America. They fight it. The same way they fought sending the kids back to school during COVID. They fight this. The same thing that we've seen is record spending on education both in the state and around the country. And at the same time our spending goes up, the scores go down. And what we are trying to do is to provide alternatives to solve that problem. And this is one small way that we both solve that, help solve that problem, but that we also help the families who have reached out a helping hand and done frankly what many of us are not willing or able to do. And one small way.

that Georgians can invest in the children in those families. And the same way that we would invest in them, by the way, if they attended a public school. So Mr. President, I know that we're in a posture, apparently, a new day in this chamber. We're opposing bills and seeing minority reports for the most common sense pieces of legislation. And we'll send this over to the House and make the changes that the minority whip talked about, because I think that is a valid conversation. We'll do the work that the Senate of the 38th, and I've talked about in the off session, to bring this back for foster children. The Senate of the 48th will have a bill before you, within the next week, that looks to take care of active duty military children. And sadly, I think the reality is that once again, it will be only the Republicans who stand for those families. Mr. President, I yield the well. Senators yielding. And the Senate has closed the debate. Is there objections before you ask me in order? Chair, here's none. It is. Question is ordered. Question is only adoption of the committee. Substitute, is there objection to the adoption of the committee. Substitute, hearing none, the committee substitute is adopted.

I bring it out as Senator from the 51st. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I have before you a Senate resolution recognizing an extraordinary Georgia former senator Kelly Laffler was appointed by President Trump to support, to serve as the administrator of the small business administration in December of 2024. And she was confirmed just last week by the U.S. Senate. Senator Laffler brings an impressive record of public service and leadership to the role. She led a successful business career in the automotive and the financial services industries and venture capital. She went on to become a key leader for the intercontinental exchange and later the New York Stock Exchange until shifting her focus to public service. When Governor Camp appointed Laffler to the U.S. Senate in 2019, she became the first female senator in nearly a hundred years in Georgia's history. In the Senate, she championed policies at fostered economic growth. She had burdensome regulations and strengthened opportunities for American workers and entrepreneurs. Senator Laffler's leadership was highlighted there in COVID-19 pandemic where she played an instrumental role in securing support for small businesses such as the Paycheck Protection Plan, which retained over 1.5 million jobs here in Georgia. Today, she's back in DC fighting for our business community and generating opportunities for millions of Americans. I urge you to vote in favor of this resolution so we can recognize Administrator Laffler's dedication to keeping the American dream alive here in Georgia and across this nation. In addition, we are fortunate to have Miss Laffler coming on Monday. Monday afternoon to be recognized here in this chamber and where she'll be receiving this resolution. I encourage you to vote yes for this resolution and I will yield the well. Does anyone sit on which speech for against resolution? Chair here's none.
