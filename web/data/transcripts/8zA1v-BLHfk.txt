Now I want you to listen up just for a second. You need to hear what I'm going to tell you. Before we move into our chaplain of the day, I just want to thank y'all for your work last night. You know, like I'm, you know, being in my mind and imprint at all night long, we haven't been that long since we've seen each other. But I want to tell you, I want to let y'all know this. And I've received several compliments, numbers of compliments, on about my work last night. And that's a joke, because it was our work last night, y'all. I'm most appreciative. We handle some tough issues. We agreed a lot last night, and we disagreed some last night. But you did it respectfully, respectfully of each other. And together, I believe this house is in a really good place. We'll continue to disagree sometimes, Mr. Leader. Mr. Leader, members, we'll continue to disagree sometimes. But we're going to work in that spirit of trying to get things done in a bipartisan way that does one thing, and that works for the best interests of all Georgians. So I just, I want to personally thank y'all for your work last night. And for how we're all trying to work together, and how we respect each other. So I want to give you a round of applause. We are the Georgia House, and we do lead under this gold dome, if I last time I checked. Is that not correct? That's right. That's right. I'm going to give you a round of applause. We are the Georgia House, and we do lead under this gold dome, if I last time I checked. Is that not correct? That's right. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the gentleman from the first, the very first House District, representing Mike Cameron, representative Cameron. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, everybody. Isn't it good to sleep this morning late, like till 6'30, quarter 7, wouldn't it good? I'm honored today to have Reverend Eddie Cantrell from Trenton First Baptist Churches, our chaplain of the day. Pastor Eddie has been at Trenton First Baptist for almost 33 years. He's been married to his wife Teresa for 42 years. He's been a child of his children, Sarah and James. He has been the chaplain in date counties kind of the small place, like 16, 70,000 people. And so he's had a chance to grow into the community. He's the chaplain for something called the Southeast Lineman School. We have a school in date county that trains people to climb poles and string line. And it's a big thing. They have hundreds and hundreds of people a year and he's able to minister to those people. And the basketball programs in date county for like 33 years. So, ladies and gentlemen, I'll go ahead and here's a pastor Eddie Cantrell. Thank you so much for that introduction, Mike, and Mr. Speakers. Thank you for allowing me the time I will try not to try your patience. I'll try to get on with it. I don't need to tell you that our country is an up people. I don't need to tell you that depending on what station you listen to or who you follow that we can find an argument of first and a five, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I don't need to tell you that we can find ways to divide. Rural, urban, Democrat, Republican, white, black. I don't need to tell you this. You know all this, but I want to remind you. It seems like we're constantly looking for a fight. And the more punches we throw, the louder and prouder our supporters seem to get. And the more divided the world becomes and the battle lines are drawn real quickly. And they seem to never be crossed again. I asked myself this week, what can I do? What could I possibly say to you that you haven't heard before? Probably nothing. But here's my best shot at it. Abraham Lincoln said, I don't like that, man. I must get to know him better. In preparing this devotion for you, I realize I have nothing new, nothing dazzling to share. But I thought about Lincoln's lead. And I thought the best I could do would be try to get to know you a little better. Speaker Barnes, I had no clue that you have a jurist doctor degree. I don't even know what that is. I had to look it up. I didn't know that he was a Sunday school superintendent and representative Jones of the 25th. I didn't know you had the same degree. Mr. Speaker, I read what I could about your family. I know you love them and you're proud of them. Minority leader Beverly, I found it interesting that you are an optometrist. You and I would have a lot to talk about if we had more time. I began to dig into bows. And let me just say concerning your bows, some of you need a lot of work. It's hard to find a lot of stuff out of a boucher. But I found some interesting stuff. And the more I found, the more I liked you. Representative Bennett from the 94th, Alicons, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Lord knows I need you. Representative Camp from the 135th, either was or is Alicons DMT. Same thing. Representative Davis from the 87th, I read that you had over 23 years of critical care nursing and work in that field. And you are a former commissioned officer in the US Army in Airborne. And while it didn't have a clue, wouldn't have had a clue. Representative Evans of the 57th, I know that you have a lot of agree from UGA and you are attorney. I read where Representative Anderson from the 10th was a deacon at his Baptist church. Representative Houston from the 170th was an active Methodist. Representative Bonner from the 73rd was a deacon and a youth leader. I read where Representative Carter of the 93rd has a master's degree in theology. I love what Representative Douglas of the 78th put in the bio. His proudest achievement was his family. His wife Veda and his children Destiny and Demi. It caught my attention, Representative Park, from 107, that you had grandparents who were refugees from the Korean War. And that you moved to the US to pursue the American dream. Wherever you are, I hope you're pursuing it. I hope you found it. Representative O. While we, I knew I'd mess it up, from the 50th, a Chinese American whose parents immigrated to the US in the 60s. You know the more I read about you and the more I got to know some of you, the more I realized I really didn't care if you were a D or an R. I really didn't care if you were male or female. I really didn't care what religion you are or what race you are. I began to love you as people who love this state and who have given your time away from your families and your pursuits to serve people like me. I realize you are people with different ideas, with different backgrounds, with different ways in which you think you can solve our problems, but I realize you're wonderful people who are doing your best to serve our state. My hope and prayer is that what you see in each other is the same thing that I see in you. Never forget that you are role models to the people of your district. And in our day and age today, we certainly need role models. Our children need them, our grandchildren need them. In a world full of hatred and bullies and name-calling and violence, we need role models like never before. We need people to lead us in the right way, with kindness, with gentleness, with peacefulness, in a gracious way. We need people who know how to disagree agreeably. I love what the speaker said and I hope that is the spirit in this room. Our children and our grandchildren need to see white and black and conservatives and liberals and youth and elderly and Christians and non-Christians alike, join together and work together to better our state. Not always agreeing, but not judging, not demeaning, and not always suspicious of what someone thinks if they disagree with us. I am of the hippie generation. I see a few of you are too. Years ago, John Lennon wrote a song that was a defining song of our generation. The song was imagined. And while I don't agree with all of his song, I understand the feeling behind the song. But imagine today that you're not a Democrat or a Republican, but you're first and foremost a human being. Just human beings looking at each other, with different backgrounds, different points of view. Imagine just listening to each other with a desire to learn how someone else feels, instead of trying to win an argument. Imagine what our state would become if we simply looked at each other believing that no one is trying to destroy our state. We only have different backgrounds and different lives, and we really want what's best for our state. Imagine if we prayed for each other a little more, and talked poorly about each other a little less. Imagine if we took time to get to know each other. Now these things are useless to dream about, and it's a waste of time to wish other people would do it. But you know what? I can start. You can start. When we were kids, we played this game. What superpower would you like to have? I always wanted to be able to read minds. I wonder what you thought. Rural, first district, hillbelly, Baptist preacher, first Baptist preacher, friend of my camera, and say that loosely. You know, if you got to know me, you might be surprised. If I get to know you, I might be surprised. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that. It's time we work to turn on the lights. Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior said, I am the light of the world. And yet Jesus took time to know people, to listen to people, to help people. Jesus died for the sins of the world so that we might have life.

have lot, we might make a difference, but he didn't bully people. He just told him what they needed to do. My prayer for you is you will make a difference and I know you are. My prayer for you is that you will be seen as role models, not simply for your race or your gender or your political party, but by everyone in your district. I'll wrap this thing up by saying Jesus said to his followers, if you're a Christian, we would be known by how much we loved each other. We have blown it because we have allowed disagreements to get between us and the love of God. We are destroying our land with divisions. We're fighting over the silliest things. Our families are following apart. Our churches are crumbling and for most of government, there seems to be no credibility. The good news is you and I can make a difference. We can be seen as people who are different. Let's make a difference by our love, by our gentleness, by our desire to work for peace. Let's make a difference by reaching out to those who are hurting lonely, abused or depressed. Let's make a difference by praying for each other. If you want to get to know me and invite me to lunch, I'll try my best to come. If you will pay, I'll be there. You know how it is when a politician and a preacher eats, it's like who's going to pay, right? My prayer for you is that God would bless your families, that God would protect you and give you peace in your life, and peace with each other, that God would give you the wisdom to do what needs to be done and to move our state forward. My prayer for you is that God reveals Himself to you and all of us, like never before. May God bless you and thank you for this time. Let's pray. Father, we are so thankful for the men and the women in this room. We are thankful for them because they have given so much to serve this state. We thank you for their families. We thank you for their loved ones. And we pray that your peace would be upon them and your blessings would be upon them. We ask Father in the days to come give the speaker and all of our leaders wisdom just to do the right things that will bring glory to you. You night this house like never before and allow them to feel your presence and your power and help us just to step back and recognize you for your love and mercy and all of our lives. And may we share that with one another in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Thank you. I pledge to bless you. To the flag of the nine states of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God. Indivisible liberty and justice for all. Door keepers will unlock the doors. Members may greet the chaplain in the south any room and have a photo. Thank you Pastor Ken Trail.

But I will be there until the end of June so there's still work to be done. The University of North Georgia opened its doors in January 1873 as a North Georgia agricultural college becoming the second public university in Georgia. Our CESQUIS-TANIAL and I'm asked often what does that mean it means 150 year celebration gives us a special opportunity to reflect on our heritage to celebrate our achievements and to look forward to our future. In 1873 I doubt that our founders could have imagined we would be offering degrees in criminal justice cyber security or nursing but they knew then as we know now the value of color. The value of college education and its role in strengthening communities and in creating economic prosperity and career opportunities. Universities are special places where students learn to think critically and explore opportunities where knowledge is.

created and advanced, where a sense of belonging and shared experiences build lifelong relationships. At UNG in particular, students also learn to both serve and lead others. For 150 years, we have produced civic professional and military leaders who made a positive impact on their communities and beyond, including, as mentioned, speakers Tom Murphy and David Ralston. Military education has been a signature part of the university's mission since the beginning, as one of only six federally designated senior military colleges in the nation, along with Virginia Tech, Texas A&M, Citadel VMI, and Norwich. We are the military college of Georgia, and we have proudly produced more than 60 generals, general officers who have served Georgia in the nation. With distinctions like being named a national top producer of Fulbright students for our sixth consecutive year, our reputation for academic excellence student success and value continues to grow. Today we have campuses in Blue Ridge, DeLonica, Gainesville, or County County, as well as Unlearn. UNG serves now more than 18,000 students who represent nearly every county in Georgia. I believe this year is every county but four. From 46 states and territories, as well as from 87 countries. Our future is bright, and we are tremendously grateful to you as student leaders. State leaders, little slip there, I've been around students a lot. But we do appreciate you, and I understand how hard you work, and I know sometimes you leave it very early hours to get here, and you are greatly, greatly appreciated, and I know you do it for the betterment of our institutions and for the state of Georgia. I do invite you to attend a special military review with a select contingent of our Corps of Cadets this afternoon at 2 p.m. at Liberty Plaza, where Governor Camp will serve as the reviewing officer. Again, thank you very much. We appreciate you. Madam President, congratulations on your years of service, and I know you're looking forward to retirement, but I'm sure you'll find a job somewhere somebody wants to keep you engaged no doubt.

We're going to move on to morning order, but first, but first we're going to do the doctor of the day, Chairman Buddy DeLouch, is recognized to join me and introduce our doctor of the day. Chairman DeLouch. Thank you very much, Mrs. Speaker. It's a privilege to introduce our doctor of the day today. I've done a lot of things in my 40-small years in politics, but I've never tried to be Lisa Hagen, but I'm going to do that today in her absence and introduce them to the doctor. My seatmate told me I'd be a miserable failure at being Lisa. Dr. Spence received his bachelor in biology from Emory University in Atlanta. Following his undergraduate studies, Dr. Spence attended Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, where he received his master's in biology, focusing on immune system biology. After completing his graduate studies, he received his doctor of medicine from Saber University of Medicine in the Netherlands Antilles. Dr. Spence is board certified in family medicine. He practices wound care and hyperbaric medicine as well as regenerative medicine. Dr. Spence is a medical director of Memorial Health Meadows wound care center, where he treats and cares for patients in the surrounding area in Vardalia. In addition to his passion for wound care, he has established regenerative medicine associates, a regenerative medicine practice in the heart of Vardalia. He specializes in metabolic optimization for patient seeking longevity and a more youthful life. And I told him this morning that I probably need to visit him. At the beginning of his career, Dr. Spence spent eight years as an attending emergency room physician. Dr. Spence and his wife Ursula reside in Vardalia, where they enjoy the beauty of small town living and several rescue animals. Dr. Spence. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I'll be with you. Oh, just quickly. Thank you all very much for making Georgia a great state to practice medicine. And to be able to do what we were trained to do, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Spence, we certainly appreciate you being here. And I think Representative Loach has already been to see he's such a young man, so vibrant. So we appreciate your efforts in rural Georgia, and especially appreciate you being here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Members, if we can have your attention, please. Chairman Chokus. And guest. We have another special resolution. I think you should pay attention. That's what I know you should. I met this wonderful individual earlier today. So without further ado, I'll let. I'll let the proper introduction occur. And now I'll recognize Chairman Mike Chokus. Chairman Mike Chokus for purposes of introduction and information. Chairman Chokus. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think the only reason I was asked to do this introduction is because I'm the only one that can pronounce the Greek names. Oh, someone was paying attention. That's great. Anyway, just a few short weeks from now, Greece will celebrate its 200 and second Independence Day celebration on March 25, 2003, 202 years of independence from the oppressive, Ottoman Muslim-Turkish empire. Greatly outnumbered with limited resources, but with a love of country and democracy, the people of Greece endured years of struggle and hardship to overcome the enslavement of the Turkish empire. The people of Greece were inspired by the American resolution, revolution, and have had strong, have been strong allies with the United States in every major conflict. As a matter of fact, the first victories of the Second World War were by the Greek armed forces against the fascist armies of Mussolini. Winston Churchill once said he rose, fight like the Greeks. The relationship between the United States and Greece is stronger than ever and is demonstrated by the signing of the mutual defense and cooperation agreement. And with that in mind, it is indeed a pleasure, an honor, and a privilege for me to introduce Alexandra Papadopoulou, the ambassador of Greece to the United States. And I'll just say a word or two about her. She was appointed ambassador to Greece in February of 2019. Prior to that, she served as the head of the diplomatic candidate for the Greek Prime Minister and permanent representative of Greece and the EEU, EU. And I could keep going and on and on about the accolades that she's accomplished. But I want to share that she holds a law degree from the University of Athens, and no sir, it's not Godogs, Athens, Greece. And a master's degree in international relations and international law from the University of Pennsylvania and she is a full bright scholar. So I got to meet Mrs. Papadopoulou just a few minutes ago and we've had a wonderful, wonderful time catching up, talking, and sharing. So please join me in welcoming the first female ambassador of Greece to the United States. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mr. Chokas, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but everybody pronounces my name right here in the Senate and now in the House of Representatives because either because you have Athens here, so you know, or because we did a very good job educating everybody. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, it is an immense honor and pleasure for me to address the legislature of the state of Georgia and bring to the representatives of the people of Georgia the warmest greetings of the legislature of Hellenic Republic and the Greek people. Greece and the United States share a long history of common fights in defense of the values and principles both are peoples who are dear and precious. Democracy, rule of law, human rights, and the respect of the individual are the cornerstone of which both our countries were built. Both our countries and peoples respect and adhere to them and we both work together for their safeguarding and promotion through our shared participation in NATO and also are very strong bilateral military and political partnership. Many Americans have Greek descent living in the state of Georgia, a state who provided them with a fertile environment to live and prosper and eventually contribute to the well-being of this great state. These Americans of Greek descent form a unique, unbreakable bond between your state and my country and for all of that you provided to them for strong partnership and the fact that our two peoples feel so close together and share the same values we are grateful to all of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We must thank you very much. Thank you. I'll tell you all after spending a little time with Madam Ambassador this morning, it's very clear to me of the shared values we have with the Greek people over our history and what a wonderful lady, what a wonderful representative from the country of Greece that she is. And I hope all of you will take an opportunity to meet her in this out there in the room, wonderful lady, wonderful citizen of the country of Greece and could not envision a better ambassador from your country to our country. And thank you for what we share together. Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you. Thank you. Members, thank you for your attention. What a special visitor.
