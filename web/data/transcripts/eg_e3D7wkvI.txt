TRANSCRIPT
----------
We'd like to get this ceremony started.
I tell you, I welcome everybody who's in the back
for the chairs who aren't already taken.
Y'all come and fill in the areas, the front rows.
Now, this in church service,
so y'all can fill in the first couple rows.
We're not going to be all from for all friends,
so, asking for one.
Y'all always still got those that sit in the back, though.
Nevertheless, come on around, come on around.
I see our chaplain, Ron.
Ron, you want to come up here and we probably all need a little prayer in today.
So you won't come up here and offer a water prayer for us
before we get started, we usually start,
for those who aren't familiar,
we usually start with a chaplain of the day.
He's not gonna do a message a day,
he's just gonna do a prayer,
but I think it's always good to start with prayer, Ron.
You mind?
Thank God, appreciate that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for everyone for being here.
Yes, people please stand and we'll have a moment of prayer.
Lord God, thank you for government.
Government is ordained by you
and great responsibilities, great privileges involved
in serving, and I just as King Solomon
recognize those responsibilities, those privileges.
He asked for a wise and a discerning heart.
So I pray that for our new Secretary of the Senate,
a Jack trip, I pray that he would just know your favor.
He would know the also passing greatness of your power.
Those of us who do believe in Jesus Christ
is Lord and Savior, God.
So thank you that we can call upon you.
Pray that you're pleased with all the proceedings
here this morning, and I ask all these things
and may name a Christ my Lord.
Amen.
Go.
Thank you, Ron.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ron.
I appreciate that.
That is a very special occasion today, and we're very excited to be here, and I thank
everyone for attending this ceremony today.
We also, it's time to celebrate a new era here in the secretaries as the, here in the
Senate with the new secretary, but also want to recognize two fine gentlemen who have served
than this post, David Cook and Mr. Ewing back there who I believe I know I've been here
too long because we've made history today. For all of you for the first time since 1789,
we have three secretaries of the Senate, two former and one by to be current, secretaries
that's here today and so now that we've made history I think I'll just I'll let Senator Kennedy take it over from here
So but no let's give all those guys a round of applause, please
And it is my honor to recognize the Senate Pro Tem obviously
We are a jack trip is is going to be taking the reins here as a new secretary and we're
very excited about jack he's worked in this role actually he's worked in just about
every role in the secretary's office for the last ten years which I am I have always
a big a big proponent of of always elevating those who have earned the right to to hold
to position. I do it in my private business and I've done it throughout my career and
I didn't want to change the way that we had done things that I'd been used to doing
things in the past because Jack has always done, has such a light David Cook, has such
a calm demeanor and has always done a fabulous job and they've got a great group of young
people that work in that office and you can tell there's good camaraderie and we felt
When Senator Kennedy and I, the pro-tum got together and started talking about who were we going to get to replace?
Secretary Cook, I said, I don't think there's any reason to mess with the
with the the group that we have right now and
Until they prove otherwise, you know, and I think they're gonna do a great job
And I was glad that the Senator Kennedy and I saw that I and the value of that and
and for the official moment of appointing Jack out,
Senator Kennedy will make the official appointment
and then I will do the swearing in
and then we can congratulate the family.
I don't know if it's congratulations to the wife now.
He's gonna have a lot of hours here during session tonight
but it's good to have both his parents, his wife
and his in-laws here as well.
So without any more delay,
I recognize the senator, the pro-tem,
but the Senate, Senator Kennedy.
Well, good morning.
And thank you, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
and members of the Senate that are here,
thank you for being here,
and thanks to all the distinguished guests.
I know it means a lot to Jack's family as it does
the president and me as Pro Tem and all the members
of the Senate for this important work
that we're here to do today.
Let me add my words of welcome.
It is wonderful to see so many members and friends
and the family of Jack Tripp that's with us today
for a really, really nice occasion.
Before I formally make the appointment,
I wanna take a moment and briefly mention the process
as the president alluded to a minute ago
of how we really got here today.
When there's a vacancy in the position
of the Secretary of the Senate,
Georgia Law says that it is the duty
of the President Pro Tem of the Senate
to appoint an individual to the post.
And that position will later be voted on
when we come back here in January
and enter the session for next year.
When Secretary David Cook decided to retire,
I understood that we needed someone
to fill some shoes that quite frankly,
were almost too big to fill.
And this is a historic vacancy that many President
Pro Tems in the past have had the honor of filling,
and I'm certainly indeed honored to get to do that today.
With that in mind, I do take this duty very seriously.
I consulted with our Lieutenant Governor,
as he referenced, and appreciate the guidance and leadership
that he gave me, and as he said in the conversations
we had, it very quickly turned to the obvious choice
of who we could turn to to fill these big shoes to do a fantastic job and maintain what
David Secretary David Cook has done for so long, and we certainly appreciate his guidance.
And quite frankly, there was a clear consensus between me and the lieutenant governor over
who the next secretary should be.
With that being said, and with a full endorsement of our lieutenant governor, the president
of this body and importantly, Secretary David Cook.
And pursuant to the authority granted to me
under section three of Title 28
of the official Code of Georgia,
hereby point James M. Jack Tripp
as the Secretary of the Georgia Senate
to serve until the next session of the General Assembly.
Thank you.
Jack, if you'll raise your right hand or pee after me, I do hear by solemnly swear or
affirm that I will discharge my duties faithfully and to the best of my skills and knowledge.
To the best of my skills and knowledge.
So help me God.
Thank you all.
Congratulations.
I'm very happy that we were able to make this decision but the pro team and I always see
out of our own most everything so it was an easy choice.
It is some big shoes to feel, David Cook, I just can't express my gratitude to you and
what a wonderful job you've done Bob, I was young when I first got here and you were
Casey, Lieutenant Governor Casey Kagle always bragged about the job that you did and you were
always very professional and just very gentleman-like and in my short brief but very pleasant
dealings with you and we appreciate you being here as well. So I just proud to have Jack
here and proud to have the team, the IS team back because like I said, they are invaluable
to this body and to the every member here that serves in this state, they are very helpful,
very good and very just on top of their game and everything that they do and I want to
keep that tradition going until somebody else wants this job and I can assure you that
The next person will be in good hands with this group in place.
So Senator, you like it?
Yeah.
Thank you, Mr. President, for those comments.
Just a few more.
I echo the sentiments of our President
that it really cannot be overstated of how vital and the value
that the role of the Secretary is at the Georgia Senate.
As you see, our current President do so smoothly and eloquently.
It seems second nature when you watch him,
But it's not really when you start,
unless you've got someone like a David Cook
and now a Jack Trip that's right on your wing
to help you make sure things do go smoothly.
The people of Georgia and lately the entire nation
seem to be tuning into the votes
that we have right here in this chamber
and watching this closely.
But what was important, but somewhat,
the quiet duty of voting and debating
is now seemingly the highlight of what we see
on the news at night.
But that's just what is seen out there from this chamber.
What happens behind the scenes is critical
to make sure that things do, in fact, run smoothly.
In the Lieutenant Governor and I talking about this
and also the work that is done by the Secretary,
not only assisting us, but also helping
and counseling committee chairman and other members
as we navigate the procedures of doing the business
of the people in this, the upper chamber,
is so important to the work of this distinguished body.
Lucky for us, Jack has been sitting close by watching
and helping, and also under the tutelage of Secretary Cook.
And he's done that for the last two years
while being right here on the rostrum.
And before that, he was managing the voting procedures
and the floor activity here in the chamber,
also helping Secretary Cook.
Now he'll be standing right here on the rostrum
with his name and his work being directly impactful
on the lives of 11 million Georgians
and all 56 senators without the privilege
of coming in here and doing the work that we do.
Let me make a way for the newest constitutional officer
of the and the 44th Secretary of the Senate,
Secretary James Tripp, but before I do,
I also wanna give a shout out to all those
that have supported Secretary Cook
and that will be supporting Secretary Tripp.
And that is the staff of the Secretary's office.
Many of them are here today.
Thank you.
Not only for being here, thank you for the work
that you've done that make this chamber operate so smoothly.
Thanks for making Secretary cook look good for the last while.
And thank you for what you'll do to make Secretary trip look good
as we all work together.
So thank you for that.
And with that, I bring you Secretary Trip.
Thank you very much and good morning. I'm so glad to see so many of the Senate staff
your day. It's, it is truly y'all who make this system go. So I'm grateful for the deep
honor you've given me to show up. Senator Kennedy, thank you very much for those kind
words. I truly value the trust and confidence you've placed in me by making this appointment
and very much look forward to earning further your trust
and confidence in the role.
It's one of the great honors of my life
to be asked to serve as secretary.
So thank you for that.
Lieutenant Governor General Delso,
I want to thank you for your kind words as well
and for your support in the selection process
and throughout my time in the Senate.
It really means a lot.
I look forward to working with both of you
as well as the distinguished members of this Georgia Senate
to whom I owe a special debt of gratitude
as I've been able to see for the better part
the last decade how you have shown the hard lessons of public service and what that is and
how best to do it. I'm grateful to you for your service and for your sacrifice on behalf
of this body. When I or the office of the secretary can be of help to you, please don't
hesitate to reach out. It's our honor.
Also I'm grateful for Secretary Cook and for Secretary Ewing to being here today and
for the immense shoes that they've left to fill.
I'm glad the President, Pro Tim and I are in this
in agreement on the size of shoes left to fill.
The impact of your many years of faithful service
to this body and to the state will echo down
the generations of this great Senate.
As part of that enduring legacy,
David and Bob have built a great and truly exceptional staff,
both past and present, many of whom I am deeply privileged
to call friends, being asked to serve as a leader of friends
is both a great honor and a daunting responsibility,
one for which I am very thankful and do not take lightfully.
I would be remiss to not mention my family,
without whom, as I think many of you would agree,
the work we do here would simply not be possible.
To my beloved wife, Kaitlyn, my parents,
Kathy and Troy, my in-laws, John and Jesse,
and my adored grandparents.
Thank you for the many lessons you taught me,
and for putting up with the many difficulties
that this work entails.
I would not be here without you.
And finally, Mr. President, I'm a great believer
in the lesson which so many of our Senate chaplains have tried to impart, he who is heard
briefly will be heard again. Thank you very much.
It is, this will be the conclusion of our ceremonial event.
There will be a reception in room 230 here at the Capitol after this, but as custom
here, the Senate, when we do honor somebody here on the roster, particularly our pastors
of the day, but other people as well, what we usually do is have those individuals or
their family come down to the side here and the people in the room will come by and congratulate
them, and if y'all would do me the courtesy of doing that for Jack and Katelyn, I would
be greatly appreciative because it is a big honor that we have for him to be promoted
to this position, but it's a lot of responsibility and I recognize that and he is ready
for the job and he will have a learning curve like we all do and anything we do, but I think
he is well prepared and we'll do us a fine job and we just appreciate it one being here today
and y'all have a wonderful day. Take care.
