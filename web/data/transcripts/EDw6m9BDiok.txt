Good morning.
Hope everybody is feeling well today.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the fourth house district representative Casey Carpenter representative Carpenter.
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Speaker, brothers and sisters of the house, I get to introduce
again my dear friend Reverend Stan Leicester, best I can calculate, besides the speaker
and speaker Pro Tem Jones, Reverend Stan Leicester is now number three on the list of talking
on this microphone, so this is his third time here in like the last year and a half, he
It does a great job.
Appreciate you having us, and I hope to hear a good word.
Thank you, guys.
I wondered how this house has allowed Casey Carpenter
to stay in such good graces here for so long.
And then I walked in this morning
and the place smells like a big ham biscuit,
and I understand a little bit now,
he brings ham biscuits when he comes.
So, Speaker Olston, Representative Carpenter,
thank you for the opportunity to share today
and also to those of you who are members of the House.
Thank you for your steadfast commitment
to help lead the great state of Georgia.
There's a part of the country called Death Valley.
It's the hottest place in North America.
Average temperature in September is 107 degrees.
In 2020, Death Valley hit 130 degrees.
average precipitation? Essentially zero. Something significant happened because
Death Valley is called Death Valley because nothing ever grows there. The surface
is crusty, nothing happens, and something significant happened in 2004, the
winner of 2004, seven inches of rain fell in a very short period of time. It
happened quickly, and immediately nothing happened, but eventually something
began to happen. In the spring of 2005, death valley was covered with wildflowers and flowers
and vegetation. And what they determined was this, that death valley wasn't dead, death
valley was dormant, that beneath the surface there were seeds of potential and opportunity.
And when you think about it, the idea is that when you get seeds of opportunity in the
the right environment and growth happens.
And whether we're educators or lawyers or pastors or whether we're teachers or legislators.
What we do is we position people in the right environments so that they can experience growth
and their potential and be everything that they're supposed to be.
Paul writes in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 15, be careful how you live, not as unwise but
is wise, making the most of your time because the days that we're living in are evil, making
the most of your time. Maybe a great command of the Scripture that we rarely ever even realize
is found in that passage that we should make the most of our time. We should redeem the
time that we have. He says, first of all, be careful how you live. He's not talking about
being cautious. He's talking about taking the most of the opportunities that are before
you. The word is, is ab porta. It means it means that when the ships would come in, it's
a nautical term, when the ships would come in to port, the tide would rise, and when
the tide would rise, that's when the ships could come in. It was their opportunity to bring
the ships into port. It's been said that the opportunity of a lifetime has to be seized
in the lifetime of the opportunity. And so every one of us have opportunities to make
a better Georgia for those around us. As leaders, we lead in such a way that create
opportunity for others. The other thing that Paul teaches us is that we have to adapt.
We have to adapt to change. We have to adapt to circumstances. He says, don't be unwise,
but be wise. If we've learned anything over the last 18 months, we've learned the importance
of adaptation. That we have to shift. We have to change. In 2013, Eastman Kodak sold at
$35 a share. Yesterday, Kodak closed at $6.75 a share. Why the decline? Kodak was so
blinded by its success that it missed the rise of the digital technology. That doesn't
make sense because the first digital camera was created in 1975 by an engineer named Steve
Sassen who worked for Eastman Kodak. It was as big as a toaster. It took 20 seconds to
take an image, it was low quality required, complicated connections to a television
to view, and it clearly had massive disruptive potential.
Sassen himself told the New York Times that management's response to his digital technology
and camera was, that's cute, don't tell anyone about it.
Spotting something and doing something about it are two different things.
I could act in vented the technology, but didn't believe in it enough to invest in it.
As legislators, as pastors, as teachers, we create a better tomorrow.
We believe in people.
We hope in people.
We believe in the possibility of seeds coming to life that maybe had been dormant for a long
time.
Having wisdom to know what to do is not enough.
Wisdom demands courage to do what we know we ought to do.
The third thing that Paul tells us is make the most of your time.
Make the most of every moment you have because the days that we're living in their fleeting,
he says they're evil.
And sometimes the way to make the most of things are right before us, right?
We've all experienced this where we're searching for something that's right in our hands,
right?
We've yelled at the kids who took my car keys and as we're looking for our car keys,
our wife, our husband looks at us and says, you're carrying them in your hand or we have
of our reading glasses on the top of our head
while we're looking for them.
And my wife will look at me and say,
your reading glasses are right on the top of your head.
Sometimes the thing that we're looking for
is right before us.
I recently read this article,
a Turkish man, Bayon Mutlu, 50,
who lives in the Northwestern Berza Province,
was believed to be missing Tuesday,
after he wandered away drunk in the forest
from his group of friends.
When reported missing, a search party
was formed to find him.
Mutlu had fallen asleep in the forest.
And the next morning when he awakened,
he came across the search party looking for a lost man.
Mutlu unknowingly joined the search party
to find himself.
When the volunteers began shouting his name,
Mutlu became confused and asked, who are you looking for?
When they said his name, he said, I'm here.
Police realized the man they were looking for had joined his own search party and gave
him a ride home.
Is it possible the very answers we're looking for are right before us?
That's what Paul would say.
He would say, make the most of the moments that are before you, but don't be so complex
and so complicated as educators, or pastors, or leaders, or moms, or dads, or legislators
that we miss what's right before us.
If the scripture would scream one thing at us, it would scream this.
The thing that is right before us is simply this, love the Lord your God with all your
heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.
It's really pretty simple, right?
Love yourself because the only way to love your neighbor, your brother, your sister,
is to love yourself.
And out of that love for yourself,
you love others.
And it all begins with an understanding
that we love God above all else.
Love the Lord your God with all of your heart.
Maybe the best way for us to reach people
is to simply be kind.
Maybe the best way for us to lead people
is to simply be kind.
In an atmosphere where it feels like kindness is missing.
In our world, in our cultures, in our nation,
Maybe the greatest thing that we need is right in front of us to simply love God and
to love one another.
What I've found to be true is this, that I can disagree with someone, I can disagree with
their lifestyle, I can disagree with their preferences, I can disagree with their political
leanings and still love them and still be kind to them.
How do we make the most of every moment?
lead with humility by loving people and being kind to them. Would you pray with me?
Father, I thank you today for your great grace. I thank you for this house. I thank you
for leader Rostin and the gift that he is to us. I thank you, Lord, for the many hours
that are invested. God, they're not hours invested in vain, but they make for us a better
future and not just for us, but for our kids and our grandchildren. And I pray that your
great grace would be upon each of them.
That God should give them wisdom, but not just wisdom, but courage, courage to make the
kinds of decision that's going to help us be who we're supposed to be in our future.
I pray God for the families, the marriages, the children that are represented, the grandchildren
that are represented in this room.
I pray that this be a season of great grace.
I pray for great rest during the holiday seasons, that God's memories would be made, that
rest would be experienced.
God when everything is said and done, because we understand, Lord, in the great state of Georgia,
that all good things come from the Father of Lights will be careful to give you honor, to
give you glory in the name of our risen Savior, Jesus. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, Speaker.
Always, always play.
Always, always enjoy.
Absolutely.
At any time.
Keep everything straight and dull.

I'm not here to remind you to put a gift in for the toys for tots. I'm here to ask
you to patch yourself on the back and thank you for helping me in 2016 pass House Bill
897, which was the donated drug repository program. This is one of the fastest growing
donation programs in the country, allowing unexpired surplus medicines to be redistributed
to low income families and via networks of charities, clinics, and
pharmacists like Good Pill. Here in Georgia, we have GoodPill.org, GoodPill
Pharmacy. It's not an in-house pharmacy. It's the pharmacy that distributes
these drugs all over our state at a cost of about $6 for a 90-day supply of
of hypertension drugs, drugs for heart failure, for depression, but we've got a problem.
We have a lot of people that don't know that there is a thing called the good pill
pharmacy and that they can get their drugs from that if they have financial problems and we have
a lot of people thanks to this COVID that are in that situation. So tomorrow morning outside,
I'm going to have packets of this, this little card that you can take home and give to
your safety net organizations like a food bank or somewhere where they will be given out.
And on the back of them, it's a real easy step-by-step way for the person to start getting their
medicines from good pill pharmacy. Give yourself a real big pat on the back for passing this bill.
it came out of the house and like I said it's one of the fastest growing and we were the first one
to do it statewide via mail which is especially good to help our elderly in our rural areas that
may have trouble getting to a pharmacy. Thank you again, thank you Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative drier for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yesterday, there was a very grim statistic that was released in the past year over 100,000
Americans have died from drug overdoses.
We're seeing triple quadruple number of drug overdose deaths from just two to three
years ago.
There are people like Joe Thomas, Dustin Manning, 18 19-year-olds from Lawrenceville, who
played baseball and fish together and accidentally took a pill that was laced with fentanyl
and died.
But I think this has touched a lot of people in all of our districts.
I think it's probably touched each of us once, even if it's a friend or a friend's son
daughter, but every one of these 100,000 people are brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers,
sons, and daughters, and so we have work to do, but I think today would be a good moment
to take a moment of silence to honor the lives that were lost.
Thank you so much, colleagues.
The clerk will read the caption to a group of privilege resolutions.
This is a historic day in this house.
I have to share this with all of you.
