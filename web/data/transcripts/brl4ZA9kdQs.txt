----------
Let's get our folks in here and we can get started on our next house bill. If you're a ring the bell. All right. All members please come into the chamber. All members come into the chamber and look for your seat. This would be the appropriate time to do all of that. What day is this? Day 40. Day 40. There you go. That's what day it is. Day 40. Thank you members. Hope you had a good lunch. Nobody need to take a nap. I've got some important business to take care of this afternoon. So with that, I'm going to recognize represented Matt Hatchet for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move to this House agreed to the conference committee report for House Bill 68. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to the conference committee report? The committee of conference on House Bill 68 recommends both House of Representatives and the Senate recede from their positions and that the Attached Committee of Conference Substitute to House Bill 68 be adopted, respectfully submitted. Honorable Matt Hatchet, representative of the 155th District, Hon. Jan Jones, representative 47th District, Hon. Chuck Hestration, representative 104th District for the Senate. Hon. Blake Tillery, Senator 19th District, Hon. John F. Kennedy, Senator 18th District, and the Hon. Stephen Gooch, Senator 51st District. A gentleman recognized to explain the conference committee report. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before I call Tyrone, I'd like to make a moment of... A gentleman with a spin. I don't know anything about each Tyrone. I thought I'd just loosen things up here a little bit. He best be careful with all Tyrone's on. I'm going to tell you. Okay, the gentleman's recognized. Thank you. I would like to take a moment of personal privilege and introduce three pages that I have today. Two of my pages is their third and second year for doing that. They happen to be the children of our budget office, the director, Christine Murdoch. Her children Maya and Miles Murdoch stand up. How about that? I'm sure they'll get me back for that one day. And the other is Miss Danica Risha. She's from Millageville, but her mother grew up in Dublin and moved to Millageville for some reason. But she has been paging for us at least once, and on several sunny days, but this is her seventh year paging. Thank you, Miss Danica. Thank you. Y'all, it's been a journey to get to this point on the FY 26 budget, but we have arrived. And I believe that we work with our partners in the Senate and the governor's office to craft the budget for the next fiscal year that both makes the needs of Georgians and lives within our means. Based on interest earnings at Treasury to date, the governor has increased the revenue estimate this morning by $50.4 million. This additional recognition of revenue helped us close gaps in the budget where the General Assembly sought to ensure that the base was correct for programs with higher than anticipated utilization, like out of home care in DHS. It also allowed the General Assembly to maintain its additional support for enhancements in corrections and education. As I told you in the budget left this house, the budget is highly focused on public safety and education. That position still holds in the conference committee version. There are number of items that you won't see on your differences sheet because the Senate agreed with the house position, like $22.7 million, including $10 million in newly appropriated funds for recommendations by the Georgia Council on Literacy. And adds in corrections for new correctional officer positions in state prisons and technology upgrades. There are a number of differences between the House and the Senate that did not have to be resolved. Decisions like whether or not to utilize bonds or fully fund the promised scholarship were never policy differences with the governor or the Senate. Rather, they were simply different strategies employed to balance the budget. Here are a few highlights of differences in the budget as I left as it left this chamber and as the conference committee has recommended them. The House agreed with the Senate and the governor to utilize cash for one more year to fund capital projects. There are no bonds in the final version of the budget. The conference committee returns to the governor's position of funding the promised scholarship at 1% of QBE earnings or $141 million. I know many of you have been receiving updates on the number of applications and know that of the 10,000 applications started, 5,100 have been deemed eligible for the scholarship today. This full funding allows for more than 21,000 students the opportunity to participate in the program. We spent a lot of time perfecting the school safety legislation. The funding for the S3 database that was included in the House version of the budget has been removed and the conference committee version includes $6.9 million for reimbursable grants for qualified student advocacy specialist as authorized in House Bill 268. I've heard from many of you who are concerned about the apex. The Senate had moved the funding for apex to the Department of Education for mental health services. We understand that that funding mechanism would not have worked to continue the successful program. So in the conference committee version, $9.2 million in apex funding is restored to DBA STD. Funding for the new student support services program at DOE is preserved. I'll be at it a slightly lower number. This includes nearly $20 million for mental health support grants for middle and high schools. And $2.3 million to provide funds for school systems that, due to their size, do not earn full funding for a school social worker. The Senate added to the out of school care grants or boost 2.0 bringing the total to $12.5 million. Finally, one of the items that I'm most proud of in this budget is the poverty rate. It's funded at $15.2 million. These funds will impact and will be 94,000 students in 59 school systems with more than 40% of their students meeting direct certification poverty. In health care, we were able to make a number of improvements to medical rate, Medicaid rates. Ultimately, we were not able to include all the adjustments requested. But adjustments were made for primary care physicians, dental codes, applied behavior analysts, neonatologists, and maternal fetal medicine. And to provide EMS reimbursements upon patient pickup. Rural Georgia is always on our mind. To help address health care needs, the House and Senate have provided $3.9 million to expand the newborn add-on payment for Medicaid delivery services in rural Georgia. These funds will provide a $2,000 add-on payment for a total of $3,000 per delivery in rural counties with a population of less than 35,000. And in rural counties with a population between 35,000 and 50,000, there will be a $1,500 add-on payment. The amended budget was the vehicle for Hurricane Helene relief. This budget includes one other item tied to HB 223, which is $17.3 million for a grant for local governments to provide reimbursements for timber severance taxes not collected. In the Department of Agriculture, a number of reductions from the Senate version have been restored, including an emergency management specialist position and two meat inspector positions. The Senate also agreed to set up a fund with the Forestry Commission to provide speedier overtime payments to our forest land firefighters who are frontline responders when natural disasters occur across our country. This was an important priority for many of you. Also important to a number of you was maintaining the 2% provider rate increase for child-carrying institutions, child-placing agencies, foster parents and relative caregivers. These agencies and people are meeting a need for our state and the youth in their care and it was important to recognize the increased costs they're incurring. The House has added to the Governor's recommendation for the now-comp waivers and the Senate agreed to the House position to find a total of 115 new slides. In the Conference Committee version of the Budget, the Department of Corrections receives an infusion of $200 million over the current budget. This is $75 million more than the Governor's original recommendations. But the House and the Senate agree on staffing and safety increases. However, the House went further and wanted to recognize the increased costs for food and healthcare in the base budget. Ultimately, we recognize that some of these additions are multi-year process and can be adjusted next year. The Commissioner has been a good partner and we appreciate that he always picked up the phone whenever we needed to just call Tyrone. Finally, gentlemen's out of order. Boosting the financial stability of the Employees Retirement System has been a priority of many in this chamber. And we've worked hard in the budget over several years to boost the long-term outlook of the system, while also addressing the needs of state retirees who gave service to our state. While not as high as initially recommended by the House, the Conference Committee version of the Budget includes an additional $10 million to ERS to increase the one-time supplement payment that retirees receive. Mr. Speaker, that's a very high-level review of the most significant changes in the budget since it left this chamber first. This document and the accompanying highlights have been on your desk since about 1040 this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to work on this budget on behalf of you and the citizens of this state. I want to thank our colleagues in the Senate, Rick Dunn and Lauren Curry in the Governor's office, the subcommittee chairs, and the greatest budget staff in the country. For all of their hours, they put in this document for you to this point. And before I go call Tyrone again, I'll take some questions. I've got to gather myself after you call Tyrone. Gentlemen's going to yield for some questions. This recognizes Ripsidy Berry to your left about two-thirds of the way back on the left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The budget increases the hope that was actually ran for our HBCUs, which is a crucial benefit for our HBCUs students. But there is still not further true to do more for full hope parity for our HBC students in the state. I believe that is correct. Thank you for this bill. Ripsidy, Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gentlemen, you? Yes. I'm using the tracking sheet for this. On 145.7, when it's talking about the voucher program, it references SB-82, which I believe is a bill that we just passed, that has, that compels local school systems to not deny the charter school petitions. In that bill, we said the state will give you $250,000 in startup costs. It looks like we only appropriated $500,000. And that's 145.7, correct. Yes. We did appropriate $500,000. This is a grant program as we do in many items through the budget. You never know how many will apply. So this allows if we do have two that apply between now and say amended, we do have the money to do what we have said we were doing the bill. Right. But if we have three, then they would not get the $250,000. No, no. It'll be divided by three instead of two. No, we will, they will be funded at $250,000. They just may have to wait a little while. Thank you. Ripsidy, you've locked into your left is recognized for a question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for working so hard on our budget. Is it not true that on 228.4, line 228.4, we have, although I am a little disappointed that we did not end up with the 8.1 million to fund from the fall off of victims of crime act money, we have settled on $3.1 million to give to victims of crime, sexual assault center. Things like that, which is more than the governor's recommendation. Is that true? Thank you so much. Thank you. It is, you know, I think this is something that we need to all remember and consider from now on that, you know, we are the state and we cannot cannot replace all federal funds if they go away. So we have helped them and brought them up for a little while. Ripsidy, Stinson, in the back to your left, recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes, to my favorite strawberry queen. Thank you. Is it not true that my seatmate standing with me wanted to say that she really appreciate you calling Tyrone, but you can't use her phone. Is that not true? I believe I've heard that before. I won't say the rest of the song. I might get thrown out of here. We thank you for your work on the budget. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Spirter. Representative Holcomb has a question. Mr. Chairman, if you'll take his question, then you have... Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Neal. Yes. Our budget is predicated on a revenue estimate, and I think it's fair to say that since we reconvened in January, the macroeconomic picture has changed pretty dramatically and just over the last few days. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates that we're likely to see a negative drop of 2.8% in GDP for this quarter. And JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both state that the probability of a recession now is quite high because of the recently imposed tariffs which represent the largest tax increase since 1968. So my question is, how comfortable are you with the probability that the revenue estimates that make this budget will hold throughout the year? Well, I'm not an economist, and I don't play one on TV. But you are correct. I believe that things have changed and are changing. I would think that this... I would think this budget could stand if there are huge swings. And if there are huge swings, then our role is... This is our number one job. Yes. And I don't think anybody in here would have... We could not object to coming back and correcting something that all of a sudden, unforeseen by us, we have to correct. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, with that, I would ask for the body's favorable consideration, and I will yield the will. The gentleman is yielded the will. Are you suggesting that I should call Tyrone? Okay, use your phone. I don't have his number, so we'll move on from that one. The gentleman is yielded the will. In the adoption of the Conference Committee report on House Bill 68, all in favor of the adoption of the Conference Committee report. We'll vote yes. All those opposed? We'll vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted for what purpose is represented, part Ken and Roz. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that on today, the commemoration of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This budget includes a cut to the King's Center? Yes, I think I saw that line, and I know that Chairman was, it worked diligently to maintain those numbers. I think he's going to share some light on that for us. So, what purpose does Chairman Hatchet arise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that particular line item for the Martin Luther King Center is a 125 increase to a line item that approaches a million dollars a year? I'm sure the gentleman has watched it over the years and has embedded in our budget, and we're continuing to support. An institution is important to our state and our country. For what purpose is represented, the risk, the prize? Mr. Speaker, Parliamentary inquiry. Dary. The state's inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it true? I'm not sure if someone's asking you. Is it true that the budget chair is singing Colin Tyrone because when he went into the conference, he told a government in the Senate, that he's not getting tired of yours. The gentleman knows there's one more signature that has occurred on this budget. I'm not going there. Have all members now voted? If so, for what purpose does the barren's rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you. The state's inquiry. Is it not true that based on the budget, there is a reduction in nutrition funds, but only because as many kids as we fed last year does not need to be fed this year. That's a true success story. I know that Chairman has worked hard on those funds and has very close to his heart and his mind to share it as it will. Have all members now voted? Thank you. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the adoption of the conference committee report on HB68, the A's are 170, the nasa 5. And the committee of conference report is adopted. Members, I want to thank the members of the staff of HBRO, all the committee subchairs, the committee members, and this house for standing behind the great properties of this house to make sure we took care of all these hard working Georgians. Chairman Hatchett, especially I want to thank you, your dedication, and your commitment to the people of Georgia getting this budget out. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Leader, a majority leader of the administration. I think our work's done here. What do you think? I'm ready to make the motion. Will you give me the work? I think we could get you down to this on that one. That's not a motion, that's an emotion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This day off. Chairman Wheat-Hour is recognized for a motion. Give the gentleman the will. Your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we agree to the Senate substitute to Senate Bill 630. House Bill or Senate Bill 630? House Bill 630. House Bill 630. Mr. Clarence, will you read the caption? House Bill 630 to be entitled to amend chapter 47 and title 43. The fiscal to Georgia and Senator relating to use motor vehicle and use motor vehicle parts dealers. Chairman Wheat-Hour is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the licensure bill dealing with use motor vehicle dealers and use motor vehicle parts. It had a little rider on it and the Senate decided it didn't want to ride no more. That's all I got. I yield the will. The gentleman has no questions and he's yielded the will. On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 630. All those in favor will say yes. All those opposed will vote no. Mr. Clarence, will you unlock the machines?

All members voted on the gentleman's motion. It's clerk will close the machine, lock the machines on the gentleman's motion. The Jays are 173, the Nays are 1, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 630, 630. Chairman Corbett is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I make a motion to the House agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 371. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 371 to be entitled to an act of men code section 2260, the Fisher go to Georgia annotated relating to Capitol Outlay funds generally under the Quality Basic Education Act. Chairman Corbett is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Section 1 of the bill is the original section, and all we did there was just raised the state's maximum authorization for Capitol Outlay funding from $300 million to $375. That was the original bill that we passed. Section 2 of the bill, the Senate's substitute, that just ensures that any new elementary school bill after July 1, 2027, which includes a playground meets modern accessibility standards creating truly inclusive place spaces for all children. And that's the change in the bill, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Chairman Heslund, further question. The Chairman Heslund questions as yielded the well. The Chairman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 371, all those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, were you in luck, the machines? All members voted yes, so Mr. Clerk, were you in luck, the machines? All the Jimlins motion, the A's are 168, the A's are 3, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 371.

Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption? House Bill 378, be entitled to amend Code Section 48534, the fiscal and the Georgia Administrator laying out the law and property tax bill forms. Representative Gaines has recognized to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The caption of the bill and the bill that's before you are certainly different. The original House Bill 371 was incorporated to House Bill 92, so that is no longer what House Bill 372 is. The amendment you have on your desk does is it removes any existing language from House Bill 370 and adds in the vape registry bill that this House passed in House Bill 570, 759 to 12 earlier this session. It's exactly the same as what we have already considered in this body, and Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer a question if there is one. General Helser, a couple of questions. Representative Gail? In the back to your left. Reptile. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Isn't it true that this substitute that's on this bill now is being pushed by the tobacco lobby in an effort to create a monopoly on the sale of vaping products? No, and in fact, I'll tell you just two days ago, the Supreme Court ruled on this matter and made it clear that what FDA has done to try to regulate vaping, the FDA's active properly. And instead what this is trying to do is to get under control. And massive influx of illegal disposable Chinese vape products. And I hope this House will once again overwhelmingly approve this bill. Gentlemen, further yield? Sure. Reptile, Stacy Evans to your left. It's a quick answer for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. I want to just make sure the way I read it, there's nothing in this bill anymore that requires local school boards to put anything on bills. It doesn't affect them at all. Is that correct? That's all removed from the bill. Thank you for the clarification. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask the by-join us and trying to get this vaping crisis under control. Thank you. Gentlemen, answer all these questions. And he's yielded the well. Is there any objection to adoption of the House amendment? Here he done the House amendment is adopted.

And, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 141, the nays are 31, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 370 as amended by the House. The re-up thick chest stain is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move to agree to the Senate amendment as amended by the House on HB 491. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 491 to be entitled back to amend Article 1 of Chapter 3 to Article 2, Chapter 4, the title 27 of the Efficient Court of George Anitettid related to hunting and non-commercial fishing. The Representative Chest Tane is recognized to explain the Senate amendment and the House amendment. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HB 491 passed the House last week, actually 171 to 2. This is the air gun and the airboat bill. This substitute actually just strikes through the Senate amendment and makes the bill exactly like it was when we presented it last week in the House. That's the amendment, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, has a question representing Cameron? Gentlemen, I'll ask. You're right. Does this take out the extension of the dear season? Yes, sir. It does. Okay. Thank you. Gentlemen, you have one more question? Yes. The way up at this House. The Representative Park has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, you old? Yes, sir. So essentially this will go back to the underlying bill which was just about catfish. Which was what? About catfish. Yes, sir. Okay. Air gun airboat. Yes, sir. By partisan support for catfish. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. We won't go about catfish again. Now we did that one. Reps. Roman is recognized for a question to your last up the center aisle. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a dumb and yield. Yes, sir. But did we figure out if catfish are in danger or not since the last time we spoke about this? No. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, how you yield the well? Good answer. I'm glad you yielded the well. Yes. Because that one had gone deep six last time. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? Hearing in the House amendment is adopted. Yes, sir.

And the House has agreed to the Senate amendment to House Bill 491 as amended by the House. Members, we'll move on to the rules, calendar. I'm going to ask the clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill Ken, Senate Bill 10. Senate Bill 10 by Senator Goodman and the eighth and others to be titled an act to amend the Code Section 1562, the official code of Georgia annotated relating to the number of judges and superior courts, so to provide for an additional judge and the superior courts, the Lapa Ha, judicial circuit. I'll refer to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by the Rules Committee Substitute. Representative Tray Kelly is recognized to present Senate Bill 10. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues. I bring before you SB 10, which was originally a bill that was going to add a new judge to the Lapa Ha circuit. That measure was already passed by Representative Ford, and so it will no longer be needed. And so we use it as a vehicle for judicial officers and circuits to have over 15 superior court judges to help improve efficiency throughout the process. Mr. Speaker, it's a simple bill passed as you did share a committee unanimously with bipartisan support. I would ask for your favorable consideration. I'll be glad to take any questions. General, I have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You'll do well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered, is there any objection to withdrawing the Committee's substitute? Here in none of the Committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the Committee on Rules? Here in none of the Rules Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report of the Committee's agreed to shout. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote, yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Is so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate Bill 10, the yeas are 161, the nays are seven. This bill having stated requisite cost of majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you be the caption to House Resolution 347. House Resolution 347. A resolution urging all high schools to establish flag football programs for girls. This bill, this resolution haven't been assigned to the Committee on Special Rules. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Representative Cox has recognized to present House Resolution 347. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I come to you as an urging resolution from this body that we encourage all Georgia high school athletic programs in this state to start girls flag football. The day we dropped this resolution, we have since had 34 high schools start participating in creating their new girls high school football. Currently there's 457 schools in GHSA, 307 of which. Currently participating over 9,000 girls. In 1972 is when Title IX occurred and that was the origin of when flag football began in this country. This has gained some great recognition. If you'll look up on the board, the author blank foundation in the Atlanta Falcons currently are offering a grant and I encourage any one of you, we have 150 high schools left to get programs going and you can QR code and you can get that information and get it back to your high schools but they're offering five to $10,000 grants to each school to help them start it. Y'all coming up in Los Angeles is the Olympics. They're going to be offering flag football. This is an incredible opportunity for our high school students to potentially become future Olympians. The Falcons, the NFL, all are fully behind in supporting this. Our local sports broadcasters are fully behind this. We will be the first legislator across the country to do this so I ask for your favorable support and strongly encourage you, let's get 100% support across this state. Mr. Speaker, I yield for any questions. You have several representative Wilkerson to your left and the back is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Is it not true that the McEacher and high school Indians flag football team is one of the top ranked teams in the state? Actually, the nation and the state champion, is that not true, my friend? I do believe you're 100% correct. To your left representative, Jasmine Clark is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Is it not true that I love watching our girls play flag football and while we are urging schools, I would also urge us to consider how much it costs to actually have these types of sports at schools and hopefully we can get funding so that we can help these schools start these flag football programs. I understand and that's where author Blank and his foundation has poured into our community to do such things as that through private money and urge you to create resolutions to move forward with it as well. Representative Scofield has recognized for a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. I really like this program and I clicked on the link and is it not true that you said that they are looking for more ways for other schools to engage or more funding? May I miss something? We're looking for the remaining 150 at least in GHSA to finish out and start their programs and that they can use this grant money to help start their programs. There's currently 307. Okay, because I'm looking at the form right now and it says thanks for your interest but it's closed. We're no longer accepting new submissions. I'll be right back. I clicked on the link. I will check and see but right now I know that the author Blank Foundation and the Atlanta Falcons are fully behind us. All right, thanks. The gentleman, I had conversation with GHSA yesterday and they were wide open and they're looking and then the Blank Atlanta Falcons are certainly behind it. Representative Richardson has recognized for a question to your right. Yes. I do. Is it not true that Greenborough High School in Columbia County is not one back-to-back state championships? I know that you know what you're talking about coming from Augusta. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there's no more questions I'll yield the way. You do have another question. Okay. Representative Franklin to your left, recognize for a question. Yes. Is it not true that Southeast Bullock is one five, five back-to-back state championships? Is it also not true that Southeast Bullock and Flagfootball team can beat all your own Flagfootball team? There we go. Where's Tyrone? Let's see. A gentleman knows about football. Do we be clean? Is recognize for a question? Thanks, Mr. Speaker. Is gentleman you? Yes, I think, sir. Isn't it true that I support this program and I know that the Atlanta Falcons Foundation as well as Arthur Blank has put a lot, a lot, a lot of money in making sure that girls, Flagfootball succeed. Absolutely. 100% correct. Thank you for what you've done for us as well with the Falcons. And thank you for bringing this resolution. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Any more questions, Mr. Speaker? You've got a whole bunch of several. One more? One more? One more? Representative Barrett to your left, recognize for a question? Okay, last one, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? Yes, I do. In the spirit of this awesome, awesome program that you're endorsing so energetically behind, would you consider encouraging the first annual House First Ascent at Flagfootball game? I think that is a great idea and we'll, we can continue the softball but let's bring Flagfootball to the Capitol. That's a great idea, Mr. Speaker. You've got a yield of the well and I, I just called Tyrone and he said, please leave. Thank you. He just sent me his number, by the way. Thanks. Appreciate you, Mr. Commissioner. You're a good man. Gentlemen, is yield of the well? Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Your Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution here in the other board of the committee to agree to? Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. Yes, so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All the adoption of the resolution, the yeas are 172, the nays are zero. The resolution ever seen the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to Senate Bill 101, 101? Senate Bill 101 by Senator Robertson, 29th, to be entitled to amend Chapter 12, the Title 31 of the fiscal to George Aniteta, relating to control of hazardous conditions, preventable diseases and metabolic disorders. This bill I've referred to the committee on public and community health. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative David Clark has recognized to present Senate Bill 101, representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring today Senate Bill 101. It was the language in that bill. Originally it was House Bill 87, we passed 171 to 2. Has to do with the orthotics and prosthetics. So everybody can move, movement that a lot of y'all met, Elliott and Jared Wallace and Mohammed Mousquaw. So the sponsor who has Senate Bill 101 allowed me to remove his language and put my language in there. I'll see. Gentlemen, has no questions? Are you not doing, I'm sorry, that's my bad. With that, ask for your favourable consideration and vote yes. I'll be glad to take any questions. Gentlemen, does have a couple of questions. I would like to ask you a question. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's earlier bill with respect to prosthetics. Do you have the LC number by any chance just to make sure that members are voting and understanding the right version of this bill? I do not have the LC number in my head right now, to be recorded. Help you with that, just a moment. Thank you, sir. But this is with respect to prosthetics, not to the muscular district. Senate Bill 101 only has House Bill 87 language in there. We removed these Senate Bill 101 language that came from the Senate and we added House Bill 87. And I talked with the sponsor and he's in agreement and we sent to the Senate and he'll agree to it and we'll pass it to the covers and dust. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? I'm sure as we get the LC number situated, is it not true that this is one of the best bills that you and I worked on that will pass today? Yes, ma'am. Thank you for all your help. Mr. Will, LC 6000167S. I would like to take Cooper, his recognizable question and the back when you're right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that that bill came out of my committee and that I hocaid the removal of what was in the original bill and let you put in your bill? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration of Senate Bill 101. Thank you. The gentleman had no further questions. He's. He's yielded the well. Representative Bennett has recognized the speak in favorably or representative Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today in strong support of Senate Bill 101 as substituted by the House Committee on Public and Community Health. This legislation addresses a fundamental issue of equity, access and dignity in our health care system. Senate Bill 101 ensures that the judges who rely on orthotic and prosthetic devices can live a full independent lives, maximized their rehabilitation, maximized their functional capacity. Let me be clear. These devices are not illiterate. They are not cosmetic. They are medically necessary for function. We are talking about artificial limbs, custom design, supports and mobility aids that enable our fellow citizens to work, play, bathe, care for their families and anything that you do, they will be able to do. And yet too often coverage for these essential devices is either denied or limited by outdated policies that don't reflect the real needs of the people that we serve. Senate Bill 101 changes that. It requires health benefit policies in Georgia to provide coverage for orthotic and prosthetic devices when they are medically necessary. It ensures this coverage supports not just survival but quality of life, covering devices that enable physical activity, personal hygiene and essential job functions. This bill, Colleagues, brings Georgia in line with national clinical standards. It recognizes that a joint may need to be replaced when a person's body changes and that a limb may need more than one device over a period of time and at any one time. It includes not just the device itself but the education, the training, the fittings and the repairs, everything a person needs to be effective in their mobility. Importantly, Senate Bill 101 sets reasonable limits no more than three devices per limb over three years and it allows insurers to deny coverage for misuse or theft. This is a balanced approach and to my colleagues concerned about cost, I hear you but consider this restoring mobility reduces long-term health care expenses. It reduces secondary conditions, prevents hospitalizations and increases employment and mobility ability. It empowers Georgia to live to their full capacity and colleagues I ask that the members of this body do vote in favor of Senate Bill 101 because today we have a chance to say we see you, we value you and we are not going to let insurance company stand in the way of our rights to live a full and healthy life. I urge your favor consideration and I respectfully ask for your yes vote on Senate Bill 101. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I yield the well.

The well that concludes the speakers on the bill. We do have a minority report. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. We do have a minority report. Representing Park, Canis, recognize for up to 20 minutes for the minority report. I don't need that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, members. I want to be very clear this minority report is not about the substance of what this bill does for our communities that need this health benefit. This minority report is specifically about an efficient government and a process to understand what happens once we do this. Walk with me through this. Any plan starting in 2026, private plans in the state of Georgia must provide this access. So 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030. So that's a set of five years of data. On line 112, it speaks to those five years. So thank you in the bill for speaking directly about what we want this report to include. But on line 105, it says that the report is not due until July 1st, 2032. The questions that we asked in committee was if this is such an important piece of legislation that so many of us agree with, why would we request that a department give us a report two and a half years later. So again, we're hopeful that there will be some work on this legislation to bring that report sooner and to make sure that those who are receiving this health care benefit have timely processing. We want to thank those who have publicly stated that they will continue to work to get the state health benefit plan to also participate in this bill. To also participate in this, as currently this measure does not include it. And that's all that we have. I will be voting in favor of this measure, but wanted to be clear that this minority report is about process and making our government more efficient with the number of claims submitted, the number of claims paid, and the total amount that it costs for our state. Thank you and I yield. That concludes the speakers. I'm the minority report. The lady is yielded the well. We don't have anyone taking this chairman's time, so we're going to move on. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report of the committee's agreed to, shall this bill now pass on in favor of the passage of the bill? Will, yes, all those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate Bill 101, the A's are 167, the NA's are two. This bill, I haven't received a request, the Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate Bill 204? Mr. Clerk, will you suspend just for a moment? I want to recognize a former member of this house who has had a distinguished career in this legislature and the state government, my friend Jay Neill. Let's welcome Jay Neill to the people's house back. Former member Jay Neill. Mr. Clerk, will you apologize, Mr. Clerk? Will you read the caption of Senate Bill 204? Senator Jones, the 222nd to be entitled back to amend code section 1777.1. The official go to Georgia and attain a relay in the trial upon accusations and certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea of guilty or no lo contendering. This bill ever referred to the committee on judiciary, and on civil committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Ellen Powell was recognized to present Senate Bill 204. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house. I bring to you this afternoon Senate Bill 204. There's two sections of this bill, which normally is the things that we see in the latter days that we combine bills. So I bring these to you today. First section that you'll be looking at is reinforcing the preemption clauses that this general assembly has passed over the years about what those parts of the state law are that it's important. And I would tell you right now that this is a reinforcement because it raises penalties for those cities and counties and political subdivisions that may violate the preemption clause to the weapons law in this state. Now a lot of people want to talk about that this is about the second amendment rights of people. This is more about keeping order and the administration of the laws in this state. And I'll tell you a little bit about why this was brought over in the Senate. Apparently we have one of the cities in the state that decided to pass a local ordinance that said that if you have a car, and I'm not sure quite frankly if it was a car that was broken to whether it was locked or unlocked, and if somebody stole your weapon, then they charged a thousand dollar fine. If you didn't report it within 24 hours, they charged just secondary thousand dollar fine. If you didn't pay that, then it's a 30-day penalty of incarceration. And it sounds like this may be a second amendment issue, but there's a bigger issue. And that is the preemption status of state laws. I will tell you if you can imagine that we have 600 plus political subdivisions in Georgia, cities, counties, towns. And if all of these cities and counties preempted state law, then we would live in a chaotic situation, ladies and gentlemen. So first and foremost, that's what this is really about. Yes, there's somewhat to the second amendment rights, because that seems to be one of the biggest issues that people want to talk about. But the bigger issue to me is the preemption. And I know a little bit about preemption. When I was a younger legislator, there was a legislator by the name of, well, he made up one, his name mentioned. But he and I passed the preemption law back in the mid-90s. And that preemption law said that if they were the violation, it was a hundred dollar fine. Now, I can only tell you what I've been told. They put these thousand dollar fines on there. And then it was reached out to the Attorney General to reach out to this particular city. And what came back was that we are getting the thousand dollars penalty on these, so hundred dollar fine doesn't mean anything. Well, at that time, we thought a thirty something years ago, we thought that a hundred dollars might have been a lot of money at that time. But apparently not. A hundred dollars in and a hundred dollars today, hidden much reason for these cities to preempt the state law. So what we're doing today is what you see in front of you. And I'll go over the part section one first. What we're saying is that if you have been subject to or agreed by an act, rule, or regulation that you have a right to appeal to the courts. And if you're the prevailing plaintiff in that, then you can get in joint-div relief. Then there's a civil action which you can recover attorney's fees. It goes further to say that then we reduced it from the fifty thousand penalty that came out of the Senate to twenty-five thousand. But actual damages, if you have actual damages, whichever is greater plus the expenses of litigation and reasonable attorney fees, then you can collect or you can claim for liquidated damages or three times the amount of expenses. And that is the message to send back that preemption, we are the legislature, we are the state government, and we are the ones who write these laws because if not, there would be absolute chaos that if you went through six hundred different political subdivisions and all of them had a different law. We would be embroiled in more conflicts than you can imagine. The second part of the bill, ladies and gentlemen, this deals with the criminal procedures with district attorneys. And if these are offenses that are not considered a serious violent felony such as sexual felonies, violent felonies, if these are what they call minor felonies, then they can be prosecuted under an accusation with that grand jury appearance. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what this bill does. I would implore you to consider it. I know that those people who have concerns, whatever they may be about the second amendment, I would tell you that you go about it the right way and do allow the state of Georgia and the legislature to preempt and let our laws prevail. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a gesture of this bill and I will be more than glad to stand for any questions, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, I have several questions. Representative Isle. She, agenda back to your left. Yes, sir. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so, so far the session, the majority party has number one refused to grant a hearing to HP one, a safe storage requirement. Number two, it's allowed HP 79, which offered a tax credit for purchase of safe storage equipment to be gutted by the Senate. And number three, it's now seeks to preempt local governments from enacting public safety measures involving safe storage. And in fact, exposes them to a $25,000 penalty for such measures. So the question is, can you explain why the majority body continues to oppose interventions that prevent gun theft by criminals and would address the number one cause of death of kids and teenagers in this country? To the good lady, I am not in that position of leadership to say why these individual bills haven't came up. I think that maybe some of them have been heard. I don't know what has and hasn't. I know that Georgia is a strong second amendment state. We've always believed in the right to bear arms. Most of us who have been on board of this issue for years, we promote safety, but that's all in the eyes of the older. This particular bill to the lady, if I may. This particular bill, when I talk about the prevention, one of the things that's disturbing to me is that in this municipality I'm talking about, they want to charge $1,000 for somebody who is stolen your property, $1,000. Your motor vehicle in this state has always been treated under the castle doctrine as the same as your home. It's the same as your home. So if your baby vehicle has been violated and someone has stolen a weapon from it, and you're going to penalize them for being the victim, that's not justice. That is not justice. So the other question is a political question that you can only ask yourself why these other bills haven't come forward. There's two houses of the legislature and let the process work. One follow-up if I may. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'll just note that a safe short requirement would prevent against gun theft. So that is a good thing to talk about as we move forward. I know you're just one person and you are not making all the decisions, but I'll just ask you as the bill sponsor primarily. Would you support giving HB1, the Safe Storage Bill, a hearing and a vote? Next session? I would like to see what's in the bill. I make no commitment on any bill until I read the bill and what I'm voting on. Okay, it was the first bill filed this year, so you have plenty of time to read it. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen, you owe for a question from representative Chess Stain to your right, the joint justice. Yes, sir. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it gentlemen, you? Yes, sir. Is it not true this bill protects lawful weapon carriers when their rights are violated by unconstitutional local ordinances? Yes, sir. Absolutely right. Gentlemen, you owe for a couple more? Yes, sir. Glad to answer any question on such an important subject. Representative McQueen to your left, just recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You see the list. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So, isn't it true that this bill would prevent local lawmakers from passing legislation for gun owners to prevent reglass and negligent storage of firearms to prevent unauthorized access to weapons? That's fine, local lawmakers. This says that those local governments can't bring up state law. You are nearly elected to the legislature of this state to pass laws of importance that affect everybody in the state. If we had 600 plus jurisdictions that just passed the Maraja laws, we would have chaos that no one would know exactly what the rules were of behavior. Thank you, ma'am. Representative Jason Ridley to your right. Extreme right. Is it recognized for a question? What's the truth, is there? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's gentleman, you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that this year that we had a house member that had a safe storage unit in his vehicle, they broke into his vehicle and then still had four days later they broke into it again and took crowbars and opened up to safe storage unit in his vehicle and stored his weapon. And under the, if we didn't pass this in that one city, he'd be fined $1,000 even though he had a safe, you have to answer it. I'm sure the exact language in that city I'm referring to, whether it's a, whether it's a lot of car and an online car. But I know that if you leave a weapon in a car, then you're subject to have a theft of that vehicle of that weapon. We know that from experience that right here in the lab, that criminals will target certain vehicles. They love to target trucks SUVs. In my tenure up here, I lost a couple of handguns over the years by driving my truck the time because criminals, they know what to target. They're professional. They broke into my vehicles, didn't get anything but my weapons and I learned better. I learned to start carrying it in my pocket. Yes, you heard that right. And it's something that I don't like to talk about very much because I've always said those people who, who talk so boisterous about carrying the weapon, they're the ones that are the first victim of a criminal. But everyone has that right to protect themselves. But you also have a right not to be penalized for being lawful citizen and a criminal taking advantage of you. Gentlemen, you yield for question. Certainly. The review is sent cheers to your right is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it gentleman you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that the first four pages of this bill is essentially Senate bill 163 by State Senator Colton Moore? I think you're right. Thank you. And please don't hold that against me. I'm going to represent the Williams and recognize a little question to your right to your right. Mr. Speaker, does General Neild is not true that the core issue redressing here is of the 600 subdivisions of, of approximately 600 subdivisions of State government you've referred to, that they're not law makers. So all they can do is pass ordinances in this general assembly is not only law making body in the whole state. But we're absolutely right. The cross section of the conscience of this state is what this body in the lower house. We're the cross section. We are the state lawmakers in the laws that we pass take promise. Further question? Yes, sir. It's gentleman you. Certainly. Is it not true that many of these subdivisions have not figured that out yet? Is that the politicians sitting in those seats have not figured out the fact that they're not law makers. Is that not true? You know, we live in a time. We live in a time that is nothing like I've seen in my lifetime politically. We have issues that people think that because they can't get justice over what they perceive as their position in the legislature, that they can do what they want to do. That's disarray. That's chaos. That's not what governance is supposed to be about. So what I say is that this while the Second Amendment may be the deeper part of this. There's a bigger part and that's about the preemption of these laws. As I had said, why would a city pass a law to penalize someone who was a victim of a crime? Folks, that gives me heartburn to think about. So that being said, I know there's a lot of people that want to talk about this. And I know there's a lot, especially maybe a partisan divide on your beliefs of the Second Amendment. But I believe that that is a sacred part of the Constitution. I've always said that the Constitution in God Almighty gave everybody a right to protect themselves and their property and their loved ones. But to me, it's absolutely astonishing to believe that someone could be charged with a crime and to a thousand dollar fine in a penalty. Let me tell you something about these things. Thousand dollars don't mean much to some of you folks out there. But I tell you who it does mean something to you. It means a lot to those working folks out there to get charged. You'll remember a little bill that we were dealing with about the cameras. There's no recourse to a lot of them. They just sent to check and paid it. In this particular case, you get charged with a thousand dollar penalty or two thousand if you don't report it. Did they've got to hire a lawyer? Well, in our society, unfortunately, what the day we live in, that they can break you one way or they can break you the other. If you have to hire a lawyer and hire legal counsel to stop something, that's not fair, ladies and gentlemen. There's no reason the penalties are end here so that they can be reimbursed for their legal expenses. But somebody's got to pay for those legal expenses first. Mr. Speaker, if there's no other questions, I'm sure we have plenty of folks who want to speak on and against this bill probably. But I would certainly appreciate your considerations to the argument. I would ask that you vote against violations of preemption. I would ask that you vote quite frankly for the base issue that creates this preemption. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and appreciate your favorable consideration. Mr. General, Mr. General, he did answer most of his questions and we do have a lot of speakers on the bill. We have a number of folks signed up to speak up, posed to and in favor of. Chair is going to hope you'll take four minutes and 30 seconds. But I will give you up to five minutes to speakers on the bill. You'll have the yellow light at 4.30 and you'll have the red light at 5. So we're going to hold all of those opposed and in favor for a person known anybody get excited. I thought you had a minute each. We'll move forward. Representative Crawford, a Mark. Virginia is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Now, I'll try to be as briefed within your time. I'll light it. Friends of the day, I rise in opposition of Senate bill 204. The bill started off as a bill that dealt with prosecutorial efficiency and then language was added that would preempt local governance from trying to do what's right and that is to protect their citizens. As a person that stands in as well, I know a little bit too much about hijacking of bills. And as you can't imagine, I'm against it. Nonetheless, the speaker before me and he is completely right that this is a bill that deals with the home room act in preemption. Georgia County's municipalities right now have the opportunity to draft ordinances, not laws, but ordinances that can protect the citizens within their local government. Those ordinances can only be drafted so long as it does not preempt what the state government says. The speaker before me is right that under OCGA 161173, there is already a preemption of any type of sale, transfer, purchase, or storage of firearms. In the CAHC County, we have tried to draft ordinances that would allow storage ordinances to be implemented, but preemption prohibited us from doing that. So a lot of counties that try to work around how do you save the people's lives in your districts by creating ordinances that would not be challenged by preemption. So the issue that I have is allow people in their counties to come up with some creative ways that they can decrease the amount of gunshots, the amount of deaths that occur inside of their counties because they have the numbers. What you see on your screen right now is a story from the CAHC County, the county that I'm from, where someone was actually murdered. A teenager was murdered because they were able to get inside of someone's home, take a gun, and use that inside of a fight, and someone died. This happens all too often. I want to give you a few stats. In 2024, there were approximately 200 deaths and injuries that occurred with teenagers that were at least 17 years or younger because they were either killed again or injured from accidental discharges when they were able to get inside of closets, cars, and they killed themselves or others because they had access to guns. There have also been nationwide approximately 15,000 deaths similar in Georgia. They have been about 2,000. So we have about 2,000 deaths that occur in this state. Now, the problem is that those 2,000 deaths that occur in this state are centrally located into Metro Atlantic area. The reason why I'm bringing that up is because there are counties in Metro Atlantic area that are trying to create safe ways for people to have guns. I am not against the second amendment. If you have a gun and you are a lawful owner, have your gun. I don't have a problem with that. But if Fulton County, the CAHC County Clayton County wants to create an ordinance that says, we don't want our children to get inside of closets, to get inside of cars, take those guys and commit other crimes, then let the people into CAHC County and Fulton County are whatever county to come up with. CAHC County to come up with creative ways to pass those ordinances. It should also be noted that this is a bill that is trying to do what really is already the law. If you look at, and if you have time and if you're so interested, if you look at an 11th Circuit case, the United States versus gun, no pun intended. But if you look at the United States versus gun, there is already a law that says that the state can preempt laws that deal with storage. So there is already a law for this. So you really don't have to pass this bill. This is something that is already in the law. So we don't really need to pass something that is already there. But what this does is that it doubles down on any type of effort from local governments to create once again safeguards and safe rails for ordinances. If you don't like a gun ordinance, and whatever county that you come from, and let's say is a small county that does not have that type of issue, then my suggestion is go to your city council, go to your commissioners and tell them that you don't want the bill or the ordinance rather that would preempt or attempt to preempt. But if you come from a county like some of us come from where that is a big deal, then again, let us do something to protect the children. That is what I am asking. I am asking that you oppose Senate bill 204 because there are, again, there are areas in this state where we need to be able to create these ordinances. I am a person from the CAF county that understands the importance of allowing us to have the power of home rule. And I'm asking that you vote down 204 so that people who are from areas where this is an issue that happens on a daily basis, allow us to do what we need to do to protect our children. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I you the well. The gentleman's yielding the well, rip the two Roberts is recognized, speech of the bill. Thank you, Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. That's not quite evening, I guess. I would like to start my speeches on guns. I know you all know I'm opposed to this bill with I own a gun and it's stored safely at home. I am not anti gun. But I'm wondering how many of you took the time to speak with the students and staff from at Bellachi High School. Students and family members who came to the Capitol while still in mourning. Last September, two 14 year olds, Mason, Shermerhorn and Christian and Gula were gunned down at school. Coach Richard Aspenwall and Christina, Irami, both teachers died protecting their students. Children ran for cover. Parents got the call. No parent should ever receive that their child might not come home. The students, staff and families of Appalachia will carry that trauma of that day for the rest of their lives and they are not alone. From Metro Atlanta to rural Georgia, gun violence has become routine. Just two years ago, Amy St. Pierre was shot and killed at a Medtown doctor's office right up the way. Today, her husband lost his wife and her children lost their mother. These aren't isolated incidents in 2024 and average of 2005 Georgians died by gun, 52% by suicide, 45% by homicide. And yet, what have we done? Nothing except expand access to guns. The Appalachian families have come here again and again asking you to pass common sense safe storage laws and how do we respond? With a bill that concludes safe storage laws, SB 204 is a slap in the face to those families. And for what? To punish Savannah for.

Trying to prevent gun theft and violence, all they proposed was a civil penalty if someone left their gun and carried in a car stolen and used in a crime. Instead of supporting them, this bill blocks local leaders from protecting their communities and lets private citizens sue local governments for trying. Let's be clear, we're not just tying the hands of mayors and police chiefs. We are threatening them with legal and financial punishment. The hypocrisy here is alps astounding, earlier this session. Many of you in this room voted for tort or form saying Georgia is a judicial hellhole. Now you want to create a new private ride of action against cities and counties that are trying to keep people safe. We haven't even passed the bill that encourages safe storage and safety training through a simple text rebate. Wow, and don't say that's the senate's fault. We all know when house leadership wants to get something done, it gets done. So let's be honest, this majority party has prioritized gun lobbyists over Georgia's children. You're creating a $25,000 legal threat against local governments, small towns that can't afford the risk, and you're doing it to support a senator who disrespected two of our speakers and threatened our house staff. You're siding with him over grieving families in Barrow County. If you won't pass safe storage laws, at least don't slap these families in the face with this political retribution bill. To those of you supporting SB 204 out of concern for the second amendment, I understand. But rights come with responsibilities and our responsibility as lawmakers is to protect life. Not just the rights of gun owners, but the lives of the innocent. The students of Appalachia were just trying to learn. Their parents were just trying to get through a normal day. SB 204 won't make anyone safer. It won't stop the next shooting. It might make it harder to prevent. We should be passing laws to support safe storage, background checks, and red flag laws, not bills that prioritize lawsuits over lives. This isn't a theoretical debate. It is life and death. It's lockdowns. ER visits, funerals. It's trauma children carry into adulthood. We cannot keep expanding gun rights while ignoring gun deaths. So today, I'm not just asking. I've done it before. I begged, and I'm begging again. Vote no on SB 204 for Appalachia for your communities for your conscience. Thank you. I yield the well. Thank you. The lady is yielded the well. Representative Barry has recognized a speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in the strongest opposition to SB 204. I would love to support the original version of SB 204, a bipartisan measure that would reduce recidivism rates in our state. But instead, here we are debating another big government control bill with SB 153 or two of four of you want to call it. There is too much to begin with what's wrong with this bill. There are the process and procedural issues. There are the issues of local subversion and there are issues of constitutionality. But the biggest issue for me is that we are here talking about a bill that is so dangerous, so absurd, and so deeply unserious that I have to wonder, what's made in a signal chat full of gun lobbyists? This is where I say, hey, you know, it would be fun making it easier to sue cities for keeping people getting shot and everyone just sent a fist in an American flag and a fire emoji. It's funny, but it would be even, and it would be even funnier if it wasn't a slap in the face to local control, to public safety, and to basic common sense. I am tired of watching this chamber make it easier to carry guns than to vote, than to get health care, than to afford rent. The people of this state are sick and tired of that false choice too. And instead of listening to people of Georgia, instead of tackling gun violence, what does this bill do? It lets people sue cities and counties for trying to affect their own residents. Let's break down just how ridiculous this process has been. This bill was Russia committee, failed, and then brought back from the dead. No real public hearings, no real input from law enforcement, no consultation with communities that will suffer the most, the people who are begging for gun safety laws, ignored. The city leaders that are trying to keep our streets safe, ignored. The parents who don't want their kids caught in the crossfire, ignored. But guess who wasn't ignored? The gun lobbyists. They had a front row seat while this thing got pushed through. This tort scam intensified. And guess who pays? Not the gun companies, not the lawmakers that are pushing this. The taxpayers. Look, this bill basically says to cities not only can you not protect your own people, but don't worry. We will let gun activists sue you for trying. That's like banning seatbelts and then letting reckless drivers sue the DMV for suggesting they buckle up. Look, we just had an election where Georgia made it clear they want stronger gun safety measures. They voted for leaders who promise to take action against gun violence. But instead, a respect in the will of people, this bill does the opposite. It silences their voices and overrides the very officials they elected to protect their communities in the first place. This isn't just bad policy, it's just a blatant disregard for democracy. And you know what else is a matter under this bill? Local governments. Your mayor was comments since gun laws too bad. Your city council wants to keep guns out of parks and playgrounds. Sorry, can't do it. You want safer streets. Well, you better cross your fingers because SB 163 says good luck with that. Look, by trade, I'm a numbers guy. I mean, I'm an economics major for more house. So we talk about that a lot. Cycling with facts. Not fear mongering. And here's the fact. Gun violence is the number one cause of death for children in America. Not video games. Not TikTok trends. Guns. And yet instead of addressing that, we're debating a bill that does nothing but create more lawsuits, more legal fees, more headaches for local governments. All will be getting harder for to keep people safe. I don't know about y'all. I did not come to this chamber to be a glorified defense attorney for the gun lobby. If this body actually cares about law and order, then let's start by keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. But instead, SB 163 or SB 204, whatever you want to call it, does the opposite. It punches local leaders for trying to keep their city safe. It shields dangerous policies from accountability. And it ignores the people we were elected to serve. So to my colleagues who are still indecided, I urge you to think about the communities we represent. Our job is to listen to the people of Georgia and make decisions that keep them safe. This monstrosity of a bill does not do that. I don't call it the scripture. Ziki, your 2230. I look for someone among them who would build up a wall and stand before me in the gap for those who cannot stand from themselves. Right now, our children, our families and our communities need us to stand up for their safety. Let us not be silent in this moment. Let us not be found unwilling to act. Instead, let us do what's right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the well. Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I said here today, and I listened, As I sat here today and listened to all the statements that were made, and I saw what this bill was all about. And I'm going to tell you, if you recall when I first got here, I had a nephew that had been killed in the city of Savannah by someone that went in, stole a gun, and shot him, stole his car, and thank God for our police officers. They were able to get him. He's still in jail, but has not come to trial. So this morning, as I was reading my email, I received an email regarding this bill, and I was ordered to vote for this bill. And I was ordered that why I should vote for it was because the city of Savannah is trying to make us safer by saying that you must lock your cars and that you must lock your glove compartments because you know that there are people going around trying to break into them. That was to protect me and every resident in our community. But the problem is, is that I was told that we did need to listen to what our city government was doing, but I should listen to people that want to do whatever they want to do with their guns. I want my city to help to protect our children, our senior citizens, and all of the people that come to our community. Why am I standing up here? I want to tell you, because in this communication that I received, I was told that either I do it or, and I'm going to read it verbally, Savannah, it says, Georgia gun owners will keep me informed of your vote and what happens to this bill. In capital letters, I will be watching what you do, how you vote, and will tell everyone I know to vote for our against you, depending on your performance on this and other gun issues. Well, you all know I don't like guns. I will try to vote you out of office if your performance is not acceptable on this issue. Well, I'm saying to you, think about residents in your community that need to be protected. Think about the children in your communities that need to be. I am happy that we made a decision to protect it by saying if you are not going to take care of what is inside your car that could take a life, then you don't even need to be there. So I want you to know, my colleagues, as I stand here this afternoon, I want you to know that I need your support and I need your support so that communities can make their own decisions of how they are going to protect our people against gun violence by telling them to lock them in their cars and lock boxes in their homes. I have a gun. I don't even like guns, but I want to vote with me. And I'm making it a personal thing since it's a personal attack. Please vote no. The gentle lady has yielded the well. I'm going to take just a moment of personal privilege and recognize a former member that's on the floor. If you'll join me in welcoming the former Camilla Hobson who is now Camilla Jackson, she represented Albany in House District 153 and she's here with her husband Derek Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Former representative Jackson. We're moving on to the proponents of the, oh I'm sorry, we do have another speaker to speak against the bill. The chair recognizes representative Ramon to speak to the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker of Pro Tem. Please it appears some of you have misplaced a pair of spherical objects today and it is making me furious. And let me explain. With deep respect to those who are engaging on this issue seriously and I mean that sincerely. My opposition to this bill in addition to what we're going to be talking about from policy position is the fact that I firmly believe we should not be rewarding those who threaten our staffers with policy. And what do I mean by that? This bill is one of my colleagues mentioned is actually Senate bill 168. And unfortunately with Senate bill 168 the supporters of that bill actually posted a video calling out by name a staffer who works for us and said come burn their desk. An actual staff member that works for us that has never done anything but do their job and who was essentially doxed on the internet. And for what? For following orders? And the thing that really boggles my mind is that sure the name of the original author of the bill and those supporters are not at the top of this legislation. But the thing I've learned being here for three terms now or three sessions now is that when you're in the minority party you sneeze wrong and your bill dies. It happens. It's fine. It is what it is. The majority party you sneeze wrong and a bill moves out of rules. Also fine. It happens. We saw it happen on Wednesday. It was great. But for me personally I really think that there should be a red line, a line that none of us will ever cross no matter how much we want this policy. I don't care if this bill is about puppies and unicorns and everybody gets a free one. I don't care if it's my most important policy positions. You do not get to threaten our staff and then get your policy and your bill on our floor within a week. That is a deep and sincere belief in mine. There has to be a red line. There has to be something that says, sure, you want to be a part of the legislative process, whether you are elected or not elected, you are an advocate, a friend in the hall, whatever it is, a constituent. It doesn't matter. We love to hear your voice. We love to have you. Calm down. I beg my constituents. I beg my people who aren't my constituents to come here all the time. All the time. Please come and work on these bills with us. But I will tell you this, if any of them ever threaten a staffer, ever, to me that is a red line. It should be a red line for all of us. The reality is that we will always debate bills. We will always debate policy. We will always have different positions. I deeply believe this is one of those that there should be no daylight between any of us. Bring it up next year. Bring it up as a clean bill by an author from this chamber. Something that we own. Here is the other thing, speaking of procedure. Last I checked, in addition to sneezing correctly in here, you are supposed to be able to go toe to toe with the speaker's general counsel and win to get your bill on our floor. Not lose and still get your bill on our floor. Yeah, I said what I said. Colleagues, I don't like the precedent we are sending here. I actually think it is way bigger than this bill, deeply and sincerely. Again, with all due respect to the amazing policy discussions we are having, the stories we are hearing, the sort of moving stories of victims that we are going to continue to hear about today. It should not have to take somebody from the minority party and a woman to stand up here and say, you know what, we are going to protect our honor and our dignity in this chamber. It should not have to be me saying this. It should not have to be me saying we should be protecting our staff and drawing this red line. And I am deeply, deeply disappointed to see this bill on our floor. I really, really thought we were better than this. At some point we have to have a red line. And I hope as you hear about the policy, you think about the policy, you consider it. I hope you also think about the bigger picture of what it means to pass this bill today. Thank you Madam Speaker, I yield the bill. The lady has yielded the well. The chair recognizes Chairman Jasper's to speak for the bill. And I would like to ask Chairman Jasper to give us a little bit of a quick introduction to the bill. We are going to talk about prevention a lot here in the last little bit. It is common to be used here. It is where the higher levels of government tell the lower level what they can do what they can't do. They can tell county school systems, law enforcement and on and on what they have to do. As a member said earlier, we are the lawmakers, so we do get that opportunity to do that. These bills are hotly debated in preemption. The cities and counties do try to defend their role, but we get to make the decision. Chairman Powell said a few moments ago, we passed preemption on second amendment rights years ago. And we have adjusted our laws many times over the years, making them better. Making them better for Georgia citizens and making for sure, and one thing that has been my goal over these years is to make sure that they can't carry a weapon where they choose to and they don't have to store it in their car. And we worked very hard to do that. I am very supportive of this bill. And I think we get lost in some of all the rhetoric, but the important part about this is that a Georgian when he goes into my town, your town, any town knows how to act, knows how to carry their weapon, knows where to put it, knows where to not do it, nor they can't go, and where they can't go. It makes it clear and uniform laws. And I hope you vote for this and join Chairman Powell and the University of support our second amendment rights. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman is yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. There is a minority report and the chair recognizes representative Evans for the minority report. Good afternoon, colleagues. I rise in opposition to Senate Bill 204. Now we know state law preempts nearly any local gun rule regulation ordinance or resolution. That's already true. We don't have to do anything to change that. Local laws relating to guns are only allowed in the areas where we say they can exist. And in this bill we're adding storage laws to the list of things where we are not going to allow a city to regulate. So without this bill local governments have been able to regulate storage laws, for example, like requiring folks to lock their car doors if they have a gun inside so they won't get stolen and commit a crime. And others have talked to you about why that's a bad idea not to allow those kinds of common sense laws by local governments. But I want to spend a little bit of time talking about another problem with this bill that we haven't talked about yet, I don't think. This bill, if you look with me at lines 81, this bill says that anyone, I'm not going to quote, who is or has been subject to or aggrieved by a rule regulation ordinance or resolution that they think is in violation of the limits that this legislature set on laws that local governments can set can haul city officials to court to defend those laws. Now let me say that again. You don't have to be aggrieved by a local law. You just have to be subject to it. And you don't even have to be subject to it. You could have been subject to it in the past. You could have moved. You never got fined. You never got arrested. You never got charged. You just think the local government has passed a law that goes beyond the preemption and you want to make somebody prove it. You haul them into court. This bill allows you to do it. Old law didn't do that. Old law said you had to be aggrieved. This bill does not say that. You don't have to be damaged. You can bring them in for injunctive relief. There's two sections about how you haul them into court. One for injunction. One for damages. So just again, you don't have to be charged. You don't have to be arrested. You don't have to be fined. You don't have to be convicted. You don't even have to live there anymore. You just have to think that one of these laws goes too far and you want to bring the city official in to account for it. That seems like a lot. We're setting up a system where a person who is or did live in a jurisdiction where a local law was passed can haul city officials in to make them defend the law. And there's no place in this law that says if the city official was hauled in and they found that the law was just fine, that the city gets paid back. No, no. Think about the advocacy groups in this state or across the country that would love to gin up residents or former residents just to make them prove it. Y'all know I'm right. This is going to chill local governments from doing even what we allow them to do. But I do want to talk about storage again for just a moment. As I said, when I started, this law would add gun storage as an area where we are not going to allow local governments to try. Now this house had a priority this year and at least last year and probably before that too to make encouraging of storage of guns safely a priority. Let me say that again. This house had a priority to encourage the safe storage of guns. We passed House Bill 79 this year, 165 to 8. Last year we passed a bill House Bill 971, 162 to 3. Most of those bills would have provided a tax credit for gun owners who bought a safe storage device. Our priority, the House's priority was to encourage safe storage under this bill when a local government does exactly what we wanted to do. Encourage safe storage they're going to get sued and not even have to be by anybody who's been damaged by it. This is not our priority, y'all. Our priority is the opposite. This is the Senate's priority. The Senate didn't pass our bill last year, obviously. They didn't pass it this year to add insult to injury. They got it in. They don't care about our priorities but somehow we are chopping at the bit to grab theirs and not just any Senate priority but a Senate priority lead sponsor, the Senator who disrespected this House over and over, our current informer speakers sued our staff, essentially spit in our face any chance he got. And we're like, give me what he wants. I want to do that. They got our bill. We pick up theirs. This first section, Senate Bill 163 is Colton Moore's bill. This is not anyone else's bill. This is his bill. So once again, we yield to other priorities, not ours. I'm going to close with this because I'm reminded of a song. I won't sing but I'm going to talk about the song. It reminds me of a song by the late great Toby Keese. I want to talk about me. I want to talk about me. I want to talk about I. I want to talk about number one, oh my, me, my, what I think, what I like, what I know, what I want, what I see. I like talking about you, you, you, you, usually. But occasionally, I want to talk about me. Occasionally, can it be about the house? Does it always got to be about the Senate or somebody else? They ignored our priorities on storage for multiple years. And now we just pick up their priority from someone who disrespects this body every chance he gets. I just don't get it, y'all. Please join me in vote, no. I yield. The lady is yielded the well. The chair recognizes Representative Willis to speak for the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Good afternoon colleagues. Arise today in opposition to Senate Bill 204. This bill, as originally drafted by the Senate Minority Leader, was really good bill. Originally aimed at procedural criminal justice reform. It's quite simply has been hijacked to undermine local authority. And I don't know about you, but I stand with my local leaders and not against them. And for me, that's the city of Atlanta and that's Fulton County. This substitute allows individuals to sue local governments for regulating weapons. And the weapons carrier can file a lawsuit and recover damages and attorney's fees. Opening the floodgates to harassment lawsuits against not only city councils, but law enforcement. Now what works in your county may not necessarily be best for mine. And in Atlanta and Fulton County, we're doing something right. So nationally ranks number four in the nation for economic development. We do. All right. So hold up. Wait a minute. If y'all thought I was finished, we've spent the bulk of this legislative session hearing about how frivolous lawsuits are running people and businesses out of Georgia. That they are the bane of our existence. And yet less than a week later, once again, we are presented with the bill that sets the stage for what actually sounds magnetic for more lawsuits. But go off. How will we defend taxpayer funded lawsuits from anyone who says their gun rights were

Franched by city ordinance. So who are we? Who are we as a state body to continue to reach into localities, to dictate to them what we feel is proper? What message does this send to any mayor or to a city council? William Haslet once said that the only vice that cannot be forgiven is hypocrisy. Elected local officials should regulate public safety. And we should stay in our lane. And we should stay in our lane. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of time to the gentle lady Westbrook of Savannah's 163rd District. Thank you. The lady is yielded the well and the chair recognizes Representative Westbrook to speak on the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. And good afternoon colleagues. I rise today in strong opposition to Senate Bill 204 because it retaliates against the duly elected leadership of the city I represent and against my constituents themselves. It makes Georgia's communities less safe. And it violates the public policy that this body communicated to Georgians that we value, which is safe firearm storage. This is not a reinforcement bill. This is a retaliation bill. It was Fulton County's turn on Wednesday. I guess it's Savannah's turn today. But I'm here to speak for my community. This is a Franken bill. It started out as a perfectly good bill. And it was hijacked. Hijacked by a far right senator who I am confused as to why this body wants to carry his water, but that's apparently what we're going to do. This senator openly stated that he was targeting the ordinance passed by my city council despite the fact that he represents a district nowhere near my district. There are suburbs of Chattanooga basically, but he wants to tell us how we need to handle our business in Savannah. I represent a district that is mostly comprised of in town neighborhoods within the city of Savannah. It is a dense urban district made up of some affluent neighborhoods and also some neighborhoods that still show the persistent, lingering effects of segregation, of underinvestment, of poverty. And social science data and criminology data tell us that in districts that are suffering from those persistent, lingering effects of our past sins, that there are challenges. And some of my district has those challenges. Food insecurity, housing insecurity, lack of access to quality education, lack of access to good jobs, lack of access to childcare. And so we have some challenges and safety can be one of those in my district. So on top of considering the needs of civilians, all civilians, we've got an additional challenge. We are a district, we are a city that is visited by people from all over the world, from all over the US and from all over the state of Georgia. And we have to worry about them too and we do. But we welcome them. We ask them to come and walk our squares and eat our seafood, including the Georgia shrimp. We've done so much to promote and protect in this chamber. We ask them to have a good time, eat, drink, be merry. All we ask, all we ask is after you have enjoyed yourself, when it's time for you to go home, please do not leave our community less safe than you found it. Tell me what is unreasonable about that. We have an ordinance. It does not contrary to some of the misinformation that you heard earlier. It does nothing to people who lock their cars, nothing. All our ordinance asks is if you bring your guns to town, and Johnny Cash said you shouldn't do that, we don't go that far. If you bring your guns to town, lock them in your car if you leave them. Just lock them in your car. That's it. In Georgia, you can take them everywhere. You all made that available. You can take them in a restaurant, you can take them in a bar and have a few drinks. You can take them with you. If you leave them in your car, lock your car. It's not that hard, y'all. This is a particular issue for our district. I know y'all think that we need to make all the rules up here and just tell all the cities how to do it, but my city's not like your city. My city's not like your town. My city is not like the 2000 strong and population town of the senator who filed this bill. Our issues are different. We have a dense urban plan. It's why people love to visit us. We've got sidewalks right next to on-street parking and we have a problem with people walking down those sidewalks and trying car door after car door after car door. Which one is going to be unlocked? Which one can I pop in too quickly and see if I can find a gun line right there? That is what they are looking for. Every time I go to a neighborhood meeting in my district, every single time we start with a public safety report and a Savannah Police Department officer stands up and says to the neighbors, please lock your car. Please lock your car if you leave a firearm in it. Every single time we get that request. In 2024, 266 guns were reported stolen from vehicles in Savannah. Of those 266, 228 were stolen out of unlocked vehicles. 86%. Again, we're just asking that people lock their cars. I'll also mention, our ordinance also protects you when you visit our city. It protects you from being victims of theft. Once your firearm is stolen, you've lost your personal property. You can't use it for protection. You can't use it for anything at all. A thief can. The thief who gets your gun, they get to use it, but you don't get to use it anymore. Some of you are so worried about a propaganda's government that is coming for your guns. You are actually up here fighting a local government trying to help you hang on to them. Make it make sense. For my constituents and me, our ordinance also protects us. It protects us from what can happen when a gun, which is otherwise just a tool in an object. For what can happen when that gets in the wrong hands? When that happens, my community now has yet another firearm in the hands of someone who did not buy it from a federally licensed firearms dealer and did not go through a background check. To state the obvious, if someone is willing to steal a gun by definition, they are not law abiding. They probably don't have a lot of reservations about using it for another unlawful purpose or selling it to someone else who wants to use it for an unlawful purpose. Someone who cannot just walk into a gun shop and pass it back ground check. That is what my city's leaders were trying to address to keep our people safe. Savannah passed this ordinance on April 11th of last year. It has not even been a year. I may first test plaintiff had been found to sue the city of Savannah. So much for cracking down on frivolous lawsuits. This test plaintiff was not a citizen of Savannah, had never been cited pursuant to the ordinance. He basically said, I don't have power locks and it's just too much effort for me to walk around to the other side of my car and lock the door so that y'all can be safe. Just couldn't muster up the effort. In November of last year, his lawsuit was dismissed because he had suffered no injury. In fact, that will change if you all pass this law. Any lack standing to bring the suit for the lawyers know about standing and probably a lot of y'all do too, but quite literally it's just not his business. Essentially what the court was saying. The people whose business it is, my constituents, they are not suing the city council that passed this ordinance. They are electing and re-electing them. Savanians are not suing their city over this ordinance because they welcome it. They know it's needed. They are tired of having the debates on their neighborhood Facebook pages. Every city dweller in Georgia knows this. What was that sound? Gunshots or fireworks? When irresponsible people shoot into the air in rural parts of Georgia, the bullets come down on pine trees. When irresponsible people do that in our metro communities, they come down on roofs. They come down on hoods of cars. Ask me how I know about that particular one. Sometimes they even come down on people. What works in Y'all's area might not work in my area. My constituents are living with the real costs of this. The costs of how unwilling Y'all are to ask gun owners who you have assured us are all completely responsible people to perform the simplest tasks related to safety and responsibility. This bill also violates the expressed public policy we told Georgians that we hold. When we passed the safe storage tax credit, we told Georgians that safe storage of firearms is something that we value. I think it's worth remembering a little bit about the history of that bill. That was an idea brought by one of my democratic colleagues. Some of Y'all kind of got the idea. That was a pretty good bill. By the time we passed it, your names were all over that bill. One of your caucus was the author. Your names were in the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spot. Some of Y'all during the last campaign season went back to your districts and you told your constituents and your voters that you care about safe storage. I hope that's true because we're about to find out in just a few minutes. We're about to find out how much Y'all value that. We're about to find out if you care about safety for Georgians or if you care about appeasing extremists. I'll tell you I've got a bad feeling that when we adjourn tonight, the only legislation the General Assembly will have passed to address the number one killer of Georgia's children and teens is one that makes it easier for people to sue cities that try to pass safe storage. My time is running out. There are a lot of things we could do on this issue. We could pass background checks. They cut every category of gun violence in half. They cut trafficking down. My city is also near on 95. Kind of important for the iron pipeline of gun trafficking. There are so many things we could do we have not done. But Y'all want to micromanage local governments instead. You said you've done things to make it better. What you've done is you passed guns everywhere. You've decimated our permit carrying system. The only real background checks system we had. You have failed to keep Georgians safe and your voters are going to watch and they are going to hold you accountable if you go after cities today instead of living up to what you said were your values of safe storage for Georgians. Thank you Madam Speaker. I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. For what purpose does representative park rise? Thank you Speaker Pro Tem. I move that the rule substitute to Senate bill 204 be laid on the table. The minority whip has made the motion that the bill be laid on the table. All those in favor will is their objection. There is objection. All those in favor of laying the table on the table vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Mr. Clerk were you locked the machine on the gentleman's motion to table? The motion is failed. The A's are 75 the A's are 95. Moving on to chair's time we have up to 25 minutes for chairman's time. 20 minutes I apologize. 20 minutes. House will come to order. Have up to 20 minutes for the chair's time. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith has recognized to speak to the proposition. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon members of this I will just buddy. I am going to end up yielding some time to some other members on list but I will point something out here that is very important. Not one. Not one person in opposition to this legislation pointed out where the home rule statutes allow a city to circumvent not only this issue before us but any issue. I will call to your remembrance from municipalities at least those are a creation of this body and if they are circumventing the laws of this state it needs to be corrected. I don't know if you all pay attention but we are a meat grinder down there in 132 a lot of times. If we find something that is preempted by federal code we do are darned us to make sure that is taken out of the bill. That would be very nice if municipalities and counties would pay us the same courtesy. I get aggravated with it all the time. It just puts a bur under my cell. I have got some simple advice here. Those cities and counties worried about litigation. If you don't attempt to circumvent state law you won't have to worry about being sued. Easy motion to dismiss. With that, Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield the remaining bouts of my time to the majority later this House in Chairman Powell. Leader, if strish is recognized to speak to the bill you will allocate the remainder of the time with Chairman Powell. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of Senate Bill 204. I want to go through some of the arguments that were made by the minority party when the bill was being debated in Chairman's time. But ultimately this is an affirmation of our strong and unwavering support of the Second Amendment. And this legislation ensures that Georgians are protected from government overreach that Georgians are able to remain under the blanket of public safety by being able to defend themselves. And that ultimately when we have circumstances where local governments are taking action contrary to our preemption laws that there are consequences in place in code to address it. Now, at the heart of Senate Bill 204 there is a clear principle. The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, not by Congress and not by a state and certainly not by a local government, a county or municipal government. Georgians should be able to know that as they travel to different parts of the state, be it Savannah or any other location, that their right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Now recent actions by the city of Savannah's liberal government have placed those rights in jeopardy, leaving lawful gun owners open to punishment simply because a criminal breaks into their, say, vehicle and steals a firearm. Now just think about that for a minute. If a criminal breaks into my vehicle and steals my glock and I call the police to respond and then I'm the one arrested, it's outrageous. We already have preemption to protect Georgian Second Amendment rights in the code. And when that is being circumvented, it's necessary that we update the law to address that. Now getting into the specifics which were raised, yes, there are paths here that can be sought. If a person is subjected to or grieved by these kinds of local government, acts, rules, regulations, ordinances, that they would have options. There would be the ability to seek a petition for mandamus or seek injunctive relief from the court to ask that this violation of their rights is addressed in a courtroom. But then there is also a damages option. If they have suffered as a result of the action of local government, they would be able to go to court and very clearly it is specified the damages that they could seek, including attorney's fees. And if it's necessary to pursue that through an appellate path, liquidated damages that would ensure recovery under those circumstances. This bill doesn't just preempt local overreach now or potentially in the future. It empowers citizens and it allows lawful weapons carriers to bring legal action against a local government or local office that violates this section of the law. That's not just good law. It's good constitutional stewardship for Georgians. Using their constitutional rights from being infringed at the local level and giving them a clear path to address it in their court system. Colleagues, this legislation is about more than just firearms. It's about the rule of law. And it's about ensuring that Georgians are not subjected to the whims of local politics. It's about honoring our oaths, my view, to adhere to the U.S. Constitution, which could not be more explicit in the right of the people to keep and bear arms. We have an opportunity today. We have an opportunity to stand together, to vote in favor of Senate Bill 204, to protect the rights of our citizens, to speak clearly where others so confusion, and to affirm that in Georgia, the Constitution and the Second Amendment still means what it says. And Mr. Speaker, I yield the wealth. I yield the remainder of the time to Chairman Powell. Chairman, Ireland Powell has recognized to speak to the bill for the remainder of the chair's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. You know, I didn't think this was going to be an easy task. And I heard a lot of what is. I've heard some things and comments made by the opponents to this bill. And I understand politics. This hasn't got anything to do with most of the old's minds in opposition about what's right, or about what preemption really means to the law. You've heard some of the skilled jurists, Chairman Powell, Smith, leader of the administration, talk about what law is really about and about the need. And that's the need that we have structure. I heard comments from some of the distinguished members of the minority party today, but most of all of it was about their opposition to the Second Amendment. I don't think I heard a whole lot about the preemption, but it was about their opposition. I heard some comments that were hurtful to me, but I hear people talk about and quote the tragedy of Appalachia and try to compare it to this. Shame on you. Shame on you because there's not a soul in this building that would ever try to mix those two subjects. I see it, but I see the politics of this, ladies and gentlemen. It's all about what we want. It's about a political position that I'm opposed to the Second Amendment. There's a proper way to do that. There's a proper way. Let me tell you a little bit. I've sat down and I thought about the preemptions. So if you think, for those of you all who think that local governments should be able to preempt the law, so let's talk about the Bill of Rights. Let's talk about freedom of speech. Let's talk about freedom of religion. What if somebody didn't want a mosque? What if they didn't want a synagogue in their district? What if they didn't want to allow women the right to vote? And they just passed a preemptive law. That's what preemptions about it. What about the civil rights law? What about the civil rights law? I'm a realtor. What about the fair housing? We got a lot of people that have concerns about fair housing. But what if some local jurisdiction passed laws against the fair housing act or redlining? I deal with this a lot of times in my professional life. And I have to stand up and actually leave before I can even listen to that kind of talk about preempting because my professional business license would be in jeopardy. So I want to talk about that preemption. And those of you all who want to talk about the second amendments and the need to ban this or to ban that, then mobilize your forces and go after it. This is more about preemption. Yes, I am a strong second amendment supporter. But this is about allowing local governments to step across that line. I heard the good lady talk about shooting guns into the air. There's nothing says you can't discharge a weapon. That's part of the provisions of local government under their codes and all. So when you talk about charging someone for a crime or having a weapon stolen, that is a violation. This isn't got anything to do with frivolous litigation. This is about doing what is right. And I'm going to part with one comment. So every matter before you that you don't do the right thing, then it will come back at some point. Those things that we do that are a violation of somebody's rights, it will come back to you in some other shape form of fashion. Mr. Speaker, there's been a lot of talk about this. We've burned a lot of hours on this or an hour or so. But I would ask the members of this house to vote in favor of this legislation and let's stop this practice. If nothing else, it sends a message that the growing could soo that creeps across a lot of the political subdivisions today that this has got to stop on this subject. And maybe it might have an impact on other subjects. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the time. Gentlemen, as you were the way all that completes the chairman's time, that completes the discussion on Senate Bill 204. Here's any objection with drawing the committee's substitute. Here in under committee's substitute is withdrawn. Here's any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules. Here in under rules, committee's substitute is adopted. Here in the objection to agreeing to report to the committee, which was favorable to the pass to the bill. Here in under committee's agreed to, shall this bill now pass all in favor of the pass to the bill? We'll vote Yes. Those opposed will vote No. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. For what purpose does chairman Petrie rise? Parliamentary and, Mr. Speaker. Statue in court. Mr. Speaker is not true that sadly we have 48,000 firearm deaths a year in the United States, 27,000 of which are suicides and 19,000 of which are homicides that exponentially more than that. Guns are used in the prevention of crime over 2.5 million times a year including in the instance of 400,000 life threatening crimes avoided by the protection and the defense of use of firearms. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Have all members now voted?

Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the pass to Senate Bill 204, the A's of 99, the names are Nays of 74, Bill Harenstead of Request Constitutional Majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you be decaptioned to Senate Bill 179? Will I take to tell that one second, Mr. Clerk? I'm going to have this body recognize the former dean of this house, a man who served this state, who served health care in New State and was recognized for that service a few days ago from the great city of Columbus, Georgia, our dear friend, the house's friend whose portrait graces the front of this building as you walk in. Member of the former Representative the Chairman Calvin Schкой speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, another very distinguished guest that's blessed us here on day 40 is the mayor of one of the greatest cities in America, our own capital city, the city of Atlanta, Mayor Andre Dickens, Mayor Glad to have you. We appreciate you taking time to come over. You've always been our friend and we're glad to be your friend. Thank you so much for what you do. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 179-179? Senate Bill 179 by Senator Dickens, into the 45th and others to be titled. Next to men, Chapter 2, a tunnel 20, the Fishercoded, Georgia, annotated relating to elementary and secondary education. So it was required that the academic and disciplinary records of each transferring student shall be provided by such students' previous school to the receiving school within five days. This bill emits for the Committee on Education, that committee recommends a disbilled doo pass by committee substitute. We're representing Bethany Ballard, is recognized to present Senate Bill 179, Remstany Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As colleagues, it often happens at this time of the year, the title of the original title of the bill doesn't really have anything to do with what's actually in the city. We're representing the bill. We subbed a language in an education committee and it was vetted by the House Education Committee, so we don't have to worry about that. This bill requires students to take a computer science class or a CTAE course embedded with computer science beginning in the 2031-31-32 school year. It changes the reimbursement cost of tuition for the Georgia virtual school because that has not been adjusted since 2012. It requires private online virtual schools to report enrollment to the student's home school district, and this is for purposes of keeping up with attendance so that we can get a handle on this chronic absenteeism policy. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill, and I will yield for any questions. Lady, has no questions. Thank you. I ask your favor consideration. I yield the well. Lady, have no questions. Representative Queen is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Queen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. Today, I rise in strong support of Senate Bill 179, because as a teacher, I see firsthand how quickly our world is changing. And how urgently we need to ensure our students are ready to meet that change head on. This bill is about preparing Georgia students not just for graduation, but for a life in a digital, fast-moving world. SB 179 makes computer science a graduation requirement, starting with the class of 2037. I can't believe I just said that out loud. I want to be clear, this is not just about learning code. So when we think about computer science, we think about C++ and Java, it's not just that. It is about learning how to think. It is about logic, creativity, resilience, and the ability to approach problems from multiple angles. Whether a student wants to go into agriculture, arts, or medicine, these skills are essential. But right now, less than half of 1% of Georgia high school graduates have taken a computer science course, and as an educator, I find this deeply concerning. Our students are growing up, surrounded by technology, but they don't understand how it works, or how they can shape it instead of being shaped by it. Meanwhile, thousands of jobs in our state are going unfilled because we lack workers with the necessary tech skills. Computer science is no longer just for tech companies. It's for farmers using data to increase crop yields. It's for nurses navigating electronic health records. It's for small business owners using e-commerce platforms to grow. Digital literacy is essential, and computer science is the foundation. I have seen students light up from STEM lessons when they realize that they can build something real from nothing but an idea and a keyboard. It's powerful. That is the kind of empowerment this bill provides. It tells every student in Georgia, you belong in this future and you can build it. SB 179 also understands that access matters. It allows students to take the required course any time between grades 8 through 12. It counts towards their math credit, science credit, CTAE credit, fine arts, world languages, or any lector credit. Students don't have to choose between learning of vital skill and completing graduation requirements, giving them the flexibility to pursue their passions while still gaining the tools they need. It also increases funding for Georgia virtual school, raising the tuition cap so more students, especially in rural or underserved areas, can take quality computer science courses online. That's critical because where students live should never live, sorry, should never determine the opportunities that they have. Just as important, this bill invests in teachers. It funds professional development grants to help educators become certified to teach computer science regardless of their background. Because we know our students can't succeed if we don't also invest in the people who are facilitating the instruction in the classroom. Technology is evolving at lightning speed. If you had told this chamber 20 years ago that we'd one day have platforms that can generate life-like images, answer complex questions in seconds, or even help write some of our speeches. I think many of us would have laughed. The pace of change can feel overwhelming even for us. And that's exactly why we must invest in preparing students not to just keep up, but to lead. With the rise of tools like chat GBT and other AI platforms, it's clear these technologies aren't a passing trend, they're shaping the future. And Georgia students need to understand how they work because they're not going away. They're here to stay. Colleagues, this is about readiness. It's about equity. It's about economic development. But more than anything, it's about our kids. Every single one of them deserves a shot at a future where they're not just surviving, but thriving. A future where they have understands that the world they live in and have the skills to unchange it. I urge your support for SB 179. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, ladies. You're the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report of the committee's agreed to shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, we unlock the machine. Thank you. Thank you.
