We gonna do. Go anywhere. All members, all members please come to the floor. All members. The hour for convenient having arrived, all members will please come to the floor and take their seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? All members, all members will please come to the floor and take their seats please. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted while you're voting. I want to remind you of something. Check it out. As you all are aware, the house rules were brought to the trophy home, Mr. Wepp. We really whipped up on the Senate. We all did good work. We had the best cheerleaders. That was across the finish line. It was a great day to be a house member like every day is. So thank you all for everyone who participated yesterday, whether you want to signline cheering and expecting and encouraging our members to do their best and they did. So the Senate was extremely overwhelmed by the house presence as they are on most occasions. No doubt about that. All members have voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Doors keep us? Will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from down in the 157th House District, Representative Bill Workiser. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is an honor for me to introduce my pastor, Brandon Newell, with him. He's got some guests, but as toddlers will often do, they're down in office watching. So Brandon's family, his wife, his wife graces with him today, as well as his father-in-law, Jimmy Gimerson, along with their two children, Grayson and Ray. Brandon started his education at shorter college, then went to New Orleans, the illogical Baptist seminary, and served churches in Tampa, and Douglas Phil, Georgia. He's been our pastor for the last two years, and has done a tremendous job. Love what he does, and not being the traditional first Baptist, but trying to reach people of all walks in life, and has done a great job and expanded our ministry. And so it's my pleasure to have my pastor here today, Brandon Newell. Thank you. Good morning. This morning, I would like us to look at Hebrews 4, verse 14. Hebrews is a book written to a people who had a great understanding of the scriptures. Throughout Hebrews up to this point, we have seen things that Jesus is superior to angels, that Jesus is our high priest, that we must be sure not to disobey and lack belief, because if we lack belief, we will not enter God's promise rest to those who believe. For the Israelites and the wilderness, that rest was found in God's presence and the promised land, Canaan. For us, that rest is found in God's presence and the promised land, heaven. And light of all this, we find ourselves at the end of chapter 4 of Hebrews. Hebrews 4, 14 says this. Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. When we see the word, therefore, in scripture, what we must ask is what is therefore. Hebrews 4, 14 is therefore actually links back to Hebrews 2, which expounds a great deal about Jesus being our high priest, and while we did not read Hebrews 2 today, I encourage you in your free time to go read it. What exactly is a high priest? A high priest is someone who makes intercession for himself and for others. He offers sacrifices and makes sure that people can be in good standing before good and holy God. We saw in Hebrews chapter 2 that Jesus is our high priest who made intercession for us. This is good news for both those who are lost and those who are found. Those who are lost now have an opportunity in Jesus to have Jesus plead their case before the Lord and to be forgiven of their sins so that many may enter into fellowship with God forever. Those who already have trusted in Jesus Christ now have Jesus our high priest, prayerfully interceding on our behalf to God the Father. In regards to those who have not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, this passage gives beautiful imagery of what Jesus has done for us. Romans 3.23 says that all of sin and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 6.23 tells us that the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ, our Lord. Romans 5.8 tells us that at just the right time Jesus Christ died for the ungodly. Remember what a high priest does? That's right. They make sacrifices on behalf of the people so that they may be in good standing before the Lord. Now those high priests would make blood offerings that would last for a season and would have to be done again. However, Jesus our great high priest has made a once and for all offering himself. And this offering he made is not a seasonal offering or temporary offering but an everlasting offering that is completely satisfied the wrath of God for all eternity. Jesus died for you and for me so that we could dwell with God forever. Romans 10.9 says if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Friends, it is not my responsibility to make you believe in Jesus. It is simply my responsibility to tell you about him. He is our great high priest who loved us enough to offer himself so that we may spend eternity with our maker. I hope you will trust in him. Would you stand with me as we pray together? Father, thank you for your mercies that are new every single morning. I thank you for these men and women you have appointed. What a privilege it is to come boldly before your throne to make our request known to you. In a moment you are going to lead us, Lord, by your Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that you would as we have read this text illuminated to us. Your word is living and breathing. Have your way in our hearts today, Lord. Convict us where we need to be convicted, edify us where we need to be built up. Whatever it is you would like to say us, say to us, help our hearts be receptive to you, Lord. In Jesus' name, amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and honor. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you, Brother Newell, for that devotion. We appreciate you and your family making the long journey from Glenville all the way up here. Do our keepers. You may open the doors. Members, you may join Brother Newell in the south any room. And welcome here, for giving them thanks for being here today and ministering to us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Members, our doctor of the day was invited to join us by Representative Billy Mitchell. Thank you. Did you know that? Good work. Dr. Dominic Mack. Dr. Mack is downstairs. If you need some help and need to visit with the physician, he will be down in the aid room downstairs. So go down and join Dr. Mack and we appreciate him serving us today.

Representative Cameron, what is that? I'm from Turkey. Oh yeah, I thought that's what that was. We love Bucky's members. Vignature attention please. We're going to have another invite resolution. Okay members, we need your attention just for a moment before I recognize. Representative Ballard. Will you read the resolution house resolution 504? If you read the caption. House resolution 504 by Representative Ballard to the 147th, ticky the 134th part of the 5th, to low to the 167th, the crew of the 118th and others, a resolution recognizing March 20th, 2025, is Bucky's day at the state capital and celebrating Bucky's and its presence in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Clerk, I recognize Representative Bethany Ballard to speak to the resolution, Representative Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Happy Bucky's day, y'all. Before I get started, you should all have giddy bags that were delivered to your offices. They're not on your desks in here, but in your offices. So, look for those. I'm proud today to recognize Richard Sebastian, Senior Director of Operations, Josh Smith, Michael Buie, and most importantly, Bucky. Bucky. The Warner Robbins Bucky's was the first Bucky's in Georgia. It's now how I give directions to my house. You get off at the Bucky's exit and turn left. It's got 120 gas pumps and the cleanest bathrooms around, if you know that, if you've been there. More than that, though, Bucky's is a valued community partner. They have great jobs, great benefits, and it's a place for people to eat and gather. It is the place to be on a Houston County Friday night after football games. All the teenagers go because what do you need at 11 o'clock? You need slushies and candy. And beef jerky. Georgia currently has two Bucky's locations, one in Warner Robbins, one in the Calhoun area. Two more are coming in Brunswick and Monroe County. I am honored today to present the Bucky's team with this resolution, honoring their commitment to Georgia and recognizing them for all the great things they do in our communities. I'm not going to read it all, but I will read one part of it. Whereas Georgia travelers and travelers through Georgia deserve a safe, well-lit place to stop, shop, refuel, and rest. And they can happily say, meet me at Bucky's 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Thank you. We can get pictures later. I know you will all want pictures in the anarium in just a few minutes. And Mr. Sebastian, if you would like to come up and squeeze up and say, if you want to present this to you. On behalf of Bucky's, I just wanted to say thank you. We are currently in nine states, and you're the first state that has done this for us. So thank you, Georgia. And based on our results, the Warner Robins in Calhoun, and I'm sure a new Brunswick starting August 4th, I can sum it up in three words. Bucky's loves Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. And Georgia loves Bucky's. No doubt. So thank you all for y'all's presence in our state. You're at a lot to us, and we most certainly appreciate you. Members, you may join our representative baller to our friend, some Bucky in the south any room, and get some pretty cool photos there. We appreciate y'all. Okay, members, here's our posture. We have a whole slew of morning orders. And I know there are a lot of good folks in the gallery that we need to recognize. So this is where we're going to do. We're going to give the first one. We're going to give the first one a little bit longer because it's very, and I want members to pay attention and stand, if you will. When I recognize you, don't stand yet. I'm going to recognize Chairman Stevens. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to set the timer at 45 seconds. The lights going off at 45, your mic will go off at one minute. So you need to get it done when you get up there and certainly give adequate recognition to our friends in the gallery. We could be here till midnight. All right, members, please stand. All members, please stand. All conversations will cease. Allow our guests to enter the any room. Doorkeepers, will you encourage our guests to move into the any room? Okay, we can hold them right there. We just need to cease any conversations. Chairman Stevens is recognized for a new morning order. It's very important. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House. Today you may remember back December, first part of December. We had the death of a very fine friend of mine, Mr. Steve Minsky. We have his family here today and a lot of folks that are here in the film industry. You might recall way back in 2005, Chairman Perish, over here started this ball rolling down the hill and rolling up the hill sometimes for this industry. And Steve Minsky is with the Tyler Perry Studios. He's got a lot of folks here from the Tyler Perry Studios as well. But I specifically wanted to mention their family. Danali, if you will, is his wife is here. And I think she's coming over from the Senate. And of course the two three children as well. If you will, just I want to get a representative carpenter, Chairman Carpenter, say a word or two as well here as chairman of that committee. Tom Taylor, of course, is the chairman of that subcommittee as all this stuff went through. Steve Minsky is a very honorable man. And I'd like to just turn it over to it's chairman. Thank you, Chairman. A huge loss for filming the state of Georgia. An advocate for all, not just himself and his in the studio. He represented but the industry as a whole. And if you ever knew him, a true gentleman, professional. And it's a great loss for the state of Georgia and a great loss for his employer. If I can, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Speaker, again, Danali is here, Charles, Adelena, both the twins and Josephine and with their family. But with the family of the film industry and for those of you that made all this happen, as you see, Steve and his family appear. Can we just have just one moment of silence please? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Steve. And members. Steve was a fine, fine man. A good husband and father. And you saw the photo of his family that was when they were here last year. He certainly is missed in the industry with his colleagues there. But he's also missed as a family man. And as a great member of our community here in Georgia, a great citizen. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family. As they continue to deal with the loss of a dear family member and a good, good man. Thank you members. You all may be seated. All right, here we go. I'm going to give you the first two rips and comings. Rips and baseball and rips and your two, base more and your two on deck. 45 seconds. Cut off for the minute. So, respect your other colleagues and give everyone plenty of time. With the members of the Maybelton delegation, the co-delegation, please walk down quickly. I'd like to welcome today the citizens of Maybelton. Will you please stand? Maybelton, as you know, was a new city that started with voting. It was voted in 2022. And for the past two years, they have been doing a lot of work to come into fruition and to get everything in place. I don't see the mayor up there by congratulating everyone's hard work. And yes, we will be on time for getting all the services in place. So, happy Maybelton day. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Cummins. Welcome folks from Maybelton. What a cool name. I'm the best names on the Maybelton. That's all right. Thanks for being here. Thanks for what you're doing in your city. Rips and your baseball.

Why can't I have to get started? All teachers. Yes. So today, first of all, I want to thank President Joe Biden for having one of our own at the Capitol in DC and recognizing her as the teacher of the year last year. She was recognized at the White House. And I said, wait a minute. She's one of ours. We have to recognize her here and show her the love that we have for her and her teaching and the kids that she touched, the parents and everyone. Appreciate you. And I was going to read your resolution, but I have enough time. But if you can stand up, Kristy, top. Please. And please come down to the Anorone so that we can get pitches with you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Congratulations. That's quite the honor. I'm sure you're doing a great job. Obviously, to get that recognition. So thank you for what you're doing for our students. And congratulations again. Thanks for being with us. Representative Yurder. I recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm here today to recognize the Georgia Forestry Commission for serving the state of Georgia. The Georgia Forestry Commission works diligently to provide leadership services, education, to protect and conserve Georgia's forest resources. The Commission assists public and private land owners and establish practices of prescribed burning and other aspects of help to these timber owners. I want to recognize some folks for some special awards there over here in the gallery to my right. You guys stand up. The Worth County unit was selected. Georgia Forestry Commission is 24 units of the year. For their job, doing helping land owners with fire, break, pile, outing, prescribed burning and other services. The Fan Inns Towns Union unit was selected. Georgia Forestry Commission, 2024 units of the year for community engagement. And Clark Roundtree was selected. Georgia Forestry Commission's wild line firefighter of the year. Camin Lee was selected. Georgia Forestry Commission, forestry of the year. Let's give these guys a big hand. They do a great job, boys. We're representing Lepton. It's recognized in morning order. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Speaker. I'm here to honor a 40-year story here in Atlanta. Moving in the spirit was founded in 1986 and for nearly 40 years has been transforming the lives of Atlanta's youth through dance. This is an award-winning creative youth development program that uses the discipline of dance to help children and teens develop the social, emotional and cognitive skills they need to thrive. In 2005, moving in the spirit was recognized at the White House as one of the top youth development programs in the nation. In 2021, Mitz, as they're affectionately known, opened a $10 million performing arts center at Marta's Edgewood and Candler Park development. And from there, it continues to reach thousands of children, youth and families. I'd like to honor Shalandra Henry, their executive director and Aaron Wellard Dalton, director of marketing and communications for moving in the spirit. Thank you for being here today. Santa, thank you. Welcome to the House. We're glad to have you here. Representative Lim. I'm Steve Marvin Lims, recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Jasmine Clark and I are so happy to welcome Lillburn Middle School here today. And they're actually here not running to catch a bus, so I'd ask them to wave. I think I see them over there. Hi, Mr. Doyne. Now, obviously, and we obviously do not pick favorites among our schools, but we can say how deeply we appreciate Lillburn Middle students who in the past year were recognized as math leaders by the Georgia Department of Education and show growth across all grade levels, no easy feat. And we deeply appreciate their staff with whom I was personally privileged to work in this past year to bring everything from epilepsy training after we in the General Assembly passed SB-45 violence prevention and just this past month programming around body image. Not surprisingly, given LMS's efforts to connect with student needs, they also have had for the third year in a row a finalist for district counselor of the year. So let's give them some love for all their accomplishments. They're right over there. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, we yield the well. Welcome to the House. Representative Butler is recognized, Representative Baker. You can be on deck. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am excited to be here today to commemorate the greatest public health triumph in the 20th century. 70 years ago, the U.S. embarked on a historic public health initiative to eradicate polio and develop the polio vaccine. Much of that work was done right here in Georgia. We had a children of all ages were getting polio. There is no cure for it. It is an infectious disease. And like many infectious diseases, you can't cure it. You have to prevent it. Even a U.S. president had polio and came and made Georgia his second home and benefited from the therapeutic opportunities at the warm springs. This spread across the state, I know I've got a red light, but I want to get the shout out to Augusta, who was the largest repository of iron lungs that were used during that time. Thomasville, who encouraged President Eisenhower to set up the immunization program that was not just statewide, but our nationwide, but worldwide. Today, in the gallery, the person who brought this to our attention and reminded us we needed to remember this is Rich Ward, who has advocated for the past 30 years for children's health in Georgia and is retiring. So I'd like for you to thank him for the work he's done for children's health in Georgia. Thank you for your work and good to have you in house. Ripley Roberts, you're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know I love the repressor to shout out our youths, our leaders of the future. Today is youth takeover of the Capitol. We I want to welcome over 100 young Georgians, including dozens of students from Shiloh High School in Snellville. And you've probably seen many of these young people every day for the last legislative sessions bringing dozens of young people into the Capitol to take part in the work of policymaking and to make their voices heard. What you may not know is that Georgia Youth Justice Coalition now includes over 10,000 members from 97 counties in Georgia. I mean, that is impressive. Can y'all stand whoever's here from GYJC? Jason. Woo! Let's welcome the next generation of Georgia's leaders, right there, y'all. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Welcome to the People's House. That's our future. Representative Park Cannon, while you're up here, you're recognized. Representative Park Cannon is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm excited to welcome some trailblazing Georgia women to the Capitol today. We are celebrating Women's History Month in partnership with the JP Agency. Today, as I say your names, please stand. We have Jamel McKinsey, Mo Clark, Janice Colbert, Sherej Iran, Adrian Gates, Doridan Whitley, my Asian.

They'll come down for taking photos in a minute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Good to have all of you. And thanks for what you're doing, not only in your communities, but for all George and the Reps and E Baker. It's recognizing friend, it's recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to take a moment to recognize an incredible advocate for mental health awareness. Mr. Ramona Bryant, who was seated in the gallery today. Ms. Bryant has dedicated her life to breaking the stigma surrounding mental health through her, know your triggers initiative, which is empowered countless individuals to understand, manage and navigate their mental health challenges. Her advocacy has not only impacted lives here in Douglas County and throughout Georgia, but also internationally in Ghana, where she continues to raise awareness and mental support wellness efforts. Mr. Ramona, we thank you for your unwavering dedication and the difference you are making in so many lives. It is our great honor to present you with this certificate of recognition for your outstanding contributions to mental health advocacy. Members, please join me in welcoming Mr. Ramona Bryant. Thank you, Ms. Prior. Thanks for what you're doing in mental health. Thanks for that morning order. Mr. DeBale has recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being recognized. Colleagues, today is out of the trap day at the Capitol. This movement is about raising above the circumstances you were born into. It is about overcoming impossible odds and transforming survival into success. It is about breaking cycles. It is about building a better future and aspiring others to do so. It is about getting out of the economic trap, the health care trap, the criminal justice reform trap. It is about the systematic trap. Today's theme is out of the trap is about rising above poverty. I would like to honor those in the balcony, if you may stand when I call your name, Big Bank Black, Erica Bill, Easy Hall, Anthony Reed, Sunday Jones, Pascitaria Woodard, Sharp Bates, Michelle Dillard, April Hane, Rashon Hodge, and Dr. Rhyse McCarthy. If you all have any please stand. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, you are the will. Thank you. Welcome to the People's House. Appreciate what you're all getting done. Representing Virginia, to recognize for a morning order. Give the gentleman your attention please. And a goodnight delegation come down. All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. I rise today to recognize the best city in the state of Georgia. The city of Grayson is only the city of Grayson. And I also like to recognize someone that I'm recognizing for the women's month is Mayor Allison Wilkerson. She's in the gallery along with her staff. She is an amazing mayor, not just my mayor, but she's a long life resident of Gwyneth County on City of Grayson. She in 2014 she was elected the first female and second generation mayor of the city. And more so, she serves her community. I'd like to thank her for all she does. And I also share the city with my rep here, Gabe O'Coye. So thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let's recognize her. Please give her a round of applause for being here. And she'll be in the anti-room taking pictures. Thank you, Madam Mayor, for your service. We're glad to have you in the People's House. Call on these guys. They get a lot of good things done anytime you need them. I guarantee you. Representative Williamson in Fleming. And more T-ness. And more T-ness. Thank you, colleagues. And thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. I'd like to recognize Providence Classical Christian School from Newton and Walton counties. If y'all would rise, these fifth graders are learning all about the three legs of government. We're here today at their capital, learning about democracy at a very young age. So, welcome. colleagues, if you don't mind, let's give them a standing ovation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Chastain. And more T-ness. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Yes, ladies. Yes, so thank you for being here. Thank you for coming. And please meet me down the Annie Room for a good picture. Thank you, ladies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you in the well? One house. Good. I'm going to have a look at the next slide. We're going to have a look at the next slide. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to welcome five great young professionals from Harris County. They're on the back row in the gallery. I appreciate them coming for a great visit today at the Capitol. Ladies and gentlemen, they are the future of the state of Georgia. And we're certainly glad to have them. Well, this y'all stand up just a minute. That would be recognized as these five young professionals. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you, members. Appreciate your attention to some important visitors to this. This state Capitol, who means so much to our communities, we really appreciate you bringing them here and recognizing them. We're going to move on to the rules calendar. Move on to the rules calendar. Move it on to the rules calendar, Mr. Clerk. Will you read the caption to Senate Bill 153-153? Senate Bill 153 by Senator Hatcher, the 50th and others to be entitled to amend the fiscal code of Georgia and intended, so it's a revised, modernized correct errors or a mission's in and re-enact the statutory portion of said code as amended and further as the work of the Code Revision Commission. This bill ever referred to the committee. Code revision, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair, Chairman Yard has recognized to present the bill Senate Bill 153, Chairman Yard, give the gentleman your attention please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring you Senate Bill 153. 153 is annual Code Revision bill that revises the code, corrects errors in the code, corrects things that are unconstitutional. This is the work of the Code Revision Committee that presents this and is an annual bill we do. And the most important thing it does is re-enact the code for the state of Georgia. So I ask for your favourable consideration to this bill. You had no questions, the gentleman's asking for favourable consideration, does that mean you're done? Yes, sir. Gentlemen, you yield the well. The gentleman's yielding the well is any objections to the previous question being ordered, hearing none, the previous question is ordered, is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Hearing none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee's agreed to shall. This bill now passed all in favour of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?

Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 252-252? Senate bill 252 by Senator Halpern, 39th and others to be entitled. An act to amend, Chapter 37 and Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated.

This bill, I'm referring to committee on intergovernmental coordination. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Betsy Holland is recognized to present the bill. Representative Holland. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring you Senate bill 252. This is a land conveyance bill. It simply allows for the city of Atlanta to transfer property to Atlanta public schools and vice versa in a no-loss land swap. So there will never never result in a net loss for the exchange. The reason we need this in a general bill is that we have codified that a municipality with over 300,000 people must do this in a general bill. And Atlanta is the one city that has that population. And with that, I will ask for your favorable consideration. I will. He said he was going to ask. You do have a question, is the lady will yield? Yes, I will. Representative, I all Williams to your left has recognized for a question. I know. Take this speaker. Does the lady yield? Of course for my colleague. Sitting here on the front row, I'm just pondering my memory. Is this your first bill? The gentleman may be mistaken while this is my first time presenting a bill in the well, this is the bill of Senator Sonia Halburn. But this is your first time presenting a bill in the well. Yes, sir. You've done an excellent job. Thank you. See you soon. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there are no more questions, I would be happy to yield the well. The lady, let's see. You survived that question. You're doing well. I did have a couple of questions, but you asked them. You did a nice job of presenting the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If you're done, I think they're done with you right now. Excellent. Colleagues, I ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. The lady has used the well. Good job. Good bill.

This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Good job, Representative Holland. We don't see that often, do we? Congratulations! Good work, members. Good work. We're ready to move on to the rules calendar a little bit further. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate Bill 6868? Senate Bill 68 by Senator Kennedy the 18th and others being titled back to a man titles 9 1340 and 51 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to civil practice contracts motor vehicles and torts respectively. So it's required for substantive and comprehensive revisions. Provisions regarding civil practice, evidentiary matters, damages and liability and towards actions. This bill ever referred to the committee on rules that committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative James Berchette is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Burnett, Berchette. Will colleagues, this is for real this time. I rise to speak to you today about Senate Bill 68. And I just got encouragement from chairman of appropriations that if you'll just vote like we did on house bill 68, we'll be fine today. So I know everybody has eagerly anticipated this bill coming to the floor and I'm going to run through what the bill does. And but for a minute I want to just say this to you all. I know that each and every one of you is under a great deal of pressure from folks in the hall and folks back home. But I want to put this in perspective for you. Yesterday this wasn't a law tomorrow. Hopefully it is the law. And guess what's going to happen tomorrow. Sun's going to come up. You're going to say good morning to your kids and your wife. And life's going to go on regardless of what happens here today. So I don't want you guys to take this bill as life or death here. I know you guys are getting significant amount of pressure and I respect each and every one of your positions. Senate Bill 68 had roughly 15 hours of testimony. And I want to thank each and every member of the subcommittee and the chairman for thoroughly vetting this bill. All in all 25 changes were made in the house to the bill. And I'm going to speak to exactly what the bill does. I know there's been a lot of talk about what the bill does. But I'm just going to put it in simple terms for you. I first think these are reasonable revisions to our Civil Practice Act, our Evidentiary Code and then to our premises liability. The changes are as follows. When the Civil Practice Act determines how and when monetary values for non-economic damages can be argued. That's it. That's one section. Another section is when the discovery can begin. That's it. That's what the section does. How long an attorney has to voluntary dismiss, which we are doing, we're moving closer to the federal system. Currently, you can do until the first witnesses sworn in. We're moving to 60 days after an answer. The federal system is upon answer, voluntary dismissal. Next, we're clarifying that attorneys cannot double recover their fees. I don't think I have heard one person articulate an argument why attorneys should get double fees. And I realize I'm arguing against my own profession because I am an attorney. And I don't think it's patently fair for an attorney to recover twice for the same amount of work. Another thing the bill does allows evidence for seatbelts. The best argument I think for this is that it's required by law for folks to wear seatbelts. This allows evidence to come in whether or not a seatbelt was being worn. One of the most substantive changes to our tort provision is determining when negligent search security shall lie. Now there are two provisions within this bill that allow for two doorways or pathways to find whether or not there's a liability. The first one is more, it's more difficult to find liability. But the second one I would argue is almost exactly what the totality of the circumstance is. I think that that is what is going to be utilized by attorneys going forward. And lastly, one of the provisions allows for the actual cost of medical bills to be submitted to the jury as evidence. And that's it. That's what the bill does. This is about how lawyers act in court and then how and when a person can be sought for liability for negligent security. That's it. That's what the bill does. There's no hidden tricks. And I know that we're going to have a lot of testimony about the unfairness of the bill and how we treat victims differently. But I ask you, please, just read the words on the page. And I know it can be discombobulating to read these words because it is a very highly technical bill and it is a lawyer bill. But I'll submit to you folks. This is a bill that makes reasonable revisions to our civil practice act and reasonable revisions to our evidentiary code as well as reasonable revisions to our liability, a third party negligent security liability. And this speaker, that's the bill. And I'll stand for questions. Gentlemen, I have a couple of questions. Let's see. I'll recognize Chairman Warkeye's or to your left for questions. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Would you like to give him a new? I do. Is it not true that just by reducing the threat of excessive litigation, this will encourage businesses to come here and to expand? I know that is the attempt to bill. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker. Representative Smith, your right is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On line 171-171, this is in the seat belt section of the bill. And it talks about if it's a failure, and I'm paraphrasing, a failure to where you seat belt, that insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or go up on your insurance rate. So now we're going to tell insurance in this one instance what they can charge and what they can't charge. Does that open the door that we can do that with other parts of insurance? Well, I hope so, Mr. Representative. It is my intent to seek some sort of regulation upon the insurance company. Can I follow up? Yes. I want to do so. Tell me, with that statement, I'm not a lawyer. With that statement right there being in this bill and that will be the law. So if somebody finds out their insurance goes up, what happens? If I'm not mistaken, that's already the current law, too. This is new language to this section, but it is already the current law. It cannot drop you or cannot increase your coverage because of failure to make where to seat belt. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, for the yield. Representative Darlene Taylor, up the center out to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? How do you? Isn't it not true that by passing Senate Bill 68, we're taking a significant step towards lowering operational costs for our small businesses here in Georgia? I expect that to be true. Gentlemen, yield for one more. Perhaps any judge howard to your right to recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman, yield. I do. Is it not true that allowing jurors to see both billed and paid that this will promote transparency and fairness and warning damages? I think that the gentleman knows what he speaks. I think this is a more fair system allowing for the actual medical bill costs plus whatever is billed. I agree with the gentleman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I expect a good amount of testimony. I'm asking for your favorable consideration for Senate Bill 68. Thank you. Gentlemen, yield to the well. Here's our posture, members. We have those that want to speak that are opposed to the bill. To this measure, we have those that want to speak in favor. And we will have a minority report as well when that time is here. And then we have chairman's time. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to allocate 30 minutes for those opposed. And in 30 minutes for those in favor. And I'm going to allow them to allocate that time amongst themselves as they so see fit. So we'll begin with those opposed. And I'm going to recognize representatives of all Williams to speak to the bill. Reptile Williams is recognized to speak to Senate Bill 68. Reptile Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not my happy small bits since I've been a legislature? Here's a bill that could well have been worked out for the good of both sides. And for some clarifications, those of you who don't know, I spent most of my working life on the small business side of the legend. I started out in property and cabinet insurance many years ago. And I still hold the distinction of having written the two biggest premium policies in the history of Southeast Georgia. I still stand there. I also wrote the biggest life policy ever written. So I've gotten quite a bit of money off insurance companies. But I've heard and also employed 200 people here for three years and transported 50,000 people a month to medical appointments. My liability insurance was pretty huge. 110 vehicles on the road every day. But there are a couple of things. As slightly overused term in Georgia. It's hard working Georgians. I'm talking about hard working, real hard working Georgians today. It bothers me when a hard working dump truck driver who's right handed living in North Georgia.

that loses right off. He bothers me when a hardworking Georgian in Southeast Georgia gets in an accident and is no longer able to work. He bothers me that these people could reach the point where the American dream disappears, not just for them, but for their children. All of a sudden, the child's education is not assured. And maybe they're not eligible for the Zell Mill scholarship, but they want to go to college. All of a sudden, they can't do it. Maybe because when they came out of the hospital and this bill, their medical bills left. It's going to devastate the finances of this family. Now, there are a few words that I have become mesmerized by in my years of development. One of them has been oxymoron. I love that word. And this bill is a perfect example of an oxymoron. Some of the arguments, folks, you can't tell me for 11 street years, you are the best place in this nation to do business. And then, on the next hand, tell me what is the word, assess fool or a hell hole for insurance? So I've heard so many announcements over the last six years of businesses coming to Georgia. I've seen people living better than ever before. This hell hole has not taken three car garages away. This hell hole has not made the standard of living Georgia invivable everywhere in the South. Don't tell me what businesses might do. All I know is they have not left. What are the best friends I have in the world? Has been in business 55 years in Liberty County. He and I have had thousands of conversations and he's never told me his business insurance is too high. He's mentioned the time when his roof got blown off and $12,000 bill and insurance companies settled for $7,000. And he had the rest now, that bothered him. I've spent all this time watching, recruiting companies, all of this country and particularly here in Georgia, trying to bring business to Georgia and the fact of our tort costs are number 10, and the list of 10, there are nine reasons to come to, they're so far down the list. I've never lost the client to this in Georgia. And I've been on the development authority for 25 years. Hundreds of companies that come through and not one of them has said, we're not coming to Georgia because your tort cost is too high. No thing about hard working Georgians, if we talk to them today, 90% of them would not know what in the world tort means of old time. All they wanna know is, am I gonna get a jury? This is gonna be fair. And what do you mean by tort? You telling me I can't get it? Because I'm a hard working Georgian, you don't think my claim is worth X number of dollars because I'm not a member of the country club. I'm just a hard working Georgian, I'm just a farmer. So my recovery is limited. I submit to you hard working Georgians, think the fairest court in this state is a court when you go here with a claim for damages. Because if you're broke and you commit a felony, it's not if you're going to jail, it's how long you're going to jail because you can't afford to law you. But if you're broke and you have a terrible accident that devastates your family, you got a shot of being made surely whole. This has not bothered our progress in Georgia. No, I never heard a discussion about insurance premiums except home owners and car insurance being too high until we made it in the conversation. We sent people the information and they started calling people and people started talking. I served on the board of a solar company. One of the dearest friends I have who happens to be a white conservative Republican. Best man at my wedding in 1978. We differ politically. But guess what? He's never told me his insurance premiums are too high and all of my board meetings. Please don't fall for the rope of dope. It ain't about insurance premiums. Don't be there for, look at it. They only insurance most people who are hard working Georgians have. There's a home owner's policy, a car policy, and a life or a health policy. That's it. This is not for hard working Georgians. This is for good living Georgians who want to live better. Let's deal with this for what it is. And I didn't want to come. My doctor told me not to even show up today. I'm not well. But this is too important. And I will not continue to see hard working Georgians being used just don't billboards and not in the board room. It's time for them to get a little play. Don't take away this shot. Don't let some girl who's been raped not be made whole. Don't let somebody who a multi-aloperator did not secure his property. He can't be sued. Try, you can't be against trafficked. It won't, it won't take away the liability, responsibility to these folks. Folks, let's give it a thought and do something real for once, for hard working Georgians. I just want to speak to you, Louis. Gentlemen, as you are the well-referred of your Roberts, has recognized to speak to the well-referred of your Roberts. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Morning, colleagues. I think it's still morning. I want to start by saying, frankly, to everyone in this room, to all Georgians, our families, our small businesses, healthcare providers, anyone who's insurance premiums have continued to rise over the last few years. I understand your pain. My car insurance went up again a couple months ago. My homeowner's insurance has gone up every year. I run a small business, a boutique law firm, and all of the insurance policies that are required to run it. Those premiums continue to rise. It has taken a toll on all of us and I share your frustration. The proponents of this bill have spent millions of dollars praying on our stress and frustration telling us that this bill will reduce our rates, stabilize our rates, keep providers from leaving the state. It's simply not true. If it were, I'd be down here begging y'all to pass this bill. It would be against my own self-interest, not to. So let me tell you why it won't stop our pain. First, there isn't a single line in this bill that requires insurance providers to reduce premiums, to stabilize them, or even keep offering policies. Second, I asked every advocate for this bill, whether they could guarantee that it would do any of those things. And not a single one said yes. And third, I looked at the evidence in other states who have adopted similar legislation and whether rates came down or even stabilized. I bet you can guess the answer, not a one. In fact, Florida passed tort reform a couple of years ago and their rates have gone up by 30%. And their Republican speaker of the house has launched a fraud investigation into the information provided to their state legislature to prompt them to vote for similar tort reform that has increased, not decreased their citizens' pain. So what is true? I didn't know some of this. Did you know that Georgia ranks fourth in the nation for the number of fatalities involving any vehicle? We rank fourth in the nation for the number of fatalities involving commercial motor vehicles. And we rank first in the nation for violations of drugs and driving under the influence for commercial drivers. Despite these statistics, Georgia's insurance rates and insurance market are competitive. The cost of defending claims in Georgia for insurance companies is actually less than the national average. The insurance industry's own data shows that the average amount of total earned premiums used to defend Georgia claims brought by attorneys is only 3.3%. Less than the national average of 3.7%. Georgia's defense costs are similarly less than the national average for commercial automobile liability and commercial general liability. And Georgia's insurance market is consistent with the comparison states in the US where the nationwide trend is that typically 10 companies constitute the vast majority of the total state market. We've also over the last five years had 21 seller groups that have entered Georgia and 21 that have exited. So bottom line, one come and he comes in, another comes back. So the claim that they're all gonna leave doesn't pass muster. Now let's talk about what's true about our rising premiums. Insurance companies continue to increase premiums on Georgia consumers despite consistently making staggering investment profits off their state provided market. That's because their main revenue source isn't from us paying our premiums. We allow insurance companies to invest our premium money during what's called the float time. On average, automobile liability insurance claims take 15 months to resolve. While there is a five to 10 year lag in long tail insurance liability lines like medical malpractice. So they invest our premiums in the market creating essentially two pots of money. The premium pot that they use to pay out losses and the investment pot. Georgia insurance companies have earned record profits by investing premiums during this float time. For example, in 2023, although insurance companies nationwide lost $12 billion in underwriting operations, the premium pot, they profited $90 billion in investment income. And in 2024, that industry has profits totaling $144 billion. Despite our rates going up, their shareholders and corporate executives are reaping profits at our expense. So this bill is asking us to abandon the victims, our constituents that have been wrongfully harmed. Many of them spoke at these hearings, reliving their tragic traumatic heart-wrenching experiences to beg and plead that we do not pass this bill. SB 68 will make Georgia's less safe and have less access to the courts. But there is nothing that guarantees your insurance rates are going to go down. So I'm pleading with you to vote no on SB 68 and support our constituents. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. And ladies, yield to the well. Representative Murray Crawford just recognized the speak to the bill. Representative Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends of the day, I rise in full opposition of Senate Bill 68. Legislation that will be harmful to our most vulnerable constituents and citizens, those who have experienced catastrophic injuries. Legislation that was drafted under the narratives that there are too many frivolous lawsuits. There are too many nuclear verdicts. And that litigation increases insurance premiums. First, frivolous lawsuits can already be dismissed under our current rules of civil procedure in those who bring frivolous lawsuits are sanctioned. Second, nuclear verdicts rarely, if ever occur. You heard a lot of testimony or proponents saying that nuclear verdicts occur to Walton and that verdicts don't match the facts. However, what you have not heard is from proponents of this bill explained to you that when an accident occurs, there is an opportunity for defense firms and insurance companies to settle claims within their policy limits. However, they usually prolong litigation. And after prolonging litigation, which substantially harms the injured party, that case is brought to trial. And after jurors here, the egregious facts of a particular case, they return with the verdict that mirrors the facts in evidence. But then even after a verdict is rendered, there is an opportunity for judges to overturn verdicts should the verdict not match the facts in record. So there's really no need for this legislation. Now, proponents of this bill have said that litigation increases insurance premiums, but I have never seen any evidence to substantiate those claims. There's no proof that litigation increases insurance premiums. But when asked if we pass Senate Bill 68, whether or not insurance premiums with decrease, I've never heard a definitive answer. What I've heard is, well, you know, so the question that I have is, why are we attempting to pass legislation for a problem that we cannot prove exist? But then even if we agree that that problem does exist, we are about to pass legislation that will not fix the alleged problem. So I really don't understand the point again of this legislation. But there is proof that if we pass this legislation is going to interfere with our independent judiciary system. You know, earlier this session, a former member of this body and the current chief judge of our Supreme Court gave his state of the judiciary. And in his address, he said, and I quoted, that Georgia judges must ensure that equal rights are done for the rich and the poor, which promotes the importance of the rule of law and an independent judiciary that helps to build trust and confidence in our courts. Well, unfortunately, to the nearly 1600 judges in this state that have been elected by our constituents, should this bill pass, it indicates that proponents don't think that the judges know what they're doing. Proponents don't think that the verdicts mirrored the facts that are in record. And so there's been a creation of a clause in this legislation that would automatically dictate that certain trials be bifurcated, meaning that attorneys and witnesses would have to testify and present multiple times throughout a trial, which is going to prolong trials and make our courts inefficient. No one wants this. You know, this would be like on cross-over day, we have intent speakers at 1130 to come and support a bill in this well, prolonging time. No one wants that, no one needs that, it's inefficient. Should we pass this bill with this automatic bifurcation, that's exactly what we would be doing. And ironically, every year, just as soon as I'm standing here, sure as I'm standing here, there's going to be legislation where people are proposing to add judges to their judicial circuits, and they're going to cite backlogs in their judicial circuits. Well, I'm here to tell you, if this bill passes, you're going to have to ask for more judges on your circuits, because again, this bill would make our courts system less efficient and create more of a backlogs. But most importantly, this bill is going to harm everyday Georgians, allowing slum lords to go doing whatever they want to. They won't protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. Early in my career, I had an opportunity to represent a young lady who went on a blind date. And after going on a date, she decided to drop the young man off because he didn't have a car. She pulls into an apartment complex. And as soon as she pulls into the parking lot, she's shot at. Yes, she shot at multiple people shot at her car. She got hit in her arm four times. And so she has to drive herself to the hospital. And once she gets to the hospital, she learns a few things. First, that hospital is going to have to be her home for the next four weeks. Next, she learns that her arm will forever be impaired. She will never have the full range of motion in her arm. So we sent a settlement letter to the insurance company and to the apartment manager asking that they settle within the policy limits. Of course, they said no. So we continue with litigation. What we learned, as we continue to litigate this case, is that the on-site property manager was sleeping with gang members within that community. And she allowed gang members to occupy vacant rooms at this apartment complex to grow their criminal enterprise. Tenets told the on-site manager and told the owner of the apartment complex about this incredibly disgusting public nuisance and nothing was done. And so my former victim was injured because of that. That doesn't sound right. But what we learned is that there was so many apartment complexes that had the same criminal patterns. And so if we passed a bill in the way that it currently is, the young lady who I'm talking about would not have been able to receive full justice. Again, this bill is going to allow terrible slumlords in our state to continue to operate in a way that does not protect some of our constituents and some of our voters. But as opposed to holding slumlords accountable, the first thing that we're going to do is let's just kill all the attorneys. Let's kill all the lawyers because we don't like the litigation. But the problem is, is that a lot of the people that we represent their only way through justice is through an attorney that's going to fight for them in court. No one in this room is immune to a catastrophic injury. And I pray that nothing happens to anyone in this room. But should you leave this capital and are catastrophically injured because things happen, then you deserve justice. You deserve full justice and someone who can represent you to make sure that you are made whole after a crazy catastrophic incident. No constitutional right is more important or fundamental than the right of a trial by a jury. And serving on a jury is the only right that is required in our constitution and in our country. If we passed this bill, we are significantly endangering that right. I ask that you oppose Senate Bill 68, not because of your side of whether or not you like attorneys or insurance companies, but oppose Senate Bill 68 because the people that we represent can and will be catastrophically injured at some point and they deserve full justice. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. And gentlemen, as yield of the well, our next speaker's representative park, Whit Park is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, a few things. I've had the opportunity to serve in the rule subcommittee meetings that heard more than 10 hours. I'm not a trial attorney. And certainly as a native George and Bournemouth raise, I want to ensure that our business community and certainly are hospitals or medical providers, that we are creating an environment here in the state of Georgia for them to thrive. But this bill is not it. And certainly we cannot have the most vulnerable among us injured Georgians who have faced the most egregious crimes inflicted upon them to bear the burden that this bill would otherwise impose on them. The other thing I've learned along the way is, ultimately this is not a bill about big business and trial attorneys. This is a bill that is not a bill that is not a bill that has been introduced. This is a bill about whether or not Georgians and victims have access to justice. Who do trial lawyers represent? Again, they represent every day Georgians who need help. Who need access to justice which this bill would undermine and otherwise make more different. reasons I urge all members of this legislature, of this chamber to vote no to Senate bill 68, because it will hurt Georgians, especially our most vulnerable. Now, I want to do everything within our power to lower insurance premiums as well. But again, this bill will not accomplish that objective. We had our Georgia Insurance Commissioner come and testify in committee saying there is no guarantee that insurance rates will go down as a result of this legislation. We have also seen in other states that there is no causal effect with respect to this sort of legislation, this tort reform legislation, and lowering premiums of everyday hard working Georgians, Florida being an outlier. And so again, as members of this body, we have an obligation to protect the people of Georgia, to ensure that their rights are upheld, their access to justice preserved, and their health care needs met. This bill accomplishes none of those things. SB 68 Wood Weekend protections for victims make access to health care more difficult, and unfairly benefit big business at the expense of the people we serve. Now again, there was so much brave testimony from sex trafficking victims, from victims of crime who spoke out against this bill because they understood that this would undermine their ability to recover and seek justice. This bill would provide a shield to criminals and property owners who turn a blind eye to suffering happening on their property. That's not the Georgia I want to live in, and that's certainly not the Georgia we should be building. Now with respect to health care, Section 7 in particular, the collateral source rule and the amendments and modifications therein, that would devastate access to health care for uninsured and underinsured Georgians who already have a difficult time seeking access to health care. The provision also hurts doctors, patients, and Georgia taxpayers. SB 68 eliminates a crucial financing tool that allows doctors to treat patients who can't afford to pay up front. Without access to those financial tools, doctors will be forced to reduce care, layoff staff, close our properties entirely or turn away patients. What is the effect of that legislation? It would force the elderly, the poor, the uninsured and underinsured into our emergency rooms that will further exacerbate all of the health care challenges that our state continues to face as a result of the failure and ongoing failure to expand access to health care for all Georgians, which is one of the primary factors that drives everyone's private premiums. If you have health insurance and your premiums are going up, it's important because of the failure of this body to ensure that all Georgians have access to health care. This bill undermines the very foundation of our civil justice system. It makes it harder for victims to seek justice and easier for wrongdoers to escape accountability. It weakens the right to a trial by jury, which has been a cornerstone of our democracy for centuries. A jury of our peers is the best safeguard. We have to ensure fairness in the legal system and SB 68 chips away at that principle. Again, I know especially as we are heading toward the end of this legislative session, our focus may be short-sighted to a certain extent. Folks certainly on the other side of the aisle and maybe some here and some on the second floor are positioning themselves to run for higher office. Folks may not be here. Those pushing this bill may not be here. Until next year, come 2027, come 2028. Let us think about the long-term consequences of this legislation that will undermine our civil justice system and make it harder for victims to obtain the justice that they deserve. And so with all that said, again, I urge all of my members on both sides of the aisle to please do the right thing, put Georgians first, especially the most vulnerable among us and vote no to Senate Bill 68. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you the law? Thank you, Representative Sam Part, the gentleman's yielded the well. That concludes those speaking that are opposed to the bill. Now those in favor will have up to 30 minutes and we have one person signed up. Those representative chairs, Kenan, representative chairs, Kenan has recognized to speak in favor of the bill. Senate Bill 68, representative Kenan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues like many of you I've watched the debate on this issue from the sidelines. I've listened and learned a great bit from the many hours of testimony and I've learned a great bit from those who are deeply involved in this issue on both sides. Some of my very best friends in this chamber are trial lawyers and some of them are in the insurance business. So there are certainly some personal feelings on this matter for me. And I've given this issue a great deal of thought. More than I expected I would, it's an important topic. I've tried to weigh my friendships on both sides against the best interests of the people in my district and our state. After consideration of those interests arise today in support of Senate Bill 68. A pivotal piece of legislation designed to reform our state's tort system. Cretel lawsuit abuse and foster and environment for small businesses can thrive. This bill addresses the pressing need to balance the scales of justice, ensuring fairness for both plaintiffs and defendants while stimulating economic growth across Georgia. Our current legal landscape has at times permitted excessive litigation and disproportionate jury awards, which in turn have driven up insurance premiums and operating calls for businesses, particularly our small enterprises. These escalating expenses often translate into higher prices for consumers and can stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is the backbone of our state's economy. Senate Bill 68 introduces several critical reforms. By prohibiting attorneys from suggesting arbitrary figures for non-economic damages before all evidence is presented, we prevent undue influence on juries and promote impartial deliberations.

Terminations of liability and assessments of damages are conducted separately, leading to more focused and fair proceedings. Furthermore by aligning recoverable medical expenses with amounts actually paid for necessary for reasonable care, we eliminate the practice of inflating damages beyond actual costs. This not only ensures just compensation for plaintiffs, but also curbs the inflation of insurance premiums that burden our citizens and businesses alike. The bill also clarifies premises liability standards, requiring that property owners be proven aware of specific security risks they fail to address. This protects businesses from unjust lawsuits while maintaining accountability for genuine negligence. Additionally, permitting evidence of seatbelt usage in motor vehicle cases introduces a common sense approach to assessing contributory negligence, promoting personal responsibility and fairness. By enacting these reforms, we create a more predictable and equitable legal environment. This predictability is crucial for small businesses which often operate on very narrow margins and are disproportionately affected by the threat of costly litigation. Reducing frivolous lawsuits and exorbitant awards will stabilize insurance cost, enabling these businesses to invest in growth, create jobs and contribute more robustly to our state's economy. Colleagues Senate Bill 68 is not just a legal reform, it is an economic imperative. These strikes are necessary balance. Protecting the rights of individuals to seek redress while ensuring that our legal system is not exploited to the detriment of honest enterprise and consumer welfare. I urge you all to support this bill, I know it's personal for some folks, but it will foster a fair judicial system and I believe a more prosperous Georgia for all. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. Gentlemen, as you are the well, that completes those speaking favor of SB 68 and those that oppose to SB 68. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. We'll now move on to our minority report. We have a minority report that will be up to 20 minutes and we have chairs timed that will be up to 20 minutes. We'll begin with our minority report. Representative Evans, are you going to allocate your time? I think you have another speaker as well. So I trust you to take care of that. Representative, State's Evans is recognized to bring us the minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good afternoon, colleagues. I rise in strong opposition to Senate Bill 68. And I want to talk a little bit. I want to try to address the why that we've heard a little bit about why we need this. And then I want to address the what that this bill actually is. First, the why. We've been told this is about insurance. We've been told this is about insurance companies losing money and they can't stay here and that's why they're raising premiums and something's got to be done. I sat through all these hearings, these subcommittee hearings and some of you all did too. You know who didn't come in the House, the insurance commissioner. You know who didn't come in the House, not a single insurance company, not a single one. You all heard a lot about these cases, CVS and race track. You know who didn't come? CVS, race track. They were there. They're representatives. They were there, all of them were there. But they never spoke to us. They never let us ask them questions. Why? This is about insurance, but we didn't hear from insurance. Now I think that I've heard that some of you all have been told, well we're going to do insurance reform next year. Let's do this. This year we'll do insurance reform next year. Well, this is about insurance. Well, I can't we do insurance now. And I want you to also think ladies and gentlemen, you are smart. You're savvy. You've been here before. Remember the last time somebody told you we'll get to that next year. Just remember whether that happened or not. Some of this insurance emergency that we've been told about came out of a report that was done as a result of a bill that we did, the King report, were relying on that for this alleged situation that we're in. This is from the front page of that report. The contractor, he was contracted to do this. The contractor did not independently verify the insurance data and did not perform any verification procedures to determine the completeness of the data provided by the insurers. Therefore, the contractor makes no representations, no representations regarding the accuracy and the integrity of the data and information submitted. And due to the requirements of the bill, this is also in the report. This analysis was completed under a compressed timeline. As a result, the analysis team was unable to correct some data anomalies, which may have identified additional trends. That's what we're relying on here. In complete data, not hearing from the insurance company. Now you've heard about how insurance companies are making money. Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, I don't begrudge anybody a profit. I am never going to begrudge them that. And I don't begrudge them coming down here and trying to save more. That's their job. Their job is to try to get more. Like your kids. Want more candy? I want more of this. I want more of that. We sit in the seats of the parents, the lawmakers. It's our job to say no, to balance. And that's what this bill does not do. Now the fine representative carrying this bill talked a little bit about what it did. But it was a little fast. So I'm going to try to address a little bit. Number one, section one, anchoring. They told you that it's not right for these lawyers to get up there and try to put a dollar value on non-economic damages. And the jury should just decide that on their own. That's their role. Well, let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, here's what juries do. They make decisions in the enlightened consciousness of a jury. Enlightened means they have to be informed. Advocates advocate on both sides. And we've heard judges say the jury's almost always get it right. They know that these are advocates. They can balance that and they make the right decisions. And when they don't, the judges have the ability already under our law to take that away from them. They can take that verdict away. You heard all that section two does is just talk about when discovery begins. That's not all it does, ladies and gentlemen. It ensures, and I can say this without a shadow of a doubt, that good cases will languish. These motions to dismiss, so what's going to happen? This is a little wonky. So when you follow motion to dismiss right now, you get a stay for 90 days. The judge doesn't decide the motion in 90 days. The stay lifts. You can do discovery. You can get evidence. You can find documents. You can ask questions. This says that stay that stay of discovery is going to last forever. You all, memory, spare documents disappear. Year after year after year, these cases will languish. I want to talk about section six, negligence securities. Probably the biggest change in our law here. I asked corporations in these hearings, these small businesses, you're not asking us to take away liability for everything. No, that is not what we want, but that's what this bill does. This what this bill says. You could have, under this new section six, look at line 224, you got a much higher standard of saying you knew something was going to happen. This reasonable foreseeability is a really high standard now. And even if you meet that, even if you meet that really high standards, if the injury that is complained of is not about exploiting a specific physical condition of the premises, no liability. Even if you've met that increased standard, even if you've met this new threshold, what does that mean? That means no matter how much the owner knows about gang members on the property, the property owner that we heard about that was letting people have rooms, the gang people have rooms. No matter how many times you know there's been nightfights and gang rapes and gunfire, if it's not about a broken lock, a broken window, a security system that failed, a alarm system, no liability, even if you can prove they knew. None. Why would we do that? Now I appreciate that we have a car about in this section for victims of sex trafficking. That's good. It lays in general on how do we pick and choose among victims. And the carrier of the bill said some people are going to tell you that this picks and chooses among people. And he said, we'll just read the words on the page. You should read the words on the page. That's exactly what this bill does. Line 275. Sex trafficking victims treated differently. Line 279. Breaches of contracts treated differently. What about a rape victim? What about a victim of sexual assault in a slum apartment? What about those? How do you look those women in the eye? How do you look their mothers in the eye and say, we are going to treat you differently than a sexual assault victim who was a victim of sex trafficking? How do we do that? Why would we do that? To me, that is the most glaring reason to vote no, ladies and gentlemen. It acknowledges that this standard is too high. And we don't want these victims of sex trafficking left out in the cold. We don't want them to not be able to recover for their damages. Well, why wouldn't we want other victims of crime to be able to recover for their damages? Ask yourselves that, ladies and gentlemen. There's so much to say, but I'm going to close here. You know, anytime I have a big court hearing or a speech or a debate or something, y'all will have your playlist, your pump up list. I have mine too. Two main songs I listen to. They're very different. Brooks and Dunn, only in America. And Killer Mike, never scared. Why only in America? Because that's my story, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know if you've listened to that song, but there's a line that says, it's about a bus driver and she's sitting in traffic and she's looking at a rearview mirror, looking at the future of our country. She says, one kid dreams of fame and fortune and one kid helps pay the rent. That was me, ladies and gentlemen. I remember getting my first paycheck as a salibar attendant at Shownies and handing it to my mom because that's how we stayed where we were. I've never forgotten her because I've dreamed of fame and fortune, ladies and gentlemen. I've gotten it. But I will not forget that girl. She doesn't have lobbyists out there. She doesn't have a voice in every courtroom. She has to fight for every single thing she gets. And she can finally get in there and tell her story. We're going to tell her. No, sorry. Now why I never scared. Because how could I be scared? If I've lived through that. And we've seen victims come down here and plead for us to not do this, to not shut the doors of justice on them. Do you know how hard that must be for them? If they can do that, if they can stand up, it is not hard for me. And I am never scared and I hope you are never scared too. And I hope you will keep a voice for these victims. And please join me in voting no. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the majority of the time to Tony Miller. The lady has you to the well. Chair Miller, Chair Lady Miller is recognized. She speaks to the bill. Chair Lady Miller. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good afternoon, colleagues. Much like my colleague who just left this well, I too grew up the child of a working poor family. And I don't really talk about myself personally. I'm a private person. But I grew up in the mean and cold streets of Cleveland, Ohio. With the sun don't shine, the land of ice and snow. I was raised by a single mother who went to work every single day of her life, barely taking days off. Only to be one paid check away from complete and utter disaster. I watched my mother battle evictions, repossessions, opportunities that passed her by, wishing as a child always does that they could protect their mother. There's a reason why I'm telling you this. This was formative for me. It created my why in life. What my mother needed in those moments was an advocate, someone who could stand up for her. That became a formative core element of who I am as a person. It charted my course. It sent me to law school. Where I fell in love with the law. It's consistency. It's stability. It's sturdiness. It made a child who grew up with instability feel safe. Where there was a place that truth mattered. I became a trial lawyer because I fundamentally believed that the courtroom is where everyday citizens, the Davids with only a slingshot, are on equal footing with the Goliaths. I learned that our jury trial system is fundamental to our founding. You all know this. We're legislators. We're students of history. We may know that the 12th person jury is a sacred thing with roots often traced to the Welsh King of Glamorgan, who established jury trials in 725 AD, linking the judge and the jury to Jesus and the 12 disciples. And as such for us, a foundational premise of our union, indeed according to the founders of this great nation of ours, Thomas Jefferson, I consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution. John Adams, representative government and trial by jury are the hardened lungs of liberty. Without them we have no other fortification against being written like horses, flees like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed like the swine and the hounds. James Madison, trial by civil jury in cases, is as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existing rights of humans in nature. I want you to frame this discussion today, my colleagues, understanding what we are tinkering with. Understanding that this is not just some build, this is an attack on the very fundamental premise that makes this country what it is. You disrespecters, you accuse them of being confused, hoodwinked, run amok, let us stray. Not in a divorce case where they decide which parent gets a child. Not in a contract case between two big corporations where they have to decide complex accounting and whether or not some rule in our jurisprudence has been broken. Not in a murder case where a prosecutor will stand up and ask a jury in this state to send a man to die. Those jurors are okay. But somehow something happens to the 12 citizens who by nature of them being in that seat, they are voters, the same people who send you to this seat. Something happens to them when it's a personal injury case. When someone has been killed in a civil case, they get all squirrely, they get confused about the law, they can't decipher what a lawyer says is reasonable or unreasonable. They can't apply the law, they don't listen to judges and by the way those judges, many of whom appointed by Brian Kemp, we are asked to believe have created a hellhole of a justice system in this great state of Georgia. They are good men and women, they are learned jurors, they do their job under the hardest of circumstances. They don't have enough resources, but they dispense and administer justice every day in state courts and in federal courts from the north to the south of this state. And we come in here and allow them to be disparaged by some DC propaganda PR firm. It's outrageous. This tort reform sham, my brothers and sisters, is a well run orchestrated PR campaign. Take the time to researches, just Google tort reform. Since the 1990s they've been saying jackpot verdicts, jury's out of control. Businesses are closing, doctors fleeing the state, every time the campaign is run the same way with the same talking points, the same manufactured crisis. Last year we were fine, we were lamenting the fact that we were the number one place to do business, but this year my god, we are crushed and overwhelmed by an emergency in our judicial system. It has been proven to be a lie, it has been debunked over and over and over again. Don't you let them do that to you. This bill is bad for the people. Now let's talk about who this bill hurts because I think we might go past this a little too quickly in all the jargon and the legal ease. And if you can read that bill, my colleague, not as a lawyer and tell me you understand it, you are probably destined for Mensa. It is one of the most poorly drafted bills I have ever seen as a lawyer. Having spent my life interpreting and arguing and trying to understand the law. Now, this bill hurts the 92 year old elderly woman who died in her bed because she was devoured by fire ants. This bill hurts the four year old baby who went in for a random ton select to me. His wound wasn't sutured properly and by the time he got to the driveway of his home, he bled to death in front of his mother and his brother and his sister. These are the people that backs upon whom this bill, these lies, are being left. You're going to tell me it's okay if you're a 12 year old girl who has been sex trafficked. You can still go to court. Why? Because you have the pucylytical favor. You are the political group, does you? But a 12 year old who just got plain old rate. And the stairwell of an apartment complex knew they had a dangerous condition and failed to do anything. Well, I'm sorry, my dear. The courthouse doors for you are closed. You want to tell me the father of a child whose family was the victim of a drunk driver who ran to the car his wife was driving. And a Mr. Speaker, I'm wrapping up. His wife's legs were broken in the front seat. They'd been hit by an impaired driver. The cars were on fire. He went to get his six year old baby out of the back seat. He picked her up and he picked up half of her torso. The other half still in the seat because she had misplaced the seat belt and wriggled out of the shoulder strap as children often do. That father, you mean to tell me, has to come in and tell you three times? That he wrangled and held the last of his child, split into. Why is it that these are the people upon whose backs any of this is being built? My ask you my brothers and sisters, vote no. My Democrats, I know. My Democrats, I know you are carrying some of you the weight of the world on your shoulder. You have been threatened, coerced, attempted, and you don't walk on water. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the chairman of the committee, chairman Parrish, has recognized the speak to the bill. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I do not intend to take 20 minutes on this. I want to come to a little different approach to this. We are talking about Senate bill 68. I want to say thank you to the governor. I want to say thank you to the speaker, to the members of this House, the members of the rules committee, and especially to our subcommittee on rules that dealt with this. In my time that I served here in this House, to the best of my knowledge, I can't remember a piece of legislation that had as much attention as this bill does. We sat through over 13 hours of hearing in our subcommittee. We heard from dozens of interested parties that talked to us about what their concerns were, what their interests were, and so forth. Chairman Levitt, Levitt had the patience to sit there and listen to make sure everyone who wanted to have something to say was heard. I can tell you that was done. They shared their concerns and they shared their suggestions and everybody had a chance to state their case. And because of this process, the vetting changes were made to this legislation. And the changes and suggestions that we heard in our committee meetings were the reason a lot of these changes were made and what they were made for. I believe this bill is a giant step forward in the right direction to do tort reform in this state. I'm going to be voting for it. I'm going to vote yes and I hope you will join me in voting yes. And Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield my time to Chairman Levitt and Whitbury Sheth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman, you will this time and recognize House will now recognize Representative Levitt. I'd like to speak to the mayor, Representative Levitt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote for this version of Senate Bill 68. But before I talk about the bill, I want to thank the subcommittee for their service. We did hear a lot of testimony. It was very moving, much of it. It was lengthy. The hearings took a long time. I know you all had other things to do this time of year. And I appreciate your commitment to this endeavor. But I think it was very well worth it. We heard a lot. We learned a lot. We listened. And despite what some have said this morning, we put what we heard in place in this bill. The substitute you're considering today has some meaningful changes. I don't mean to slight the work of our friends across the hall. We had an advantage in that we had we got to see here the debate over there first and think about it and then it came to us. So we had more time to deal with it. I don't believe we made any material changes, but we did clarify the intent in ways that I think make the bill clearer and better. And that legislation is always good when it's clear. So I'm proud of the work we did. I'm proud of the hearings we held. And I'm proud of the process we've have applied. Now let's talk about the bill briefly. There are 10 sections to the bill. One of them is repeal or one of them is effective dates. You got eight substantive sections. One of them arguably does make some changes in the type of evidence you can hear that's relevant to prove. And that's the premises section. So it does make some changes. But I would submit to you that while I am sympathetic to any victim out there, I also want to be sympathetic to the people who run the businesses and own the property and are sometimes the defendants. They deserve fairness too. And I think what the bill tries to do is make things fair for them. For example, the voluntary dismissal right now plaintiff can dismiss just as the first witness is being sworn. I don't see how you can tell me that is fair to anybody. So we're changing it. We're moving it back to 60 days after the answer is filed. Right now plaintiffs can talk about non economic damages. This is things like pain and suffering. Any time in trial, they can also talk about economic damages. Any time in trial. This bill just says, well wait until your jury argument to make that argument. Don't do it during the rest of the case. And when you argue, make sure that your argument is rationally related to the evidence. So we're upset now that someone cannot make an irrational argument about how much money they should recover. Don't understand the outrage on that one. And you can still talk about economic damages all the way through the trial that you want to. And you can argue both in your opening and your concluding closing about economic, non economic damages. So I don't, I don't think we're really tipping the skills there. I would suggest you that that's a fair rule that we currently have. We also have the provision on the state of discovery. That's already the law. There is already a limited state of discovery. Now this could result in that state being longer, but there's already an existing exception in the statute that allows you to get discovery about the issues that the defendant is raising. So you can determine if that motion is valid or not and show that to the court. So while there is a stay, it's not an absolute stay. There are exceptions to it. And that's already existing law and that's not being changed. As to the premise section, I think we all, well, it seems like we're telling much of our state not to believe they're lying.

eyes when it comes to what's going on with respect to insurance rates and respect the liability. That particular error of the law, I think, has gotten due to the totality of the circumstances test. It's difficult to plan. It's difficult to know what you need to do and you're going to be second-guest if something happens. This simply places some boundaries and some borders on the kind of evidence that can be admitted and trial to prove that claim. It doesn't otherwise change the substance law, but it does make changes because it does change the evidence that can come in. But I would submit to you that's trying to balance the interest there in a way that's more equitable to everybody and certainly fair to the people who need to know what they need to do. So I would submit to you the whole issue with insurance. I don't know if this will cause rates to change. I don't know if it will come down. I really don't. If you look at some other states, there is a correlation. Despite what's been said here, there have been reductions in rates in Florida. Now, I can't tell you that's a causal connection there, but I just don't think we can do nothing. I don't think we can sit on our hands and wait. People in our state are telling us they're having serious problems that we need to do something about and I think based on at least correlations in other states, this will make some difference. Now, what I also say to the extent you're concerned about insulating insurance companies, it's kind of difficult to crack down on them and then have them stay and compete with one another for your premium dollar. And to the extent you're concerned that we were being asked to wait to do insurance reform, we've already done it. House Bill 1114 a year ago has imposed some regulatory reforms on the insurance company so we can check on what they're doing and what they make and what they're earning. So that's already there. I'm all for some additional initiatives, but we have done that already. So I would encourage you to vote for this bill. I think to the extent we worry that we can't do anything we're putting ourselves in the position of Nero who fiddle while Rome burned and we don't want to be in that position. So I would hope you will vote in favor of this bill and the speaker I would yield and render my time to whipership. General Muziel to the well. Whipership is recognized. He speak to the bill for the final time allotted to the chair. Thank you Mr. Speaker. My intent here is to speak to some of the concerns that were raised by my colleagues and before I do that let me say I have a great deal with respect for each and every member in this chamber and the advocates that came to this well have very impassioned statements but I feel the need to correct the record. First off there's not one line in this bill. Nowhere that does not allow a rape victim to bring a claim. Now one line in this bill does that. Nowhere is disingenuous to say so and I'll go as far to say that it does not allow a woman a victim of rape can never be made whole. Period. Once that line is crossed a victim of rape cannot be made whole. No dollar amounts. No judge. No jury. No advocate. No lawyer can ever make that woman whole. I don't think that it is a genuine statement to come in here and say that a rape victim cannot bring a claim under the end in this bill. No one in this chamber would support a measure that does that. No one in this chamber would likewise support a measure that decreases access to justice. I mean there's 50 billboards out there call any one of those lawyers they're going to give you access to justice. I promise for a small dollar that's all it's going to take and I'm a lawyer and frankly that is also a disingenuous statement to say that this is closing off access to justice. What this bill does it is a civil procedure bill mainly in my mind. Civil procedure how lawyers act in the courtroom that's it. The same claims can be brought. Every claim can be brought. One of my colleagues mentioned that this tour form doesn't work. Didn't work in Florida simple Google search February 5th 2025. Governor Ron DeSantes announced his rate reductions for Miami-Dade County auto insurance reduction statewide and 11 new companies entering Florida market. May 24th. Florida Home Insurance Premium is falling. May 24th. First downtrend in insurance rate filings in years. Now it is not it is a disingenuous to come in here and say that policy objectives can't affect insurance rates and insurance products. That's my friend's example about the property owner who was sleeping with the gangs and he knew about the gangs being on the property. I will submit to you that has no place in this bill. That victim could bring a negligent hiring claim of Icarus liability claim and a negligent retention claim none of which are in this bill none of which are impacted by this bill. So that victim has access to justice she has the ability to seek out a lawyer and get her day in court. Then by the testimony I heard today I expect that they won or will win. One of the remarks that was made in here was that there was access to health care. Access to health care will be reduced here. I have no I have read this bill reread it. I have read had to read it four or five times because it is a dense bill. There is nothing in here that closes off one emergency room in this state. The hospitals that are supporting this bill I don't think would be in very in support of this bill if there was an emergency room closed in this state and that's our primary access to health care. Everybody in this state of Georgia has access. The doctors have told me a number of times they don't turn away anyone. Access to health care is not impacted by this bill. One of my good friends said that advocates lawyers should be able to argue anything in court specifically saying that they're being constrained of what they can argue in in in a courtroom. Well I would submit to you that relating a professional baseball player salary to how much you want to get for a victim of a car accident has nothing to do at all nothing to do at all with that victim's harm. That's all we're saying bring rationally relatable measures. Don't talk about a G5 how much a G5 jet cost when you're talking about somebody that's been rear-ended that's that's that's that's the constraint. I think that's a reasonable constraint. My colleague says we should be able to argue anything we we should be able to argue and say that you know the Disney Castle cost a hundred million dollars so my client who was rear-ended should get a hundred million dollars that that is preposterous I think that is a stretch and I think this is a reasonable restraint just to say that if you were going to say that my client was hit my client should be able to recover the cost of their car the cost of their injuries we have a we haven't limited that ability at all your economic non-economic damage special damages punitive damage have not limited them at all limited at what you can say as a lawyer because you're trying to embed these numbers in these juries head that's what we're that's what we're doing here there's testimony that our courtroom this this bill is going to continue to extend the length of trials well friends we are past that mark anybody that has been in court knows that our dockets are full and there are I have a case right now that I've been litigating for five years five years this is not going to push that any further not one bit further what it will do though is require you to bring a meritorious claim bring a claim that's a real claim because you don't get it you don't get to tie somebody up with a complaint bring a claim and then make your case and then figure out if if somebody's liable you don't bring a a merit list case and then drag somebody through a discovery for 18 months and then decide well we've made him spend 150 grand now we're just going to voluntary dismiss that's happening folks one of my farmers in south Georgia had nothing had nothing to do with the case it's been a hundred thousand dollars answering interogatories going to court trying to tell everybody I didn't have anything to do with this why are you suing me this this is going to make lawyers bring better cases my colleague said that one of her pump up music is never scared I'd be afraid to tell you what mine is it's pretty pretty pretty out there but you know who's scared you know who's scared are our family businesses are scared our family run farms are scared one of my one of my farmers says I am scared to put the name of my farm on my dad going truck because somebody's going to run into me because they built these businesses these family owned businesses their whole life it takes one takes one piece of litigation to take everything away from them everything no more house no more property no more business no more way to sustain a living for your children this does one thing this does one thing it changes how lawyers act in the courtroom that's it we've litigated this quite frankly to death I'm asking you I'm employing you and I'm begging you put something put something up that's going to help us put's going to just going to move the ball forward in the state of Georgia this is not going to prevent victims of rape victims of sexual assault any victims from bringing any claims there's
