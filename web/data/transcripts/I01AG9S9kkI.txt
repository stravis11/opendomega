All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well, good afternoon. Hope everyone had a beautiful weekend. And I don't think I need to remind you today as legislative day 36. The end is drawing near. We will begin our day today with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the lady from the 23rd House District, the chairman of the juvenile justice committee, chairman Mandy Ballinger. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, you're in for a real treat. Taylor Cole is going to be our chaplain for today. As his day job, he is an assistant principal of the junior high in Dawson County. He has a bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia. He yields a master's degree from the University of North Georgia. And he has a specialist degree from Balthas to state. He resides in coming with his wife, two children, and he is also a foster parent. But his crowning achievement is being my cousin. So I hope you all will give attention to Taylor Cole. Thank you. Thank you so much. What a great honor it is to be here today. I appreciate the introduction. Since we are cousins, I'll just call her Mandy. We appreciate this opportunity. What a great privilege it is. And I want to thank all of you for the work that you do every day. I know every decision you make is met with a whole lot of criticism. But thank you for being here and thank you for what you do for the great people of Georgia every single day. I want to read a passage of scripture from the book of Matthew, the 20th chapter. Before I read that, I'm going to give you a little bit of background. Jesus had spoken to his disciples here and he had told them that he was going to Jerusalem where he was going to be crucified and where he was going to rise again on the third day. And right after he had told them that, two of the brothers, along with their mother, came up to him and they said, will you just make sure when you come to your kingdom that I can sit on one side and my brother sits on the other side? So in other words, Jesus has told them, I guess one of the most amazing things that has ever been told that he's going to die and not only that he's going to rise again. And they essentially said, enough about you, what about us? How do we fit into this? Where are we going to be when this happens? And Jesus, of course, he gives them an answer and the other disciples are that they hear his response. And then he addresses all of the disciples and the 24th verse of the 20th chapter of Matthew, he said, when the 10 heard that they were moved with Ignatian against the two brothers. But Jesus called them unto him and said, you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercised a minion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you. But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister. And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. Even as a son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. Jesus tells his disciples here to be great in this world. It's not about power or influence or fame or fortune. He tells them in order to be great is to be a servant. Now, I know all of you here, you are serving the people of Georgia. And like I've said, I appreciate the work that you do and all the public servants across our state. I appreciate the work that they do. And I know we're constantly pressured by society to think in order to be great. We have to have some sort of a position of authority. But we have to have a certain amount of money. And we have to have a certain number of people that answer to us. But Jesus said, it's not so among you. It's different. That may be the way that society measures greatness. But not so, Jesus said, among you, among his followers, greatness is measured by how they serve and who they serve. I want to leave you with this. I want to encourage you all not to be deceived by the thought of if I was in this position or if I was in that position. I was on this committee or if I was on that committee, then I could really make a difference. If I was just in a different place, if I was just in a different year, then I could really serve the people and really make a difference. I want to encourage you today, you can make a difference right where you are. You can serve people right where you are. There's people all around us every day, no matter who we are and what we do that need our service. So my prayer is that that's what we can all do is to look around us and my prayer is that God will put people in our path that we can serve and that we'll see that as being great. Not fortunate and fame and status, but in who we serve and how we serve them is what makes us great. Stand if you would and join me for a word of prayer. God, we thank you for this opportunity to be here in this House of Representatives. God, I pray for each and every member that's here today. The work they do is so important and they're constantly faced with challenges and opposition to everything they're trying to do. I pray, Lord, that you would give them wisdom when they make decisions because their decisions are so important and they impact so many people. I pray, God, that you will help bring unity and decision making and compromise when needed. And I pray, Lord, that we all together, Lord, can look for people around us in which we can serve. And Lord, not look for fame or fortune, but just look for opportunities. Look for people that are right around us that need our help and reach out to them and serve them. Lord, we pray for all the underprivileged people. We pray for all the folks in our state that are sick. And I pray, God, that you will just again bless this House of Representatives and the work that they do. And the name of Jesus we pray, amen. Join me for the pledge. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative park rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that House bill 772 and 773 have met all the criteria required for local legislation to be considered and approved by this body that our local county commission supports these measures that they have met local advertisement requirements and receive the requisite number of signatures as required by the local delegation bylaws signed by all members of the delegation and that it is hypocritical demonstrates the lack of ethics of the majority of this body by passing legislation to reconstitute boards of elections and pickings. Lincoln, Morgan, Carol and troop counties that are hyper partisan undemocratic power grabs what rejecting an effort to create a bipartisan board of elections and going at it is it not true, Mr. Speaker? So which one of those you want me to answer? All of them. I think the gentleman feels strongly about each of those when I will let that be addressed to each and every member of this body. What purpose does the chairman of the judiciary committee rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that the Gwyneth elections board is currently the fifth members currently picked by partisan affiliates of each party and so that a bipartisan official selected and only three months after Democrats took control of the county commission. They are now proposing that a five member Democrat board pick the fifth member thereby taking control over the Gwyneth county elections board. I'm encouraging members to vote no. I'm sure the gentleman believes what he has said to be true. What purpose does are chairman Timothy Barr rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State jury inquiry. Is it not true that if the county commission wished to provide a pay raise that they have that power currently? I believe that to be true. What purpose does representative McLean rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that no other local legislation has been defeated this year? And furthermore, 19 of 25 elected representatives of Gwyneth county has supported this legislation. And furthermore, that it would be a sad day in Georgia. It is a sad day in Georgia when the state body take control of local body. I'm sure the gentleman feels that to be the case. What purpose does representative Kirby rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that typically before any pay raise goes into effect for a local official or elected official? That it's after the next election cycle where the public has a chance to absorb those facts. I think that is the general rule. All right, we're going to do one or two more and then we're going to lock the machines. What purpose does representative Jasmine Clark rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that House Bill 760 has not only met all the criteria to be approved by this body, but has broad bipartisan support from the Republican and Democratic leaders, and Gwyneth including the Gwyneth Chamber of Commerce, and refusing to pass this legislation demonstrates a desire to keep the first black woman ever elected as Gwyneth's chair severely underpaid, and perpetuates the systemic racism that exists in this country whereby black women in the U.S. are paid 38% less than white men and 21% less than white women. Chair, I recognize this final parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does representative Hutchinson rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that our Gwyneth County chair makes $65,000 a year versus the CAHB County chair that makes $174,000 a year? I have absolutely no knowledge of how much either of them are paid. Okay, have all members...

voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bills on the local calendar. The eyes are 70. The nays are 97. These bills having failed to receive a requisite constitutional majority are therefore not passed. What purpose does representative cannon rise? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker to make motion. State your motion. I move that these bills be reconsidered on the next legislative day. To serve notice. Think what you're intending to do since we're not at the final three days. You would serve notice of your intent to seek reconsideration on the next legislative day. Thank you. I'd like to serve notice of intent. So noted. All right. We're going on now to morning orders. Going on to morning orders. A total of 10 minutes today for morning orders. Chair recognizes representative Bentley for a morning order. This one. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues of the House of Acts. Representative Chairman Robert Dickie and representative Calvin Smirie to stand with me as we honor the life and legacy of former City Council members for the City of Fort Valley and Fort Valley Utility Commissioner Marvin crafter and Fort Valley passed away on this past Thursday evening there in the city of Fort Valley. Mr. Crafter was a strong advocate for the citizens for the City of Fort Valley for decades. And I thank you all so very much as we pause and honor the life and legacy of a giant of a man who truly loved his community. Mr. Marvin crafter of you will join me in a moment of silence. I would be so appreciative. Amen. And thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you members of the House. Chair recognizes representative Park for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, please stand to honor and mourn the eight victims who were killed last week in the horrific mass shooting. Please stand in solidarity with the families and loved ones of the victims. Our hearts are broken. Park Sun Chung, age 74, Kim Hyun-jung, 51 years old, Kim Sun-ja, 69 years old, Yoo Yong-e, 63 years old, Delena Ashley Young, 33 years old, Jaoshie Tan, 49 years old, Dow-Yoh Feng, age 44, Paul Andre Mitchell's age 54. They included a grandmother of six, a single mother striving to support her sons. They were daughters and sisters, a business executive two days from her 50th birthday, an army veteran, a woman who loved to dance. Six of the eight victims were of Asian descent. I ask that you stand in solidarity and grief with the Asian American community. Our parents, children, and loved ones live in fear. While condolences and prayers are appreciated, action is needed and demanded. Colleagues, I ask that you hear and understand the pain of our community and legislate to serve all Georgians. We can do a lot of good in this chamber. We can demonstrate love to our neighbor, love to our fellow American, and protect and serve all our communities. In honor of their memory, I pray that we live up to our values and take action to ensure their lives were not lost in vain. May we legislate with wisdom, justice, and moderation, and be held accountable to the people for what we do and what we do not do. May I ask for eight seconds of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the well. Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House for a morning order. Good afternoon. I would like to thank the members of the House for their support and support. Colleagues, today I rise to honor this House's Speaker of Pro Tem Jan Jones. Speaker of Pro Tem Jones was first elected to this House in 2002. In 2010, the Speaker of Pro Tem made history. She was the highest ranking woman ever in the history of our General Assembly. She currently serves as the co-chair of the Grace Commission, working to fight human trafficking in our state. In the legislature, she prioritizes reforming our educational system, bringing education, bringing innovation and flexibility to students and their families. Prior to serving in the legislature, she worked in marketing for HBO. In addition to her professional and legislative accomplishments, the Speaker of Pro Tem and her husband, Galen, have raised four wonderful children. Women's history month is a time to celebrate women and their accomplishments. And especially women who have blazed trails to lead their way for others. Speaker of Pro Tem Jan Jones is just such a woman. And she has cut is an inspiration for all Georgians, male and female. And I am proud to serve with her and I'm even proud to call her friend Jan Jones. Miss Speaker, I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Beth Camp for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And it's hard to follow up. I'm going to talk about the story of George and George. I would like to talk about an outstanding Georgian for women's history month. Mary Gregory, graduate of the University of Georgia, go dogs. In 1930, she became an outstanding leader in preservation in Georgia. She was a journalist, a historian and a public official. She later named the director of the commission, becoming one of the first women heads of state in Georgia. She was the president of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, which she helped establish in 1973. She was appointed later to the State Historic Preservation Officer by Governor Lestromatics, and later by Governor Jimmy Carter. She was an outstanding person because in that day and age, many women ever held a leadership position such as that. And she later went on to serve the Georgia Agriculture Development Board, which was a predecessor for the covers industry and trade in economic development departments. So today I'd like to spotlight Mrs. Mary Gregory, do it. Thank you. I yield the well. Chair recognizes the minority leader of this house, leader Beverly for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It has become apparent that the Atlanta business community has lined up behind voter suppression. The same community that depends somewhat infrequently on the minority caucus to help with the passage of bills, the regulation of rules, and the ultimate exercise of bipartisan participation constitutional amendments has decidedly declared that the substitute in the process whereby we deliberate voter suppression is okay. When statements are issued without talking to the minority caucus for its perspective, it undoubtedly becomes lopsided, and it talked to us now as somewhat disingenuous. For several years, site selection magazine has selected Georgia to be the number one state to do business. I'd ask for them to add another category, access to voting and social justice to that equation. To the business leaders who have opened your doors and said yes to Georgia to extend a ten sporting names, who open your doors and businesses to give many of us a living wage, who've opened your doors and created a community, a climate of tolerance. We say thank you. Today we're asking you to open your mouth and say no to voter suppression. Mrs. Pika, you're the well. Chair recognizes Representative Tyler Paul Smith for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today, my colleagues, to commemorate March 20th this past Saturday. 179 years ago, the Senate held the Military College of South Carolina was formed. And since that time, from Chipotle to Peck to Fallujah, our graduates have fought for this nation and served it with honor. The school has produced governors, a governor of this state, United States Senator, Ambassador, members of Congress, state legislators, and this legislature, leaders of business, judges in our state, both state and federal. Lawyers, doctors, and continued to strive for the same ethics that we were taught as cadets. I hope you all join me in commemorating the college, which is given not only so much to the state of South Carolina, but to the state of Georgia as well. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I get to honor another trailblazer, a woman of achievement, especially a woman of achievement in the nursing field. Letty Clay Andrews was born in 1874. She graduated with a three-year nursing degree from Spelman College in 1906. And that same year, she was hired as a superintendent of Lula Grove Hospital's colored division, where she created their three-year RN program, a very first. In 1914, she founded and licensed the Grady Hospital Municipal Training School of colored nurses. 50 years later in 1964, that school would be fully integrated with the Grady Hospital School of Nursing. Through her own personal sacrifice and dedication, black nurses who had graduated from accredited Georgia nursing schools were permitted to take the state board exam in 1920, and they finally became fully licensed registered nurses. This was when Mrs. Andrews became the state's first black registered nurse. She also went on to be superintendent of the Morehouse College in Firmary and the Morehouse Spelman Atlanta University in Firmary. She was always involved in her community. She was a health teacher for the neighborhood union of Atlanta, chairman of the relief committee of Atlanta Tuberculosis Association, member of the state and local interracial committee, member of a YMCA and trustee of the Atlanta Urban League. She died in 1969, and in 2018, she was honored with the cry of becoming a woman of achievement. I would have liked to have known Lutty, having been a registered nurse and a faculty member, but we also shared the fact that when she was 10 years old, she lost two siblings to a fire. I wonder very much having gone through a similar experience at 12. If that led her to her nursing career, which has made such a difference in Georgia's history, thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The time for morning orders has expired for today. If we didn't get to everybody, if you want to be carried over till tomorrow, please see the messenger. So we're, this house will come to order. House will come to order the chair, recognizes for a special order, chairman Randy Nicks, the chair of the House Ethics Committee, chairman Nicks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I have a very serious issue I need to bring to your attention today. So please give me your attention for just a few minutes. Last week, there was a comment made by a member of this body that caused several members to file an ethics complaint. The comment was crude, had a sexual connotation, and very inappropriate. The member who made the comment came to this well the following day and made an apology. While this specific incident triggered the complaint, the underlying issue is really what I want to address today. I would like to read from the complaint, the nature of this interaction and the pervasive nature of this type of behavior on the house floor during official house business, creates an unnecessarily uncomfortable environment for many members of this chamber. Now this complaint was signed by 20 members of this house. As chairman of the House Ethics Committee, I felt that this needed to be addressed to all of the house, rather than to one individual. Members who file the complaint agreed and the speaker has granted me this time to speak to you. Like the speaker does so often, let me direct your attention to the rules, ethics, and decor of this house to brochure that everyone has. If you will look there, you don't have to look very far to how we can solve this problem. Number one, 1.1 says this. All members and staff of the house shall conduct themselves at all times with dignity and with respect for others in a manner to ensure appropriate decorum in the deliberations of the house and to reflect the responsibilities incumbent upon a member or staff of the house. When it looked up the definition of dignity, bearing conduct or speech indicative of self-respect or appreciation of the formality or gravity of an occasion or situation. If you look at rule 1.2, members and staff of the house shall observe decency of speech and gentleness of behavior at all times in the house, the gallery, and the lobbies, antirumes, and halls adjacent to the house. Rule 1.3. No member in speaking shall be disrespectful to any other member and all members shall carefully avoid references to personalities when addressing the house. Rule 1.4 doesn't address this specifically. It talks about appropriate attire and simply says that it should be coat and tie for male members and dignified dress for female members. But 1.5 says this. Profane, obscene, or indecent language is prohibited in the house and during the meeting of any standing or special committee of the house. If you look further back in this book, you will find the rules that the ethics committee operates under. The ethics committee has a number of things that they do, but they're to investigate any allegations of unethical or improper conduct. And it gives a list of four things that fall under this category of unethical or improper conduct. A is abuse of official power and it gives you a definition. I will not read. B, conflict of interest. Again, it gives you a definition that I will not read. C, is improper conduct. It gives you a definition, but I will not read it. But D, says sexual harassment. And it defines sexual harassment. It says means making sexual advances, requesting sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. When, and I will skip down to number three for this, such conduct interferes with the individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Ladies and gentlemen, clearly based on the words I read to you from the complaint, a significant number of members of this House feel that comments made during official legislative sessions have created an uncomfortable environment. This is contrary to our House rules and cannot be tolerated. We must, we must hold ourselves to a much higher standard of speech and conduct. One of the complainants stated that not only was she offended by the comments, but even more so by the fact that these are public proceedings and are viewed by people all over our state and beyond. This is certainly not the image we need to project to our constituents and to the citizens of our state. Friends, I don't know about you, but I consider it a great honor to serve in this body. We are seen here for a very respectable and honorable purpose to serve our constituents and conduct the business of our great state. There is no place for effitents, for regulatory statements, slurs, or sexually related comments or jokes. Period. As chair of the House Ethics Committee, I declare that such speech or acts are totally unacceptable and going forward, there will be a zero tolerance for such. I'd like to ask if you would put my little slide on the screen and ask if you would like to hear me. I just want to show this to you. Inoffer it to you is something that would be very helpful for us. Now this is the rotary full-way test. It says of the things that we think, say or do. First, is it the truth? Second, is it fair to all concerned? Third, will it bill goodwill and better friendships? And fourth, will it be beneficial to all concerned? Now I admit this is old school, but I'm old school. But I promise you, if you will run the things you think do and say through this funnel, not only will we eliminate the issue that brought me to this well, but we will be a better person. And this House will be a better place in which to do the important work that we are sent here to do. Should anyone have a question related to this, you can please come to see me and we'll discuss it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We're now going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 745. House Bill 745, I have some of Jackson 128th, being taught in the act of men, the act of reconstituted Board of Education of Washington County, this bill I've referred to the Committee on Intercomble Coordination. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the representative, Mac Jackson, to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to present HB 745. This bill will allow the Washington County School Board to have nonpartisan elections. I'm very proud of the work that our school board is doing. I start the school in 1957 in Washington County. And this is the first time that we've had an act of African American as school superintendent of Washington County. Dr. Ricki Atman was appointed by the school board in 2018. He alone with the school board are doing an incredible job in educating the youth of Washington County. They're unified in all decisions made by educational system. And because of the leadership that they've displayed in the school board, I have agreed to carry this bill for the Washington County School Board. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And if there are no questions, I ask for your favor or consideration. You have no questions. I yield a well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 745. The eyes are 149. The nays are nine. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption. I'm sorry. What purpose does Representative Jackson rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move that this bill House Bill 745 be immediately transferred to the Senate. On the gentleman's motion that House Bill 745 be immediately transmitted to the Senate, is there objection? Is there objection? The chair hears none and it's on its way. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 9. Senate Bill 9 by Senator Anderson of the 24th burns of the 23rd, strictly the 17th mill of the 49th, and all is the 53rd and others to be entitled to act to create a new judicial circuit for the state of Georgia to be known as the Columbia Judicial Circuit, to be composed of Columbia County, this bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Newton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was challenged by the minister today, and I'm honored to serve along each side of you and the roles that we have. Today I bring you Senate Bill 9, a bill that just passed unanimously in the Senate, which creates that Columbia Judicial Circuit through a division with the Augusta Judicial Circuit. I'm honored to represent both counties involved in this, the Richmond County and Columbia County, over the past two decades, the proposal of the split has long been discussed, as the population of Columbia County has continued to rise exponentially. Today due to that growth, the Augusta Judicial Circuit represents the largest multi-county district circuit in the state, with more growth expected in the current situation of judges, now is the time for this division to be realized. In 2018, across the way, Senator Harold Jones asked for a circuit boundary study on the Augusta Circuit. At that time, of the eight judges allocated to the circuit, four in Richmond County, which was larger, and four in Columbia County, which was smaller. Because of the relatively high number of judges residing in Columbia County, the studies review of Columbia County's ability to stand at that time as a single-county-county circuit did not get a recommendation. Since the time of that study, however, a judge of the Augusta Circuit, who lived in Columbia County, has retired, leaving Columbia County now with three judges, a number that based on the Judicial Council has since determined as the ideal number, based on the caseload and workload. Columbia County has been preparing for this split, and back in September of last year, a tremendous facility was appropriate to house the judges and the district attorney of this potential Columbia circuit if and when the time comes was acquired back in September. The strong point is this proposal has received the support and written endorsement of the commissions of both Columbia County and Richmond County, which represent 95% approximately 95% of the circuit population. Across the hall, after receiving two amendments on the Senate floor by Senator Jones, both to further ensure that the effect of the split would not disrupt the Augusta Circuit, Senate Bill 9 passed unanimously 51 to nothing. I'd be appreciative if you would vote in support of this, which I think as I say is supported by both the counties I'm honored to represent and I'd be glad to answer any questions. Mr. Speaker, in yield. You do not have any questions. Thanks for our yield to well. We have two other members that wish to be heard on the bill. The chair recognizes representative Frazier to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And to my colleagues that rise today to oppose SB9. The judicial split legislation for Columbia County from the Augusta Tri County Circuit, which is composed of Augusta, Columbia, and Burke counties. The question I ask is, why now? I ask that question along with others that are in Augusta Richmond County. Why now? A circuit that has been together since inception in 1870 over 151 years.

The Augusta Richmond County Circuit has had a good run for those 151 years because it is one of the last few of the Tri-County Circuits in Georgia. And for years, I know that the change is inevitable for prosperity and growth in Augusta Richmond County. However, change must be done for the right reasons, especially in today's society where there is so much racism and divisiveness. Columbia County's decision to split from the Augusta judicial circuit continues to baffle not only myself, circuit judges and the citizens of the Tri-Circuit because of the abrupt move now. While putting the Augusta judicial circuit at a disadvantage as it relates to the number of judges needed to hang and ever increase in caseload in Augusta and Berk counties, I represent part of Augusta and all of Berk counties. So the person that made up my constituents have asked me still is what is the reason why now are we splitting? Three weeks after the November 3rd, 2020 election and after Richmond, Berk and Columbia County residents elected the first African American District Attorney and a Democrat ever, a resolution was voted on unanimously by the Columbia County Commission to split the circuit. Now, my colleagues from Columbia County will come to this well today and justify this split with call savings of a million dollars to the taxpayers. They're probably going to say and has been said that it's been making a few years ago they validated a 2018 study committee that substantiates this split a call saving of one million dollars each year. I calculate that at about two million dollars that that could have been saved by Columbia County had they split back in 2018 when the study committee came out. Now, that's not being fiscal conservative for a tax payers dollars. That's two million dollars that we could have saved. I stand here today to go on record as I promised my constituents in Richmond, Berk and Columbia County to answer that question again why now? The snake has reared his ugly head again here in Georgia that we are noted across this country of his races and discriminatory practices. A time in history where we should be celebrating another first in Richmond, Columbia and Berk County where our constituents elected the first African American Attorney and breaking the racial barriers we are once again showing Georgia and the country who we really are. A state that is still judging each other by the color of our skin. I ask you to vote against SB 9 and send a strong message that racism cannot be tolerated in Georgia now or forever. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a well. Chair recognizes representative Howard to speak to the bill. Good afternoon, colleagues. I come to the well today to speak to something that I think all of us are going to be doing. To speak to something that I think all of us should touch our hearts or touch our hands today on what button are we going to push when it comes to the end of this. It's time to vote for this measure. I'm not sure exactly where you are as a DR and R. Sometimes it comes a time when you have to put that aside and go what your heart tells you. And there are three things that we should consider our I would I ask you to consider. What are we dealing with here? We're dealing with an issue that has come before us that district. A district attorney was elected for the first time. First time ever in the Augusta judicial circuit. And as my colleague just told you 150 years over 150 years, we for the first time ever elected an African American mail to our judicial circuit. Now that's big time. That's that's really moving forward. As we see our elections begin to or we begin to see the participation of folk voting and electing people that look like Georgia. Not just one particular look. And we should be proud of that because y'all pass by me back in that corner. Throughout the day because I'm in a unique spot. And we connect and we bump in arms and we're shaking hands, you know, not as much shaking hands as we used to. And I think a lot of you all everybody in this chamber. I think a lot of you. And I would hope that you think a little bit about me. Because it goes beyond what we vote on in this chamber, how we vote. Sometimes you just have to vote your conscious and your conscious leads you in the right direction. Now why are we voting today to split a circuit? And this true. We several years ago a couple of times there was an attempt to split the circuit. And it was vehemently rejected by the journey of turning county. I'm in Richmond County and this is a split for Columbia County. Columbia County vehemently rejected it when we attempted to do it back several years ago. Now the question that my colleague just asked you why? And the answer is simple. You don't have to really dig in deep to try to figure it out. Why? Because an African American male was elected for the first time 150 years, y'all. And we worked with every district attorney that has ever come through that circuit. When I said my dad was here, he worked with the district attorneys that were other elected officials before me. And we worked with every district attorney that has ever come through there. It's never been a problem. So why now? Why? And we are saying that we want to move forward and we want to work together. We want to be united as a state, as a city, as a country. We can't get there when we do things like this. We can. We'll never get there. If we're going to do things like this. So I plead with you to vote your conscious. I plead with you to vote no on this bill. Send it bill nine. Thank you. I'll you the will. That's all the members that wanted to be heard on the bill in debate. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. There has been a minority report filed. And under the rules of the House, 20 minutes will be given to the speakers on the minority report. The chair recognizes representative Sheila Nelson on the minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. I rise in total opposition to Senate bill nine because I believe the voter spoke with the elected who that elected, which was the first African American district attorney for the three counties in the circuit. And my first question was why now? But then my answer could not be to save money because we could have saved money years ago. I ask my colleagues to support me in voting no with Senate bill nine. And I yield the well the rest of my time to representative Evans. Chair recognizes for the balance of the minority report representative Stacy Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. We've heard this morning, this afternoon that Senate bill nine is going to save us money. It will not. It's going to create an unnecessary expense at least $1.3 million of state funds. Certainly, we could find better use of $1.3 million in these challenging times. This is not to mention the $3 million that this will cost Richmond County, Berk County and Columbia County at the least. Senate bill nine would create inconsistencies among judicial circuits. Proponents of the bill claim that Columbia County is too large and it should be removed from a multi district, a multi county district. That it's uniquely situated. That it's the only county in a multi county judicial circuit like this. It is not. There are other circuits of comparable size with multiple counties, namely Newton County is in a five county judicial circuit of similar size to the Augusta circuit. O'Coney County has requested to be removed and have its own judicial circuit. Why would we treat Columbia County differently from everyone else? This bill is a solution in search of a problem. I was on the committee that heard this bill, the judiciary committee was part of the majority of the minority that voted no. There was not one single piece of testimony in that bill that cases were not moving efficiently, that they were not moving effectively through the current judicial circuit. And believe me, if lawyers had complaints about their cases moving slow and they thought that having another circuit would help them, they would have been there to tell us. We heard nothing like that. Proponents of this bill specifically, Senate bill nine, proponents of this bill were opposed to any change like this in 2018 after a study was done of the circuit. And I asked in committee, has anything changed? Not the size, not the caseload, the answer no. But ladies and gentlemen, one thing has changed. It's my colleagues from the Augusta area have already told you for the first time the Augusta judicial circuit elected an African American district attorney. I don't even know that the ink was dry on the certification of the election before we started hearing that Columbia County needed its own judicial circuit. That district attorney will now represent Augusta, Richmond County, Burke and Columbia counties. Richmond County and Burke counties are majority minority districts, but Columbia County is 73% white. 73%. This timing cannot be ignored. Why would the same people want this now? They didn't want it in 2018 and they told you that nothing changed. Something changed. At a time when we have judicial positions in this state unfunded, we've heard about the backlog that we're going to have to deal with when this emergency emergency lifts. We have better places to spend money on the judiciary than appeasing one county that doesn't like its new district attorney. Please join me in voting no on Senate Bill 9. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Okay, under the rules of the House, we now have the chairman's time. The chairman of the committee from which the bill came chairman illustration is recognized for the chairman's time 20 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. As I've been listening to the debate today, I'm struck by the fact I'm in a position. I don't think I've experienced yet in this body as a member. And that is I'm here today to defend members of the Senate. In fact, to defend every Democrat that voted on Senate Bill 9 in the state Senate because this measure was passed unanimously in the state Senate this session. The any assertion that is made with respect to the members who are making arguments here any assertion that's been made from this well that action was taken because of an outcome of an election last year completely ignores the fact that Senate Democrats supported this bill. That they voted for it that a practicing attorney senator Harold Jones, the distinguished senator who represents part of this area, supported the legislation, the minority whip of the Senate. And so an assertion by the minority party here to claim some sort of inappropriate reason or basis for this bill coming about. I think disparages inappropriately are colleagues across the hall. Now, what I want to do though is walk you through what changes we do have here because there's one change you may notice that it's a substitute and it is one non substantive change. And that is in line 90 to 97 there was a typo there was a typo in the Senate bill that passed out that identified the district attorney as a non partisan official. Well attorneys know that DA's in Georgia have to run partisan cannot run non partisan as as a elected prosecutor. And so that was addressed in section 2-1a that is the only change from the bill that passed out of the state Senate. Some other important things for you to know this process was started years ago with a study taking place well before any election had occurred or an election outcome as is being posited here today. It's just simply not the case this study was underway and had occurred and by the way was started at the request of Senator Jones. The funding for this has already been approved in the budgets that have been considered and passed. So if you voted for the budget you have voted for support for the funding that will result from passage of Senate bill 9 if it passes. I'll just close with this I think that many times the politics of the moment drive debate sometimes to try to focus on facts that are out there. Taking a position to oppose Senate bill 9 and attempting to support it based upon an argument about what happened in an election. I think that that doesn't do just consideration to the measures that we really have before us. The fact that Senator Harold Jones the Democrat minority whip began this process seeking a study back in 2018 I believe it was that that ultimately culminated in Senate bill 9 which the state Senate this year passed out unanimously. 51 to zero with every Democrat voting voting in favor of it. And now here in the House there's a minority report and we're left to debate it. I think that consideration of the issue is is very important and it's something that we ought to do. But to attempt to disparage our Senate colleagues in such a way is just simply not appropriate not urge your favorable consideration of Senate bill 9. Gentlemen is yielded well. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that many members have spoken to racial implications of this bill and yet still members are supporting it? I'm not sure I understand the parliamentary inquiry but what purpose does chairman Setslow rise? You waives what purpose does representative Malo rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that this bill would drastically affect employer retention and the Augusta judicial circuit causing them to have a short fall of employees when we know we have a judicial emergency. Is it not true that this bill would be approved by the committee? I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate bill 9. The eyes are 96, the nays are 70. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 247. Senate bill 247 by Senator Anderson, 24th Walker, 20th. Miller, 49th Goodman, 28th. There's a 13th to know to be titled back to them in Article 2, Chapter 8, and Title 2 of the official go to Georgia and intending relating the agriculture commodity commissions generally. So is there play certain public hearings with online public comment and opportunities? This bill I refer to the committee and on that culture and consumer affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House will bring to you today Senate bill 247. Senate bill 247 is related to the commodities title, commodities act of the Georgia code within the current act of what we're doing is amending to allow for virtual meeting state place in the current environment, the which we are operating. It will also allow the commissions to publish their notifications for meetings and currently under the code it says it has to be published in the capital of the state, IE the Atlanta Journal Constitution. This will give members of the commodity commissions the ability to publish those meeting notifications in a senator, a senator publication or in the Georgia Farm Market Bulletin. So, additionally, Mr. Speaker, what this bill will do will make changes or any changes that are to be made to any of the commodity commissions will require two thirds vote and at least a 25% response from those in the affected areas to renew a commission would also require a two thirds vote of the respondents to the involved in the area of the commission which the commission is involved. Mr. Speaker, those are the things that this bill does. I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any. You do not have any questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I ask for your favor consideration and then ask for Mr. Speaker. Are you able to well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill?

This bill have for the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends a dispel do pass. The chair recognizes chairman balinger to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a real simple bill. We passed something very similar that was that I was the author on. It allows it still allows for a referendum for package sales. It just allows for the placement of the referendum on the ballot to occur with either a vote of the city council. The bill has a signature or a 20% signature by registered voters in that city or county. So that's what the bill does has two options. Like I said, it has either the signature requirement or a vote of the city councilor county commission. I'll be happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge your favorable consideration of this bill. The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

This bill, I am further from the committee on education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. You are ready to go home for the rest of the day. I will take a deep breath or two. I will be some serious prayer overnight about what we do tomorrow. Chair recognizes Chairman Timothy Barr to present the bill. It is a hard act to follow, sir. Thank you. Colleagues, I have a bill that we previously passed out of the house, so I feel fairly comfortable presenting it here. I was the author of the other bill. This bill will allow local boards of education, another tool in their toolbox. This is the use of small motor vehicles of eight passengers or less to transport students. The state board of education will set the minimum.

standard requirements for these vehicles and then the local boards may additionally add requirements as they so choose this is an opt-in to transport children. We've already looked at this bill so I'd stand for any questions. You have no questions. Thank you colleagues. I would ask that you mash the green button for us on this one. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to.

Clerk will read the caption to Senate bill 32. Senate bill 32, Senator Brass, 28th Roberts, 29th Berk, 11th Alvers, 56th.

The fiscal to Georgia and Tate relating to when public disclosure not required so it's too exempt certain personal records of state and federal employees from public disclosure. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The bill recognizes representative Gullet to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to present Senate bill 32. Current law defines state, county, and city employees as public employees that can be exempt from public records. This bill simply adds federal employees to that definition. The bill also adds public employees personal mobile and wireless telephone numbers to categories of records that are exempt from public disclosure requirements. And lastly, the bill creates an exception for the home addresses of the licensees being included in the roster of current licenses for each of the various professional licensing boards. Mr. Speaker, as all this bill does, I'm happy to answer any questions that are any. You have a question if you care to yield. How will yield? Chair recognizes representative Maynard in the gallery for a question. Do you yield, sir? Or yes, straight ahead to the right. I do. Does this bill at all help elected officials that have been soft so their information is not posted to the public? So yes, as a state employee it would. Yes. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, the other questions. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 32. The committee, the eyes are 165. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 114. Senate Bill 114 by Senator Robertson, 29. The 30th. The 51st. The 18th. The 11th and others. The title of the act to amend. The committee, the general provisions regarding the provisions of the bill will be passed. Chair recognizes representative Mom the hand to present the bill. Members of the House, today I rise to present Senate Bill 114. Senate Bill 114 announced those that have been convicted and felonies to obtain a professional license once they have been released in our under supervision. Right now, if someone earns an HVAC plumbing or other professional education in prison, they are unable to use the degree to get the professional license under Georgia code. The bill changes land and puts these folks back in the workforce so they can provide for themselves and families in a meaningful way. I hope you will join me in voting yes to this common sense measure. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I will yield the way. You have a question to secure you. I have your question. Yes, sir. I do recognize this chairman night to your right for a question. This gentleman you. I apologize. I just saw him read some of the bill and that's my fall. I should ask the question earlier, but does this bill as far as this part applied like a lot of the professional licensing board because they may have ethics within their licensing. I am curious about that. It could be a direct conflict with CPA or the ethics within the professional standards. I could hear the first part of your question. Does this apply to like the professional licensing such as a CPA engineer or other that have ethical parts to their licensure that could be a direct conflict. I am not sure I understand your question. Again, so you're well, let me ask you a question. If a police officer becomes the size of the income and engineer and they were gotten trouble for an ethical issue as a policeman for stealing, then they would be eligible to go to another board, another profession, and qualify and get licensed under that profession with the background and criminal history or stealing that they had done under the prior. That's right. I've been in question. So no, they wouldn't be qualified under this bill to do that. All this bill does is say, hey, under Georgia code today, if I have a family and I'm under direct supervision, right? Under Georgia code today, I cannot apply for that license. If I otherwise qualify for that license, so you'd have to otherwise qualify for the license to be able to get the to be able to qualify under this new code section. Still the German apology, I still do not understand. I'm sorry. Let me speak out of the way. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Bentley rise? Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, I was going to ask the author of this bill exactly how this legislation will impact the funeral industry and because I did not get a chance to get a clear answer, I will be voting no for this bill. Next time you'll stay in the will of it. What purpose does the minority caucus majority caucus will representative Kelly rise? Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. I'm hoping to clear up a few questions here. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that all we're doing here in terms of the types of crimes where an individual is still able to get license deals with whether they're currently under supervision for probation. It doesn't change any of the moral turpitude laws are currently in place or applicants of license is only if they are still currently under supervision for probation. That is my understanding. What purpose does chairman Martin rise? Do what purpose does chairman Houston rise? It's my understanding that this involves people that Governor Dio tried to expand the education of people that when carcer rated and we have many people that are incarcerated who have been able to get license maybe as a EMT or as a fireman. When they get out of prison, they're still under commuter supervision but this just gives them a chance to work and that's who this bill is aimed at. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? I believe the lady is accurate in treating me. What purpose does representative L Williams rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker? I thank the gentle lady from Nashville for explaining the bill so well and so quickly. You're not talking about representative Monpan. Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate Bill 114. The eyes are 152. The nays are 14. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does chairman Newton rise to make a motion? I move to immediately transmit Senate Bill 9 to the Senate. Chairman Newton has moved the Senate Bill 9 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Is there objection? The chair here's none and it's on its way over there. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 185. Senate Bill 185 will center a hatch of the 50th County of the 18th cows with 46 curbats with 30 seconds off of the 50 second of others. The title of the next two minutes after two, a total of 48 is physical or Georgia and Tate related state administrative organization administration and enforcement of revenue and taxation is bill. For the committee on judiciary, the committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Todd Jones to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For those members who were here last year, we took up taxpayer fairness also known as Chevron Deference on Sinney Die. This chamber passed it unanimously. Unfortunately, we were not able to find a position with the Senate that worked. We have in fact done that now. That is Senate Bill 185. Effectively, the biggest difference between last year's bill and this year's bill instead of the Deference being taken away for all regulatory and subregulatory rulings, it only takes deference away for subregulatory rulings. So that means that if anything did not go through the administrative act, the tax tribunal court does not have to give it deference and the tax tribunal court judge can in fact weigh evenly the taxpayer's argument. And the government's argument or the deal is argument to be able to come to an interpretation of what the proper ruling is. Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for questions. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Ridley to your right for a question. This is my friend, Chairman, yield. Yes, sir. I've got a question. It ain't just my question. The floor leader of Warwicky also has the same question. Could you please tell us what Chevron difference is? Is that got anything to do with the Exxon or? In fact, Chevron Deference does not have to do with the oil business, but in fact to a scotus ruling regarding when a judicial authority will take deference to a regulatory ruling. Thank you for clearing that up for us. You're welcome. You do know what a scotus ruling is. Chair recognizes chairman Timothy Barr to your left for a question. Do you yield, sir? Yes, sir. Does this bill not protect the taxpayers of our state? That's in fact exactly what this bill will do. It creates a level playing field for the taxpayers when they believe they have a cause of action against the DOR. And thank you for asking the question. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield to well and ask my colleagues for their favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 185. The eyes are 162. The nays are four. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does the Speaker Pro Tem of this House rise make a motion? Like to commit recommit Senate Bill 117 from rules back to the Judiciary non-civil committee. The Senate Bill 117, by the way, is in the middle of the 49th cows on the 46th and in the Part A of the 31st painted 54th, the Kennedy 18th and others. The Utah and Act to amend chapter 6 in Title 16, Article 111 of Chapter 10 of Title 17, Article 2 of Chapter 3 in Title 35, Title 42, and Article 112 of Chapter 2 in Title 49. On the ladies' motion, the Senate Bill 117 be recommitted from rules to the Judiciary non-civil committee. Is there objection? Is there objection? Chair, here's none and it is so ordered. What purpose does representative lever it rise? Mr. Speaker, I move that the House rules be temperous, suspended, so that the group of local bills may be read for the first time in the Senate Committee. I'm going to ask the clerk to read the bill numbers and the author of each. Okay, can you read? Unnumbered House Bill by Reservoirs of Gaines, 117th, Clark County.
