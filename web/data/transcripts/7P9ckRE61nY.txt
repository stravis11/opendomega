We will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced
by the gentleman from the 27th House District, Chairman Lee Hawkins, Chairman Hawkins.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You know, there are God put special folks on this earth and there are artists that can
paint a portrait and you swear that the eyes are following you when you move around the
room and you put pastors on this earth when they preach you swear that they're speaking
directly to you. Why have the privilege of having one of those pastors is my
pastor? You know you get attached to folks and I've always gotten attached to
the previous pastors and I've got attached to this one very much so I think
everyone that goes in that church leaves after his sermon feeling a little bit
better and a little bit more uplifted with his messages. My Reverend is Scott
heard. He grew up in Decatur, Georgia. He attended Avondale High School,
graduate from Young Harris College, and then went on to the
Chandler School of theology at Emory University. While doing his
seminary, he was the youth pastor in our church, the Gainesville First
United Methodist Church. That was 82 to 85. We had the opportunity to have him
come back as our senior passion. We took that opportunity two and a half years ago and
it's been a great time having him there. Scott is married to Sandy. They have three
children, three girls, Allison, Carolyn and Sarah and I'm proud to introduce my
Pastor Reverend Scott Herndt.
I've got to live up to that.
Wow.
Okay.
Speaker Austin, Chairman, and Friend, Lee Hawkins, and distinguished members of this body
and guest.
Thank you for this high honor.
I look out across this and what I think of is a three-month church council meeting.
And Lord, y'all do need prayer every morning, don't you?
I understand you had a Baptist preacher a couple days ago.
We Methodist, right?
We Methodist never liked to follow Baptist, so here we go.
Every now and then my wife Sandy will say to me, you know that no matter how loud you
yell at that TV, the people on the screen can't hear you. Now come on, come on, y'all yell
at the TV, you know you do. You're yelling at President Trump or you're yelling at Adam
Schiff, you're yelling at a Democrat, you're yelling at a Republican, you're yelling at
Sean Hannity or you're yelling at Don Lemon, maybe you prefer to yell at your radio.
I don't know.
There's a lot to yell at on the radio too, isn't there?
It seems today we all have opinions and we don't always have, whether we have the facts
or not and having facts, that's another story.
But it seems like we have a division today along the lines of halves and have nots, rich,
under-resourced capitalism, socialism, big government, big business, Republican Democrats.
Well, I'm a preacher.
So I want all for today in my 35 minutes that I have.
All right, here we go.
Because I got a few things to say, now I'm just teasing.
As a pastor, I don't offer just another framework this morning.
Years ago, I heard a preacher talk about a national conscience, a national conscience.
And that's always stuck with me.
I mean, you know that conscience is that thing within you that it helps you determine
what's right and wrong.
There are things that we don't have to teach each other.
We don't have to teach our kids.
We can't even explain it.
We just know that some things are right and some things are wrong here, right?
And so this preacher talked about a national conference conscience, and I got to think
about that.
There are certain things that we all, as a nation, agree are completely unacceptable.
I mean, we would never stone a single woman who became pregnant.
We would never do that.
I mean, we are just abhorred by that but that happens in some countries.
And there's some things that other countries do that really bother us and they don't think
anything of it.
You ever been to a beach in a foreign country?
There's some things that you just can't unsee after that.
I'm sorry I put that image in your head for the rest of the day right there in my band.
So what, here's the question, and I just want to kind of disinmoist live.
I want to kind of peel back the layers.
What forms a national conscience?
And I think when you peel back all of the layers that we'll find what informs our national
conscience is the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among them are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.
national consciousness and this is this is an opinion it's it's history was
shaped by sense of each person having a profound understanding of being
accountable to God I mean you think back it I mean isn't our isn't it wasn't
our national conscience that helped us forge the way through the anti-slavery
movement. It wasn't a national conscience that really drew us together, and we forged
our way through the civil rights movement. When it really came back to it, it was because
of our national conscience and a sense of being accountable to God. In the 1950s, words
From Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address,
we're kind of picked up and they were placed
in our pledge of allegiance, one nation under God.
And in 1956, Congress passed a joint resolution,
just take that in for a minute.
Congress passed a joint resolution
that in God we trust
should be printed on our coins, that wasn't that long ago.
But it feels like it's a million years ago, doesn't it?
That it's from our personal accountability to God that that's where we get our ought,
ought, and our ought not.
But when we see ourselves then as under God, we understand that God is the source of all
of our prosperity, not our hard work, not us, as well as the ones that we are accountable
to is God.
So that's what informed originally our national conscience.
So I want to add a couple of other choices this morning too, conservative, aggressive,
Democrat, Republican, big-government, small-government, rich, under-resourced.
And it's this, accountability to God or accountability to self.
God we trust. Or in we we trust. Can you imagine if we put first and foremost
every morning as we came in this room? Yes, no doubt. You are accountable to your
constituents. But before that, you're accountable to God. And this is the
promise from our Heavenly Father, 2 Chronicles 714, if my people who are
called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn
from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven. That promise I'll hear
from heaven and we'll forgive their sin and we'll heal their land. Let's pray. Gracious
God it all belongs to you. It all comes from you and it still belongs to you. We thank
you for the honor of this authority that you have bestowed upon each of these sisters
and brothers in this sacred space and may we look first to you and seek you that you
might hear from heaven and forgive us and heal our land and heal our country and we pray
this in the strong name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Savannah's capital since 1733, Savannah has served cornerstone of our state.
Savannah is known for the beautiful architecture, the rich history, the global cuisine, the
economic impact, not only for our state and our country but also for the world.
The host of City of the South welcomes more than 14 million people, remember we've only
got 11 in the entire state and 14 million last year in the home of the fastest growing
port on the planet earth.
We're thankful for the investments made in our community like Gulf Stream, the film industry
which is now doing Ozark in Savannah and we know we'll continue the Savannah with the
coastal region and flourish with all kinds of opportunity. We want to thank
everyone who traveled 250 miles to celebrate a savannah day here under the
gold dome and I hope that you'll join us tonight between five and seven at the
freight depot. I would like to recognize the mayor and council if they are here
for the city of savannah. Would you stand? Okay well they're over at the
Please come tonight. Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes the chair of the majority caucus, Chairman Hatchett, for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be joined by Chairman Pruitt and Representative Mathis.
You know, it's Savannah Day and they have a little celebration in Savannah on a certain day. I think it's March the 17th
But there's another city you go by on the way to Savannah
It's called Dublin and we've been having a St. Patrick's Festival
This will be the 55th year and it's run by a totally volunteer
organization and we're pleased to welcome today to that group this run in this
festival this year to the St. Patrick's Committee, Dublin R and St. Patrick's
Committee. Thank y'all for being here.
Chair recognizes Chairman Cantrell for a morning order. Thank you Mr. Speaker as
requested from the speaker, I bring to you a report from our movie last night that 100%
of our attendance remained for the end of the movie all the way through the credits.
And I want to give our members a great hand for 100% by partisan support for that.
And during that time, we noticed a very familiar name on that credits that belongs to
to the famous last name that belongs to probably the best,
the most important person in this chamber.
So, not named Ow Williams or anybody else.
The speaker's daughter, Elizabeth Rauston,
worked on that movie that we saw last night.
And so, we want to congratulate the speaker
on this daughter's great success.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Bentley, I wish you were in a better mood today.
I know you're kind of down.
Chair recognizes Representative Mary Francis Williams for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
You know, this house cranked out a pretty darn good budget last year.
And then the next thing you know, there's a $200 million whole in the budget, and the
public is being asked to bite the bullet.
I was elected to be the eyes and ears of the people back home.
Games are being played with this budget,
and I don't think this house has to play these games,
because it's Georgians that are going to lose,
and that's just not right.
And we all know it.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative McCloud
for a morning order.
I want to reflect on the budget as well. We cannot allow a budget that disguises itself
as a necessary tightening of the belt, but in actual fact, it will present more challenges
to the livelihood of many of our employers, otherwise known as the state of Georgia's
people or our constituents. In this budget, we offer educators a small pay increase that
allows them to barely live comfortably while reducing the little money they will have
for retirement. In this budget, we demonstrate that the healthcare is only for the healthy
Because we are decreasing funding to behavioral health and developmental disabilities by $24 million.
In this budget, we are allowing private prison owners to line their pockets with increased
funding of $2.5 million while taking out almost $44 million out of the budget for state-run
facilities.
In this budget, we are prioritizing the prosecution of people over the public defense attorneys
to protect them.
In this budget, we will be contributing to the mass incarceration by decreasing budgets
to the departments that provide resources for employment and rehabilitation by almost
$57 million.
At this time, when the United States of America leads in-
Ladies' time has expired.
I will continue.
I'm sorry?
Tomorrow.
Thank you.
That's what I thought you said.
I just heard it clarified.

Chair recognizes Chairman Tankersley for a morning order.
Good morning colleagues.

the Capitol.
