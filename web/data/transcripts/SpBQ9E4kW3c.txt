TRANSCRIPT
----------
for other. Director, I'd like to ask the bill to pass. We're exactly submitted in our Albers chairman. That completes the order. Mr. President. Gregor, as the senator from the 29th. Speak to the bill. The 29th. Speak to the bill. The Ministersjenz, thelegeness is the Just explain,talking about Q. anything they're being held there to wait to do process to determine if they're guilty or innocent and if they're going to go to prison or not or if they're going to go home. Prison is where people go after they have been adjudicated guilty by their peers. And we have certain obligations within prison to take care of these individuals. Those are required to have health care contracts, the required to have health care contracts that involve the physical health of the individuals, the mental health of the individuals, the dental health of the individuals, so forth and so on. But their limitations to what we should be required to do. And what Senate Bill 185 does is lays out those differences when it comes to certain type of gender assignment surgeries. The meat of the bill, the concern of the bill is on the last page, page four. Starks actually excuse me on line 66, except as otherwise provided for in paragraph two of this subsection. No state funds or resources shall be used for the following treatments for state inmates. State inmates is defined on line 15. And these procedures are sex, reassignment surgeries or any other surgical procedures that are performed for the purpose of altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics. Hormone replacement therapies and cosmetic procedures or prosthetics intended to alter the appearance of primary or secondary sexual characteristics. An important part is on line 73, the board shall adopt rules and regulations regarding the procedures and therapies prohibited by this subsection, which shall provide for the following limited instances in which the treatment set forth in paragraph one of this subsection shall be authorized. Treatments for medical conditions where such treatments are considered medically necessary, provided that such condition is not gender dysphoria or the purpose of such treatment is not for sex reassignment. Treatments for individuals born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including individuals born with ambiguous genitalia or chromosome abnormard, abnormard type of these resulting in invigually regarding the individual's biological sex treatment for individuals with partial and drondian insensitivity syndrome and Hormone replacement therapy treatment for state inmates who are being treated with such therapy prior to the effective date of this act, provided that the provision of such therapy is solely for the purpose of transitioning off such therapy. It's really simple. If somebody comes into the Georgia Department of Corrections and they have gender dysphoria, then they will receive the psychological therapy that they have been receiving before or if they have not been receiving it, they will have the opportunity to meet with therapists. Because understand gender dysphoria is mentioned for the first time in the DSM 5 and for the second time in the DSM 5TR and it is classified as a disorder and it is very clear as to what it is. And from a physical standpoint, when somebody comes in with a physical condition, they are required to seek, they are required to receive the same type of medical care equal to or better than the community around them outside the wire. When they come in with a mental health issue in a disorder, they are also required to receive help to deal with that disorder. But that disorder that help, which if you read conditions surrounding gender dysphoria, there are several things that, several other issues that can be displayed, it does not involve surgery. We had a very robust committee meeting about this. Several recent cases were brought forward. Something that we always hear is we are addressing a problem that is not a problem. Well, in this case, that is not true. There have been three cases filed against the Georgia Department of Corrections. And in looking at those three cases, we found a gap within the Georgia Department of Corrections. That gap being that they had no policy against these types of procedures. So, to solve that problem, this legislation was written, rewritten, and is being offered up to you today. People came to the committee meeting and said this will open up more opportunity for individuals to sue. And my response to that is I am fine with that. Every piece of legislation that comes out of this building is subject to being challenged in court. We say it many times, you can write the best piece of legislation you want. But until it is evaluated and pressure tested by man or a woman in a black robe, then you really don't know how good the legislation is. There will be people to say, well, I have this expertise, I have that expertise. So, I know. Well, I dare say that we have all been challenged in court on times when we thought we were going to win. And we didn't. And in times when we weren't sure if we were going to win and we did. I respect all of those who challenge the legislation. This thing has been written incredibly narrow. And please understand this is within the Department of Corrections. Every single thing that occurs within the Georgia Department of Corrections is paid for by tax payer dollars. This legislation is necessary. The individuals who are in Georgia Department of Corrections who suffer from anything, whether it be gender dysphoria, whether it be depression, whether it be schizophrenia, or any other mental health issue. And to use a word from the DSM-5TR disorder, they are being treated. And so all this does very narrowly. It says that we will not do surgery. To change someone's sex. And with that, Mr. President, I'll yield for questions or yield the well. A couple questions, Senator. I'll recognize the Senate from the 10th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Yeal? The Senator Yeal's for a few questions from my friend and then I'll yield for whoever else has a question. So what does that mean? Do I get one, two or three questions I ask? We'll make that information. I just don't want, and with all due respect, you and our good friends, but I don't want anybody to take up the vast majority of the time when I know there are other questions from the possibly, most likely from the same party, and I want to give everybody a fair chance. So that's fair. I yield to my friend from the Senate. I only have about three or four questions if that Senator. You mentioned when you were discussing this bill that there are no known cases of any surgeries having been performed in our Department of Corrections. Is that correct? Restate your question. I don't know of what. You mentioned while you were speaking that you knew of no known cases where anything in this bill, any of these surgeries had ever been performed in our Department of Corrections. Currently, there are three lawsuits in the Georgia Department of Corrections that I'm aware of, and my understanding is those are lawsuits and no surgical procedures have taken place within those cases. Can you expand on those lawsuits? Are those lawsuits trying to get inmates to have the surgery or Department of Corrections to be? Yes, three to three. My understanding, understanding is limited because these are ongoing lawsuits, and I've had the opportunity to talk to individuals involved on the judiciary side, and so the information you can get is very limited in this case. So there are two cases involving individuals who were understanding the information I have. Two individuals who were born male, who were attempting to transition to female, and one individual who was born female is attempting to transition to male. Thank you, Senator. Senator, do you? I do. Senator, are there any laws or anything on the books that would even require DOC on those circumstances to provide these surgeries? No, but what the gap I spoke of, the fracture that we found in the system, as I know you understand as a businessman, just if you don't have a policy against something that does not prevent somebody from challenging that, as by claiming that the fact that you do not have a policy would allow that type of behavior to happen. Senator, further you? I do. Senator, does it make sense to have a policy for something that really doesn't exist? Yes, sir. It does make sense. I think what we look at, and I really do appreciate the question. What we have found is that a lot of times the retort for when you see the tsunami coming, a lot of people want to wait until it hits the shore to start sandbagging and evacuating everybody and doing what you need to do. I think if you look at the temperature that not only are we experiencing here in the United States, and obviously by these three lawsuits, these things, people are attempting to do this, then it is the responsibility of this body and the body across the way to make sure we are prepared for what comes down the road. Because as someone who understands crisis management and other things, you don't wait. And I think you just alluded to the fact that you and I agree there are three cases. It is occurring, so it is here. So our job is to be good stewards of our state, to be good stewards of the Georgia Department of Corrections. We put policies into place that we feel are best to not only protect those housed in the Georgia Department of Corrections, but to protect the state, which is responsible for the Georgia Department of Corrections. Senator, thanks for responding. Let me correct one thing. I do not agree with you. I have not heard of any cases. I've spoken to Commissioner Oliver. I am not aware of any weariness. If you anytime in the history of Department of Corrections, this kind of surgery happens. Thank you for your response. But here is what I will tell you, and I am sorry that you do not know, but trust me on this, there are three cases. I recognize the center from the 41st. Thank you. Senator, do you yield? I do. Senator, you spoke about this bill being about prohibiting people from being able to have surgeries, but isn't it true that this bill also makes it so that people who are incarcerated cannot have home-owned replacement therapy? If the attempt of the home-owned therapy replacement is for gender transfer, yes. So Senator D. for the yield? I do. Can you explain to me why you were opposed to people having access to a very low cost medication that would allow them to continue the therapies that they've been receiving? First of all, the cost has nothing to do with it. The cost has, if we open up the door, for small opportunities to move into the area dealing with gender dysphoria, then easily. Could it be interpreted by any court or others that the door should be pushed completely open, therefore exposing us to surgeries, gender reassignment, and things of that nature? Do you further you? I will yield for one more question. Isn't it true that you began your statement by saying that gender dysphoria does deserve as a disorder in the DSM and therefore should be treated? And is it not true that hormone replacement therapy is a treatment for gender dysphoria? It is one treatment for gender dysphoria, but based on policies and procedures that will be put in place by the board after this legislation passes, I think that probably most likely will not be, but there are other treatments available. And I would encourage you to look into that, which I would be surprised if the Senator had not already. And I'll tell you what, Mr. President, I'll take one more question if there are any. You have no more questions. Thank you. I will yield the wealth. Secretary, read them, amendment. Mr. President, Senator Pairn of the 44th offers the volume amendment number one to amend Senate Bill 185, but replacing lines 84 and 85 with inserting with such therapy prior to the effective date of this act. And that completes the order, Mr. President. Senator, would you like to be going to have a minute? We're going to have a senator from the 44th. Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I've struggled over this legislation. For all the years that I've served as the state senator and the two years that I served in the House, I have always been committed to ensuring the dignity, humanity, and equality of all Georgians, especially the LGBTQ plus community who have been under near constant attack. Certainly this session, and many sessions before this, this one, I feel like we've done more bills this session, picking on transgender folks than we've done anything else. And in that a shame, when it's not a priority of Georgians that we pick on transgender folks, they want to know what we're doing about cost of housing. Among many other topics that we don't seem to be addressing, perhaps we're trying to distract from our low state minimum wage or pathetically low state minimum wage by throwing bill after bill attacking transgender folks onto the wall. But we also need to consider the public's priorities. And on the one hand, like the majority of my constituents and most Georgians, I don't believe that taxpayers should be responsible for funding the surgeries outlined in line 68 through 69 and 71 through 72, including gender affirming surgeries, cosmetic procedures, or prosthetics. But on the other hand, I believe that denying transgender prisoners access to gender affirming hormones that they are already taking, and in some cases may have been taking for years, is cruel and unnecessary. And I don't agree with the author. I don't think that allowing people to remain on hormones says anything about whether or not the state should be funding surgeries. Those are two very different things. Therefore, I rise to offer amendment one. For many transgender individuals, Hormone Therapy is a necessary medical treatment, and it's recognized as such by major medical organizations such as the AMA and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Forcing someone abruptly, or after a short period of wining, to stop taking these medications while incarcerated can and will cause severe physical and psychological distress. And it's unnecessary and it's harmful and it's medically neglectful, because the treatment is not expensive and it's not difficult to administer. There are a number of courts, increasingly ruling that denying necessary medical care of this sort constitutes a deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. And beyond the medical risks, a policy that cuts off hormones that an individual may have been on for years, exposes transgender prisoners to risks of increased violence and discrimination. We know that transgender inmates already face higher rates of abuse in prison, and the withdrawal of hormones can increase that vulnerability by forcing unwanted physical changes that can heighten the risk of abuse. If we allow, which I believe is the humane thing to do, allow transgender prisoners to continue this necessary hormone therapy, our prison system will uphold medical ethics, legal standards, and the fundamental principle that all people deserve for humane treatment. So because of this, I urge your support for amendment one. If it's adopted, I believe that SB 185 would offer a more balanced policy. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, however, I don't believe that taxpayers should be required to pay for surgeries, gender affirming surgeries, for incarcerated individuals. So I urge your support for amendment one, that I will be voting yes on the bill. In closing, please vote for amendment one. Because cutting off hormone therapy does not advance a legitimate state interest of any sort for incarcerated individuals denying incarcerated individuals hormones that they've been on for many years, and beyond not advancing any kind of legitimate state purpose, it's just cruel. So Mr. President, I'm happy to answer questions, and if not, I'll yield the well. Yeah, no questions, Senator. Thank you. I yield the well, and I urge your support for amendment one. We're going to have a center from the night. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today just to express my disdain with the way this body is prioritizing certain legislation, and we see this pattern has been coming up all session long. This bill is taking a non-issue that affects an extremely small amount of people in wasting legislative time. I believe this is the what, fourth or fifth trans bill we've seen this session, all because my colleagues on the right need a political target. We get it. You hate trans people. That is the message that we get loud and clear out of the four or five pieces of legislation that you keep harping on. Throughout this session, you hate trans people and you just want to make their life harder. And this is the target that you chose, a vulnerable group of people that don't have a lot of money or power to fight back. But this is your target. It's despicable. The amount of bills we've seen on trans is, we got it the first time. We've seen no bills to address out of control gun violence, a problem in the state right now and across our country. We've seen no bills about expanding health care, to give health care access to hundreds and thousands of people. We've seen no bills to expand housing affordability, a key issue this in all of our districts. I've seen no bills to really make our economy better. And in light of the Trump administration, economists are already sound the alarm that Trump administration policies are steering the American economy in a deep recession. That's going to skyrocket inflation, stifle business growth. And it is predicted that we are going to be in a recession higher than the great recession that we've had in the past. But by all means, let's keep dealing with trans issues while people are losing their jobs, while they don't have homes, while our kids can't read, while we're stifling funding and education. Let's just keep dealing with trans issues. This is going to save the state so much money. I just want to note that the Democratic sponsored bills have received very little hearings. The majority here wants us to play along and they're calling some of my colleagues to play along with their game here. But they won't give us a seat at the table for important legislation that we should be dealing with, actually, health shortages. No matter what any of us say, this bill is going through. It's going to go to it. It's going to pass. Conditions in our state princes are currently at horrific levels, really on constitutional levels. The living conditions in our prisons are at horrific levels. It's our job to take care of humanity. I get that we want to keep harping on trans bills. I think there's something missing here in humanity. How each of you views humanity and how you're supposed to love people and how you're supposed to take care of people? This is unserious work that isn't helping a single person in our state. Like almost other contingent bills that have come through, SB 185 is a sad, frivolous waste of time when we have so many other problems to address. Our constituents deserve better. Our states deserve better. And they deserve better than these cheap political stunts because it pulls well. With that, Mr. President, I yield well. Thank you, Senator. Recognize the Senate from the 14th. Thank you, Mr. President. The mood in here is weird. I've said that before. A lot of people in the anti-room quiet. We just got to get through this. It's painful. It's painful because you all feel like you have to do these bills. I know my colleagues have said how many of these are we going to do? I've got more specific questions about how many are we going to do part. I'm sort of curious how you figured out the mailer yet? How many bullet points? Because there is the rule of three. It does make sense to stop at three anti-transmolers. You already have the sports one you can do. And then you did the state health benefit plan. You already did puberty blockers. From a rule of three standpoint, you've already got your mail. A lot of consultants will tell you that the smaller that the font gets on a mailer, the less likelihood that the voters are going to read it. One aspect to this that you'll probably need to think about is if you do four or five or six of the bills, you start to get, you know where you get the back and forth email with your consultant where you're like, hey, I think there's too much text. Let's just drop puberty blockers. I think we should just do. The state health benefit one is good because it's tax payer money. Let's do that one and let's do sports because obviously sports is the best one we have. And then you argue over, well, let's just do one that's dedicated to sports because we'll do a mail program that's got 10 to 15 mailers. So we can save some of the later ones for like the narlay or stuff like surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery surgery. And then, you know, eventually once our mail programs complete, we will have convinced the voting public that we've protected Georgia from five people. Three people. Three people. Y'all know Senator Tommy Tuberville from Alabama. He had a quote, this was on Fox recently. I just saw this on social media. I'm going to quote Tuberville and please, if y'all cut this, like if you spliced this clip, please add the context that this is Tommy Tuberville's quote. But he goes, we're getting to a point now where women and girls sports are getting ready to be extinct because already in states across this country, we have high school teams that are made up of totally boys participating against girls. I mean, it's like it's like the fear talks and I talked about a minute ago. Am I right? We heard the word tsunami in the author's opening presentation. Just a wave of trans people, people running scared on an island away from all the trans people because the wave is 50 feet high. I've just

Trans people. Did you ever expect when you ran for office as a law and order fiscal conservative that the way you would win re-election or election to a higher office in 2026 would be to pass like six bills that target a tiny fraction of people and to come up here all serious and be like, we care so much about girl sports. Jonah here how many jokes I've heard about women's sports from people who you wouldn't expect to be overtly sexist over the last 10, 15 years. The differential in pay being justified, the fact that they don't, their arenas don't get packed out. But all of a sudden we care about girl sports. Or taxpayer money, we hear that a lot. Let's talk about the $4.1 million that the AJC found that Georgia's already spent on settlements and defense because of the lack of care that we're already providing. Like at some point, I get that, like when you get in the well, like we're by playing along with the idea that these bills have merit individually, we are covering up what's actually happened. It's very, very simple. There is a vulnerable group of people who don't have a lot of political power. There have been a couple trial runs, trial balloons on electoral success by beating up on them with bills and now we're off to the races. OK, if I did the legal history for you right now and said, oh, well, this court ruled this, you guys would be like, you on, check your phone. Because you know, you know it's unconstitutional. Like you know, if I were to quote a 2011 court of appeals opinion where the courts start waking up to the reality of the Eighth Amendment problem, the Eighth Amendment being the one that says no cruel and unusual punishment, i.e., you can't be denied medical care while you're incarcerated because you don't have the means to go get your own care. You're stuck. So the state has to provide your health care, right? And the study committee in question was the safety and welfare of all individuals in the George Department of Corrections. And yet, this bill just exempts medical care for one group of those individuals. So I guess not all. Look, to think that this is not medically required, that this is not a constitutional issue, you've basically got to think that the anguish that people experience when they have gender dysphoria just doesn't exist, or that it doesn't matter. What I'm going to ask all of you to do, if you vote yes, is decide which of those two things you think about the anguish that comes from gender dysphoria? Is it that it doesn't exist? Or is it that it doesn't matter enough? Because let me tell you, the only bill that has come through this chamber this year, though it would have a prayer of actually banning surgeries or whatever the scare word is, belongs to the senator back there. I can't see the number from Athens. It was a resolution to open up the United States Constitution and change it. That would have been the only legislative vehicle available to this body to actually get rid of hormone therapy, surgeries, and any other gender affirming care that is necessary. Like part of the problem, and I talk about these doors a lot, blocking us to the lived experience, can you imagine, and I'm being dead serious, can you imagine what it's like to be so out of touch with your own body that you attempt auto-castration? Think about that. To be so out of touch with your own body, so in anguish over the feeling of disconnect that you have with your own body that you attempt to castrate yourself. Now, the only times that surgeries have happened after they've been litigated, because it's bad enough without a policy banning them, it takes decades of court and litigation for the people who are attempting over and over and over again to castrate themselves to get a surgery. So they'll like five, whatever the tsunami of surgeries is, they're already decades of legal roadblocks for the people who get that. Let alone with the senator from 44th was talking about with regard to hormone therapy, which is a totally ordinary, do you know the hormone therapy's been in use in the US since the like the 1940s for kids, by the way? Kids, no medical diagnosis, kids. Why? Because boys and girls didn't match up to the gender stereotypes about how tall or short they were supposed to be. This is real. You can go look this up. But when did we start caring all of a sudden about hormone therapy for kids? And how irreversible in life changing was? When doctors and families decided in the privacy of their own space to start using those therapies for any different purpose except for gender stereotypes? When the culture and the social context changed, that's when all of a sudden protecting kids, protecting girls sports, all of these salute the flag but exclusionary policies started to emerge. So don't get it twisted. None of this is new. Gender dysphoria is not new. Hormone therapy is not new. Corrective surgeries are not even new. What is new is that as transgender people have started to find each other, have started to assert their voices more loudly as the science has improved and the medicine has become available so that people can get ordinary health care just like anybody else would expect as they have developed a sense of confidence and strength in being part of public life. The reactionary majority is saying not so fast. Don't run when you should be walking. In fact, don't even walk sit down. In fact, don't even sit down. Don't exist. So when we use words like a race and eradicate from the well, we are talking about what is ultimately a reactionary impulse to try to deny these people the right to live their truth. And in the meantime, under this bill, they're incarcerated in some cases harming themselves tragically. So look, if you don't think the stuff is real or that it matters, that is up to you. But don't go to your districts and say, we're saving taxpayer money. When those people sue and we pay out for defense and settlements, a multiple of what we would have paid just to give those folks health care, I would still go with three bullet points for the mailers, because I do think rule three makes the most sense. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. Regan, I as the senator from the 22nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I stand opposition to this particular legislation. First, it's kind of important to understand what the bill is really not about. It's actually about three things, but surgery is really one of the bottom areas, because it's so difficult to actually get, whether there are three pending cases or not. One of the first similar cases that ever took place as far as surgery is concerned, actually took 27 years for the person actually was able to get their surgery. Because there's a lot of stuff that you have to actually show before you can actually do it. They filed for it in 1992. It wouldn't be into 2021 that they actually finally were able to receive their surgery. The same actually would probably apply in these cases too, because it's not as though you can just say, I want to have surgery, it takes a lot to actually get to that point. So whether you file in cases or not is irrelevant, same with this person actually filed a case and took 27 years before they actually able to get it. The real aspect of this case is dealing with the hormone therapy and also, of course, the other cosmetics, which is in here, in this particular bill. And the thing about this particular bill looking at line 73 through 76 is it really does an outlaw, as which has been mentioned, hormone therapies or cosmetic procedure prosthetics. It is outlaws for persons who are suffering gender dysphoria, which obviously is completely unconstitutional equal protection violation. Because the simple fact of the matter is, if you're going to give it to one group of people, you have to actually give it to a person who's suffering from also from gender dysphoria. There's no reason not to do that. There's absolutely nothing wrong with trans people, but some of them suffer from gender dysphoria, similar to persons who may suffer from depression or any other element. Gender dysphoria is a recognized condition that someone has a true condition. And even if there are contrary opinions about that, that really doesn't matter. This contrary opinions about how to necessarily take care of an as-matter, they're contrary to sharing opinions about how necessarily to take to a person who has cancer, there's always contrary opinions. But the clear, actual scientific research is that gender dysphoria is recognized and that there's therapy which goes with gender affirming care. And that gender affirming care can be as simple as commissary items such as hair removal cream, razors, or pads to enhance or bond a person's body parts. Simple and really is that. And that's not me saying that. That actually comes from the Northern District of Georgia. Case just filed August 9, 2024. Where they ruled that the plaintiff who was actually trying to just get two commissary items, not surgery, commissary items, had a likelihood of success because of the fact that they were able to show that they had gender dysphoria. So simply put, this bill attacked something that never really happens. And that's the surgeries where the person's found lawsuit or not, we know that one of the first lawsuits that were filed to almost 30 years actually get resolved, it really actually goes to formal treatments and also the cosmetic treatments that actually exist. So we're arguing about here's commissary products more than anything else. And the fact of the matter is, right now, the Georgia Department of Corrections says that it will be the responsibility of the state or the contractor to render any needed medical care. And this particular bill actually says that basically having formal treatment or cosmetics, not surgery, can be needed medical care. That is the responsibility of the state. But also, once you understand something too, it is not a free ride. Because in the Georgia Department of Corrections, it actually does say that those products can be deducted from the prisoner's account. Obviously, that is not a lot, but it actually can be deducted from the prisoner's account. Look at the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 2019 also spoke on this issue. Under the heading, transgender, page 25, states that end-made with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria will receive, will receive, all proposed treatment plan to remote the physical and mental stability of the patient, including hormone therapy. And no treatment option is precluded. That was the rule in 2019 under President Donald Trump. And that remained the rule until today, where now they're trying to change it, because supposedly it became a good campaign issue. And that is the key. The rule in 2019 under Donald Trump was that an end-made could receive, all care, to help his physical and mental stability of the patient under the heading of transgender. And that that plan may include hormone therapy and no treatment option would be precluded. And to it was decided that it was a good campaign issue. And that person's believe they could run on it. So the law does not support this bill. The facts on the ground do not support it, because within the Bureau of Prisons, whether we're talking about Georgia or on the federal level, they actually have already said medically necessary care is something that they're going to do. This bill doesn't even support it, because it says we have medical necessary care, whether you're talking about cosmetics or hormone therapy, that is something that everyone else can take advantage of, except somebody who has gender dysphoria, completely wrong. But I know the law and the facts can never get in a way of what persons think is a good political issue. But actually it's really not a good political issue. And I'll talk about that in one moment. Before I get there, I want to say this, because there are many people who are watching and say that this doesn't really apply to them, especially African-Americans to some extent. They say this doesn't apply to me. I'm not LGBTQ plus, so this doesn't apply. First I would say humanity and respect concerns everyone. But I also would share this. This morning we passed SB 120, DEI Bill, which has everyone up in arms, especially African-Americans and it should be. This bill and the national narrative around this bill is that basically African-Americans are not qualified. Your children are not qualified. Your grandchildren are not qualified. The bill directly calls you a special interest. When the recent head of the joint chiefs was fired, he was called a DEI hire. A plane crashes and immediately people say it is DEI. From the exception of affirmative action, there was a narrative that African-Americans were not qualified. When's there would be a press conference about this bill? And persons would say that this bill and the global narrative around DEI is a race in black history month. They would say that it is in black colleges. They would say that it's actually a race in African-Americans. And people would nod their heads and they would clap to that. And I may be one of them. But I would tell you to look at that bill on page two. Because it says on page two, it says, it's illegal or wrong to provide special benefits to individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Understand that even though you may try to be separate yourself, those that you're going to say on Wednesday are trying to erase you, they're not separating you. So where are you going? So this idea is almost like being in a haunted house when you're young. And the monster comes out and you start pushing your friends up to the front. But you're back as to the wall. And so you push your friends up to the front to sacrifice them. But you're back as to the wall. Where is it that you're going to be going? There is nowhere to go. So although you may believe there's a separation, the people that did the DEI bill that everyone's going to come up here for on Wednesday and complain about, they don't believe there's a separation. You'll love right there with them. There is no separation. As I said just a few weeks ago, when you have that bus of hate, if you think it's going to miss you just because you do one thing, it's not. It will double back on you. And we have now seen this morning that doubling back. And so there's no sacrificing folks. There's no pushing anybody in front. Rawling this together. And we have to fight it together. But then someone would then bring you and say, put it such a good campaign issue. Wow, we just can't beat it. It's just such a good campaign issue. I would encourage you to tell them this. When they bring you that foolish notion, and I would tell you to encourage you to tell them this. And so unlike the presidential campaign, where they refuse to talk about economics, and they decided to walk around with Republicans who were war mongers and people that nobody even knew, our campaign will not be like that. I would encourage you to tell them, after 23 years of Republican rule, Georgia poverty is 14th in the nation. Thousands of children are going hungry. I would encourage you to tell them that 20% of the children live in poverty and that number is rising, especially when black and brown children. I would encourage you to tell them, after 23 years, Georgia is ranked 37th in the nation for child well-being. I would encourage you to tell them that Georgia's ranked 36th in the workforce, as far as persons making less than $15 an hour. And then I would tell you to tell them that Democrats are the ones that present a minimum wage bill that has not been passed. I would encourage you to tell them, after 23 years, 500,000 people are uninsured. And the fact of the matter is, the rule hospitals are closing, and our healthcare system is actually one of the fifth worst in the nation. But as Democrats who have been trying to push to actually spend Medicaid and that has not happened, I would tell you to tell them that we can continue with these horrible stats. And I would tell you to tell them that Democrats have real solutions to these problems, and that the solution that the other side is giving you is to pick on kids, talk about surgery that may not happen for 30 years, without a year or a while. I'm going to ask the senator from the third night. Thank you, Mr. President. America is long overdue for a returned common sense. A revival is an order. And it's time our party steps up to claim the empty seat that the Republicans left vacant on the common sense train the moment Elon Musk stepped foot in the Oval Office. So let's talk about common sense. There is a long list of medical procedures that incarcerated individuals in Georgia do not receive. Procedures that taxpayers do not cover breast augmentation, liposuction, rhinoplasty, hair transplant, fertility treatments, gastric bypass, laseyck, eye surgery, and even erectile dysfunction medication. If you are a prisoner in Georgia and you want any of these elected procedures, in other words, procedures that are not deemed medically necessary under the standards that govern prison healthcare, the state will not provide them, nor should it. This bill does not cut a single dollar from the state budget. Not one tax dollar in Georgia has ever been sent on spent, on sex change surgeries for inmates. So let's not pretend this is about fiscal responsibility. This bill simply makes explicit what is already the practice in Georgia, and yet here we are debating this as if it were some looming crisis, as if Georgia's prisons were on the verge of becoming gender-affirming care centers at the taxpayer's expense. Let me be clear, that is not the reality here in Georgia, that is not happening. There is no policy urgency on this issue, and I believe it is a complete disservice to the people we are elected to represent to pretend otherwise. But I am also a pragmatist, and the simple truth is that I cannot, in good conscience, support taxpayer-funded medical procedures for prisoners that we do not provide to law-abiding citizens who are struggling every day to afford basic healthcare. Because here's what I do know, if you are a woman in Georgia, cisgender or transgender, who cannot afford a necessary medical procedure, this state will not step in to help you. If you are a child in Georgia who needs mental healthcare, your family may be forced to wait months, even years, for treatment. If you are a pregnant woman in Georgia facing complications and need emergency care, you might have to drive hours to receive life-saving care, because we still have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country and hospitals that have closed or are on the verge of closing. We have a childcare crisis, an affordable housing crisis, and a wage gap that punishes women at every stage of their lives. You can thank 23 years of Republican leadership for that, but that is the reality we are living in. And until we fix that, I cannot stand on this floor and say that incarcerated individuals who've wreaked havoc in the streets of Georgia should have access to procedures that struggling Georgians outside of prison do not. That is not fairness and that is not justice. Now, let me be absolutely clear. My vote today does not change my commitment to the LGBTQ plus community. I believe that transgender people deserve full dignity, respect, and equal protection under the law. I will fight against discrimination and housing in employment and in health care. I will fight for protections that ensure transgender people in Georgia can live their lives safely and freely. And I will fight back against real attacks on LGBTQ plus rights, because those are the fights that matter. But I will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent. My job is not to follow the loudest voices. My job is to lead with reason, with fairness, and with an unwavering commitment to the issues that actually improve the lives of the people I serve. That is what I've done since my first day at the Capitol. That is what I'm doing today. And that is what I will continue to do into the future. And no one, not the far right, not the far left, and certainly not the people who prefer outrage over solutions will tell me otherwise. America is calling for a return to common sense. And I intend to answer that call, not by abandoning my values, but by standing firm in them. Thank you, Mr. President. And less there are questions, I yield the well. Yeah, no questions, Senator. Thank you. Recognize the center from the 40th. Thank you, Mr. President. Three years ago, I stood in front of this body and told you all that I am the parent of a trans child. I had barely said those words to myself when I said them. I had told very few people, but the reason I came to the well to say those words that day is because I had listened to this debate. It was the first debate about the sports issue. And it felt like we were debating a political football instead of people. And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people, children, parents, families. Some of you were here when I told that story, some of you weren't. But that story is really the story of my children who are now young adults. It is not really my story. It is their story. I remember when I first learned about boys and girls, I was in kindergarten. And I learned the words lassi and latti. Do you remember those words? There was a song about them. Have you ever seen a lassi go this way in that? Have you ever seen a latti go this way in that? I played it on YouTube in my car on the way here today. I really wish that it was that simple. I have heard many of you say when you present bills, there's girls, and there's boys, and that's it. But for me, even though I would like it to be that simple, it is not. So I feel when we discuss these bills in this chamber, and my goodness, have we discussed them a lot, and spent so much time on them. And I sit in my chair in a feel like I'm on a little tiny island in the middle of an ocean, and I'm completely by myself. And there are huge continents out to my left, and out to my right. And out to my left is the Democrats saying, I know this is true. And out to my right are the Republicans saying, I know this is true. And here I sit on my little island saying to myself, I don't know. I don't understand this. I am not comfortable with this. But I must tolerate that ambiguity because I must love my children. We are all lucky enough to have been born into a country that offers freedom. But with the freedom, you have to have tolerance. Because if you don't have tolerance, you begin chipping away at that freedom. If we allow people true freedom, it's going to make all of us a little bit uncomfortable from time to time. But we have to be tolerant in order to protect everyone's freedom. We have to deal with things that we don't like. I keep hearing over and over again that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for surgeries medically, if you consider gender dysphoria a disorder, that taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for that. But we all have to sometimes pay for things we don't like. And in this case, it's probably pennies. If you take the expenses that could be associated with gender dysphoria, with prisoners, and divide that up amongst 11 million people, we are probably talking about spending pennies each on something that some of us are uncomfortable with. So what this begins to feel like, and I'm back to why I came to the well to talk about this subject three years ago, what this is feeling like, is it feels like we're discussing, we're dealing with politics instead of people, particularly with this bill. Maybe not with some of the other ones, but with this bill, which is why I've come to the well, I've been pretty quiet on this subject the last few years. But this feels like putting politics before people. I feel like this is all about those TV commercials we all saw during the presidential election. I think we're very distasteful commercials during the presidency. And people realize that that issue could score about 2%. But in a race that's close and in races that are close, that 2% can be about winning or losing. So it feels like this topic, particularly with this bill, when I hear people talking about it, whether they're Democrats or Republicans, they're talking about politics. But people. Now there are very few institutions left in our country where people from the right and people from the left come together in the same room and have to fight out issues. Very few institutions. We all live in our bubbles these days. But this institution right here, this chamber, the chamber across the hall, the chambers across the country, this is one institution that's left where people from the left and right have to come together. And so it is really, it is our responsibility to lead the way, to demonstrate tolerance, to have those serious conversations, to help heal the divide that is killing our country. And bills like this that put politics before people only widen that divide. But they also hurt people. Every time one of-

These bills comes up. I have to worry about my children. I have to worry about how they are internalizing it. And every parent of a trans kid or a trans person has to worry about that. So I invite you to sit down with me, have a quiet conversation. We can listen to each other. And if we have that conversation, you might be surprised by some of the things I say. And I might be surprised by some of the things you say. But if we have those quiet conversations instead of fighting out these politics and bills that just further the divide, then perhaps we can learn from one another. Thank you, Mr. President. And if there are no questions, I yield the well. You have no questions. You have no questions. Thank you. All right. I think we've got a last speaker, Senator, from the 56. And then we'll have the Senator from the 29th close of the debate. Thank you, Mr. President. On the first day of legislative session, I reminded you all of a debating trick. If you can't win the argument, you change the subject. Let's be honest, you as Democrats and your own caucus are divided on this issue. Throughout the last several votes, some of you voted with us, and others took a walk and did not vote at all. The overwhelming number of Georgians and Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, support this bill and the others. Candidly, if you vote against this bill, you are politically tone deaf. One day, I do sincerely hope and pray that those who would vote against this bill will care more about the victims than convicted criminals. Let's make sure we understand convicted criminals in the Georgia prison system. If you support sex change drugs and surgeries with taxpayer dollars for convicted criminals, I really believe you've lost touch with your constituents and your grip on reality. Folks, this is common sense. Some days, I think it's not all too common anymore, but I would sure hope you would use your common sense today and vote for this bill. I yield the well. Senator from the 41st, would you like to speak on it? Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to talk about the inflection of pain on another person, to talk about real pain faced by real people, and to talk about this body's dismissal of that pain indeed willful inflection of even more pain on those experiencing gender dysphoria in our prisons. You see, gender dysphoria is a mental health diagnosis. And when left untreated, we know the results. They are always tragic and sometimes fatal. What other diagnosis will this body decide to deny treatment for simply because someone has been convicted? What's next? Is it depression, suicidal ideation, psychosis, anxiety? All of these are diagnoses that a person can have based on their testimony, behavior, and the evaluation of a mental health care professional. Are we going to decide that those aren't real either? Despite the mountains of medical expertise that speak to the contrary, gender dysphoria is a mental health diagnosis. One that polls indicate that very few Americans have ever personally experienced, but nonetheless, it's very real. It's as real as cancer, as real as kidney failure, as serious as a heart attack. Gender dysphoria is painful and it's real. Can you imagine living and pain every single day? And there's a low-cost pill that could ease your suffering. But because a bunch of people who've never felt your pain have decided that it's not real, you don't get to have that pill. When we ban HRT, that's what we are doing to a fellow human being. We are leaving them to suffer. Removing all of the tools for treating that pain is fundamentally cruel. Deciding that one mental health diagnosis is not as real as the others, dismissing the pain of another's lived experience, it's wrong, and it's cruel. When a person who is incarcerated has a diagnosis, we, the taxpayers, pay for their treatment. Ghanaia, Chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis, lymphoma, high blood pressure, we pay for it. Depression, anxiety, and erexia, sacrosis, we pay for it. Cancer treatments that require medications covered. Surgical intervention needed covered. Diabetes that requires a daily medications, we got you. An application that's needed? Got you, it's covered. Broke your leg while committing a crime, no problem. We've got to split and crush us for you. Knit yourself while shanking somebody else. What we've got, taxpayer paid, stitches waiting just for you. Developed a coma, need dialysis, we, the taxpayers, cover it. And why do we cover it for people who are incarcerated? Why? Because we are better than the criminal who shows no regard for human suffering. We cover it because we have a moral obligation to avoid inflicting pain on another human being regardless of a crime that they've committed. We pay for medical care for people in prison because we have a constitutional duty to avoid cruel and unusual punishment. SB 185 is unconstitutional. It's unconstitutional because it denies health care to those who are in custody. We are denying them care. When we know that they have something that is very painful and yet very treatable, to deny this care is willful disregard of our duty to provide medicine and healing for those in prison who need it. As a society, we've decided that when someone willfully causes another pain and shows no regard for human suffering, doing so is a criminal act. Yet when lawmakers withhold treatment for those with certain medical health diagnosis is when we disregard their suffering and cause a measurable pain, well, they just call that Monday. But I want to take a step back for a moment. I want to take a step away from the issue of this General Assembly willfully choosing to inflict more pain on the minority population and turn to the Aether Minments of the Constitution. You see, the Aether Minment states that excessive bill shall not be required, nor excessive fines impose, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted. The Aether Minment doesn't differentiate between separate classes or categories for those in our carceral system. It doesn't differentiate between those at the General Assembly, Dezim's normal and worthy and those that the body doesn't understand. The Aether Minment applies to every person in our carceral system. And how do we define cruel and unusual punishment? Well, the Supreme Court defines cruel and unusual punishment as punishments that are arbitrary, unnecessary, overly painful, humiliating or degrading to human dignity. In a 2015 case, Diamond versus Owens, which sought to expose the harm endured by a transgender woman did not care for gender dysphoria, the Department of Justice issued a clear directive for all state prisons. The directive said that they must, that prisons must continue hormone regiments, that people came in needing at the time of incarceration. Bringing it a little closer to home, this body's disregard for the numerous lawsuits that have been filed in our state regarding anti-trans policies is just staggering. It's staggering that Georgia taxpayers have paid over $4 million in transgender discrimination cases since 2015. It's staggering that out of the 19 cases brought against the state regarding discrimination and transgender children and transgender people, the state has one zero cases. The taxpayer money spent on legal action far outweighs the funds we could have directed to the medical care for those in our prisons. Yet despite the staggering facts, the lawsuits, the directive from the Department of Justice despite the unconstitutionality of SB 185, despite the pain that this bill inflicts on a small population with a treatable mental health diagnosis, here we are, here we are again. But I wanna be clear, I refuse to be silent. I refuse to accept an unconstitutional cruel and unnecessary piece of legislation that that is going to be the norm here. I will not sit silently by and watch a group of Georgia citizens be crushed and beaten down by this body yet again. And before I take my seat, I wanna address the elephant in the room. I know good and well that public polling does not support gender affirming care for people who are incarcerated. But I am keenly aware of our history, a history in which public opinion has often not been on the right side of justice. A history in which public polling has often sided with the majority and further isolated and forsaken the minority. I know this is not politically popular, but I stand here today urging my colleagues to vote no on this bill, to vote no as a sign of your commitment to humanity, vote no for dignity, colleagues, I beg you. Do not let public polling persuades you to do something that you know in your heart. It's fundamentally unconstitutional and quite frankly, it's downright immoral. With that I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Senator from the 29th, would you like clothes? Thank you, Mr. President. First thing I'll address is the amendment. Again, if you read online 83th of the bill, it says, hormone replacement therapy treatment for state inmates, and this is talking about things that are allowed. Hormone replacement treatment for state inmates who were being treated for such, with such therapy prior to the effective date of this act, provided that the provision of the bill provided that the provision of such therapy is solely for the purpose of transitioning off such therapy. And there are processes to handle transitioning off such therapy. They don't cut it off. They help them transition off. So friends, asking you to vote now, amendment number one. I gotta tell you when I came up here to present this legislation, I knew there'd be some pushback. And you always try to anticipate what the pushback is, because I know we have some well educated, well skilled attorneys in the room. On both sides, I think we were counting up the other day. There's about nine attorneys in this room. Maybe we need to consider a piece of legislation to address that, but. But what I heard was, and I want to tell you, it's almost laughable. We're talking about this, and I heard somebody come up here, start screaming, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, and what I realized right then is that person didn't have an argument. If there's any hate, I can tell you where it's coming from. I'm a part of a caucus, and I've, the seven years I've been here, I've not seen hate against anybody. And I promise you those that say they walk amongst the transgender community, they walk amongst those who feel whether, whether they have a middle disorder to make some full of certain way, or whether they make a choice to fill a certain way, they walk around as if they were walking amongst this tribe. I promise you, in my 30 years, I've walked amongst that tribe. When they came here to meet at the ropes, I went out and spoke to every person out there. I worked in a large city law enforcement, I promise you I've walked amongst people that you've only read about. And some of these are people with serious mental health issues. And I heard people come up here and talk about Republican, Republican, Republican, Republican. And so my extemporaneous mind said they have no argument. They just don't like Republicans. And then I heard somebody throw out Elon Musk's name. I hate to tell you, but when I called Elon about this bill, he did not answer. It didn't happen. And listen, I heard well speeches, this sounded more like sermons than the speeches discussing a piece of legislation. And let me tell you my friend, any one of us can get a free time we want to. And we can start talking about anything we want to. And we can make it sound like anything we want to. But the citizens of Georgia put us up here to have serious conversations about issues. And we represent the state of Georgia. And if there's an apartment with an issue, if that issue can be solved, then we attempt to solve that problem. Nobody walked up here in a black robe. So you can stand here all day long and say something's unconstitutional. But until you earn yourself a black robe, which requires a lot of room to start with. And until you have a gavel in your hand, please, please forgive me. If I don't quiver and shake and sweat, when you say a piece of legislation is unconstitutional, that's just not me. But I'm going to tell you to come up here and deflect and call other people in this chamber haters to assume that there are certain segments of the population that the caucus that I represent don't like, hate, want to mistreat, want to segregate. All that does is show that you don't know. This legislation is really simple. You can pump all the emotion you want to in there. You can do all this other stuff. But let me tell you something. I can tell you one guy here doesn't hate anybody. It's a word we weren't allowed to use when I was a kid at home. Everybody knows the word. I have a tendency to use way too much when I'm locked in a room with my friends. I would have probably got away with using that word, which I never did before I would have ever gotten away with using the word hate. Because my mother said you had to go to a dark place to hate something. And the men and women that I serve in this body with did not hate anybody. So what you need to start doing is maybe break out your books, find you some experts, quit making it about politics. Because I'm going to tell you if we're talking about gender affirming care and if we're talking about gender dysphoria, then I'll tell you one thing that's not in my mind. It's not malers. And let me be perfectly clear. If you think you're a member of the Democratic Party, and I'm going to waste one bit of energy spending campaign money to do a waiver about you, then God bless you. I got more important things to do. The 200,000 people that put me in there put me in there. And if you love what people say here in the well, do be a favor, be quiet and listen. They don't need to hear the chatter. Let them say what they got to say. This is good legislation. This is compassionate legislation. If you don't like it, don't like it and don't vote for it. But quit making it political because that's what you're doing. Please vote down the amendment vote for the underlying bill. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. Senator has closed the date. All right. We're going to take up a amendment one. Offered by the senator from the 44th. Amendment one. Is there objection to amendment one? There is objection. If all those in favor of amendment one will vote ye. Opposed nay. Secretary of the law, the machine. Thank you. On the amendment number one, the yeas are 19 and the nays are 34. So amendment number one has failed. Is there objection to agree to the port of committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. Port of committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill. All those in favor of vote ye. Opposed nay. Chair, here's no objection. On the passes of the bill, the yeas are 37 and the nays are 15. This bill hasn't received a constitutional majority. It is therefore passed. All right. Hopefully we'll start moving now. Secretary Reed, SB 111. Senate bill 111. I send our albors to 56 and others. The bill is being denied to amend title 10 of the official code of Georgia and it's really two commerce and traits us to enact the Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act. To protect the privacy of consumer personal data in the state, to arrive for definition, to arrive for accountability, to provide for exemptions, to arrive for responsibilities, to process service and controllers, to arrive for notice and disclosure, to provide for security practices, to protect consumer personal data, to allow a controller to offer a different goods or services under certain conditions, to arrive for limitations, to arrive for statutory constructions, to arrive for preemption of local regulation, to arrive for a related matter, to arrive for an effective date through a political conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President, Senate Command, economic development of tourism recommends this bill to pass or slightly submitted Senator Beech, the 20th or the district chairman, that completes the order, Mr. President. Senator from the 44th, what purpose do you rise? I ask for unanimous consent, Mr. President, to excuse the senator from the 41st for business in South Capital. Without Mr. Jackson, Senator from the 41st is excused. Now, I recognize the senator from the 56th to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I stand before you this evening to discuss an issue that is increasingly vital in our digital age. An issue that touches the lives of every single one of our constituents, the protection of consumer privacy. Senate Bill 111, the Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act, represents a significant stride toward securing the rights of our residents, promoting their safety and ensuring their privacy. This was a foundational recommendation from the Artificial Intelligence Study Committee, which met throughout 2024. Artificial intelligence will be perhaps the most impactful thing in our lifetime. For the past few years, the world has become increasingly interconnected. Beginning with the advent of the Internet and digital technology and now Artificial Intelligence, our personal information has become more exposed than ever. Every day we share financial details, our contact information, and even our personal thoughts online. We get through social media e-commerce or other digital platforms. While these developments have brought many conveniences, they have opened the door to significant risks. For more scale data breaches to more localized cyber attacks, the threat is real and present. Our consumer data is continually at risk and the consequences can be dire. Identity theft, financial loss, invasion of privacy, these are all things that are constituents may face if their personal data falls into the wrong hands. This is why the Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act is not just important, but absolutely necessary. This bill is a comprehensive approach to protect our consumer's personal data. It provides for clear definitions, outlines specific responsibilities for data processors, controllers, and mandates notice and disclosure requirements. It also ensures the security practices are put in place to protect consumer data. In essence, this bill is about accountability and transparency. It puts the power back in the hands of consumers, allowing them to control their data and how it is used. Simply doing things like opting out of selling, targeting, and profiling you, and your personally identifiable information. The Consumer Privacy Protection Act also importantly provides for certain exemptions and limitations. This means that not one size fits all, but rather one that considers unique circumstances of different situation. The flexibility ensures that the law remains effective and relevant and fair for all the parties involved. Moreover, this bill promotes the preemption of local regulation and will prevent a patchwork of different and potentially conflicting laws, thus ensuring consistency and predictability in the rules that govern our digital landscape. It's a forward-looking bill that anticipates the complexity and ever-changing digital world. In addition to these benefits, this act has the potential to restore trust and confidence in your digital life and transactions. With the enactment of this bill, Georgia citizens can comfortably engage in digital activities knowing their data is protected more than ever and that their rights and recourse should not be compromised. The Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act is not just a piece of legislation, it's a statement of our commitment to the welfare and rights of our constituents. It's a testament to the belief of the importance of privacy in our increasingly digital world and most importantly, for a flexion of our dedication here in the Georgia State Senate to create a safer, more secure, and empowering digital environment for all Georgians. This line-goge was in developed and partnership from a multi-state working group of our colleagues around the nation, Technet, the leading technology group nationwide, the Technology Association of Georgia, numerous chambers of commerce and other important stakeholders. You will see a letter on your desk reflecting some of that support today. I urge each and every one of you to support the Georgia Consumer Privacy Protection Act, show our constituents that were committed to protecting their rights, their privacy, and their safety in this digital age, while keeping Georgia the number one place to do business. Mr. President, if there are no questions, I will yield the well. You have one question, Senator. We recognize the Senate from the fourth thing. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senate yield. Certainly for my friend from the 14th. Is it not true, Senator, that this was a good bill last year? It is a good bill this year, and I am honored to support this as a step in the right direction. Senator, I appreciate your great support. Thank you, Senator. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senate wants to speak for against the bill. Chair here is none. Is there objection to previous questions being ordered? Chair here is none. Previous questions are ordered. Is there objection to agree to the fourth committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none. The fourth committee is agreed to. Is there objection to main question being ordered? Chair here is none. Is there any question or order? The question is on the past of the bill. All those in favor vote? Yes, all opposed, nay. Secretary, I am not the machine.

you six Yeah, these are 53 in the nose or from the typical no crowd back there. The bill haven't received the fixed constitution with the worries therefore pass. They get all no crowd boy. I'll tell you what, Senator from 27, I bet your kids have no fun, do they? You're the no caucus. Senator 53, you'll be right behind him soon as you start having kids. Moving on to SB 151, Senate Bill 151, Secretary Reedicap, Senate Bill 151 by Senator Beach to the 21st and others, it will be between Title and Action Grade, the Joint Development Authority of North Fault and Municipalities to provide a short title to write definitions to write for powers of the authority to provide for directors of the authority to write a development area to write for revenue bonds and other obligations of the authority to recite constitutional authority to write for effect on other authorities to write for a late matter, a typical looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senate Committee on the State and Local Governmental Operations General, recommends that this bill do pass or start with submitted Senator Dixon Chairman. Mr. President, minority reports the Senate Bill 151 has been attached. That completes the order, Mr. President. Recognize the pride of Fulton County right here. There it is. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Senators, I bring before USB 151, which will create the Joint Development Authority of North Fulton. You know, Senators, when I moved to North Fulton 32 years ago, we had two cities, Roswell and Alphoretta. The rest of North Fulton was unincorporated, Fulton County. Now if you fast forward to today, we have six cities and there is no unincorporated Fulton County within these six cities. And I will tell you, Fulton County is a unique county. It's a unique animal, if you will. It's 91 miles long. And then in the middle, you have this big giant called Atlanta. You have South Fulton, Atlanta, and North Fulton. And our needs are very different. So from a geographic standpoint, the needs of South Fulton are very different than North Fulton. And then Atlanta has their own development authority called Invest Atlanta. This bill simply creates a North Fulton Joint Development Authority so that the six cities have control over their own economic development. You may ask why is this important? With the state investing $4 billion in the Georgia 400 corridor with 16 miles of new lanes northbound and 16 miles of lane southbound in Marta, bus rapid transit going up the middle on Georgia 400, we will continue to see economic growth. The state of Georgia believes Georgia 400 is an economic engine of our state. So all SB 51 simply does is gives us the tool in our toolbox in North Fulton to help facilitate this growth. So I just ask for your favorable support. And Mr. President, I'll yield for questions. If not, I'll yield the well. You have no questions, Senator. Okay. Thank you very much. I ask for your support. I recognize the Senator from the 39th, the other pride of Fulton County. Here they come. Opps. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, I rise in opposition to this bill. The creation of a North Fulton Development Authority is a solution in search of a problem. It does not enhance economic growth. It weakens it. It does not create efficiency. It duplicates bureaucracy. And it does not serve the people. It serves confusion. Let's be clear. Develop Fulton already works. It has successfully served every corner of the county from north to south under an existing effective legal framework. It has provided consistent, transparent, and fair economic development support for years. The bill before us today undermines that success in favor of fragmentation, uncertainty, and duplication. Develop Fulton's balanced board includes representatives from north and south Fulton, as well as county and school officials, ensuring a county-wide perspective that the proposed authority would lack. We often talk about streamlining government and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. So why would we create yet another government agency within a county that already has a functioning one? The state is actively working to reduce government bloat, yet this proposal would do the opposite, layering in a new authority that serves no distinct purpose beyond adding confusion. When businesses and investors look at a region, they seek stability and clarity. The creation of a separate authority introduces uncertainty, the kind that makes businesses think twice before investing. If Fulton County starts carving itself in a separate competing development authorities, we send a dangerous signal that we are not unified, that we do not have a single strong economic vision, and that businesses looking to invest here might be better off going elsewhere. One of the most misleading narratives behind this bill is that north Fulton is somehow going to be left behind in development decisions, but here are the facts. Develop Fulton has already approved every single project brought forward from north Fulton. The nine member board that governs economic development includes members representing north Fulton, ensuring fair input. In fact, the author of this very legislation was either vice chairman or a board member when some of those north Fulton projects were greenlit. What exactly is broken here? If projects are being approved, if representation is fair, if development is moving forward, what is the justification for breaking apart an already successful system? Businesses and investors that have spent time and money navigating our existing system could suddenly find themselves in limbo, and that's not how you build trust in a business friendly environment. A business friendly environment, by the way, which has yielded over $1.4 billion in investments in north Fulton alone, creating or retaining 20,000 jobs, and has added more than $62 million in new net tax revenue in just north Fulton. The existing authority already ensures that all affected stakeholders from county to school officials have a seat at the table, and this new proposal shuts them out. And let's not forget that three of the six cities that represent north Fulton already have their own development authorities. Sandy Springs, Roswell, and Alpharetta. So in these cases, we wouldn't just be adding one more layer bureaucracy. We'd be adding a third layer. Where is the logic in that? Where is the efficiency? This is not economic development. This is over legislating at its worst. And finally, we need to talk about process. This was not a bill that was brought in front of the Fulton County delegation, and that is more than just a procedural misstep. The facts are clear, developed Fultons already working for north Fulton, creating a separate authority introduces confusion and economic stability, especially since developed Fulton was created in statute, and will continue to operate in all areas of the county because there is not a separate bill to move forward that would keep it from doing that. It duplicates bureaucracy in a way that even state leaders like us should oppose, and it jeopardizes ongoing projects, the businesses and nonprofits are counting on. So we must ask ourselves, are we here to build a stronger United Fulton County? Are we here to create unnecessary divisions that serve no real purpose? I think each of you may have received over the weekend an email from the chair of the Fulton County Development Fulton Authority, the current chair, who has laid out for us many of the things that I just said, but who has underscored the fact that north Fulton will continue to be an important part of the development work that the authority is doing, and that we are urged by him as well to reject this proposed legislation, and to stand with developed Fulton in preserving the foundation that's made Fulton County a leader in Georgia and around the globe. I urge you also to reject this proposal, let's not fix what isn't broken, and let's not divide what works best when you're not. I will take questions or yield the well, which everyone, I'm happy to use, but I might have a question for my friend and colleague. I thank you have a friendly question here Senator. Greg and I are Senator from 36. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you to the Senator in the well for your presentation, and it's accurate to say that you are the chair of the Fulton County delegation in the Senate. Is that not the case? Yes, I am, and thank you for that. I forgot to introduce my such as the chair of the Senate Fulton County by partisan delegation who did not get a chance to prevent this bill with the other members of the delegation before it was brought to committee. Thank you for sharing that information. I'm a member of that delegation as well, and in the true we had no opportunity to make input on it. And in the true that as we consider this vote, and I agree with you, this is layers and layers and layers of government. Are we just setting up a situation for future conflict and competition for entities within one county? We are, in fact there's a term for that and it's called form shopping. When sometimes business will come and in fact they will pit one development authority against the other looking for the best tax break that they may be able to secure for themselves. And that's not the best way to do business, certainly not within one county. And add to that the other development authorities that already exist in the cities and the municipalities themselves, and it just breeds confusion. And the true and I think you have made this point. We could actually, if we voted yes to create this entity in North Fulton, actually be wind up with deals that are not financially beneficial to the county because the low ball goes and the low ball goes. And before you know it, we're headed on a downward spiral or that's certainly the potential that the senator knows of which he speaks. Thank you for pointing out all these salient facts and I would implore colleagues to consider as you cast this vote in a true that it would be in the best interest of a sound review of this that this not go forward. So many of us I would ask would like this to happen in the counties that they represent. If the answer is yes, well that's your answer but in the true we're asking people to take a close look at this and understand the downside of this is that true. That is very true. I'm urging you to vote no on this bill. It is not necessary. It is duplicative and it is not what the county is looking for. Thank you very much. You do have one more question but you're welcome to yield at any time. I know. I shall yield the well. Senator has yielded. I love it when people take good clean keys. All right. Senator from the 20th, would you like to make a statement? Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry. Staging inquiry. Mr. President to quote the former senator from the 45th. I live out in the hinterlands and all these cities and communities up there in the metro area and all that get me very confused. My question, my parliamentary inquiry is how will this impact the city of Mulberry? I'm sure if we hung around along with our senator we figured out a way. We're going to ask Senator from the 56 to close debate. Thank you, senators for one last comment. The same arguments we heard against this bill today were the same ones we heard when we created the city of Sandy Springs. And the city of Johns Creek and the city of Milton, which became the most successful cities in that area and all the other cities that happened after that. It's brought positive economic growth and prosperity. Fulton County, if it was measured in its population by state, would be bigger than nine other states in population. It's enormous and because it's our largest capital county and state it deserves separate attention in one area. This is a good bill and I'd urge your favorable consideration. Thank you. I yield the well. Senator Gilden. Senator from the 21st, would you like to close the debate? Wave, oh. The body, you're playing with the votes, man. Playing with the voters. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me just say this that the reason for this is when you look at the six cities in North Fulton, we would be the fifth largest county in the state at 388,600 population. So it's almost like it's its own county. But more importantly, when you look up the 400 corridor, you have 900 technology companies, the Fintech business. And again, we're getting ready to invest $4 billion. When I speak on as economic development and tourism chairman around the state, I talk about three economic engines, the Hartfield Jackson International Airport, the Busy's Airport, the World Congress Center, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and Savannah Port and Brunswick Port. I have now added a fourth economic engine. It's the North Fulton corridor with the Fintech business and with all the technology companies. We're going to continue to grow and we need to have our own development authority. Currently, there's nine board members on development, Fulton, only two from North Fulton. Sandy Springs does not have a development authority, only Alfred and Roswell. So I would just tell you, we need this tool in our toolbox as we continue to grow and create jobs in North Fulton. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. All right. Does any of the Senator would speak for against the measure? Is there a objection to previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agreeing to the Port Committee, which is favourable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none. Port Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill. All those in favourable vote, yay. All opposed, nay. Secretary, and Lightning Machine. Thank you. Senator, from the 31st, what purpose do you rise? Part of the mentoring inquiry. State's your inquiry. For the senator from the 21st, isn't it not true? Ag is still the number one industry in Georgia. Senator Knudes, what do you speak? All the passes of the bill, the yay's are 32. The nay's are 23. This bill has received recisting Constitution of Majority of the 4PASS. I have one more bill, I think. Maybe two more. I don't know. How long this one takes? Let's see, it's eight o'clock. Let's see how long this one gets debated. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 175 by Senator Robertson, 29th and others. Bill's been telling tonight to amend Article 1 of Chapter 2 of Title 1 and 1 of the Efficient of Georgia and it here. It's a great opportunity to general provisions regarding elections and primaries. So it's to prohibit the use of ranked choice voting to arrive for certain exceptions, to arrive for a definition, to arrive for a late marriage, to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senator Kruyan, ethics recommends that this bill do pass to the submitted Senator Watson, chairman. Mr. President, minority puts the Senate bill 171 has been attached and that completes the order, Mr. President. Recognize Senator in 29th. For you, John, very familiar with SB 175, this is legislation to ban ranked choice voting in Georgia. And let me tell you, this is not the Republicans having a talent for coming up with a bad solution to nonexistent problem. Well, this is, there's been a push for ranked choice voting. It is not organic. It is not a grassroots movement. But it's a concerted national campaign by a group of elite mega donors to change elections across this nation. Americans want elections with clear rules that deliver clear winners. We have done a lot here in Georgia to do that. I and others in this room were part of a lawsuit related to SB 202. As the lawsuits were dropped, we saw voter turnout skyrocket because of SB 202. For both parties, Democrats and Republicans, we saw a seismic shift in the transparency of Georgia elections. And now, what this small group of eliteists want to do, who pay their lobbyists very, very well, if you don't believe so, just pull the report to push ranked choice voting. It's used in New York City where they've complained many times about confusion and spent millions of dollars to educate. Again, ranked choice voting, you've heard it before, you voted it out before to prohibit ranked choice voting in Georgia. And I ask you to do that again tonight. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. I know we have a minority report on this. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against a measure? One of those lawyers back there. The other. All right. I know you are Senator. All right. If nobody else wants to speak on it, we'll do the minority report right now calling the Senator from the 44th. Speak to the bill. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Good evening. I think this is my last time in the welded air. I know we're all getting tired. We're all going to La Punchy. But I want to make some important points about the bill that we have in front of us. I want to thank the state of the state for the opportunity to go to the state of the state to make sure that we have a good policy to ban ranked choice voting in Georgia at this time, especially because it actually isn't even legal. So the bill accomplishes nothing at all. Ranked choice voting is not necessarily a perfect solution to some of what Ails American democracy today. It's a much needed reform to help break the cycle that we are currently in of polarization, dysfunction, and frustration that has gripped our democracy for far too long. Right now our elections reward the most extreme voices. And I don't need to tell all of you why because all of you know exactly why our primaries where all or almost all of our elections are decided partially due to gerrymandering, partially due to geographic distributions of partisanship. All those primaries are dominated by the most committed ideological activists. And we all know this because we all live it and it is part of our existence as politicians. We've all shared in the anti-room or over dinner stories of unreasonable, misinformed, out of touch constituents. They might be one of those. They might be all three sometimes who try to bully us and form online mobs to try to enforce ideological conformity. These activists make up a tiny fraction of voters but they're the ones choosing the candidates. Now I guess I need to give them all a shout out because clearly these activists chose every single one of us. So you know it's not all bad but I still think the system is resulting in a lot of frustration out of the average voter. There are major issues with having a relatively tiny group of activists choose basically all of the legislators in our chamber and also the one across the hall. The vast majority of Georgians who just want their government to work solve problems and represent their interests and priorities and the things they actually care about. Health care, the economy, crime, taxes, education. We spend so little time on the public's priorities and so much time on the priorities of some group in someone's primary. Voters writ large are frustrated, unheard and underrepresented. So ranked choice voting is one way that could fix this instead of forcing voters to pick between what many would regard, none of us, but many through the broad ideological middle of the electorate would regard as the lesser of two evils. It allows them to rank candidates in order of preference. This means that winning candidates must actually appeal beyond their base and earn support from a broader range of voters. It rewards consensus building rather than extremism. It encourages candidates to engage with all voters, not just those in their respective primary, or the most radical voices in their party. And it also lessens negative campaigning because instead of just going totally negative against the person that you think may be ahead of you in the race, you are wanting to win over their voters and hope that they will pick you second. So it encourages, I mean, it lessens negative toxic campaigning. And it eliminates the spoiler effect where some voters feel that they can't vote for their preferred candidate because they know that candidate is not viable. This allows them to vote for their preferred candidate and other candidates so they know that their vote will count in the end. The impact is less gridlock, more accountability, and better problem solving. States and cities that have adopted ranked choice voting have seen broader coalitions formed and a government that has a greater mandate from the people. But another benefit that should be very important to us here in Georgia is that our runoff system is extremely costly, millions and millions of dollars in taxpayer money. The recent report from KSU found that the staggering costs of our runoffs recently were 75 million dollars. The runoff election is also notably less democratic than the first round of voting because turnout drops anywhere from like 70% to 90%. Almost all of our runoffs in the cab this year saw turnout drop 90% or more. Often there's just one race left on the ballot. And so all the hubbub and chatter that you get from having multiple contests voted on at the same time disappears. People get busy and they forget about it. And so then when you have this like 10% of voters deciding the result when 90% just dropped off, that's also not democratic at all. Americans are hungry for reform. Georgia is our hungry.

People are seeking a government that represents the broad middle, not just the loudest voices in the room or online. This would offer a path forward, trying ranked choice voting. But banning it just keeps a broken system in place. And since it actually isn't currently legal, except for our overseas voters, it bears repeating that the bill does nothing at all. So let's embrace thinking about reforms. I would love to make elections work for the people, for the broad center of Georgian public opinion, not just for political elites or activists that pay attention to politics about as much as all the rest of us do, which we know is a very small percentage of the electorate. I'd like to help get American democracy off its moribund, toxic gridlock, and back to serving citizens again. I'd love to let our cities pilot ranked choice voting, which is what many of them have asked for in my district and in many of your districts. That's what they would like to do. Try it, see if it works. Perhaps we could all learn a lesson from that trial. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't have to go further. But I do know that in trying to check down any notion of reform, we do nothing but reward political extremists and keep a system in place that Americans currently are very dissatisfied by. And are in fact trying to throw grenades into every chance they can because they do not feel represented. So, Mr. President, I will yield the well if I have no questions. You do have one question, Senator. All right, I will. I will recognize Senator from the 27th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, do you yield? Of course. You said that you'd like to see local municipalities be able to implement this. I'm curious how they would implement it though. What system were they used for that? Because as you probably know, the Dominion machines have not been EAC certified to use the ranked choice voting module that's a part of those. So my concern is that while you said it would be very expensive, or runoff system is very expensive, which I would agree with, buying new voting equipment would be over $100 million. So does that concern you at all? I think we don't have some other bills that are already moving us toward. I didn't catch that question. Right. Let me answer your question. So the legislation that has been pending in the House in prior sessions, I don't know if it's been refiled, is would allow the piloting of ranked choice voting. And I cannot recall, so I don't want to miss represent exactly how it would work. But I do know how it works for our overseas and military voters, and it would probably work like that. Steve, for the yield? Sure. Well, overseas voters use paper ballots. And so that would be the only way that actually would work would be a more thorough overhaul of the system, which that's kind of my point is that until an endless dominion is certified under current Georgia law, it would be actually be much more expensive to do this than to stick with the current. Well, that's only if you do that statewide, and no one's talking about that. We're talking about there are a few cities that would like to pilot it. So I don't believe that the expense would be astronomical, and I believe that those particular machines or paper ballots could be utilized. There are ways that could make it happen for a limited pilot without upending every dominion B.D. B.M.D. that we currently use. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thank you. I yield the law. Then I'm going to close it. I'm going to offer the worst center for the 29th. Oh, good. He stepped off so we can we can close the bait. We can close to bait. Does any other centers which speak for against? Is there objections to previous question being ordered? Chair here none. Previous question is ordered. Is there a jurisdiction to agree to the board of committee which is available to the past of the bill? Chair here is none. The board of committee is agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passage of the bill all those in favor of vote. Yay. Opposed nay. Secretary of Law. No. Thank you. Thank you. On the passage of the bill the liaison are 36 days are 19. 19 this bill having received ricks at constitutional majority is there for a path Secretary Senate bill 195 Senate bill 195 by senator Hustetler the 52nd and others built between Title IX to amend article six of chapter four of Title 26 of the Efficient Coge George annotate or I do pharmacy so to provide that pharmacist or authorized to dispense pre exposure Prophylaxis and post exposure prophylaxis under certain conditions to amend article two of chapter 34 of Title 4 a 3 of the Fischer Code Georgia annotate or a 2 medical practice as to provide for the approval or development of a training program for pharmacist by the Georgia State Board of Pharmacies or Paraphram pharmacist complete such training program before dispensing pre exposure prophylaxis or post exposure prophylaxis to provide for definitions to provide for later matters to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President sending him in health and human services recommends this bill to pass strictly submitted Senator Watson chairman that police Order Mr. President Mr. President senator Hustetler the 52nd offers to following amendment number one to amend Senate bill 195 by replacing it Georgia drug in Archatic agency on lines 196 from 197 with Georgia State Board of Pharmacy by replacing borderline 269 with Georgia State Board of Pharmacy and for other purposes that completes the order Mr. President. I send a floor yours senator from city second. Thank you Mr. President hopefully this bill will be a little bit easier than some but the HIV right of new infections in Atlanta is about the fourth highest in the country. One thing that does help out with this is some preventive medicine is available. This medicine would be dispensed by pharmacists not prescribed by pharmacists we don't have prescription in there they're dispensing it. Distinction I need to make clear to everybody but the cost of that generically can be as low as $23 to prevent it the cost of treating it once they have it is about 30 to $70,000 a year. And so this bill would I think lower the cost of healthcare as well as improve quality of life the amendment is because in four places where we had board they thought it should say the Georgia State Board of Pharmacy and in two places where we said the Georgia drug in Archatic's agency they asked that they be removed because there's no narcotics involved in this medicine. There's no questions out of urgent sport amendment one of the bill and I'll yield well. There are no questions senator does any of the senator we speak for against the measure. Here's none is there objection previous question being ordered. Here's none of the previous question is ordered questions only adoption of amendment one. Question on adoption amendment one authored by the senator from the 50 second is there objection. Without objection amendment one is added. Is there objection to agree to the board of committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill. Chair here's none before the committee is agreed to is there objection. The main question being ordered. Chair here's none. The main question is ordered questions on the passes of the bill as amended. All those in favor of the bill vote. Yay all pose nay secretary on the machine. On the pass of the bill the a's are 55 the knees are zero this bill him received recs it. Constitution was your is there for pass as amended. Secretary read Senate bill 29. Senate bill 29 by senator Williams of the 25th and others built to be in town tonight to amend article 6A of chapter 3 of title 35 of the fish got Georgia annotated away to DNA sampling collection analysis. Just a bribe for the collection of DNA samples of individuals arrested for the commission of a felony at the time such individuals are booked or otherwise processed by the facility. Surveys provisions related to destruction of DNA profiles to provide for related matters to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President's and like when you just share recommends this bill to pass or slightly submitted senator Strickland chairman. Mr. President and minority reports the Senate bill 29 has been attached. Mr. President's senator Williams of the 25th offers to following amendment number one to amend Senate bill 29 by replacing lines 101 through 116 with the following. One a certified copy of the applicable a court order documentation with a prosecuting attorney stating that all charges for which the DNA profile is created or dismissed or and for other purposes. Mr. President senator hatch of the 50th and others offer the following amendment number two to amend Senate bill 29 by replacing felony on lines 29 or on lines 26 and 59 with serious violent felony. Mr. President and minority reports the following amendment number two to amend Senate bill 29 by replacing felony as such term is defined in code section 17-10-6.1 that could be the order Mr. President. All right recognize the undertaker from the from the 25th district. You know I just realized something senator both you and the House member from Baldwin County are both undertakers. How about that? Mr. President I bring to you a bill today Senate bill 29. This bill will allow law enforcement to swab inside of your cheek for someone arrested of a felony offense. The person when he's finger printed and then he'll be swabbed every state that touches Georgia has been doing this. Georgia's the last South Eastern state that does not collect DNA Alabama started in 2010 Florida in 2009 North Carolina in 2009 South Carolina in 2008. Tennessee in 2007 here it is 2025 ladies and gentlemen we need this rape kits are finally being processed that is only one piece of the puzzle we need the other part of the puzzle we need to know who did the crime. We could have a serial rapist or murderer living here close to us but not only does this DNA help convict the guilty it can set you free it was a case down in South Georgia a man was charged with a crime of killing a couple at a church. He spent 20 years in prison I don't want to say senator a ladies and gentlemen I know the time is getting late but please give the senator your attention. Dennis Perry was sent to prison after being charged with a murder in Camden County of a couple he spent 20 years in prison finally DNA evidence and a match came up and Eric Spayer was charged with a murder. This man was turned loose after 20 years in prison that is too long ladies and gentlemen Harold swain film of swing was killed in Waverly Georgia someone acting as the suspects boss called the police and told him that he was at work that day. 375 DNA exonerations have taken place between 1989 and 2020 DNA is a powerful tool but it is not enough to convict someone usually the DNA can be used to prove guilt or innocence but it's often used with a combination of other information impacts. The cost of a swab kit is $1.44 plus posters to be mailed this is a long overdue hope that you will vote for this bill I'll yield for any questions Mr. President. You do not have any questions. Thank you I yield the well. Oh yes senator did you speak to the amendment senator senator did you speak to the amendment. I have amendment 8M 55003 this is something that leds council brought forward that clears up that if you're exonerated and found innocent then your DNA swab is purged it is not kept on file. You would have to have proof that you were exonerated found innocent but your DNA profile would be purged and would not be kept on file. All right senator you can either yield you have one question but you can yield if you want to. You want to take a question. Yes senator from 65th. You might distinguish colleague what you will you yield. Is your amendment up here. No I don't have it. I'm sorry. Will you yield please I do yes sir. Is it not true senator that if I accuse you of felony you would be under this particular bill be required to give up your DNA. If you have arrested me for the commission of a felony yes sir. Would that not violate guilty until proven innocent. No so not necessarily it couldn't malign fact as I have stated couldn't actually set you free and prove that you didn't do it by collecting your DNA. We further yield senator yes sir I certainly do. I applaud the sense that you are proceeding but is it not further true that we have DNA we have rape kits that are yet to be resolved going back for years in certain of our counties. If they are processing the rape kits there are probably two to three weeks out from what I have been told that they have just about caught up. That DNA is on file from those rape kits and if they can match that DNA from someone who is committed a burglary or some other crime who they have gotten arrested for that felony then we could probably take a serial rapist off the streets. Thank you my distinguished colleague I will not ask you any further questions. I think there is a second amendment to. There is a second amendment on lines 26 and 59 by replacing serious felony with serious violent felony. As such term is defined in code section 171061 this is known as a seven deadly sins so you would have to commit very serious felony in order to be swabbed. He is on speeches. How do you deal the way of biking? Thank you Mr. President. I rise in support of amendment 2 which is a friendly amendment signed by the bill's author. This is a basic replacing felony on lines 26 and 59 with serious violent felony as such term is defined in code section 17-10-6.1. I know the hour is late but I think this is a pretty serious matter that we are about to do because we are changing some policy in the state of Georgia. Right now in all 50 states upon a conviction of a felony they can collect your DNA. What we are trying to do now is if you are arrested for a felony they can take your cheek swab. What this amendment seeks to do is it basically aligns Georgia code with the US Supreme Court that is already found that if you are arrested for a violent felony it is not a fourth amendment violation under the Constitution to take a DNA swab from the cheek. This was in a 2012 case Maryland versus King. In that case Justice Kennedy actually wrote the decision and you had Chief Justice Roberts who was appointed by George Bush, Clarence Thomas, Justice Breyer which was appointed by Clinton, Alito which was appointed by Bush. The reason that a DNA swab after being arrested for a violent felony is constitutional and not a violation of your fourth amendment. You can argue all day about the Constitutionality of the current bill but if we go with this amendment we already know it has been heard and decided by the Supreme Court. What I am attempting to do is at least get Georgia in line with what 31 other states are already doing. 31 states are doing this right now. One of the purposes behind this DNA sample upon arrest is with the progression that we have seen in technology with DNA it is a great tool for law enforcement. Every law enforcement officer that I have spoken to is in favor of this. There have been cases all across the country but one in particular that a woman flew in from Texas and talked about how she was brutally raped. When she was attacked they put a mask over her and she was not able to see the person that did it to her at all. She lived in fear for two to three years until finally the person that did that to her was found in a state in one of these 31 other states where they do take DNA samples upon arrest. They caught him. He was convicted and now he is serving about 200 years in prison and it turned out he was a serial rapist. In Texas where this is implemented the first year they caught 240. Second year they caught 600 and in 2023 they caught 1,000 for. So this is a very powerful tool it protects citizens and it is constitutional because of the ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012. Thank you Mr. President I yield the well. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? All right so nobody signed up to speak we'll take up the amendments. On amendment number one authored by the senator from the 25th author of the bill is their objection to amendment number one.
