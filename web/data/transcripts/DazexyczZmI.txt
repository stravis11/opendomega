Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning to my brothers and sisters on this morning.
How y'all doing?
I'm going to say that again.
Good morning to my brothers and sisters.
How are you doing?
You know, I've learned the word that says, everybody say yes.
Yes.
I've learned the word yes means a good thing
being submissive to something, some will, some way.
So the day, if you can just stand to your feet,
clap your hands, give the Lord some praise
and say yes to that, we can agree on that on today.
Can you stand and give the Lord some praise
up in this place?
Yes, to your will, to your way.
Yes, I will trust you and obey.
Yes, I will worship you.
Yes, I will praise you.
Yes is a big word.
didn't that feel good? That's our Williams, yes. So today I woke up with praise and
Thanksgiving on my heart with the opportunity to bring you something that we
need a word from the Lord. And today I was blessed that we have with us as our
Chappin of the day, Dr. Eric Mason.
He is not only a senior pastor
and Dr. Eric Mason's senior,
he comes from God's country, Savannah Georgia.
By ways of God, the city.
He comes also by ways of Tampa, Florida.
He is not just a pastor,
he is a communicator that brings people together.
He's an educator,
not only a father in our community,
he does several programs,
he's initiated several reentry programs,
several programs to empower our community
and our children bringing people from races
and colors and creeds together in our community.
And that's something to say yes to.
He is the pastor of Jesus,
a first community church,
and it is a community church that gives back,
does a lot of things in our community.
I do not want to waste your yes time,
but I want to bring to you our chafflin' for the day,
Dr. Eric D. Mason Senior.
And the house said amen.
All right, we are so happy to be here this morning.
I was have been greeted by some wonderful, wonderful people
that made me feel right at home this morning.
So I'm honored to be here as your devotional leader
for today and to the honorable speaker of the house,
Speaker Roltson and to our representative Carl Guillard,
who introduced us and afforded us with this opportunity
to share this morning.
Now where I come from, we do a,
I'm not going to do it unless I get a few amen,
But where we come from is not a good sermon
without someone first singing a hymn of some sort.
I'm not going to sing unless somebody say sing,
but other than that, I will keep on sharing this moment.
I hear some mumbling somewhere, but I'm
going to keep on sharing anyway.
And where we come from, it wouldn't
be anything for someone to just simply say,
I need the all.
I need thee, yeah, every hour, I need thee.
Oh, oh, bless, bless me now, my say,
Hey, yeah, I come to
I am to thee.
I'd like to give honor to my wife of 26 years, and to my four sons, and their wives, and
my wonderful grandchildren, and to one of the greatest churches in South Georgia, Jesus
first, the community church, located in Garden City.
And I'm sure all of them are watching this morning to amen witness this wonderful occasion
to the Georgia House of Representatives and all of you
that are present.
I'd like to say this morning, it is good to be here.
Do Aramuni 31 and 6 if I was to use for text this morning,
it simply says, be strong and of a good courage.
Fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord by God.
It is he that doeth go with thee.
He will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
As a support Texas says in Isaiah 43 and 2,
Wendell passeth through the waters.
I will be with thee.
And through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
Wendell walketh through the fire.
Thou shalt not be burned.
Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
For thought this morning, if I had to use one,
the Lord is with us.
He has not left us.
He is mindful of all of us.
As a young boy growing up in the projects of Savannah, Georgia,
namely Garden Homes, Hitch Village, Fred Wessels,
and a small community called Pinpoint, Georgia.
With no father in the home, I was told by many
that I would not graduate or mount to anything.
What did I turn that into a lie?
One would think the odds were against me.
One day, a great woman of God, Dr. Idael Chiever told me,
and I quote, to believe in yourself and your God.
And you can be whatever you put your heart,
your mind and soul in, you can accomplish it.
I note it was not a program or the place where I live,
but a person, a prophet that made a huge difference
in my life. On this journey called life, I've learned and concluded, you cannot make it
on your own. We need one another. Most of all, we need our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
We need Him to lead us as we touch and empower and transform the lives of those we come
in contact with on a day-by-day basis.
The fight for equality, justice, mercy, and peace
is still in front of us, although we deemed ourselves
as free through bondage, plague, disease,
and the cares of this life.
We continue to fight the good fight of faith,
working together to combat all the issues we face
in America today.
We see it every day through poverty, and crime,
and economics, and educational deficiency,
police brutality, gun violence, and gang violence,
and illegal drug use, and hunger, and homelessness,
human trafficking, evictions, unemployment, and the like.
It all reminds us today.
We have a huge responsibility to those
we serve in our various community.
The struggle is real.
There is much work for all of us to accomplish.
We simply cannot give up now.
Quitting is not an option.
The other night I found myself,
believe it or not, watching the movie called Harriet Tugman.
In doing so, I was reminded that February is Black History Month.
A time set aside for us to reflect on whence we have come
and where we are going.
Right before my eyes, I was reminded of the struggle,
how our forefathers and mothers and sisters and brothers
survive such hard degrading and deplorable and brutal times.
Today is clear to me, we are standing on the shoulders
of greatness, the shoulders of people with integrity,
the shoulders of those who have character courage and faith,
people who have refused to give up regardless
of the odds, the obstacles and opposition.
Call it what you may.
I see it all as a reminder, we've come a long way,
but yet have a long way to go.
Harriet Tubman believed that God would bring out alive her
and all her siblings.
She believed and trust God because he promised
he would never leave nor forsake her.
The Lord granted Harriet Tubman's wishes
and saved alive her mother, her father,
brothers, her friends, and neighbors,
just as he did for rehab,
who lived in the walls of the city of Jericho
on the outskirts at the limits on the margins
and brought rehab out alive with her entire family.
I believe it can also be done today.
Need I remind us, we are in the business
of saving lives, families, and communities.
Let me echo in your ears today,
it was grace that brought us safe this fall
and grace shall lead us on.
That's fast forward today as I hurry along to my seat.
No one could have predict that there would be a time
when people around the globe would be fighting a deadly
pandemic like COVID-19.
Many lives were snuffed out too early and loved ones
taken away by ambulance, never to be seen again,
dying alone in hospital beds.
Because of mandatory lockdowns, elderly parents
and nursing homes could only see their families
to glass windows or speak on a phone.
People hearts were so full of fear,
the suicide rate escalated
along with the numbers of domestic violence incident.
It has isolated families, friends, co-workers,
and acquaintances.
All but I came to tell you today,
there is hope in the midst of all this turmoil
and strife because you and I, we are not alone.
May I remind you of our texts.
It says, be strong and of a good courage.
Fear not, be afraid of all of,
don't be afraid of all of this.
For the Lord, by God, he is that do go with us.
He will not fail us, nor forsake us.
When we pass through the waters of life,
he will be with us.
And through the rivers, they will not overflow us.
When thou walkest through the fire,
thou shall not be burned,
neither shall the flames can do the pundit.
as I hurry to my clothes.
I challenge all of us to remember
our purpose, call assignment and our oath
are calling to Michael six and eight.
He has shown the old man what is good
and what do with the Lord require thee,
but to do justly and to love mercy
and to walk humbly with thy God.
We are servants, we are here to serve humanity
and bring about change.
I challenge the room today
To feed the hungry, clothe the naked, provide the resources, build community, provide better
transportation houses, employment, food and educational opportunities, restore reentry
for those formerly incarcerated, return back to our community, raise the minimum wages
for our beloved Georgia citizens so they can have a better opportunity at life.
In doing so, we will fulfill the duties and responsibilities of great leaders, a great
government, a great people, and most of all a great Georgia, may we all stand. Let us pray.
Father, oh Father, through all generations you have been our dwelling place. And for that we say thank you.
Thank you, kind Father. Birth is yours and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell
variant. It all belongs to you. You lay the earth's foundation on the seas and
built it on the ocean depths. We thank you for you. God, you for this general
assembly, the speaker of the house, the governor of the state of Georgia, the
senators, the house of representative, counsel, and all of us that are part of the
team that keeps this house productive and safe. Lord bless their families and the
state of Georgia. We remember this day, all those who have been affected by
COVID-19, we pray for their strength, their healing and deliverance. We pray for
your wisdom, your knowledge, your guidance, compassion, understanding and
provision. Father, help us to always do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly
with you. We pray that we will always remember our purpose, the agenda and the
assignment that is set before us. This is to serve those who abide God in this
our beloved state to the best of our ability with honesty, integrity and accountability.
It is in the name, which is above all names we pray, every heart that loved
him say, Amen. May we recite together the pledges of allegiance, our pledge of
allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
is staying one nation under God, indivisible, but vividly justice for all.
Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Got two quick things.
I want to thank Chairman Dickie for reminding me that today is National Cabbage Day.
So in case you are wondering, Georgia farmers grow about 30,000 acres of Georgia grown cabbage
that produces about 61 million pounds of cabbage.
So eat more cabbage.
But also I want to thank the speaker and the governor and this body for the funding they
provided for the Georgia National Fairgrounds.
There's approximately 2,200 students and 3,000 to 3,000 animals that are headed to our
state fairgrounds as we speak, that are showing livestock as we speak.
so thank you all for that. That's a great program and teaches a lot of
responsibility and great things, so thank you all. So what time will the
slaughter dogs be ready? Chair recognizes representative Carpenter for a
morning order. Thank you, Speaker. So I got really excited about the
cabbage myself because today is Georgia restaurant day. Guys, we're here to

So we just want to talk for a minute about the importance of restaurants. We all know how important they are to your districts

high school wrestling team.
Through the hard work and dedication
of these fine student athletes,
they took home their seventh consecutive
state team championship earlier this month.
And three days ago, they closed out
as the seven A traditional state champions.
We appreciate your hard work, and we're proud of you.
Thank you.
Representative Sains, yes, Mr. Speaker.
So there were other champions and other classifications
last week, were they're not?

Speaker. Good morning. Today in our moment in black history, I want to
introduce to some and bring to remembers to others Mr. Prince Hall a
a forgotten, bounding father.
Prince Hall, a free African-American
and a contemporary of John Adams
from his formal acquisition of freedom in 1770
until his death in 1807, Hall helped forge
an activist black community in Boston
while elevating the calls of abolition to new prominence.
Hall was the first American to publicly use
the language of the Declaration of Independence
for a political purpose other than justifying war
against Britain.
In January 1777, just six months after the promulgation
of the Declaration, and nearly three years
before Adams drafted the state constitution,
Hall submitted a petition to Massachusetts legislature.
We will share this letter with you,
and for his activism and his cause,
He should be considered as a founder of our nation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I hear the word.
We are about to go on to the rules calendar.
We are about to go on to the rules calendar.

Title 19 in the fiscal to Georgia and Entetter relating to domestic relations.
So it's to strengthen, clarify and update provisions relating to the protection of children.
The Chair recognizes representative Reeves to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues, members of the House.
It's been five years, Mr. Spakers, since this house started leading on the issue of adoption and foster care reform.
And we have, frankly, over the last five years, what we've seen is a synergy developing this building from our friends across the hall and
the Senate into the governor's office of continuing to build on the platform of making adoptions easier in Georgia and
trying to improve our foster care system and trying to create an environment where our foster kids can be more easily
adopted. And what's great about this, we brag about a lot of things. This is
something we don't brag enough about is that what we have done, if you take all
of these separate measures for the last five years and put them together, we have
increased the number of adoptions that have been in Georgia and we have
substantially decreased the number of children that are in foster care. And that
is something that every single person in this body should be extremely proud of.
We have been changing lives, and in some cases saving lives.
And this bill here, House Bill 154, is almost identical to what this body passed last year.
It was House Bill 913, it was passed by the House.
And it was when we came back from the COVID break, like a lot of matters.
It was elected to focus on other things, and we did not take this up.
So this bill is pretty much substantially the same bill as last year.
it has four additional clarifications
that are simply technical clarifying things
that would, I would say, relate to our efforts
of efficiency on this issue.
This bill has been worked on by the Georgia Council
of Adoption Lawyers.
It's had the input of the judiciary,
of practitioners, and et cetera.
All of the players have been involved with this.
And Mr. Speaker, at this time,
I'll be happy to yield for any questions on this.
You do not appear to have any questions.

bill having received the requisite

Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 282.
House Bill 282, members, on a mix of 178th to be entitled to an act to amend Article 13 to
Chapter 5 of Title 48 of the fiscal to Georgia and to relay an ad ballorum taxation of
qualified timberland property.
This bill ever for the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this
bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Steven
Meeks to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen. I'm bringing to you House bill 282. House bill 282 is legislative
legislative intent bill that makes some housekeeping changes to rules and
regulations for the department at the hospital 282 is referring to the
qualified timberland property which was passed by unanimous a unanimous
vote under a constitutional amendment of HR 51 in 2018 with the enabling
legislation being House Bill 85 carried in this body by the late Chairman
J. Powell. House bill 282 does three things. It defines the definition of
contiguous, meaning that if you want a piece of property that has a has common
ownership on both sides of a road or railroad track where we just let it be
known that that is defined as a contiguous piece of property it gives a
qualified landowner a one-time opportunity to make that declaration. Second
thing this does is that it says that the the way we're going to value this
timberland property for the purposes of out of a room taxes will be the same
way that Cuba and Flippa are done in a 65-35 market and income evaluation approach.
Third thing this piece of legislation does, Mr. Speakers, it says that the tax commissioner
will accept a county map drawn by the cryptographer in the county or a GIS technician and then signed
by the county board of assessors and the qualified landowner for that piece of property.
So Mr. Speaker, those are the provisions of HR 282 and I will entertain any questions
if we have any.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I appreciate your attention.
Ask for a favorable consideration of House 282.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?

The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 130.
House Bill 130 by the way, go over the 19th and others to be entitled back to amend
Chapter 60, Title 36, the official go to George annotated relating the general provisions
of applicable counties and municipal corporations so as to find the term fence detection system
this bill ever referred to the committee on government affairs that committee
recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Gullet to
present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 130 is a bill that this
body passed last year but because of COVID we couldn't get it done in the
Senate. This is a bill that brings uniformity to the permitting process for
battery-powered alarm security fences that are designated as non-residential. This bill
would authorize the permitting of battery-powered alarm security fences as burglar alarm systems.
This would streamline the process for permitting and registration in accordance to local
laws and allow businesses to protect their assets and property in a timely manner. Today,
variants can take months or years, and if you have property that you want to secure,
just not acceptable. We've worked with GMA and ACCG in the language of the
build this year and they're good with the legislation as written. Mr. Speaker if
there any questions I'd be happy to take them otherwise I'd ask for your
favorable consideration of House Bill 130. You do have a question or two do you yield?
I do. Chair recognizes representative Shannon up in the gallery to your right.
Thank you Mr. Chair. Is the speaker yield? I do. Thank you. Republicans frequently
talk about how local control is always the best for decisions, for most decisions. Sometimes
I agree, sometimes I don't, but the bottom line is these are your values not necessarily
always ours. In this case, my question is why does this bill include preemption? Why are
localities not able to say that they don't want these types of fences in their community?
Those are the final lines in the bill where it talks about basically it's just preemption
calls that cities and localities cannot pass any type of
ordinance that would prohibit these fences.
Thank you for your question.
Right now, variances, so a lot of times if you want to
protect your property, you normally go to the max size of
a fence that you can get in that property.
So if a city has a 10 foot maximum, a lot of times that's
what you'll build, because that's what you have.
If you want an electric fence, there's a requirement that
it's got to be two feet taller than the tallest fence.
So if I have a 10 foot variance in the city's max,
this would allow, there's a process
that you would go through that takes time.
Sometimes it's six months, it could be over a year.
I think ACCG and GMA are neutral to the language,
which just says a lot, we restricted it from last year,
but then being given the bill, I don't see this as a problem.
Does the speaker yield for more questions?
I do.
OK, so I'm going to restate my question
because this isn't about sizing and the process
of how you get these fences approved.
My question is very directly,
why does this bill include preemption?
Because even if once they get through the process,
your bill says that if a community decides
they don't want electric fences in their community,
they can pass no legislation, no ordinance
or anything that would prevent these fences
from existing in communities.
So I think it's key to say that you're saying
electric fences, that's not quite clear.
It's a battery powered electric trans security system,
it's an alarm system.
So it's 12 votes, it doesn't actually,
it gets you off the fence, but it doesn't hurt you.
It sends a alarm call to the police department.
It's an alarm system, not a electric fence system
the way you're describing it.
12 votes, is this three votes more than the battery
as you touch with your tongue?
To see if it still has a valid battery.
So it's not gonna shock you, it's gonna get you off the fence,
but it's not gonna hurt you in any way.
So, you know, from a freedom shift standpoint,
that this is a way for property owners
to protect their property.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you owe for another question?
I'll you owe for one more.
Chair recognizes Chairman Jay Collins
to your left for a question.
Is it gentlemen, you?
I do for my friend.
Is it not true that I spent a good bit of time
in local government before I came up here to the house?
I know that to be true.
