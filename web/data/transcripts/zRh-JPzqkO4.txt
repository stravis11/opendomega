TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
You
Our newest member of the Transportation Committee has just been confirmed that Senator
Randy Robertson has been named as an ex officio to the distinguished exclusive high-powered
transportation committee.
And thankfully for you, we've already dealt with truck weights, and we're going to move
on to a matter of equal importance this morning.
And that is Representative Anderson
with House Bill 121, Representative Anderson.
Why don't you go ahead and grab a seat here
and Representative Rose, you can grab a seat next to him.
We have a House Bill 121 is serving as a vehicle
of sorts for Representative Rose's vehicle legislation.
So we have a vehicle to deal with vehicles.
So would love Representative Anderson,
if you want to talk us through the bill as it originally passed
the Representative Rose, you can talk us through the additions
that are in the committee sub.
And we'll make sure we're working off the same version here.
Representative Anderson, what version do you have there
in front of you?
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I have LC393953S.
Fantastic, take us through it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, members of the committee.
This bill has been actually thought about and worked on
for many years in this past summer,
the part of my newly district 10 includes
Raven County and the associations from both Lake
Burton and Lake Raven approached me about this concept
and brought to me identical resolutions
that their water safety committees had passed asking
for some help and some consideration to help protect
their property and protect the lives and the livelihood
of the people that are enjoying the lakes up there
regarding boats that are generating a large wake.
We call them wake boats that we're not actually
with this legislation.
We're not defining a particular type of vessel.
We're defining an activity.
So when I was approached with this idea,
I started looking at what's the best way to do this
to make it make sense.
So I reached out to Colonel Bernard with DNR,
who is here today to speak to the bill.
If there's any questions that would be directed
towards the enforcement portion of this,
his suggestion was, let's start with the Tennessee law.
We actually have lakes at border Tennessee.
We also have lakes at border South Carolina,
as well as Alabama and Florida.
Maybe not Florida, but Alabama I know we do.
And those states have different buffers zones,
if you will from as far as wake generating water vessels
then Georgia does.
Most of them are Tennessee and South Carolina are 200 feet.
Georgia is 100 feet.
So these particular boats generating three and four
foot high wakes are causing shoreline erosion.
They're causing seawall damage.
They're causing dock disturbances,
even throwing people literally knocking them off
docks, knocking them out of boats into the water.
That sort of thing, particularly in our lakes
that are typically considered flat water lakes.
So what we've done here is we've put together a proposal.
Excuse me.
Yes, Representative.
Mayors, the committee, please welcome
Chairman Brandon Lamont-Peach.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Carry on, Representative.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
What we've done is we've taken this classification
of activity, again, not identifying a boat,
design, type, or specification, not identifying anything
except the activity of generating a wake,
which is capable of being surfed on.
That's a popular thing to do now.
It's a generated large wake behind these boats
and literally step out onto a surfboard
and surf that without actually being towed in many cases.
So we've identified that activity and said
that if you're going to generate a wake
that is capable of being surfed, the buffer zone,
instead of being a 100 foot no wake zone,
it extends out to 200 feet from shores,
from dock structures, that sort of thing,
from mord boats along the shore to provide more space
for that wave to attenuate before it hits the shore
and in turn will cause less damage
and less likelihood to affect the people
that are enjoying the shoreline of our lakes.
Just a couple of things that we've done with this,
we have excluded the intercostal waterways and rivers.
We have some of our residents and citizens
to enjoy doing this along the rivers.
Rivers are a little different from lakes.
Rivers have varying water-high levels.
They have varying current flows, that sort of thing.
So Shoreline erosion is a little different characteristic
along riverways than it is along our flat water lakes,
which cover lakes and reservoirs in the state.
We've also excluded regattas, boat races, marine parades,
tournaments or exhibition, which the commissioner has granted a marine event permit.
So there will be situations and circumstances where this can be done and it will be excluded
from this provision with approval of the commissioner.
Great.
That's that portion of the bit long.
Thank you, Representative.
The biggest probably also worth noting, this is in a section of the code that relates
to non-private lakes, so private lakes are not captured in this.
I do have a question for you, Representative.
I've noticed you are a consistent, dedicated,
and even some would say disciplined individual
who makes almost morning appearance at the Mollis.
Is that correct?
That is correct, sir.
Is this an attempt to get into shape
for weight-boarding and or weight surfing over the summer?
Unfortunately, my age and my knees are way beyond that.
So fantastic.
All right, I believe Chairman Moore was reaching for the button here, which didn't work, but I'll recognize it.
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to be clear that this is only on public waters and not private waters.
That is correct, okay.
Okay.
It's just relative to the code section that it's in, that only this is the code section that I guess sets the law for the public waterways and not private waterways.
And if we do need affirmation of that, Colonel Bernard can elaborate more on their skill
appropriate.
Chairman Gan, what's your number there?
Fine.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Because that was one of the first things I looked at in this, as I'll give you an example.
I've had events and outings, the up and Jackson County, my chairman of the County Commission
has a wonderful light.
They do a lot of ski exhibits and recreational skiing.
That's all private.
But to me, I was talking to our legislative council over here,
and we were thinking about making an addition in section B
where the code section shall not apply to,
and just making sure that there's no question about that.
Because for me, I don't see exactly where this spells it out
that, okay, this is only for public lakes.
because for me, I want to make darn sure that, you know,
if you own the lake and it's, you know, 40 acres or whatever,
said that if you want to go wake boarding on it,
we're not taking away that right or privilege
for the individual.
Correct.
Jim again, I had actually had a version of this
that struck the 50 acre requirement
because I had that exact concern,
but then was told by counsel that this one,
that this does not apply to private lakes at all.
So that change was not necessary.
I think now that we've taken waters out of this state,
because that's the fine term,
we might either want to add that back in,
just to clarify.
If you want to work on an amendment,
we'll be ready at the appropriate time.
Thank you.
You mentioned Tennessee.
I think that it's important.
Jack in our office actually did a essentially study
of all surrounding states.
And this mirrors, best I could tell,
mirrors what Tennessee has.
Alabama, interestingly enough, and I hate this,
because I love to wake, sir, but Alabama has outlawed
weightboarding all together.
And I've seen that that's because of that.
And then some lakes like Arrowhead, for example,
which is private, they don't allow any of this activity anyway.
So Colonel, you are the subject matter expert.
Why don't you go ahead and step up to witness
my number one here, right here, Colonel, if you don't mind.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, good morning.
Good morning.
Yes, so this is Title 52 within that title.
We can only enforce state law on waters of the state.
And so we don't go into those places
of the private property at all with the Title 52,
if that helps clear that up.
I think the verbiage.
The waters of the state come from state
a little longer than that back in.
Right, it's all throughout that Title 52
as far as our enforcement on that.
We are a nationally accredited agency,
and through that, not all 50 states are.
And so we follow what it's called NASBLA.
And so NASBLA has set the 200 foot as a recommended,
and that's why you've seen Tennessee
and South Carolina move towards that 200 feet.
And we do that with also consultation
with the water sports industry.
Those folks who make white board boats
I also support that legislation.
And I wanna highlight, as well,
the, what would happen if this were to pass
is the existing 100 foot no-wake law stays in effect
as it relates to distances from shorelines and docks
and when you're a lot of said awake
and any type of watercraft.
And you're essentially capturing the activity
of the boats that have the ballast and the surf gates
and things like that.
And when they're pulling someone
that are specifically designed to be weighed down
such that it would increase the weight
with a, you know, you're talking about 600 horsepower
motors, and usually 2,000 pounds of ballast to make,
I'd rather make the boats as the least efficient
as possible to throw as much weight as possible.
Recognize Chairman again.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You know, I'm not a lawyer, I don't pretend to be one
I don't know, I have watched Perry Mason.
The question that I have is, you know,
if I go over to the other side of the Department
natural resources with EPD, and I'll go to a lake which much lakes are built on stream
said they, and there's some type of an issue that comes up, there's mud in the, you're
doing deland is starving and it's going into the water.
They immediately jump to, that's waters of the state.
So I don't know, you know, when we start talking about, okay, well, this is not waters of
the state, this is waters of the state, and I don't want to get into an argument.
So I'm going to ask Ms. Dole, if you don't mind,
and that we specifically exclude those privately owned
likes, and if that's okay with the sponsor.
I would definitely be supportive of an improvement to the bill.
I appreciate that, because like I said, I'm not the lawyer,
but we've got a great one here on staff.
Chair Vitch.
Lake Lanier is owned by the Corps of Engineers, correct?
That's correct, yes.
Would that apply to Lake Lanier?
And so the core, once you pass state law,
they will adopt whatever that is, is passed.
So they're like, that's correct.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir, Robertson, number one.
Thank you, and Colonel, again, I have Lake Harding
right there at Alabama, and I have West Point.
And I know West Point's Corps of Engineers,
so this would be applicable.
And Lake Harding, it would also be applicable.
And so we're talking about, to be clear, 66 yards
from the, from the, from docs and everything.
I have a, I have a friend that has one of these
ridiculous, expensive, very inefficient boats
that they surf behind.
And so I know they try to stay to the middle
best they can.
But this also applies if there's a anchored boat
anywhere near, right?
Right.
Well, I think within this piece here,
We talked about just the shoreline and docks and not things.
Okay, so we got done.
Oh, you did that then, okay.
Yeah, so I just want to be sure.
And of course, your game warnings,
as we've changed it back to Game War right now,
use discretion out there in the intent of everybody.
So it's not some crazed group of law enforcement officers
that are looking just right as many tickets as possible.
No, sir, I will say this.
It's my protocol for our folks.
I have it in policy, where anytime the new law like this
is changed, right, for the public,
that may not be aware of it.
We take that first year.
We push a lot of information out.
We work with the water sports industry.
They've actually got a couple of different articles
that they push out to notify the public.
We'll post that at boat ramps and arenas and different things.
And then we also use that as an educational period
that first year that it comes out.
If we see somebody that's within the 200 feet, and for us, you know, we don't draw that
exact line with what the laser range finder, right?
We look at how they're causing a problem, right?
They're, well, I'm just less than 100 feet.
Colonel, what's the current law relative to distance from an anchor vessel when you're
it's 100 feet?
Okay.
I have a little bit of anxiety, honestly, about capturing anchor vessels in this.
I think about, I've been away surfing for over a decade, and that could make, that could
be problematic. I think that the difference in my mind is we're talking large
about property damage here. If you go and anchor yourself out in the middle of
Lake Lanier, you're well aware that you're gonna get tossed around a little bit
if you don't find a cove. So I may and more vessels obviously have or
typically more to something on the shore or on a dock. So I may want to strike
anchor vessel. Was anchor vessel in the original language? It was not in the
original language. Okay. What was the intent? Well your thoughts
that's drawn to adding in.
When we were, I was discussing this with Wensh Council,
we were looking at being more consistent
with other areas of the code,
and there were a few things that we did not include
that came from other areas of the code,
so there would be absolutely no issue with me
and would not diminish the bill's intent to remove that, sir.
Okay.
Chairman again, I had a question.
I had to vote five.
Yes sir, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It said that, and that was my concern was,
you know, you're going late morning,
and I've never done it.
don't know that I ever will at this ripe old age.
But for me, I'm thinking, okay,
I'm coming up on a boat on the lake.
And I got a look out there and see whether this guy
that's out there fishing has got a rope
and a anchor down to the ground or not.
I'm like, okay, you know what he's going to know that.
And so for me, I agree with the chairman
that we need to make sure that's not the case.
Yes.
I'm in full agreement.
Thank you.
All right.
Any other questions for around the wake surfing
portion of the bill before we move on
to the vehicle portion of the vehicle.
I'm just glad to be in the system.
Well, we appreciate you and you,
hey, you're worth your weight and goal.
I did brand and Senator Brandon Lamott Beach.
Have you ever waked served?
No.
Okay.
This reference is in here on line 42,
if you'll notice, an exhibition.
And I feel like we could probably have a fundraiser
and when Lamott Beach would pay a lot of money
for an exhibition of you waked surfing.
So, I see David Muller in the room
probably something worth considering, y'all teeming up on something like that during the
off season.
All right.
Representative Rose, before you get started, I've got to ask you about the double name
badge look.
That's the first time I've seen it.
Can you help me understand what's going on there?
You know, Mr. Chairman, when you come before the honorable Senate, you need as many errors
in your Quivers, Possible and Titles, so I just made sure I've got...
Is that actually an attempt to block the arrows that may come your way from this?
No, just do.
It's just show my love young, okay? Fantastic.
Talk just, if I may, I'm just going to observe that the title that he has on the bottom
name badge is Lieutenant Governor's Florida.
Oh, I did not.
I did not.
Well, hopefully you can, can you get one of those made for Senator Walker?
I think that he might find great use with that as well.
We'll have to ask the Lieutenant Governor.
I did find out he is a Lieutenant Governor's Florida when I tried to amend his bill the other
day.
I learned the hard way that he is the floor leader for the lieutenant governor.
All right, let's talk about side by side.
We got fixed.
Mr. floor leader, take it away.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Some of you may be aware and some of you may not, but the term that we use in the country
boy world side by side has changed a lot over the last few years.
I know Senator Moore up in his area, he probably sees him quite frequently, but they've come
a long way from your old John Deere gator that you would use to kind of put around the
farm and haul stuff around. Now these side by sides are or four doors with electric windows,
with heat in there and they go 65 miles an hour. And basically all this bill does and we want
to make it as safe as possible. But what this bill does is allow side by sides that can go 25 to
65 miles an hour, be legal to ride on county roads with the ability to cross
from a new sport or state highway. They would have to, and I want to add if we
can, if you look at line 162, it would have to be equipped with headlights,
brakes, tail lights, a review mirror, and safety belts. I would also like to add
in there a blinker system if possible, and I've talked to Jen on that.
Is that a blinker system? Yes, signal lights. What would be the legal term there
that we were seeing in our lives.
I'm showing my country boy right there on the spot.
That's right, absolutely.
But that is pretty, if you look at line 187 is what we're trying to do here.
Multi-purpose all-way vehicle shall be operated only on highways that are part of a county
road system, and shall be authorized across highways that are part of a municipal street
system or part of a state highway.
And you know, just to give you an example,
where I live, my farm is 20 miles away from my house.
But I can weave in and out of dirt roads and paved roads
and drive all the way to my farm.
You know, with vehicle that goes 60 miles an hour,
you're not impeding or holding up traffic.
I know Senator Morgan probably tell you
that in North Georgia, this is a very big thing.
In Tennessee, they require their side-by-sides to be tagged.
And they can come right in the state of Georgia.
But if you live up in the mountains of North Georgia,
you cannot take your side by side into Tennessee
because you do not have a tag on the video.
So one other thing, positive note is we would be raising
our state a good bit of money by doing this.
So Chair Moore loves a good tax increase.
I'm gonna go ahead and recognize Chairman Moore.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Really, I'm excited about this section of the bill
because we have a lot of ungovernable people
in Northwest Georgia and this will make them into
to law about us.
But I do like the bill as it's written.
I would oppose adding blinkers to those.
I think it's very common to hold your hand out the window
and do this.
And if you've got your brakes, you do this.
This is something pretty common.
And I think that suffices when you take the mud
in Northwest Georgia, and it gets up there in those lights.
Can you see them anyway?
I can't see him any way in a lot of times,
and they don't work.
So I like how legislation is, it's written.
I would be at the will of the committee, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Floorlier, I happen to own one of these vehicles.
It is not equipped with brake lights or tail lights
or rear-view mirror.
It does have safety belts and headlights.
I'm assuming that most of these will need to be retrofitted
to have the brake lights and tail lights, and I'm curious.
So would those not be just as easily
if they able to serve as a signal light?
Some may.
The ones that have been bought in the last year,
two or three probably have everything,
but I know you can get a fully integrated
lighting new lighting system with signals
and everything for $6 to $700.
Not sure about just tail lights and brake lights.
This is a random story, but I was with my son
on our trails and I was winging down a tree
on my side by side and like an idiot,
I didn't look around and I pulled a tree down
top of the side by side and bent the frame and it was the middle of the pandemic and
took a year to get it fixed because all the parts were crazy.
So that's the problem.
Don't assume that all of us are responsible with these vehicles and for the moral leader
because that was pretty dumb.
All right.
Any questions, comments?
Senator C.
You ever been on the side by side?
No, I haven't.
Am I getting that invitation?
Absolutely.
I think that these are huge.
It's done a fundraiser before at Iron Mountain.
I think you would love to go right through the mud in Iron Mountain and get that
full experience, we'll keep you in mind for that.
Representative, I'm sorry, Senator Robertson.
Not a second in your motion that what you did with the
tray and all was not the most important thing that I've
known you to do.
I couldn't get the doors open, we're surrounded by leaves and
twigs and I look at my eight-year-old at that point and
I realize his dad is an idiot.
Do they make an all-terrain skinny uniform that you can wear
when you're out there?
I look really good when I'm out there, so yeah.
All right.
And what is the will of the committee?
The, yeah, did you get your permit?
Mr. Chairman, if I could.
Absolutely.
But yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Dold to come join us for just a second.
So he's got the amendment.
Great.
Well, Senator McClaurth is here.
So we're going to make sure we follow proper protocol on this.
Before we take up any amendments, we're going to take up any action on the underlying bill.
Before we amend the underlying bill.
So at the appropriate time, we will adhere to amendments.
We're not quite there yet.
We have a motion do pass from the good Senator McClure and second from Chairman Dixon.
Any discussion or amendments?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
Senator Dianne.
If I could ask Ms. Dole to address the amendment, so she'll get the verbiage exactly right?
On line 32.
On line 32.
On line 32, after wakeboarding, add uponwaters of the state, strike line 34.
number three to two online 35 and strike or anchored on that line.
Renumber four to three online 39 and online 44.
Add a comma, remove the and and add a second comma after rivers and say, or private lakes.
All right, so I believe what you've done there is you've captured the private lake versus
state waters portion you have removed the anchored vessels portion and I believe you
struck all together the body of water less than 50 acres is that correct accurate okay
yeah and I put that in the form of a motion all right we have a motion from chairman
again wait a second second senator Robertson whip Robertson all those in favor of the amendment
or any discussion all those in favor of the moment please signify by saying aye all those
like song. All right. Any other amendments to this?
Chairman more. I'd like to make an amendment to give the option of the license plate
but not mandate the license plate. I think the license plate is important if you choose to go
into Tennessee and Tennessee wants to recognize that but if you're just like representative
roads and you're going down the back roads. I don't I don't know if the
government needs to tax you to get from point A to point B. Okay. We have a
motion for a moment. Well, let's let's be a little more specific. Turn if you
can on that. And while you're doing that, maybe before we have a second on
that, my reading of this bill says they may provide a license plate and this
in no way regulate activity on private property. Only activity should you
choose to be on the roads. I do have a question. Good.
I'm not sure if I understand, you know, today we've got a lot of people that are right
inside by sides to the state highways out in front of my house or county roads around
the corner.
They do so without any license plate or anything on them.
I don't know whether they're doing that legally or not, so I'm not sure and maybe our friends
that are in the law enforcement community could address that.
I'm kind of curious.
I did want to point out and something was said we have had a horrific problem in the metro
areas with individuals out here in these untagged vehicles.
Law enforcement cannot catch them.
I understand Chairman Moore's concern and I agree with him that if my vehicle is on
my private property then you know damn the torpedoes I can go out there and do whatever
I want to do but once I get on a public road driving I think the vehicle doesn't need
to be registered and have the safety equipment necessary as the gentleman are attempting
to do not only to protect the occupants of the vehicle but also to manage the safety
of the roads in highways.
I'd like to clarify for Chairman Moore, is your intent here to, is your reading of this
bill such that you believe that any purchase of a side-by-side will now require a license
plate?
No, no, that is not the intention of my amendment.
So is the intention of your amendment to allow these to travel on the roads without the
license plates?
Mr. Chairman.
Okay.
Understood.
All right.
So do you want to, what specifically would you like to put on the amendment?
Well, had I seen the substitute last night, I would have already drawn this up, but considering
I have not read all the way through this, I'm not exactly sure I'd have to refer to legislative
counsel how to make that happen, because it looks like Section 2-4 relates to license
place as well as 2-3.
I agree with him on principle with what he said, but the intent was what Senator Robertson
was talking about, we were basically trying to make sure in our metro areas that we did
not have people abusing this and just, you know, going crazy on these side by side
in downtown Atlanta and Augusta and our different metro areas. So that was the intent of that.
Mr. Chairman, maybe we include attainment zones like we did with truck weights.
Yeah, that would capture part of what he mentioned, but not all of it.
Mr. Forleiter, because it would just be the ATL areas essentially.
What is your understanding right now is it relates to current law if you were to take
your side-by-side on a county road?
Well, without a license plate.
When you live where I live, it's kind of a, I'm speaking to the law, what's your understanding
of the law?
understanding of the law is you're not supposed to be I would ask my law
enforcement friends here but you're not supposed to do it in the country
rally of this kind of understood but we were just wanting to make it clear in
the law that it was that you could be there on the county roads they could
tell you I think it's against the law to be on the county road it's a
tickable fence and it's a tickable fence extremely dangerous I drive a pretty
large pickup truck and most of the folks out in my neck of the woods right
around in these things are children and juveniles and it's you know they're
like we all were when we were young kids they go out there and try it but also
I was with Georgia State Patrol when night crime suppression team and we chased
a gaggle of motorcycles all over the city of Atlanta saw them could not catch
them but could not identify them because they were not registered vehicles and
and I'm sure the the Colonel's team sees many more than we do because of the
In fact, of those who go out hunting and fishing and this kind of stuff, sometimes they'll
attempt to take shortcut and just take one vehicle and go down a public road and those
types of accidents are devastating to the individuals on the all-trained vehicles.
Mr. Chairman, I can just ask you.
I've talked to hundreds of people about this issue and I have not had one person so everybody
has said, I'd be more than willing to buy a tag to be able to say that I'm legally
on the road.
That is not an issue, but my understanding of the current law very clearly is that unlicensed
vehicles are not allowed on the road.
So while your sheriff may look the other way when you cross the road, my understanding
of what you're intent here is to provide a mechanism such that people that want to use
their side-by-side for consistent or even inconsistent travel along the road, or I should
say on the road, have the ability to be on the road not worried about whether a law enforcement
officer is going to look the other way or not.
It will not require me to register my side-by-side wish I never intend to drive down the road
But it would give a path to make that happen.
I think Chairman Moore, what you are saying is that you want to allow them legally to be
on the road without a license, which I think would require more than just amending this bill
because you have to point out to the code around that would be more in the broader section.
And it doesn't appear that this is the will of the committee anyway.
So if it is to be addressed, we'll address it on the floor, I suppose.
You know, if somebody wants to get a license plate and drive across state lines and be recognized
there, I think that's perfectly fine.
But I mean, you got to think some folks have, you know, up to 10 of these sometimes.
And that's like 10 tags they got to go by, they've got to keep up with every single year.
So, that was the intention of the amendment, but...
Understood. If you want to work further...
That's what we'll do, Mr. Chair.
I think that'd be wise we'll keep this moving today,
because this is your last chance to get this out of committee.
So, we have an amended motion.
Is there any other discussion on the amended motion?
All right. With that, we will take up the underlying motion,
which is a motion do pass in LC 393953S as amended all those in favor please
signify by saying aye all those opposed like sign motion carries unanimously
