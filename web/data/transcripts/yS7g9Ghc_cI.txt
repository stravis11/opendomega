TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good evening, I'm Sarah Callis with the Lawmaker's Capitol Report.
Senate Bill 68, the controversial tort reform bill, was back in the Senate today after changes
were made in the House, the carved out an exception for victims of human trafficking.
tried to add an amendment before the debate started that would give children an elderly
plaintiffs the same protections as people who have been trafficked.
So let's stand with kids, let's stand with the elderly. Why should they not have the same
rights? If they're abused, if they're raped, then people who have been sex trafficked.
Why should they not have the same rights?" That amendment failed.
Senator John Kennedy, who sponsored the bill, said that current laws still provide
many of those protections and weren't needed in the bill.
all of the other causes of actions in Georgia law are remain untouched that folks have
available to them. Democrats also found an unexpected ally in Republican Senator Colton Moore,
who said that while he was all for the premises liabilities addressed in the bill.
Because everything else in this piece of legislation is nothing more than an insurance
company bailout. There's no guarantees whatsoever that insurance companies are going to lower their
rates. I think any good business man in the insurance company. Now that they've got
this bell out, what are they going to do? They're going to pocket that money, not return it
back to their customers.
SB 68 was passed mostly along party lines, 34 to 21. Governor Brian Kemp spoke afterwards.
I've seen a lot of good legislating around this building over the years on really tough
issues and this rank is right up there with them. It's a great job.
Lawmakers return on Tuesday for day 35.
For G-PV News, I'm Sarah Callis at the State Capitol.
