TRANSCRIPT
----------
So up until last week this bill HB 127 was actually a bill to give teachers a
couple of extra days sick time it was one that was bipartisan everybody could
support it but the Republicans decided that they wanted to take that away from
teachers and put on this DEI bill supposedly was this called a DEI bill which
has really taken us back to prior days of discrimination so let's kind of
get into the weeds for a second one of the things that we talked about was our
were not germane. They were very germane and they also had not created a substitute.
Of all the amendments we had, all we did was try to add to this bill and actually make
it something that all Georgians could actually kind of work through. But they didn't want
to do that. Now the real deal to all of this, this bill takes us back. This is a sad day
for the Georgia State Senate. One of the saddest I've ever been in 10 years, quite frankly.
We heard one of my colleagues, Senator Lucas, talk about the fact what he grew up with,
what he's dealt with, Senator Magnum, others, Nann Orrah, others have fought the civil rights
movement and here we are again fighting the same movement again and it's really a
travesty that we'll be here doing these particular fights and I also believe
and I firmly believe this and one of the things I said in the well is they were
afraid of those amendments that actually talked about slavery and actually talked
about the Confederate States of America because they could not vote on those
particular amendments. One basically saying that slavery was a cause of the
Civil War, they were afraid to vote on that. So I want you to talk about people
having fear. The Republican Party today was afraid to say that slavery actually
instrumental to the civil war. They were afraid today to say the Confederate States of America
actually was a rebellion set of states. They were afraid of that. That's what they were afraid of
today. So mark that in your notes. That is the key. That is your takeaway from this. The Republican
Party of Georgia was afraid to actually condemn slavery. The Republican Party of Georgia was afraid
to actually condemn the Confederate States of America. And that's why they made that motion. And
that's why the lieutenant governor said we don't want to do this anymore. But that's exactly what
what was going on. I also want you to make note of this. This caucus was prepared to fight for
next five, six hours, whatever it was going to take to either defeat this bill or make it better.
We were going to make sure that that took place. We were not going to be afraid of that fight.
We were ready. And yet that was taken from us. So I wanted the people of Georgia to know
that tonight was the night that your Democratic caucus stood up for all people of Georgia.
Because this doesn't represent the people of Georgia. But tonight was the night the Republican
party said they're going to take Georgia backwards. Backwards today is when people did not have
have four rights. And that's exactly what it was. It cannot be any clearer than that.
One particular part of Democratic Party said we want to move forward as far as race relations
concerned. As far as gender relations are concerned, another party said we're going to
go backwards. And this state is going to refuse to do that. And we're going to continue to fight.
And this fight will continue over the next months into next year or two without taking
questions. You know I'll go ahead. I was going to say what you can
attach on to what are your thoughts about them? Well first one was when
they actually do the motion to resolve debate to begin with. So that's
already tells you right there. They did not want to actually debate this
particular bill. This is a bill basically about human rights that they basically
said look after a couple of speakers we want to resolve the debate. That is
a travesty. That in itself is a travesty. This is a bill that talks about
supposedly reverse discrimination taken away basic human rights from people and
after two speakers they were willing to say we don't want to hear anymore. Also
as a travesty the fact let go of time this bill even came up. This will be one of
the first bills that we tried to tackle so we could have a true honest hearing
about this particular bill. They didn't want to do that. They wanted to do it in
the dead of night. Hopefully try to sneak it through and but we were ready and
we're gonna make sure we fought against it. So number one it came up at a time
they were trying to hide this particular bill. They aren't proud of this
particular bill but they voted for and they're stuck with it and we're going to hang the next
with it. The fact that they're not ever going to forget what they did to Georgia tonight.
They never hurt this bill, never had one person speak and testify at the committee in favor of this bill.
That's exactly right. They were shut down and shut down and continue tonight. And
this is not how purple it. When you read this bill, when you heard with the Senate from 23rd
or talked about people are not qualified.
How dare anybody say that?
As I said it in the well,
you're talking about over 450 years
for the first African-American law student
was allowed into law school.
First African-American was allowed into medical school.
450 years, and somebody dares talk about qualification
in that situation when we've been locked out
of actually any opportunities that existed
within this state, within this nation,
and to stand up there and say that people may not be qualified
be where they are today is just sickening quite frankly and we're not we
weren't going to tolerate it we're going to continue to fight it and as I said
this is what this party will be not the Republican party to be known from
to this point forward as party that wanted to take us backwards it was basically
was trying to say that we were trying to create a committee substitute and to
do that you really trying to change the whole bill really we were just trying
to add a couple of things to the bill one of the things that we were talking
about was that DEI would not mean that you cannot say that slavery was caused by slavery.
Why would you not want to add that to that particular bill so you can say that when you're
teaching DEI, one of the things that would not be excluded because they're trying to
exclude a lot of things is the concept, the slavery actually was a contributing factor
to the Civil War.
Another thing would be, hey, you got to talk about evolution.
They didn't want to talk about that.
So those are the things that we were actually talking about.
We were not necessarily trying to substitute this bill, made no mistake.
We were trying to add to it to make sure we clarified what could and could not be taught
within our classrooms so we can continue to have robust and open classrooms.
That was the key.
They don't want to do that.
They don't want to continue to have open and robust classrooms.
As I said, they want to continue to pull us backwards and we're just not going to stand
for that anymore.
Thank you.
They were also sort of Democrats in the House to walk out during a vote over medical treatments
for prisoners in the state of the prison system.
I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the limitations that Democrats
have in pushing back on some of these bills, the strategies that you're trying to avoid
here at the end of session to do that when you don't have a lot of tools at your disposal
and any lessons you learned from these new strategies.
But one of the things, one of the things we,
the lesson we always have known,
our tools are right here, these 23 folks.
That's our tool.
Our tool is to make sure we push the envelope
and make sure we stand up for the people of Georgia.
So we've always had that tool.
There may be certain strategies here and there,
but these amendments were not necessarily a strategy.
I believe in these amendments.
I believe we want them to make sure
what could not be taught.
And so that's why you didn't see a walk out.
You saw us ready to fight.
And that's exactly ready to do it.
We were going to do that tonight,
but the Republicans didn't want to do that.
That was the key.
We're going to mitigate what you are going to do.
Oh, there's no doubt it's going to court.
And most of it, most likely, will be declared unconstitutional.
We're absolutely going to be struck down.
Many DEI programs have already been,
many of these laws have already been struck down.
Many of these DEI laws that come about,
they've been struck down.
So there certainly will be court procedures
that will take place once again, waste and taxpayer dollars
because they realize that a lot of these parts
are going to be declared unconstitutional.
So just waste and taxpayer dollars.
But 100%, we will be fighting this in court
and we will be threatening to win, too.
and elections are coming up.
And elections are coming up, that's right.
You'll see the results of this.
Measures that they took tonight
are gonna be showing up and people turn out to vote.
Senator Harbyson, what was the last time you would say
you saw 20 and then it's presented on a bill?
Senator Harbyson.
I can't remember, but it probably has happened,
but it's beyond my memory right now.
That's over three decades.
That's just on candy and the life of the fact
the passion behind this effort.
The very fact that we were fighting for a legacy
of civil rights that we inherited from the 1960s
and beyond, and this was sort of squashed
in the face of the disembowel of those members.
And of course, we've never seen a bill
like this probably for like 20 years or so,
quite frankly, a bill that actually tries to restrict
the rights of African-Americans, women, also LGBTQ.
We haven't seen a bill this comprehensive
that basically says you're not included in Georgia.
So this is a different type of bill also.
So it has to have different type of consequences too.
And a complete violation of academic freedom.
And freedom of speech.
If Trump wasn't elected, this big aluminum
is discussing tonight.
We'll be talking about it.
And that's the reason we're talking here tonight.
At the committee meeting, there were at least 15 people
who signed up to speak on this bill,
and they would not allow them to.
they closed everything like they did tonight with us.
They had no way of saying anything.
I asked for, what is this gonna cost us?
They told me I shouldn't ask,
it's no fiscal, no required.
However, it's gonna cost a lot of money,
so where's the money coming from?
That's exactly right.
So what you see here is a unified caucus
against this particular bill.
We've been a unified all session.
We continue to do that after session two.
So I would say it's two people in Georgia.
The fight will continue.
It's going to be in the courthouse.
The fight now goes to the courthouse.
But the fight, that's right.
But the fight will also continue.
And the fight also will continue at the ballot box, too.
That's going to be the next key.
Absolutely.
You need to take the fight together.
There you go.
Thank you guys so much.
Appreciate it.
