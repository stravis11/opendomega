Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day of work with scripture and scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the gentleman from the 148th House District, representing no Williams representative Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to welcome today my pastor from Cordill, originally from Savannah, Georgia. He has been our pastor for the past seven years. He has done an excellent job. He's a great leader, but he's a better friend. He's really good at the words. I've heard a lot of preachers in my time, and I'm also getting to hear him every Sunday. I'd like to introduce to you all today my pastor and friend, Larry Rollins. Thank you so much. It is an honor and a privilege to be here in the House this afternoon. I'm going to say this morning, my original schedule is this morning. I got to thinking about that before I began to share this morning, because normally I preach in the morning, and I watch people looking at their watch so they can get to the restaurant before the Baptist, where the method is. I know a Baptist preacher says the exact same thing. I figure y'all have all had lunch, so we've got time, right? Just kidding. Before I do want to thank y'all for being here, I want to thank you for a miracle that you've performed. No Williams I understand sits over here, which means he doesn't have to sit on the back row, which is a minor miracle. We're delighted. It's nice to know what you look like up close, and all thank you. Y'all tell me if he does is off. I'll know ahead of time. I just wanted to share it before I share scripture and prayer with y'all. I was noticing in the hallway just how sort of pandemonium goes on around here, and I know everyone in this room has such a weight of responsibility. And I understand that. I know there's that place where sometimes it feels like no matter what you do, nothing goes right or certainly nobody gives you credit. I have been in the ministry now 30 years, and everywhere I go there is an Edgar. That was a gentleman at a church I served. Edgar was a guy who rarely comp. No, he never... He occasionally had a good word to say to somebody. I just never heard it. And even when he began with a good word, it usually ended with, yeah, but, and then there was something else. And I know there's those days it feels that way no matter what you do, it doesn't seem to make a difference and you get overwhelmed. I share that with you because I wanted to share what to me is one of the hardest, most difficult, if you will, scriptures in the Bible, because it sounds good. And there's a lot that sounds good, but then what you do with it is a whole nother ball game. And it's from 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, verses 16 to 17. And it says simply, rejoice always, pray continuously, and give thanks in all circumstances. And that sounds marvelous. Except that I know about you, there's times I don't feel like rejoicing always. And sometimes my prayers are not the lovely things that seems to make. It's Lord do something about knowle, or something along those lines in there. And then give thanks in all circumstances. I drove up here yesterday and I left Cordilla early thinking I'd beat the traffic. There is no such thing. And as I sat there in the traffic jam that exists from locust grove to 675, I sat there and I thought I'm going to talk about rejoicing and I don't feel like rejoicing. And I'm certainly not thankful for this. But let me give you something that I hope will be a nice nugget just very briefly to carry with you in the work that you're doing today before we pray together. I have been privileged to serve in the ministry for 30 years. And as a Methodist minister, I have served everywhere from Savannah to Chester. I don't know who represents Chester here. I just will say 30 years ago when I was appointed to Chester, it didn't exist on the map I bought from the convenience store. I served in Macon and Vidalia and Columbus. I went to school in Atlanta and I say all that to say I find this to be a wonderful state. There's so much and so many wonderful folks and so many places. And today I drive back and forth to see my mother in Savannah or up to Carter'sville to see my mother-in-law and her family. And I realize just how amazing our state is. All the different places. I drive through towns I served and I'm thankful for the folks I know. And I realize sometimes we miss it. In all of the rush and all of the confusion, we miss it. My family are avid campers and we have camped at nearly every one of the state parks in Georgia. That was our standard getaway. My sons are big campers. I even honeymoon to Cloudland Canyon State Park years ago. And just the way the state is, the beauty of the state is marvelous. You can go and see and do so very much. It's wonderful. I am proud and happy to have raised my sons in the state. I have an older son who lives in Columbus, has married, settled their loves where he lives. I have a younger son that went into the army and trained at Fort Benning now for more before he was deployed in numbers of places and he went out. And before he was deployed the first time he bought himself a camouflage pattern Atlanta Braves cap. So he could carry with him to Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria and wherever else. And he looked at me with a grin. He said, I got to be a missionary too, dad. Go Braves. So there were those places that we just love about the state. But I wanted to tell you the one thing that made me happiest and most excited about being a Georgian. In September, as you know, Hurricane Helene churned up and came in in Cordill. We watched the weather and it looked like it was going to come right over top of us. And we had been hit by Hurricane Michael back in 2018 and we were worried to death about what that was going to mean. And so we batten down and buckled down. And then of course, as you know, somewhere in the night, it took a turn to the east and it hit our neighbors farther off in that direction. And I have said to this day that the people of my church, I think suffer from survivors guilt. They were fully expecting it to hit us and it didn't. And literally that morning, my phone began to light up as folks said, what can we do? How can we help other pastors in the community called and all the sudden we were just and undated with donations of money, of tarps, of water, of canned goods, stuff that I don't think will ever use. But folks were giving everything they could. We sent working with folks in our community. And I know all the communities around here did this. We sent teams up to bring food to some places. We sent teams to bring whatever was needed. I loaded up one of the teams that went within a truck that I was driving and we were loaded up with stuff to go see folks that I had known back in Vidalia. And we drove a truckload of tarps and water and canned goods. And I'm only telling you this because on the way there, as I drove through places that were so dear to me and that were so devastated and so torn up, we drove past town after town. And in every parking lot of churches and shopping centers were these centers where people were handing out food and tarps and water. These were church groups and civic groups. These were black people and white people and brown people. These were Democrats and Republicans. These were neighbors. And it didn't matter what label we put on each other. It meant our friends were in trouble and we could do something. And I know sometimes I forget that and the stuff when I run into the edgers of this world and I get frustrated. And I remind myself that those are the people that God has called me to serve and I am so grateful for it. And those are the people that you are blessed to serve. And I am thankful that we have the opportunity in all of the hard work you're going to do to care for the folks of the state of Georgia, who are marvelous folks. And so I do rejoice always. There's so much to rejoice in. I pray continually. Sometimes it's O Lord help, sometimes it's Lord thank you. I give thanks in all circumstances because we are indeed a blessed people. And I hope that lives your day. I hope that strengthens you as you go forward today as you do the hard work that's called upon and remember the folks like the folks in that gallery and all over the state who are here because they know that they can be trusted. They can trust you in what you do. Thank you for your service. Will you bow with me in prayer? God of the soul.

We bow bow before you as a blessed people. A people with much to celebrate and much that brings us joy. Give us eyes to see it and ears to hear it and hearts to be well filled. Teach us to see one another through your eyes of grace and appreciation. Be with those whom you have entrusted with leadership. Grant them your wisdom and your patience. Remind them of why they serve and most especially whom they serve. Teach us all to cherish your gifts. Most especially the beloved sons and daughters you place around us. In our work and in our challenges, even in our disagreements, may we build up and never tear down so that we may hand this wonderful legacy to our children, to our grandchildren, and to many generations yet unborn. This is our hope, our dream and our prayer. In your holy name we pray this day. Amen. Amen. Would you join me in the pledge? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you brother Larry. Thank you. Thank you. No going to we go take a photo. Doorkeepers you may unlock the doors members. You can join brother Larry in the South County any room and thank him for being with us today. We appreciate your words brother. Thank you for being here and appreciate that prayer as well. Members, our doctor of the day has brought us by Representative Scott Holcomb. He doesn't see that strong. Our doctor is Dr. Daniel Loupes. We appreciate Dr. Loupes serving us today. Thank you. Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and Knowledge is recognized. Chairman Hilton. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Knowledge has spent the long weekend reading the journal the previous legislative day and after many days we've found it to be correct. I'm sure you to get much sleep. I understand you're a slow reader. Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and Knowledge reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct is an objection to a dispense with a reading of the journal. Chair here's none. The reading the journal is dispensed with is an objection to the confirmation of the journal. Hearing none, the journal is confirmed. Mr. Clerk, are you ready to read the resolution establishing the order of business for the day? Representative Shatian, the 104th Moose following me establishes the order of business in the first part of the period unanimous consent. Introduction to bills and resolutions, first reading and reference of House bills and resolutions, second reading of bills and resolutions, reports of standing committees, first reading and reference of Senate bills and resolutions, morning orders. Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution establishing the order of business for the day? Hearing none, the resolution has adopted. Members, I would ask you to direct your attention, your full attention. We have a special guest who's serving Georgia and serving the United States of America in the U.S. Congress. A former member of this House, I'm going to ask him to join me. Members, take your seats. See your conversations. A distinguished Georgia that is serving us well and I can let you all know as we had a conversation about hurricane relief and disaster relief, I can't think of any better champion for Georgia. Especially rural Georgia that served us any better and was any more proactive and helpful than Congressman Sanford Bishop. So I want you to show your appreciation to the Congressman as he comes and speaks to us right now. He's earned that privilege as a former member of this House. Congressman Bishop. Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, it is indeed a privilege and an honor for me to be here back home. Truly, this is the day that the Lord is made and we must be rejoiced and be glad in it. I'm so happy to be here. It's very nostalgic to come back where I got my beginning. I understood the fundamentals of the legislative process and politics. There was no better training for me than the 14 years I spent in this House and the two years over in the Senate which really, really underscored how important the work is that you do. And so I just want to come and to greet you to let you know that we are in Washington as you are here, doing our dead level best to represent the people of the state of Georgia. I represent Middleton, Southwest Georgia. I have for now, this is my 33rd year. But the thing that I am so, so happy about is that here in this general assembly, I learned that politics is nothing more, nothing less than who gets what and when and how in this legislative and this political process. Now we all, on the federal level, the state level and even the local level, represent the same people. We are sworn and we are committed to working for and in their behalf. And through often we lose our focus and focus on the things that divide us. But we must remember as we serve the people of this state and as I serve the people of this country that we must focus on our common goals, our common hopes and our common aspirations. And we have more in common than we have the devazas. And so I'm happy to be this state representative in Washington to help pursue the strong interests of this state, improving the quality of life for everyone in this state. And of course in these United States, agriculture is the strongest industry, the biggest economic engine in this state. I'm proud to be in a position to help our state's agriculture. Defense and military and veterans are the next biggest contributor and in influence in this state. I'm proud to be in a position to do that. And of course, many people across this country don't know how important financial services are to this country and half of the transactions in this country. Every single day come right through Georgia. So we have so much in common, so much to look after and I look forward to continuing to work with each and every one of you, the speaker, the lieutenant governor, the governor, all of the people of the state of Georgia to make this state the best state anywhere and to have the quality of life for the people of this state as high and as good as possible. As we carry out our duties, each and every one of us is here for a certain time. We have our period of service. It is my hope and my prayer that each of us, you as you represent your constituents and your district, I as I represent the people of the second congressional district and all of us use the time that we have here for the betterment of our people. Every single moment here should be for and in the health of all of the people of our states and the people that we represent. Dr. Benjamin Mage used to quote, a poem, synonymous poet, I have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it forced upon me, can't refuse it, didn't seek it, didn't choose it, I must suffer if I lose it. Give account if I abuse it. Just a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it. I pray that all of us in our respective positions will use God's minute for the betterment of humanity and humankind. Thank you so much for allowing me to come back to this chamber that means so much to me. God bless you and God bless your work for the people of Georgia. Thank you so much. Congressman Bishop, thanks for taking time to come by and be with us. Thanks for your service. You make us proud. Keep doing what you're doing. Thank you. Members, Congressman Bishop will join you in the south any room so you can visit with him a moment and get a photo with him. Thank you for your attention, members.

The FFA does so many wonderful things, and there are so many wonderful projects that children participate in that help them become outstanding members of our society. To me, the best thing FFA does is it raises kids because it gives them opportunities to gain skills and confidence. So think they can go forward in the world and make good decisions and become the people we need them to be the leaders of tomorrow. So it's my honor to introduce a number of our state officers. It can be a play lock. She is the State FFA Secretary from Gordon County. In Malarance, she's the State FFA Vice President. She is from a manual county.

Chairman, what guys are recognized for an order? Thank you, miss Picker. Got one of your favorite grips here. CSG, which is the council of state governments. Most of your UO timers know them as the Southern Legislative Conference every summer they have a great conference. Last year we were in West Virginia and I want to bring up just because to show you how valuable they are. Miss Picker, you were on a panel with a young gentleman who was trying to bring a business to Georgia. And he looked at you and said when we were looking at barriers to providing childcare and other issues, we decided to go to North Carolina. And I know that hurts you as much as it did me. So I emailed them and I said hey, could I get a chart of the Southern States and our regulations surrounding that very issue. Within a week, I got this big print out of all the rules and regulations for corporations providing childcare. And that's the kind of reports and stuff they can turn out within a few days. So put July 19 to 22 and without even asking you miss Picker, I'm sure you're going to be there in Birmingham, Alabama. But put that down. It's a great time to find out what other states are doing on the various issues that you're working on. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Chairman. I guarantee you I'll be there. And I welcome you all to join Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter and Alabama for a great event with a great group. And we need to take advantage of them. You're right, Miss Chairman. They have a storehouse of information. We appreciate CSG. And since she says an old time, I thought it was SLC. So CSG, thanks for that. Let's see.

Let's see, we can get you all up here before we get started. Representative, you're talented. He wants to say hello to the coast. Yes sir, Mr. Speaker. Just as a second home kind of situation. He hasn't come down there yet. But you think he does as often as you think he does. So you aren't adopted coastal guy. He doesn't wear socks usually down there. Anyway, welcome colleagues after an in order morning orders. Just want to remind you tonight. First welcome our Golden Oils group is here. We've got over 50 coming in.

Members, we're going to take up House Resolution 42, which is very important to the people of Georgia has been. So I'm going to recognize Governor's floor leader, Representative Matthew Gamble to present House Bill 42, Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Resolution number 42, by Representative Gamble, 15th and others. A resolution ratifying Governor Brian P. Kemp's executive orders number 10-1 24-2 10-8 24-1 and 10-15 24-1, suspending the collection of motor fuel and diesel fuel taxes. Representative Gamble, I think the clerk got me back. So I think I said House Bill, but certainly House Resolution 42. The gentleman's recognized to present House Resolution 42. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to present to you House Resolution 42, which is the on behalf of Governor Kemp to ratify the temporary suspension of the collection of motor fuel and diesel fuel taxes in response to his three executive orders in October of 2024, declaring a state of emergency for Hurricane Helene. This is being done because this is a procedural matter that we need to take up. During that time, the Governor consulted with the leadership of our legislature on these suspensions, which saved Georgians between $140 to $160 million at the gas pumps during that time as we all were feeling the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Just like previous resolutions, this one simply ratifies what the Governor has already done and this is a necessary procedure that we need to take up. And again, through the Governor's executive actions, which were issued in consultation with the leadership, the collective efforts to conservatively manage our state's budget has allowed us the opportunity to help lessen the burden of a horrific natural disaster. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions that may be on House Resolution 42 and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. Gentlemen, yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Period none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed? We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? For what purpose is representing the hall, Russ? Parliamentary inquires? State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that previous suspensions of motor fuel taxes have demonstrated clear benefits for Georgia's economy and citizens by keeping more money in the hands of everyday Georgians? Thank the lady knows what she speaks and we appreciate it. It's been a thing that all Georgians have a very meaningful matter. Have all members voted. All members voted this. So the clerk will lock the machine. All the adoption of House Resolution 42, the yeas are 172, the nays are zero. The resolution heaven received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 223-223? House Bill 223 by Representative Perchette of the 176 to be entitled to amend Title 48, the fiscal to Georgia and its underrelated and revenue and taxation. So it's the exclude from the calculation of taxable net income, certain disaster relief or assistance grant program payments. Let's Bill Emmer for the Committee on Ways and Means Act Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Will Perchette is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All right, folks. I have the first of what I hope to be many bills seeking to help in the relief of Hurricane Helene's damage. I'm going to start by giving you a little story and then run through the measures in the bill and then ask for your favorable consideration. But first I want to thank this House. I want to thank Speaker and Leader of the administration and Leader Hugley for all of the support that this chamber gave South Georgia and during Hurricane Helene. The outpouring of love, via water, food, diapers, formula was significant and I can tell you I very much appreciated all of your help and when we needed help, like the pastor said this morning, the first people to respond were just neighbors and friends, calls from no one asked what part of you were or pointed out any differences they just got there to help and I very, very much appreciate this body for doing what they did. With that said, as the sunset on that September evening, the horizon was painted with eerie stillness and the storms rolled in. If you recall, it was not supposed to, the track of the storm was tracking west and it turned last minute to the east and for my family, the winds were hailing like a freight train. I had both of my boys and my wife in the bathroom and we hunkered down through the night and very seldom do I ever get nervous about a storm and folks let me tell you this storm was bad, was terrible. I started rethinking the fact of not moving out and I've been through several of these hurricanes. As we woke up, we had a different skyline to look at. Everything I live on a farm and it looked nothing like it did when I went to sleep. In fact, we just bought a new vehicle and we hadn't gotten insurance on it because I closed off insurance and I had a pine tree sitting this far from my wife's car and Lord thank you for not crushing that because I don't think I could have lived that now. But overnight, the agricultural community found a loss of $5.6 billion. That's how much damage from the Florida state line, the South Carolina state line we found with Hurricane Elaine. You're talking about she-

in houses, livestock barns, trees, it looked like a tornado hit. It looked like a tornado hit everywhere. Doesn't look anything like it did. The devastation was widespread and it was a hit, you know, the heart of what I consider Georgia. Everybody's part of Georgia is their favorite part of the state, but this is family farms that were hit significantly. Whole stands of 100 acres of trees were completely laying down. We're talking about 30-year-old trees, someone's invested their life savings in and was counting on that as a retirement plan or now gone. And we have about us a state down there that has this beautiful stand of pine trees and there's not one pine tree in about us a state right now. And you're talking about huge, huge trees. The recovery started that day like I said and you all are a big part of that and we're still recovering. If you haven't had a chance to get down there, get down there and take a look. It's going to take years and years to recover from this storm. And my whip over there is giving me the hurry up so you guys are getting tired and glass side and I appreciate that. So I'll get to the bill. What the bill seeks to do is essentially what we did in Hurricane Michael. In 2018 Governor Deel General Assembly laid out language that sought to not make whole but try and help out with the damages there. Now Governor Brian Kim and this house is leading with House Bill 223. The bill aims to address the devastation and the loss of the agricultural community in three main components. First, it exempts disaster relief payments. Any payments received for disaster relief, it exempts them from state income tax as well as crop insurance. The second section of the bill allows timber owners a tax credit for the loss that they found. They only are allowed to take the tax credit if they replant. And then lastly, it exempts the sales tax for building materials for any livestock buildings like a poultry house or a livestock barn. That's pretty much the bill, Mr. Bigger. I hope that everybody can support it. I hope for your favorable consideration of the bill. This is one, like I said, of many to come. I do want to point out one gentleman the day after the storm. Leader of frustration and Sam West started working on language for this bill. And he saw fit to allow me to carry the bill. It means it was in my district, but I really want to tell you I appreciate you for working on the bill. Again, this is what we did in Michael. It's a rerun. And I hope that this general assembly will pass this bill and give some relief to our number one industry. And that is agriculture in the state of Georgia. And with that, Miss Speaker, I don't want to believe at the point. You have a couple of questions if the gentleman will yield. I will. Chair recognize the gentleman from the 68th district representative Jackson. Representative Derry Jackson has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Isn't that true that we need to pass House Bill 223 because the Trump administration just declined our FEMA requests? I don't know that's the reason we need to pass it, but I do agree with you. We do need to pass it. It's important that we get some relief to our farmers and our ag community and I appreciate your affirmative vote. Do you further yield? Sure. So it's imperative that there's 200 million that House Bill 223 outlines. It's just a small increment of assistant. So we still need the federal government to show up. Is that not true? It is true that there's $200 million in this bill and in the aggregate for tax credits and I appreciate your support on the bill. One more do you yield? I do. Not true that FEMA plays a very central role to Georgia because the number of hurricanes or tornadoes we get. We can't simply continue to pass House Bill 223 any other time because we need FEMA to be there for Georgia. Is that not true? We're representative. I can't speak for what they're doing DC, but I certainly hope that I can speak for this chamber in support of 223. Gentlemen, yield. It does true your left representative Kelly from the 16th has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman yield. I do to my friend. First I want to tell you thank you for bringing this measure up. Up in North Georgia we didn't see the disaster that y'all had, but we certainly felt it with y'all. I'm still praying for y'all as y'all recover. But is it not true that this bill has similar language that we've passed previously for hurricane Michael? Is. Thank you. Appreciate it. Gentlemen has two more questions to feel yield. Two more questions. Yes sir. The lady from the 108th represent Jasmine Clark to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. I understand how hurricanes and we've seen a lot of them. I've lived in Georgia my entire life and I feel like we're seeing a lot more of these incidences. I'm just curious. So this bill is very specific to timber. Has there been any contemplation about helping just regular everyday Georgians who might also benefit from some type of tax credit? Because you mentioned like insurance, you mentioned property damage, all those things. This seems to be very specific for one set, one industry. Is there any contemplation of helping those just Georgians down in that area? Well, I thank you for the question and I would submit to you that timber owners and South Georgia are normal tax pay and Georgians. But I do get your point and I do believe that there are a myriad of these types of bills in the works. In fact, I've been talking and pleading with my roommate chairman of ways and means to hear some more of my bills. But we've got a lot working on it and I certainly appreciate your pointing that out. All right. Thank you so much. Gentlemen, yield to his roommate. I figured y'all could have worked this out back home, but gentlemen, yield. I do. Representative Blackman is recognized for a question. Commissioner speakers of gentlemen, yield. Gentlemen does yield. Isn't it true that you have championed several measures, not only this one that will help those victims of lean and disaster across Georgia? That's my roommate right there. I'm going to say, I would do. Is it not further true that House Bill 223 will ensure that these disaster relief funds will go directly and fully in the pockets of those that have been devastated the most by this 100%. Yes, sir. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Gentlemen, yield to the will. We have a speaker on the bill. Chair recognizes chairman Hatchett to speak to House Bill 223. Give the gentleman your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I have not planned on doing this today. But listening to the questions, listening to our pastor today, just put this on me that I needed to come say something. Those of you who did not experience the 2 a.m. wake up call of destruction do not know what we in the area and in the line of the storm experience. It was scary. It made you question your life. And I'm going to make it through this. It was real. I mean, I just can't describe it. I never felt like I would experience that and it didn't stop. It came and it got quiet and it came back. I have never seen the destruction that this storm did to our state. Never. No one has. And this is just a small portion of what I think we should be doing for the citizens of our state. And I will continue to try to work to do something to help those that still have not received any help in this storm. There are many, many blue tarps still keeping rain out of people's homes and what's left of them. There were over a thousand homes in my county that were determined, unlivable. And I was on the edge. So people, we need to help where we can. This means something to those that lost something and lost everything. I don't know what all we can do, but everything we can do will be appreciated. And I thank you all for supporting this and helping those citizens not only in the district that I'm honored to serve, but the many across South, Middle and Eastern Georgia that this will benefit. Thank you and I yield the will. General Gilles DeWel, as always, Representative Hatchett has a big heart. And we appreciate your service and what you do as you recognize the loss of so many people across Georgia. And we look forward to working with you on that. There's no further questions, no further comments, no further speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. For what purpose is represented the Hague and Rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue of inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that when we help our ag producers in this state that we're actually helping every single Georgian in this state? I think the lady knows what she speaks. She understands the industry. For what purpose does Chairman Mix rise? Any ways? Have all members now voted? All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of the bill? The Yees are the passage of House Bill 223. The Yees are 173. The Nays are zero. This bill, Henry's either requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Thank you members. Many Georgians appreciate that. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 92? 92? House Bill 92, I represent a black man in the 146 and others. To be entitled an act to amend Code Section 485, 44.2, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to base year, homestead exemptions. So as to postpone the date by which local governing authorities are authorized to opt out. This bill ever referred to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chairman Blackman is recognized to present House Bill 92. Representative Blackman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, fellow members. Bring before you House Bill 92, which having met and talked to many of you and a lot of your local officials. This is a cleanup to the homestead exemption piece, HP 581 that passed this body overwhelmingly. And then again via the CA in November designed to protect homeowners from exceedingly high property tax assessments and also property tax owners in general. So there are several pieces to this bill go through on the cleanup side that are listed. There was not an area defined around the homestead consistent with other pieces of legislation. That is a five acre add to this bill. There are some changes to the notice that would clarify and clean up the timing as to when that would come forward. And if what would happen if if local governments did not provide the full the rollback estimated rollback rate. There's a provision that would allow for the filing of an exemption during the appeal process. It would also allow spousal survivability of one's homestead exemption without an additional filing. And then finally there is a date change it would I think hopefully give the locals some more time to understand the value of allowing taxpayers to keep more their money and extend this out to March 31st for that opt out period also allowing them to opt to back end during that period have they already opted out. I do want to thank so many of the people that had a chance to talk too along these lines and I know that the question that has come up repeatedly is you know there's what's in this for us. There's nothing in this for us. Right representative Williams and I say this is tax relief is intended for the tax payer. Not the tax collector and I just I know that several measures have come up today and Mr. Speaker if I may I just want to thank you for championing tax relief for hard work and Georgians all across this state. Be happy to stand for questions there are any. I'm going to allow two questions and those buttons are already pushed we have some other things we need to do today. I'm going to recognize representative Kelly to your left the gentleman from the 16th House District for question representative Kelly. Thank you Miss Speaker were the gentleman yield. Do I need to yield yes or out you. Mr. Chairman thank you for your work on this measure I think this is you know combined with 581 provides our tax payers with the greatest opportunity we've seen in decades. But isn't it true that in this legislation all we're doing is extending a time period for our local stuff make the right decision and opt in stay in but we're not touching the exemption itself. Yes or I that that is is correct other than the little bit of a not that we've been asked to provide by several of the stakeholders involved. Thank you for the question gentleman yield for another one yes or miss speaker representative representative Al Williams. Since you referenced him as a mentor I'm going to ask the question you're too kind to speak with the gentleman yield. Yes or for you is it not true that I do support this extension. Is it not further to true that I would hope that we would take the time to really really explain this bill that has had so many misreferences throughout that we explain the benefits as it relates to tax payers and let's try and get ahead of social media. And get to truth on this bill and the the representative knows of what he speaks thank you sir. We're almost there for your yield for another one of gentlemen knows a little bit about local government I'm going to recognize representative Chaz Cannon to your right. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that if all the cities in the county opt into 581 in addition to the county that the citizens in that county would be able to realize that they're significant reduction in their property taxes. Yes that is absolutely true in fact I think what we found in total this bill that as many as 2 thirds of the cities could eliminate their property tax and a number of counties could do that as well. Let's see if this last one helps with that social media representative Carter Barrett is recognized for a question of gentleman with yield. Does it gentleman yield to my seat made yes sir. Thank you sir. Isn't it true that you will be happy if you never hear the term opt out again. 100% accurate Mr. Speaker I believe I'll yield the well. I think that'd be a good point. We appreciate all those questions and Mr. Chairman thank you for your work. You're a very conscientious work on certainly very complicated issues like this one. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered. Here none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute. Here is none the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules. Here none the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the community which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Here none the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage. The bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Okay. That's all. That's all. That's right. Have all members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the pass to the bill, the yeas are on the passage of House Bill 92. The yeas are 173. The nays are won.

Always doing things just right to set an example for other people who would come and behind me, especially women. That is those are the words of Gladys West. She was born in rural Virginia. Gladys West spent her childhood helping her parents on the farm. As she grew up, she dedicated her time to her education and graduated valedictorian of her high school in 1948. Shortly after receiving a master's degree in mathematics, she took a position at the computer program, program or student and project manager for data processing systems at the Naval proving ground. In the 1970s and 1980s, she programmed an IBM to model the shape of the earth and her data became the foundation for the global positioning system, better known as GPS that has become a vital component of our daily lives. So when you're lost or when you need directions to your favorite coffee shop, using ways, thank Gladys West for getting you there safely. I yield the wheel. Chairman Jasperes and Representative McDonald are recognized members of the house. You need to pay attention to the transportation chair because this is important about how we properly move forward and the vice chair of the committee as we talk about road naming the process. There is a process. So please give the gentleman your attention. Okay, members, take a look on your desk. You'll see a sheet just like this. Now fold it up, put it in your desk, take it with you or come see me to get another one at some other time. But this is how you name a road. As I go through this, I didn't do this. I have the best policy analyst that many of us share Abbey Day. She helps us do these things and she's our key person in road naming. The committee has a number of rules about road naming and will help you get through it. But I can't emphasize enough. This is an honor, a responsibility that you have. You better take it serious or it'll bite you. Because one thing that comes to people talk to me about is who can I name a road after? Think about it. It's got to be somebody with national prominence. You can kind of know what that is. Or somebody that's been a very impactful person in your community commissioners. That's up for you to decide but decide carefully. It's not just because you're friends with someone. So I wouldn't do that. You have plenty of time to get this done. There are three steps. You've got to do it. You've got to do them carefully and do them right for us to pass through. But I can't emphasize enough. It's a powerful opportunity in your community to honor someone. And I'm going to turn it over to my boss, Chairman, Lor McDonnell. And he'll tell you how powerful it is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. It is powerful to do this as an honor for us to pick that person in our community. And just recently, first of the year, we had somebody that was just a pillar of the community, Mr. Bobby Thomas. He was unfortunately a Georgia Tech grad. And of course, my family business, we did the service. And his family made me wear Georgia Tech Ty for three days. And those most painful things, I experienced I ever had. But I did it for the family. Mr. Chairman, he served in our United States Navy. And why he was doing that? He met with the love of his life, Miss Brenda Pugh. And when owned it, he owned a business they did. They supplied seeder for all over the southeast. So when you're thinking about that pillar in your community and what you want to say to that person, you know, I had my chairman says, hey, have you ever written somebody a note? So if you can look up on the screen, you can see I wrote Mr. Thomas a note. A note saying reminding him what he meant to the community, what an honor it was for me to honor him with this road naming. And so at his service, they had turned it around. When they, the family framed it right after the road naming, but at his service, they took it back to the frame. And the note that I had written him was so powerful to them that that's how they're going to leave that hanging on their wall in their home. And so when you're doing these road naming, it's so important to write these people a note on the back of the sign because it meant so much to this family. Thank you for your time. Well, you're the one. I hope all of the members understand how you exercise this important honor that we have and a great privilege to name part of our transportation system to honor someone. I'm going to ask Representative Reese and the Columbus delegation, all members of the Columbus delegation to come forward. Gentlemen will hold just for a moment. Members, if you will, let's all stand as we condolences are expected for a passing in the community, Joe Jalen. I think we have everyone don't we represent you Reese, the entire delegation. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today we come before you with solid hearts, hearts that are hurting all the way from Columbus, Georgia. For we lost a phenomenal person in our community, former longtime of Skoget County senior court judge, John Allen, died at the age of 82. He was chief judge of the Chattanoche Circuit for two decades before retiring in 2013. He was a Columbus native that spent over 30 years on the bench.

He grew up in one of the local housing projects there in Columbus, Georgia. So you can imagine what a hero he was in the community to so many different people. He was respected as a trailblazer and often praised for his fair but compassionate approach to the law and those who came before his court. Today we stand here to remember him. Today we stand here to solidify his legacy. Today we stand here to acknowledge the things he was able to overcome like attending the insegregated Spencer High School in Columbus, Georgia and graduating from the Tuskegee University and Tuskegee, Alabama and becoming an Air Force fighter pilot doing Vietnam and attorney and eventually a judge. If you will please join me in a moment of silence as the Skogie County in the Chattahoochie Judicial Circuit, remember one of our stallwursts, one of our leaders, one of our giants in the legal community. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Representative Roman is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you Mr. Speaker and colleagues on Thursday afternoon we heard sort of two differing assessments of an ongoing lawsuit related to Section 504 that provides disability protections. I was curious because when we come down here we tend to disagree, we tend to talk about issues and so I decided to look up the lawsuit myself and why do I share this story? Because I think sometimes we lose sight of the fact that in this political world we can actually go and read things for ourselves. We have access to primary sources and in a moment like that when we disagree on something like this that impacts so many people around our state we have a responsibility to fact check what we say. In the case of the lawsuit on Section 504 on page 42 it very explicitly states that one of the remedies being requested is that Section 504 be deemed unconstitutional. It is one sentence in a very small list. All I'm asking is that during times like these when people might be scared or worried about how something impacts them that we don't inadvertently lull them into a false sense of security and then they are unable to prepare for what's to come. That is my only ask of all of you. That is my afternoon order for today and as a reminder to everybody to please check in with your constituents on issues like 504 and other resources they have been using to make life easier for them and their families. Thank you. Lady, you use the wheel. Representative Hilton has recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've been in politics or elected office close to a decade now and this might be saying a lot but one of the most shameful things I've seen in my time in office is what took place this past week and over the weekend and that is political partisan groups, fomenting fear, confusion and frankly misinformation in regards to the 504 plan and what's happening. Again I got up here Thursday and I'm going to say the same thing I said on Thursday to the special needs community. Your 504 plan is not at risk. There is a line and a lawsuit that the Attorney General signed that does say I'm black and white. We want to declare it unconstitutional. However if anyone with any level of intellectual honesty went to dig in deeper into the entire lawsuit, spoke to the AG, spoke to educational professionals, you will quickly and easily find that all agree that no one is in fact trying to take away the 504 program. In fact we are trying to protect it against a gender ideology movement that is trying to take away precious resources from our state's most vulnerable. It is wrong then, it is why Georgia is suing. We are suing to protect the integrity and the funding of the special needs 504 program and anyone who wants to get up and say anything different is just spewing misinformation. So again I'll say one more time to our families out there. Here in Georgia we are fighting for you and we are fighting for your access to the 504 against federal overreach and we'll continue to keep fighting for you. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Representative Fry, Representative Spencer Fry from Athens is recognized for an afternoon to give the gentleman your attention please for an afternoon order. Representative Fry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies gentlemen, earlier today I was able to put a letter on your desk and this letter I wrote to my dad on Friday. I'm going to have passed away about 2017, 2017, you don't have to stand up or anything. I never thought to recognize him over here and didn't think he really, he didn't carry the way. I'm not going to go into the letter but I think if you take a second to take a look at it you will understand exactly what I'm trying to say. We were all raised differently than what we're following our folks in DC acting like. I just want to give you one paragraph because I'm not here to judge, I'm not here to lambast, I'm not here to do anything, I'm not here to talk about the 504 plan. I'm going to read this little paragraph. To my father. And I wrote, Dad, also know you wouldn't want me to lose hope. You tell me that love is still stronger than hate. That even in the darkest times there are still good people trying to do the right thing. You'd remind me that our job isn't to despair. It's the fight for what is right to be the hands and the feet of the gospel, to keep showing up for people just like we did all those years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to keep those words in your heart. God bless the state of Georgia and thank you very much. I yield the well. Thank you. And thank God for good parents. You had a good dad. Thank you representative. Representative Wade has recognized for an afternoon order. Gentlemen, recognize. Thank you speaker. I just want to give a shout out to some excellent students back home working hard in their schools today. But these athletes recently in my district, district nine, we have some state champions. First of all, I'd like to highlight the Lumpkin County High School women's wrestling team from my friends in South Georgia that yep, that's tussling. It's okay, you can laugh. But two three time individual champs, Nathan Nielsen, three time, Greta, Gerbosovas, three time, her sister, Nora, state champ this year too, and then Nathan's brother, Zander, also a state champ. And Mike Nichols runner up. For Dawson County, we have a freshman, Parker Voss, individual state champion, and White County finished fourth place in the state. We know how to wrestle in North Georgia. And so just remember that I'll wrestle a bill now again to thank you speaker. Way to go Dawson, Lumpkin and White County. Thanks. Congratulations.
