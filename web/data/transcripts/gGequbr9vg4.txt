----------
Technological innovations speed up faster than many of us can keep up. Our state is helping
to keep things moving. According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia
is proudly at the forefront of digital health, cyber security, thin tech, and creative
technology. Now, that's great for Georgians in the workforce, but as technology grows,
There's a need to create laws that protect Jordan's and joining me are Republican Representative
Todd Jones of South Versailles.
He chairs the House Committee on Technology and Infrastructure Innovation and Democratic
Senator Sally Harrell of Atlanta.
Her committees include government oversight.
She also co-chaired a Senate study committee on social media AI and children over the past
few months.
Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
I'm glad to have you here.
I'm going to start with you, Chairman Jones.
Give us a general picture of the types of innovation
that your committee will look at technology,
this coming session.
Look, Donna, for over a decade,
we've been the number one place to do business.
We're now shifting to becoming the most innovative place
to do business in the entire country.
We're going to take leadership in places like mobility
in terms of air taxis, in terms of autonomous vehicles.
We're going to take those folks that have been,
in a sense, stuck in their home because of disability,
because of old age, and we're going to help them get out,
visa VAV, we're going to bring traffic off into the air, we're going to go ahead and use
a creative manufacturing, a lot of people call that 3D printing, to absolutely expand
everything that we can print or in a sense of manufacturer here in Georgia and for outside
of our state.
In other words, we're going to take literally what AI can do, what human beings can do,
robotics can do, and transform education, healthcare, transportation, just about everything
that a Georgian touches is going to be transformed in the next five to ten years.
and you'll need to put guardrails on that.
We are gonna have to put guardrails on it,
but I'll tell you this, on the innovation side,
we wanna make sure that this is very similar
to the third industrial revolution,
we're in the fifth industrial revolution,
when Carnegie and Rockefeller and Edison,
when they were making those changes
and they were giving those great innovations in steam
and electricity, there wasn't a lot of guardrails
on them on the innovation side.
We wanna do the same thing.
We wanna give our innovators a chance
to innovate and really change the game
economically, healthcare and education.
Now, I know you have done a lot with urban transportation.
We'll get to that in a moment.
Senator Harrell, I want to actually start with you
with the committee we talked about,
and play a clip of a DeCab County mother
who talked at one of the final ones.
She testified before your committee on October 10th.
Her name is Kay Fullerton,
and she described how her fourth grader and his friends
found an AI chat box, but with a Hunger Games theme.
And they started to have a conversation with it because they're kids and curious and that quickly descended into sexualized content on the school network in fourth grade.
And this wasn't blocked because of the nature of the website services like chat GPT have these developer tools that allow developers to access these large language models for fractions of a penny with no oversight on where that content goes after it's produced by the model.
model.
Yeah.
And Senator Harold, one of her concerns is, parents can't preview what these bots are doing.
So there's no way of monitoring any of that.
So talk a little bit about that.
That's right.
This parent came to me during session last year and told me this story.
And I immediately tried to find a bill to amend because it was late in the session so that
we could fix this issue.
Unfortunately, the bill didn't pass.
And so that's when I really pushed to have this study committee.
This issue is personal for me, my kids were like in middle school when everybody started
getting smart phones.
And I could see that these programs on these phones were fundamentally changing my children.
And I tried to sound the alarm and no one would hear me.
And so I've waited eight, ten years to be able to do something about it.
Now we have enough millennials who have had kids who were scared about the phone and what
it can do to their children that we have enough collective voices that we can do something
about it.
I want to clarify something, they watched at school, and there are, there's a way they
block things, but they were able to get through.
Right, because this is new, these AI companion chatbots are new, and so the companies that
help the school's monitor what kids can access, they were on top of it, and so this just
slip through. Now, Ms. Fullerton did say that the school responded really, really well
and took care of the problem. But this technology, it changes so quickly that schools can't keep up,
parents can't keep up. So in the end, we made our committee made several recommendations that we
are turning into legislation now. Okay, we're going to talk about those in a minute. I want to
get back to you. Going back and forth, you certainly agree with all of that. And I've heard that
There are members of your party who certainly agree that there needs to be some kind, something happening
when it comes to these chat box and things like that.
100%.
Look, we're seeing basically data telling us that upwards of 75% of 15 year-olders in our state consider their AI chatbot their best friend.
They're best friend.
We have to find a way to get that socialization to be fundamentally different.
We got to put the guardrails on, but frankly we need to help of 11 million Georgians.
look, legislation can create that guardrail, but we need the parents, we need the grandparents,
the uncles, the aunts, and everyone else to understand this is changing and it's changing
monthly.
It's changing daily, so all of us need to be super diligent in terms of what we're doing
and what we're doing with our children.
And I know that's hard.
I got four children, and I know how hard that is to do, but between the guardrails that
we can put on with my colleague in the Senate and what we can also do to work with 11 million
Georgians, I think we can make a difference.
Talk a little bit about what you're expecting to do
with some legislation.
Right, so what we've realized is that these big tech companies
have discovered through the years that the more engaged
they keep the users, the longer they keep them
on the phone or the iPad, the more money they make,
selling information to advertisers.
So they're making money off of our kids' attention
And they're doing that now by designing the platforms
and the products to be addictive,
designing things in where if you do something,
they give you something back, they give you a reward
that gives a little dose of dopamine
that makes you feel good.
So the first thing we want to do is regulate
the addictive design.
We don't want addictive products designed
for our children.
The second thing we want to do is address the chatbot,
the companion chatbot issue.
This is critical.
This is going to make the situation so much worse.
Children are using these chatbots
and becoming friends with these chatbots.
And the parents, they don't know yet
that their children are interacting with these chatbots.
We had parents who told horrible stories
about the chatbot actually telling the child
to kill himself, to commit suicide.
I listened to that, it was just terrifying.
It's awful.
No parent knows what this chatbot is going to say to their child.
So two, those parents out there, I would tell you,
find out if your children are using companion chatbots,
if they are, please teach them about the dangers.
We want to hold these companies accountable.
If a parent bought a doll and the doll said,
kill yourself, that company would be liable
because they had a product, just like cars.
Cars have to study safety measures
before they bring out a new model.
We want these companies to be responsible for the products
they put out in the harms that they cause
in terms of AI chatbots.
And then finally, we want to give parents more power.
So the parental controls, they're very difficult to use.
And parents are frustrated.
And the kids find their ways around them.
So we're supporting something called the App Store
Accountability Act, which when a parent buys a phone
for a child, the phone is linked to the parent's phone.
If a child tries to download an app,
a notification is sent to the parent,
and the parent can decide whether to approve the app
or not, that's easier than parental controls.
And then the very last thing we're doing,
last year we passed a law banning cell phones
in schools K through eight.
I believe we are gonna come back and add high schools.
And I know that they're talking about that
both in the Senate and certainly in the House.
That's going to happen.
So that's good.
I want to get back to you about something.
While we still have time, I know that when it comes to the
air taxis, something special is going to happen in 2026.
And you've been working on this for a long time.
For a long time, knock wood.
We're going to get special permission to be able to land
an air taxi right in the middle of the Georgia World
Congress Center at the kickoff.
And I don't mean that as a pun at the kickoff of the
World Cup.
And this is literally the world looking at us.
millions of people looking at Atlanta and being able to land an air taxi and simultaneously
bringing up an autonomous vehicle and hopefully having the FIFA head, our governor, our speaker
and our lieutenant governor going into a 3D printed mini house because we want to show that
affordable housing can be done, it can be done in our state and we can do it through a
creative manufacturing.
So we're going to go ahead and put all together basically an entire portfolio of innovation
for the world to see that George is leading the way.
So they're going to start at this, at this bear, bear report, bear, bear up in the North
Bolton, right?
The governor and all of these officials are going to go to the Georgia World Congress
Center and then there's going to be this house there.
That is our hope and we're hoping to get the final approvals on that and any of you
who know anyone at the FAA would like to be able to get that from them.
And for people who don't understand, these, these taxis are going to go along the interstate
and they'll be able to go to Hart's Field
and different things like that.
Yeah, look, imagine an idea
where you're going to be able to go out to your ride share app
and you're going to have a choice of,
do you want to go autonomous, do you want to go driver
or do you want to go in the air?
And you're going to be able to go in the air
and literally go from, say, the northern arc to Fox Theater,
the northern arc into the airport.
You name it, you're going to now have a defined commute time
as opposed to guessing what your commute time
is going to be based on traffic.
And autonomous, let me see if anybody will be.
Yeah, well, okay, so much to talk to you too about.
Thank you so much for coming on.
We'll keep up with these issues.
Thank you so much.
