Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines? All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Doorkeepers, you will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. We will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country today. Special day. And we will begin it with a special chaplain this morning that will be introduced by the gentleman from the 73rd House District Representative Josh Bonner. Representative Bonner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today is a special day. We are honored to present to you one of our military chaplains. The chaplain corps is vital to our military. They provide religious and spiritual support to our soldiers. They advise our commanders, counsel our soldiers and provide religious services. The chaplain corps is kind of near and dear to my heart not only having chaplains in my units over the years, but also given the fact that my oldest son, Bo, is currently in training to become an army chaplain. So it's a great day and an honor to introduce to you chaplain major Paul McCabe was born in Fulton County, grew up in Smirna and graduated from Campbell High School. He began his military career in the Navy, serving on the USS Forstall in the Persian Gulf. Chaplain McCabe went on to attend Georgia State University, earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice, and later went on to work for the Fulton County Police until May of 2004. He was ordained into the presid in the Episcopal Church in 2004 and currently serves as the rector of the Episcopal Church of the Inunciation in Marietta. In 2008, he was federally appointed as a chaplain in the Georgia Army National Guard and was assigned to the 170th Military Police Battalion where he has been activated a number of times in service to our state. Chaplain McCabe currently serves as a 648th maneuver enhancement brigade chaplain and resides in Marietta with his wife Katie and daughter Kindle. So please welcome Chaplain McCabe. Good morning everyone and what an incredible and awesome privilege it is to be in front of every one of you on this morning and offer some words of encouragement and prayer. But as any good chaplain will do, I have to do a shout out very quickly to my Georgia Army National Guard and Georgia Air Guard members who are here today to celebrate the work that we do. So I want to share my role as not only providing religious services but also to boost morale. I love this morning. I was told that I had five minutes to share my message with you like they had to worry about a chaplain speaking more than five minutes. But this morning, I would like to talk to you a word about, give you a word and a testimony about faith. Now before you tune me out, I want to put a little spin on this word faith because the word faith gets a bad rap. It's often automatically assumed that it has to do with religion but it's not just about religion. So I looked up the word faith on the internet because that's what you do these days. And the first thing to appear was from the Oxford dictionary was faith. Complete trust or confidence in someone or something. Now think about that for just a moment. As you're assembled in this chamber under the dome doing what you believe you are called to do or at least feel inspired to do, you all have something to do with faith. Complete trust or confidence in something. I often hear from individuals that they say that they could not do my job and I could say this easily for each and every one of you here, I could not do your job. You not only have to drive a metro Atlantic traffic to get here but you also have to deal with the nasty comments on both side of the aisle and to boot from people you represent. Who signs up for that by the way? If you hear my knees knocking right now and that noise that's okay. Anytime you're in front of people it's a little nervous wracking but I'm sharing God's word. And I would venture to guess like me you have long days also but you get it done. That my brothers and sisters is faith. A complete trust and confidence in something and that is the great people of the state. The people of this great state of Georgia are putting confidence in each and every one of you to do the work you have been elected and call to do. And it may seem like it's a lot of ones play but it's something to reflect on this morning. Everyone in this chamber has a different background. No one is the same. And that's what makes it extremely fascinating that each and every one of you are called to this chamber to do the work of this great state regardless of your differences. Now I'll draw from a source that has the other definition of faith. Come from scripture. He views 111. We are reminded faith is the assurance of things hope for and the conviction of things not seen. There are days that may be harder than others. Not only do you have to balance your personal and family lives but your public service lives. This is important work happening under the capital dome and in this chamber that each and every one of you are doing here. You have to know that it matters. Even when you can't see how it does or disagree how this work makes a difference and even when you do have differences on how it does, you all have one thing in common. Hope. Hope that you can make a difference. Never lose that hope or determination to serve all the people of this great state who have also put their faith in trusting you to do so. Faith is a powerful force. However you look at it. Now if you will with me standing as you are able. Praying in your own words on faith. Let us pray. God the fountain of wisdom whose will is good and gracious whose law is truth. We beseech you so to guide and bless this house of representatives in this great state of Georgia assembled here today. Give them the strength and wisdom to do the work they have been called to do. To never lose faith or hope. To the glory of your name and the welfare of this people through your holy and life giving name, our creator, Redeemer and sustainer we pray. And the Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord left his countenance upon you and give you peace. Thanks be to God and all men. If you will, it's a pleasure to the allegiance to the five of the United States of America and to the Republic of which it stands one nation under God. The individual with liberty and justice for all. Oh, it was a file. Major McCabe, thank you for being with us. Don't leave yet.

Thomas the 21st and Clark, or the 100th, a resolution recognizing February 6, 2025 as National Guard Day at the State Capitol and for other purposes. Representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It is my great honor to recognize and introduce Major General Richard Dwayne Wilson, the 44th Agedent General of the Georgia National Guard. On the special occasion is National Guard Day at the Georgia Capitol. Today we celebrate the dedication and sacrifice of the men and women of the Georgia National Guard and there is no better leader to represent them than General Wilson. His distinguished military career began in 1987 as a combat engineer in the Army Reserve. In 1993, he was commissioned as an aviation reserve officer and since then he has commanded at every level serving in both active duty and reserve components with excellence. His leadership has been instrumental in shaping the Georgia National Guard and his extensive operational experience spans from Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, to Kosovo, and Iraq. As a lifelong learner and accomplished leader, General Wilson holds multiple advanced degrees and has earned numerous prestigious military awards including the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal. As a master, Army Aviator, he exemplifies the highest standard of service and commitment. Beyond his military achievement, he is a devoted husband, father and grandfather, with a proud family legacy of service to our nation. On this National Guard Day, we honor all those who serve and is with deep respect and gratitude that I now invite Major General Wilson to say a few words. Hey, well good morning. Thanks for the introduction, Representative Clark. Mr. Speaker, sir, it's certainly an honor for us to be here and thank you all for allowing me just to have a couple of minutes to highlight the incredible accomplishments of the 15,000 men and women that make up the Georgia Army National Guard, the Georgia Air National Guard, the Georgia State Defense Force, and our federal and state civilian employees. These men and women work selflessly. They serve day in and day out around our state and around our nation and just do a tremendous job both at home and abroad. Just a few months ago, our service members assisted local communities and state partners during both response and recovery efforts after Hurricane Debbie, Helene and Milton. Helene, as you all well know, was one of the largest and most devastating storms that we've ever experienced. Almost 2,000 of your very own soldiers, airmen and volunteers from the Georgia State Defense Force supported our citizens and local communities during the days and weeks that followed the aftermath of the storm. Additionally, your Georgia National Guard continues to be more globally engaged than ever before. Last year alone, we deployed over 2,300 soldiers and airmen across every geographic combatant command. Our service members continue to serve heroically in Europe, South America, the Pacific, Africa, the Middle East, and right here in the United States along our own Southwest border. Some of them are here with us today. So I've got several folks here with me behind me and to my right, but also in the balcony. I'm going to go ahead and ask them to stand please. And then please join me in recognizing these brave men and women from both the Army and the air guard for their service and their sacrifice to our state and our nation. I want you to know that your Georgia National Guard is in great shape. Despite a national recruiting crisis, our forces fully man the Army National Guard finished 2024 with an end strength of 110%. Additionally, the Air National Guard is closing on 100% of their authorized strength while continuing to successfully transition both of the airwinks to brand new missions. We continue to renovate and modernize our armories across the state. Most of these facilities were built in the 1950s and 1960s. This initiative was made possible only by the support of Governor Camp and you all, the General Assembly, allowing us to combine state and federal funding to complete these projects. By the end of this year, we've completed almost 24 or almost half of all of our Army National Guard armories with this initiative. So thank you all very much for your continued support. Finally, the Georgia National Guard was recently selected by both the Army and the Air to receive brand new force structure adding brand new capabilities to our state and to the nation. This new capability will include the M10 Booker Combat System for the Army National Guard as well as remotely pilot a aircraft integration mission and the new C-130J for our two airwinks. These new units will keep the Georgia National Guard at the forefront of readiness modernization and lethality for our state and for our nation for decades. But we're only able to do this. We're only able to do to be successful because of you all and because your support. So thank you all for what you have done, for what you're continuing to do for our soldiers, airmen, families, the civilians that work with us as well as all of the employers who provide career opportunities for our service members. As we begin in 2025, Rest assured that we're well equipped to successfully navigate the challenges that lie ahead, Georgians should continue to take great pride in knowing that their National Guard is always ready and always there. So thank you very much for allowing us to be here. Thank you members. Thank you General Wilson. Thank you Representative Clark. I had the great honor to visit our Southwestern border with Governor Kim and some members Chairman Bonner, some members of the Senate. I can tell you they made me proud to see those young men and women who are there representing our state to make sure we're protected. An active aggressive training program doing times when you're just training them and certainly you're ready to go and ready to deploy. I want to say this many of our neighbors where there were clothes all weak and then put the uniform on the weekend to make sure they're ready when they're needed. General Wilson, we appreciate you and your team for which I'll do to keep us ready. Thank you for that and I know you'll always have the support of the Georgia House of Representatives and your mission to keep America strong. Thank you very much for here with us today. Members of General Wilson's support staff are out in the south any room. If you'd like to speak to them and have a photo now would be the time. Well maybe not, not quite yet. We have another important invite resolution we want to honor some folks with Chairman Parrish if you'll join me. Form a dean of this house. You kind of know your way around here. Don't you, Representative Smirie. Representative Smirie, I told him we could just bring your portrait in here and you would have to travel all the way to Atlanta and we could stand out front. I thought that would have been appropriate as well. We were glad to be a part of that day honoring you and your portrait out front. Mr. Clerk, you ready? Would you read a invite resolution, please, sir? House resolution 154 by Representative Parrish, the 158th Burns, the 159th, you believe the 141st, Parker the 177th, Jones the 47th, and others, a resolution commending more house school of medicine upon its 50th anniversary. The Representative Chairman's Butch Parrish, you've had a little contact with these folks over the years haven't you? You're doing a good job too and so are they. Chairman Parrish. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, we're honored to have some special guests with us here today and as we recognize more house school of medicine on their 50th anniversary, I'd like to introduce a few folks to you that are with us today who are special people associated with more house. Just raise your hand when I call you name if you will. Arthur Collins, he's chairman of the more house school of medicine and Board of Trustees, Susan Grant, vice chair of more house school of medicine, Board of Trustees, Dr. Adrian Tendell, Dean of the more house school of medicine, and Keana Murray is a fourth year medical student and president of the Student Government Association. And there's one person who many of us know and would speak or mention a few minutes ago, he really needs no introduction. He's been here so long, but former Dean of this house, Calvin Smiley, who's a member former member of the more house school of medicine Board of Trustees and a long time supporter of that school. In addition to those, we also have the president and the CEO of the more house school of medicine, Dr. Valerian Montgomery Rice. She's an native of Macon, Georgia. She graduated from Georgia Tech, Harvard Medical School, and in her residency at Emory here in Atlanta. She's a sixth president and first woman to head this institution, and she's served there for the past 11 years. More house school of medicine has drastically expanded its physical footprint, its academic program, its research initiative, and physician class size. It has been a great public private partnership that you all have played a part in for many years, and it's my pleasure to introduce to you now for a few words Dr. Valerian Montgomery Rice. Good morning. Thank you Chairman Parrish and Speaker Burns and the entire Georgia House of Representatives. On behalf of more house school of medicine students, faculty, staff, alumni, and Board of Trustees, it is an absolute honor for institution to be here with you today. I know we have students, faculty, staff, and the galleries that you please arise and be recognized. The state of Georgia played a pivotal role in the founding and continued success of more house school of medicine. In 1975, the state supported the establishment of more house school of medicine.

as a two-year program to improve access to health care and underserved communities by addressing the shortage or minority physicians in the state of Georgia. And in 1977, the members of this legislative body made a decision to invest $1 million in this two-year medical education program that began in a trail over on the Morehouse College campus. A few years later, Morehouse School of Medicine was officially established as an independent four-year medical school program. I am honored to come before you a half-century later to thank you for your financial commitment and to thank you for establishing one of the most successful public-private partnerships to address access to care for the state of Georgia. This body believed in Morehouse School of Medicine, a private school with a public mission. And I am proud to say we have provided you and the state of Georgia with an incredible return on your investment. Graduating more than 3,200 health care professionals include in nearly 1900 physicians with greater than 60% of IMD graduates remain in Georgia to practice in our great state. Over the years, the state of Georgia has provided critical funding, resources, and policies to support that has allowed Morehouse School of Medicine to grow. Not only do we have a success for MD program, but with your support, we established one of the oldest masters in public health programs that is celebrating its 30-year anniversary this year. A fully accredited PA program would greater than 80% of those graduates remaining in Georgia to practice 14 other master's programs, MD PhD programs and PhD programs. As well, in partnership with Greater Hospital, the VA Hospital, Children's Hospital, Atlanta, and many others, we have over 200 residents and fellows trained in an our GME program. Equally exciting. We have hired our founding dean for our nursing program, which will enroll students in our Doctorate of Nursing at Riffory in the fall of 2026. And our first students in the BSMS program in the fall of 2027. Our decision to start a doctorate degree in nursing at Riffory was intentional to focus on the severe maternal mortality issues that women of Georgia face doing pregnancy. The key to the success of these programs, though, has been the recruitment of Georgia high school graduates to Morehouse School of Medicine through our pipeline initiatives that expose them early on to health care opportunities. We are excited to know that we now touch 94% of the 159 counties in the state of Georgia, with students applying to one of our 16 degree branding programs. The most important, though, we now have MSM, Morehouse School of Medicine alumni practicing in 57 of the 159 counties in Georgia, and 89% of those counties are underserved. And in order for this success to continue, we have established a regional medical campus in Columbus, and we have recently signed an agreement with the largest, most comprehensive system in Southwest Georgia, Phoebe Patney Health System, and all been to establish our second regional campus in the state of Georgia. These partnerships ensure that Morehouse School of Medicine is not limiting its impact to the greater Atlanta area. We are recruiting, retaining, and developing health care professionals from the state's most challenging areas, our rural areas, our underserved counties, and providing them a pathway to return and practice in those communities. So as you can see, we've been a little bit busy over the past five decades, and I promise you that although we may be 50, we are just getting started. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please say, Chief. Thank you. Thank you. Folks, I don't know of any leader in Georgia on the public side, or the private side. It's more passionate and impactful. Just the ROI done. When it comes to our investment in the quality of health, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for partnering with Morehouse and always being an ear that Dr. Rice can go to and make sure that we understand the needs that they have to be impactful for our people and our health care. You and your team do a marvelous job. We're glad to have all of the Morehouse family here with us today. Thank you for being here. Thank you for what you've done over the last 50 years. And we're looking forward to the next 50 years. So keep doing what you're doing. Thank you all for being here. Thank you. Been a great morning to be in the Georgia house. A lot of good folks here with us. A lot of great opportunities to serve. And they're taking advantage of them from our guards to Morehouse and doing great work for our people in Georgia. All members of field, please come to the floor. We'll take up an important piece of business here in just a second. House Bill 67 will give just a moment for our friends to exit the chamber. And if you would like to have a photo with Dr. Montgomery Rice and her team, this is your opportunity out in the south any room. All members come to the floor. We'll move on to our rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 67? House Bill 67 by Representative Burns in the 159th. Jones in the 47th, the Association of the 104th and Hatcher to the 155th, Vita Lennack to Amanda Nack, making providing appropriations for state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2025, known as the General Appropriations Act. This bill I'm referred to the Committee on Appropriations. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute. We certainly have to keep our priorities in order. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a Committee of the Whole House for the purpose of considering the House Bill 67, the Sub-Mental Appropriations Bill. The chair appoints a gentleman of the 104th, the majority lead of this House, lead the chair illustration as chairman to preside over the Committee of the Whole House. Mr. Majority Leader. All right, the chair recognizes the gentleman from the 155th District Chairman Hatchett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Leader. How's everybody today? You all ready to get down to business? All right. So today I present House Bill 67, the amended fiscal year 2025 budget. It is set by revenue estimate of $40.5 billion in state funds. In addition to the traditional revenue growth that we recognize in the mid-year, the governor has recognized $2.7 billion in surplus funds to make strategic investments across multiple policy areas and fund the state's response to Hurricane Helene. I'ma come back to Hurricane Helene, but know that funding recovery efforts and providing aid to communities across this state that are still reeling from the storm is a top priority of mine. Speaker Burns and so many of you in this chamber and our budget reflects that. But first, I'd like to start off with some of the strategic investments being made in this budget. There are some big ticket items scattered throughout this document and they will have both an immediate and a long-term impact on our state. For the second year in a row, the governor has used the amended budget to infuse GIFA with additional funding to make more resources available to our communities. These funds provide local governments with access to low interest loans for water and wastewater infrastructure. I know the needs of aging infrastructures are there as I have seen the many requests from you come across my desk. This budget includes $250 million in knee funds for your communities. When combined with the funding appropriated last year, GIFA has been infused with $500 million additional dollars. This budget also includes $500 million to support the development and construction of additional surface water resources for Georgia's coastal region to meet growth and demand. This support comes in both the wrecked investment and loans and supports the region by increasing available surface water by 2030. For the second year in a row, the budget includes more than $500 million in knee funds for the Department of Transportation for infrastructure projects along interstate corridors, to support freight and logistics efficiency and safety. This house version of the budget adds $37.5 million to the Georgia Transportation Infrastructure Bank to assist local communities with strategic road projects. 7.5 million of that in airport aid and 5 million in rail. Lastly, HP 67 includes an infusion of $250 million in the local road administration program for local transportation projects. These funds will be especially welcome in your communities because they do not require a local match. $500 million is included in the budget to improve the funded ratio and the long-term availability of the employee's retirement system. Last year, we made this same investment, bringing the total infusion to the system to $1 billion over a two-year period. These funds boost the long-term stability of the retirement plan, improve the funded ratio, and eventually will support healthier colas for our state's retirees, which has long been a priority of this chamber. $225 million is provided to the Department of Administrative Services to address current liability and property claims, including damage to state buildings from Hurricane Helene. While not glamorous at all, this funding helps address outstanding liabilities, manage claims more efficiently, and avoids increasing our agency's premiums. Nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of the children entrusted to our care. Whether it be children during the school day or children who have been placed in foster care, that's why I'm proud the house is providing the following additions in the budget. The Governor provided in the House supports additional school security grants of $50 million. When combined with the $109 million in the base, systems will receive $68,759 per school in fiscal year 25. In addition, the Speaker has announced a new school threat assessment system and this budget includes $3 million in startup funds for this initiative. Within the Department of Human Services, the House budget recognizes a need for our foster youth and added $22 million for growth and utilization acknowledging the increased cost of care. This General Assembly has made a concerted effort to end the practice of hoteling for youth who are difficult to house because of behavioral issues. Providing this level of care for these youth requires additional resources and the House budget moves that needle towards meeting this need. In addition, our budget is providing a new initiative of $1.7 million for a special victims unit in the Department charged with supporting the rescue of exploited foster children. The safety of the public, the inmates in our custody and the correctional officers charged with keeping inmates secure have been at the forefront of all of our minds and the health care staff. The housing is also a centerpiece of this budget. The House, the Senate and Governor's Office have all been working to identify solutions to the issues that are playing our prison system. I'd like to thank the Governor for hiring a consultant to help us evaluate and map out solutions and for bringing forward the money to make significant and meaningful investments in our aging facilities and our people. I know this is still just the beginning of a costly but crucial endeavor. I also want to address the staff of the Department of Corrections from the correctional officers on the front line to the commissioner and all those in between. While it may feel like we only seem to acknowledge you when there's an incident that's picked up in the news. We also need to acknowledge all the times that things go right and don't make a headline. I want you to know that this General Assembly knows that you get up every day with the safety of the inmates and the public on your mind. And it is our responsibility as appropriators to make sure that you are properly trained and equipped and that our facilities are well maintained and functional so that you feel safe coming to work every day. And that is what the House is trying to accomplish in this budget. The budget includes an infusion of $333 million in new funds to the Department slightly less than the Governor's proposal. We support many of the Governor's recommendations for increased education and health care funding as well as major repairs or innovations, facility hardening and lock replacement. We do have a few differences. We identified savings from implementation dates and reduced the purchase of secure modular units from 4 to 2 and redirected funding into the following areas. An increase in staff positions per year from 330 in the Governor's recommendation to more than 400 in the House's version. Increases in salary have been working and the Department has been able to fill and maintain positions at a higher rate. An increase in body cameras and tasers. The House includes 740 additional body cameras and 500 additional tasers above the Governor's recommendation to increase correctional officer safety. $7 million for the creation of an overwatch and logistics unit for better real-time monitoring of facilities for the protection of both staff and inmates. Additional funding for advanced intelligence and forensic tools and analysis to continue to combat the entry of contraband into facilities. Funding to address salary compression of senior officers with additional officer salary increases contemplated for next year. And $2.6 million for the cost of living adjustments for private prison employees to provide parity with adjustments made previously for our state employees. These employees are part of the correctional network and maintaining proper staffing is just as important in private prison as it is in a state facility. And finally, Hurricane Helene. The House budget includes an additional $197 million in Hurricane Helene relief and recovery efforts above the Governor's recommendation for a total package of $811 million. The House supports the Governor's recommendation to provide $145 million to the emergency fund to pay for initial cleanup and relief efforts. $5 million is also added to initiate next generation 9-1-1 an initiative that is important to all our communities. $298 million is provided to the Department of Transportation to backfill the motor fuel tax holiday and to pay for infrastructure rehab, sign replacement, and debris cleanup. The Governor had initially included $100 million to provide disaster relief and assistance to farmers and timber producers. This hurricane had a $5.5 billion impact on agriculture and timber, not including future losses. This storm had a much larger impact than anything any of us have ever seen. And it forever changed lives and the landscape of our state. Because of this, the House felt compelled to make additional resources available and the House version includes an additional $150 million for this cause. This means a total of $250 million for farmer and producer purposes. $150 million for the Georgia Development Authority. Both programs have received more application requests than funding is currently available and this funding addresses that need. Our local hospitals are a lifeline in our communities and this proved no different. I know many of you saw firsthand how hospitals aided in relief efforts in ways many of us had not anticipated, including providing food, water, shelter, and care to those who had lost everything. It's no secret that many of these same hospitals often struggle to maintain financial viability and this budget includes an infusion of $35 million and one-time funds to assist in their financial stabilization. The path to recovery across many communities is still being charted and needs still persist. For that reason the house is included $10 million in the one Georgia authority to have a source of funding available for continued relief efforts. Finally, finally the house budget includes $1.4 million for a $3,000 salary adjustment for benefit eligibility workers in the Department of Human Services beginning April 1st. Last year we gave this adjustment to child support, elder, and child welfare case workers, but did not include the eligibility workers. It was all my mind long before the storm that we should have included them. These workers are often the lifeline for our constituents who need assistance the most. Following the storm they were on the front lines processing disaster snap benefits for those impacted in a quick, efficient, and effective manner. I personally witnessed their caring work and am proud to recognize their hard work during that difficult time. Mr. Speaker and Mr. Leader, the pastor of the day spoke to us on faith. This year it's our faith and devotion that you have in your appropriations team and this budget a team and that does not go unrecognized. In closing I'd like to thank the appropriations subcommittee chairs and these house budget analysts for all their diligence and quick turnaround of this amended document. In case you don't remember we had a little interruption with a little South Georgia blizzard. You've risen to the challenge of finding a time to meet and give the governor's recommendations a thorough vetting. It was important to me into our speaker that we stick to the timeline of a quick turnaround because this budget contains very important additions primarily as it relates to hurricane relief, hurricane, and the safety and security of our prisons. It's for that reason that this house has acted with haste to do our part to send this bill back to the governor so the funds can be spent and put to work. We look forward to our counterparts in the Senate acting with the same expediency and urgency to turn this budget around quickly. Thank you and I ask for your favorable consideration of HB 67. And Mr. Leader I will attempt to answer any questions. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the house leader Hugley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, do you yield? Yes. Let me first say how important it is that we do the hurricane relief and we're pleased to see that in the budget. But I've got to ask you about these modular corrections facilities. If you speak to that for us. These are very secure units that a company, whether several companies that produce them, the one that the corrections department is looking at. I believe they're produced out in Houston, Texas. But they are very sturdy. They put them, I like to say they put them together like a reactor sets for the basement. I know y'all, but they come together, they weld them together, but the concrete, the reinforcement, the installation of doors and locks that they will use the same ones that we, or the ones that we expect, which are the ones that we use. So they will be very sturdy buildings. They're time, the lifetime of them is anywhere for 20 to 30 years. You yield for further questions? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Steven Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does my chairman yield for a certain of the questions? Mr. Chairman, is it not true that the agriculture industry in our state, the largest agriculture, their largest industry in our state is resilient in that we can withstand tropical storms, we can withstand hurricanes and low prices that we just can't do it all in one year? I believe that gentleman knows that of which he states. Does the gentleman for the yield? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, is it not true that once again that

The 100 million privacy moved around by the governor to provide relief for forestry owners and our farmers. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, is it not further true that this provides an additional 75 million in assistance to Georgia farmers and additional 75 million to forestry landowners to help them to recover from the worst hurricane that our area of the state has ever seen? Yes, and I think that this is still probably just the initial needs of many of those in that industry. And I'm sure that we will have additional legislation that may address the losses that our timber growers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And one final comment. Thank you to your great leadership, the leadership of Speaker Burns in the governor and helping the largest industry in our state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You yield for further questions. Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Bruce Williamson. Thank you, Chair. Mr. Jim Loneal. Yes, sir. Thank you, Chairman, and I have to say for the wonderful work you've done on being physically responsible and balancing all these needs and interests across all the citizens of the state of Georgia. And is it not true that according to the recently published data of the George State University press that we are in fact the 7th least taxed, you know, 7th least taxed state per capita in the nation, according to state revenues? I believe your information is correct. And so you've done an amazing job with that. Is it not further true that this budget contains over $560 million over half billion dollars in new spending that were paying cash for this much needed capital projects on across the state of Georgia without having to incur any additional debt? Is that not true? That is 100% correct. And while we're speaking about debt, is it not further true that we have the 5th lowest burden of debt of all the 50 states. So we have, it is not true that we have approximately $1300 per capita debt. And that is the 5th lowest in the state. Is that not true? I would not disagree. Thank you. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you. I would like one more Mr. Leader if there is one. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Gentlemen, you. Yes, sir. Is the gentleman from Long County? No, sir. Oh, no. I'm sorry. Thank you, sir. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to do the liberty county. I had the ill making the sorry. Don't hold that against me. I will. What time? Is it not true that I have a member of the Prophecy and Suffolk Committee on Public Safety? Yes, sir. Is it not further true that several of us have made the request to go out to Houston and take a look at these module buildings. Not that we doubted. We were the first time looking because we realized that even though I take a great picture, I look much better in person. I agree with you. You're a good man, too. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I don't know that I can have a plane that would take you, but I can drive you, maybe. Mr. Leader and those in this house would ask for your favourable consideration of HB67. Mr. Chairman, while you're headed back to your seat, I just want to express my appreciation for your hard work, the hard work of the Appropriations Subcommittees, and give my thanks to Director Christine Murdoch and the entire House Budget and Research Office for their tireless efforts prior to today. Thank you all. This time, the Chair recognizes Chairman Hatchet for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move that House Bill 67 do pass by committee substitute. Chair now recognizes Chairman Bill Hitchens. I'd like to second the do pass motion for House Bill 67. It's a favourable consideration for the fiscal year 25 amended budget. Chairman Hitchens has seconded the motion. If this time, we'll call the question as to House Bill 67. All those in favour shall now say aye. All those opposed shall say no. The ayes have it and House Bill 67 is passed by committee substitute. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 155th District, Chairman Hatchet. Mr. Chair, as chairman of the Committee of the whole House, you're instructed to report the action of the Committee of the whole House to the House. Thank you. I now recognize the majority leader of this House, leader estrachian. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 67 and has instructed me as its chairman to report the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 67 do pass by committee substitute. The report of the chairman of the Committee of the whole House has received. The Committee of the whole House has had under consideration House Bill 67 and has reported the same back to the House with the recommendation that House Bill 67 do pass by committee substitute. The Committee of the whole House is hereby dissolved. The Committee of the whole House has been dissolved. The Committee of the whole House has been dissolved. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee of the whole House to the Committee of the whole House to adopt it? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? For what purpose is represented for Maul and Roz? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that this amended budget and our budget for next year are based on state, federal, and other revenue resources? Some of the largest parts particularly in health and education rely on federal grants. So does this amended budget take into account current and potential future disruptions to those federal grants and that we should figure out those estimates? I think as the lady knows, we have a constitutional requirement that we pass a balanced budget. Our state has a robust economy. I think the governor has said a reasonable and impactful estimate of our revenue. And I know that the great work of this House and the chairman takes that conservative fiscal approach and everything we've done as this body has done over the years as we lead the way and have we appropriate monies that take care of the needs of the citizens of this state. Thank you for your question. For what purpose is represented? Canon, Roz? Parliamentary inquiry. Excuse me, Mr. President. Mr. Park, canon. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Thank you. Is it not true that there is $1.5 million in this budget increasing the funds for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association? And there are many members who have concerns about the efficacy of that funding going to that entity? Your concerns are noted. For what purpose is represented? Mr. Reese, Roz. Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this morning we had an amazing presentation from the president of Morehouse School of Medicine and with you in which you and other members of this body applauded them for the work that they're doing? And is it not further true that this budget allocates an additional $25 million for Morehouse and Mercer demonstrating our commitment to a strong health care and a diverse health care here in the state of Georgia? I know the gentleman to be a member of this caller and a gentleman. He's obviously read the budget. Thank you for that point. A great point was made this morning and certainly that is the case. And we continue to support Morehouse and other great teaching institutions are a state when especially when it comes to health care. For what purpose does chair lady Dipsy rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that in this budget there is a very special measure that helps each and every one of us in our districts. There was federal money that was removed from Georgia's court appointed special advocates, Cassa. Each of you have that in your district that helps children and families navigate our court system. If you vote against this bill, you are voting directly against helping families in your very own district. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? It is very true. It's a very comprehensive budget that takes care, I believe, of our neighbors in so many different ways. Have all members voted, all members voted, it's so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 67. The Yays are 166. The Nays are three. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. For what purpose is Chairman Hetchett rise? Make a motion. I move that House Bill 67 be transmitted to the Senate immediately. We're representative Hetchett moves that House Bill 67 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Here in none, it is awarded. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, I want to let you have a little observation about that budget. About our commitment here in the House to perform our constitutional duty to pass a budget and get it done timely. First, I want to thank the majority leader of this House for accomplishing something very important every member of this House and our families. And that was to secure an adjournment resolution. It takes us through this entire session. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Part of that process and I also want to thank Leader Gooch as he worked with us to accomplish that. Today's vote, I hope you will all understand and recognize on the adjournment resolution that we agreed to, was ahead of schedule. So we're upholding our commitment here in the House. And we certainly hope if we move through this budgetary process that our friends across the hall will also uphold their commitment to get this budget out and get it done timely, which is so, so important and get it on the Governor's desk, so, so important to the people of Georgia. Chairman Hatcher, you can have that conversation in a minute. Chairman Hatcher, that's all right, Representative. And members of the committee and certainly Christine Murdoch, your staff in the House Budget Research Office. I don't think any of us really comprehend the amount of work it's taken to get this job done and get it done on this basis, this timely basis. Certainly with what we face with a little hiccup with a beautiful snowfall in South Georgia that we are very appreciative of. Thank you, Lord. I just want to thank you again for your tireless work and dedication not only to the members of this House, but to the people of this state. Thank you all very much. Let's give them another round of applause. House members, I want to thank you all from both sides of the aisle. Our vote here certainly confirms your dedication to your constituents and to what's good for Georgia. From Hurricane Helene relief, education, school safety, to increased public safety funding and infrastructure. This budget reflects our commitment in the House to keep in our state, our state, the great state of Georgia, Georgia. The best place, live, work, and raise a family for generations to come. Thank you all. Give yourselves a hand. I'm very proud to be a member of this House. Thank you, my colleagues. We have some afternoon orders, but before we proceed there, I'm going to ask the clerk if you're ready, Mr. Clerk, to where we do have some other business. I guess we could do that now. Mr. Clerk, if you'll. We have a couple of motions that we'll take care of right now. For what purpose is represented Taylor Ries? She weighs. That one was easy. Let's see if we can do that same thing on the rest of them. For what purpose is represented Jordan Ridley Ries? To make a motion. Station motion. To move House Bill 75 from Agri Culture and Consumer Affairs to Game Fish and Parks. Both chairs agree. Thank you, sir. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 75 by Representative Ridley, the 22nd and others to be titled an act to amend Article 11 of Title IV of the Efficiency of the Georgia and Ted Erelene, the General Provisions Relent to Animal Protection. On the General's motion, that House Bill 75 be redrawn from the Agri Cultural Committee and Consumer Affairs Committee and recommitted to the Game Fish and Parks Committee, is the objection. Hearing none is so ordered, Mr. Clerk. For what purpose does Chairman Dickie rise? Make a motion, Mr. Speaker. State your motion. I'd like to make a motion. I asked H.B. 249. They moved from natural resources and environment to energy telecommunications and utilities. Okay, Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 249 by Representative Dickie, the 134th and others to be titled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 3, Title 46, the Fish go to Georgia and Ted Erelene relating to the Generation and Distribution of Electricity. On the General's motion, that H.B. 249 be redrawn from the Natural Resources Committee and recommitted to the Energy Utilities and Telecommunications Committee, is their objection. Hearing none is so ordered. For what purpose does Whitbert Chitt rise? To make a motion, state your motion. I move that House Bill 51 be moved from natural resources to rural development, development, both chairs agreed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?

It's time to start on another budget, right? So, thank you all for what you all have done, and we look forward to seeing your work and working with our members on the next budget. Afternoon orders. Let's see, we have a little time. I'm not going to limit you. We have five of five afternoon orders, so we're going to start with Whip Park, and I apologize for my previous recognition. Representative Whip, Sam Park. Representative, give the gentleman in the well your attention please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In honor of Black History Month, I rise today to recognize Biod Rustin, a brilliant strategist in lifelong advocate for civil rights, non-violence and social justice. Because of his activism, he worked closely with Dr. King to help lead voter rights and desegregation efforts in Albany, Georgia. Rustin continued that work as a key organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. His dedication to equality and peace, shaped the civil rights movement, and laid the groundwork for progress that continues today. Rustin's courage extended beyond his work for racial justice. As a gay man living openly during a time of intense discrimination, he stood as a beacon of resilience and integrity. His life reminds us that justice requires courage and that the content of one's character matters more than any immutable characteristic. So today, let us honor his remarkable contributions and be inspired to persevere in the face of hardship and continue the hard work, perfecting our union to ensure freedom, equality, and justice for all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Whip Park. Appreciate that. Afternoon order. Representative Gary Richardson. Representative Williamson. Richardson, not Chief Williamson. Richardson. From down in Columbia and McDuffy counties. Absolutely. Representative William. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I would like to read a resolution honoring a proud Georgian and a good veteran. But first, he couldn't be here. He's had some medical issues. But I'd like to recognize Joe Kout, State Commander of the BFW Department of Georgia. And I'd also like to recommend a Department of BFW Chief of Staff Wayne College for being here. Commending and congratulating retired Master Sergeant Louis Gresiano and for other purposes, whereas retired Master Sergeant Louis C. Gresiano was born in 1923, making him the last surviving World War II veteran to witness Germany surrender. And this year, he is enjoying the rare distinction of celebrating his 102nd birthday. And whereas this distinguished individual landed on Omaha Beach with the third wave on D-Day, courageously driving a tank of truck full of gasoline through the battlefield, while under relentless machine gun fire from German forces positioned on the cliffs above. And whereas after D-Day, he was involved in the Battle of the Bulls, where he almost lost his feet to frostbite. And he took part in the June 6th invasion of Normandy in 1944. And whereas he served as a utility's foreman for the 100th-second Infantry Field Artillery Battalion Special Headquarters Command in Remes, France, where he was responsible for all American occupied buildings in Remes, including the Little Red School. And whereas after witnessing this signing, retired Master Sergeant Gresiano personally escorted the German delegation to another room to meet General Dwight D. Eisenhower. And whereas retired Master Sergeant Gresiano met his future wife, Yulubabi Shainafel, while he was in range, where she served as a Staff Sergeant in Women's Army Corps. And a couple moved back to the United States and raised five children, Louis, Mario, Marsha, David, and Kim. And whereas in recognition of his extraordinary service, he has received numerous medals and accommodations throughout his life, including being knighted by the Council General of the Republic of France in 2021 as a recipient of the French Legion Medal of Honor. And whereas by the example, retired Master Sergeant Gresiano has made of his life, he makes the world a better place in which to live, and it is only fitting and proper that he be appropriately recognized during this very special and memorable time. Now therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives that the members of this body commend retired Master Sergeant Louis C. Gresiano for his unselfish, dedicated, and loving service to the members of his family, state, and nation congratulate him on the remarkable occasion of today his 102nd birthday and extend their most sincere best wishes and continued health and happiness.

Well, let's speak out of yield well, quite a remarkable gentleman and certainly a member of our greatest generation. Happy birthday. 102, awesome. Representative Park Cannon is recognized for an afternoon or give the lady your attention, please. I was hoping you didn't need all that water. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, members, I come to talk to you about a rare pregnancy condition called hyperemesis gravaderum. If you know any constituent who reaches out to you about this issue, I hope that you pay attention and you speak with them and you understand. This is a form of extreme nausea. It allows for extreme weight loss and it's because of extreme dehydration. It actually contributes to a fetal loss rate of 34% in our state and 82.8% of the people with HG talk about the negative psychosocial issues such as job loss and they also talk about their fear of future pregnancies and their depression and anxiety. Personally, I do want to share a story with one of my constituents approval. She is in her third pregnancy. She lost her second baby and found out that she was pregnant recently and she immediately started seeing these symptoms of hyperemesis gravaderum. She started looking for a specialist in the state of Georgia and literally because she is on Medicaid, no one would take her and there were no specialists who could see her. This week, we paid for an Uber from Clayton County to Alabama to the one hyperemesis gravaderum clinic in the southeast. I just hope that we bring awareness to this issue because it impacts the lives of the pregnant person and also the fetus. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for bringing that back to us and thanks for helping this lady get to the clinic. Appreciate that. Representative Barrett and Hagan and others. Let's see. There's one of you. Oh, there he is. Representative Barrett, that's...

and now, Chair Lady, are you coming to Beth Camp? You're welcome to the well. Who's gonna do the talking? Oh, you are. Okay, Representative Hagen. Certainly, you're up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And other friends, hold it just a minute. And Mr. Speaker, if it's okay with you, I'd be happy for anybody to join us. Who has been a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's. Thank you, members. And I apologize for being very emotional, because it's very personal to me. Let it all suspend just for a minute. And then I think you'll be ready, but you have a lot of folks here that care. Thank you. As we do in this chamber. You have a lot of support. You're gonna be fine. Come on down. Okay. We're representing the claim. Come on down up front. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm here to talk specifically about my late father and a lot of James Rodney Hagen known as J. Rod by everybody in Newman loved him. And that was a lot of people. He was a devoted husband, loving father, and doting Papa to his three grandchildren. We like to say in my family that we inherited Papa on June 23rd, 2017 when my mother-in-law, his caregiver died unexpectedly, and he came delivered us at our house. And this is how becoming a caregiver frequently happens. It's unexpected, we're unprepared, and we're overwhelmed, but we do the best that we can. With an estimated 6.9 million Americans suffering, living with Alzheimer's, that means there's at least 6.9 million Americans who are caring for them. And most of them are probably not okay, even though they like to put on a good face. So today, as we have visitors from the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer advocates here at the Capitol, I just want to take a minute to recognize the caregivers and remind you that you need to support them when you can, in any way that you can, and don't wait for them to ask for it, because they don't even know what they need to ask for, a lot of the time. And Mr. Speaker, if I could, I'm going to turn it over to our representative fair. There are just so many people at the Capitol Day, advocating on behalf of Alzheimer's, and I went out to the ropes a few minutes ago, and I was inundated, could you find so home, could you find so-and-so, could you find this person, could you get behind that bill that any of them spend is caring? Or there all over the Capitol, please take some time, go out, see them on the ropes. Let them know how much you appreciate them advocating at our road reclub. Recently, we did a brag about, and in 10 minutes, it was just ricocheting around the room, how many people have been touched by dementia and Alzheimer's, so just show them that you're paying attention to them. And everyone here is invited to stop by the Central Presbyterian today, from 1215-130, they've got a little lunch planned, and Michelle would stop by as well. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, y'all stay put just for a second. So if y'all will join me, all of you will join me, and let's have a moment of silence for those. I don't know about y'all, but many, many families, I know my family has been impacted by dementia, Alzheimer's, so devastating disease on the person suffering from it, and it's representative alluded to on the families as well. But our duty is to take care of them, and we're gonna do that. So let's do just what representative Hagen representative Carter Barrett said. Let's embrace those folks out in the hall, and let's further devote ourselves to doing what science can do to make a difference here.
