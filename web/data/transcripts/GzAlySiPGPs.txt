----------
House will come to order. House will come to order. Mr. Clerk. Will you read a caption to House Bill 370370? House will 370 by represent of gains of the 120th and others to be entitled to an act of encode section 48534. The official go to Georgia and attend a relay and add and alarm property tax bill forms. So it's required the property tax bill for any school district that opts out of the statewide base year. Home state exemption to state the total amount of the school district reserve funds. Dispillem for the committee on ways and means that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Athens represented Houston Gaines is recognized to present House Bill 370. Members will give your attention to the gentleman in the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 370 is a taxpayer transparency piece of legislation. They will ensure if a local government, whether it's municipality, county or school board, voted to opt out of House Bill 581, the constitutional amendment that the voters overwhelmingly approved in November that passed in all 159 counties in this state. And you name them almost unanimously approved by this body and by the Senate. If they opted out of House Bill 581, they would have to put on property owner's tax bill that that local government, specifically the board, the county commission, school board, or otherwise, voted to opt out of home under tax relief, the date of the vote and the phone number, the concerned citizens can call to share feedback on that decision. Additionally, any school system that voted to opt out would have to include how much money they have in cash reserves and how much they have in reserves per student. Many of you may have recently seen that our school systems across the state have $6.5 billion in reserves. And at the same time, many of them are opting out of home under tax relief. And relief that I'll note that it's important to note, I think this is not going to decrease revenues. Instead, it would slow the growth in revenue. And again, it's common sense legislation that will help homeowners across this state so they can know how much limit the increase in their assessed value of their homes. Mr. Speaker, that's what the bill does. Also, I do think it's important to note that any local government that already has a similar homestead exemption or if they have a 100% senior exemption will be exempt from this piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. The gentleman has a question. Then we do have a speaker on the bill, I suppose. To your left, Representative Park, Kenan's recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you? I do. I'm excited about the language related to reserves. Can you speak to that because school systems are supposed to hold a certain amount in an account. And it might be misleading to make them write that amount as if they're just holding and stop piling that. So can you speak to the reserves, please, please? I would be happy to. And I do think we've seen and I actually have the statistics right here for every single county in the state how much money to have in cash reserves. Over the last five years, the amount of reserves has doubled for our school systems combined. And so certainly I agree, I think there's an appropriate amount. But when you see $6.5 billion statewide in reserves, I certainly think that property owners and homeowners would find that to be unacceptable and they're opting out of simple homeowner property tax relief. Do you further yield? Sure. So to just put some data to it, you said you have all the school systems there. Can you speak to Atlanta Public Schools? How will this impact? What amount is an APS going to be told that they have to put on the notices with the understanding that some of that they should have in there? Sorry, I'm scrolling through all of our school systems here real quick. Atlanta Public Schools has 258 million in reserves. Pretty significant number. That's over $5,000 per student. Thank you, Miss Speaker, I'll yield the well. Jim was yielded the well. We have one member signed up to oppose that is supposed to this bill. I'm going to recognize the representative Barry. Can you get to yours in about five minutes? Gentlemen has up to five minutes. Representative Barry is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With all due respect, I rise today in support of local control. That phrase is thrown around often this chamber, yet it is not always a dub too. This two-page bill presents itself as simple and it is a simple bill to bully school districts. A simple bill that ignores the gross underfunding of our schools. A simple bill that ignores the fact that today is the 40th birthday of the QBE formula that isn't working on 2025 standards. This is a simple bill that is not a real solution to support our local districts and is misrepresenting why local districts may opt out of the home's exemption. Our schools are underfunded and the consequences are dire. This is not an abstract issue. It is a reality that affects all our children's education, our community's economic prosperity, and our state's future. The root of this crisis is simple. A lack of sufficient state funding and an outdated funding formula that has failed to keep up with the needs of modern education. Because the state fails to provide adequate funding, local school districts are forced to rely on property taxes to make the difference. This creates a system of inequality where wealthier districts with higher property values can provide more for their students, while poorer districts struggle to keep up. This is not just an education issue. It is an issue of fairness and opportunity, and every child regardless of where they live deserves access to a high quality education. But when districts are left to thin for themselves due to inadequate state support, those in less affluent areas suffer the most. Yet instead of a addressing the root issue, we expect to disshame districts for having a reserve of funds. Funds that by law, they are required to maintain. The bill does not acknowledge that districts hold reserves for a reason. To prepare for emergencies, economic downturns, or unexpected costs. Requiring districts to disclose these reserves on tax bills doesn't just create confusion for tax payers. It opens school districts up to financial scrutiny that can be weaponized against them. It invites bad faith attacks from those who want to claim that schools are hoarding money. When in reality, there is some trying to survive in a system that underfunds them year after year. Furthermore, this bill assumes a one-size-fits-all approach. This is a garden effect that each district has unique financial needs. Some districts may need larger reserves due to volatile local revenue streams, while others may be preparing for future infrastructure projects. Instead of bullying districts for finding ways to keep lights on, I challenge this body to do the right job. The time to act is now. Education funding is not an expense. It is an investment. And investment in our children, our economy, and our future. We must demand that our state provide the funding necessary to give every child the opportunity they deserve. Let's stand together and fight for the future of Georgia schools, so rather than increase the burden on local districts to raise property taxes in the first place. Thank you, and I yield the well. In general, as you do the well, there is no further speakers on House Bill 360. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in none, the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the Committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. To what purpose is representative Wade Ries? Parliamentary inquiry, speaker. Statue inquiry. Is it not true that this body with bipartisan ship has fully funded QBE, and the last several budgets since I have been serving in this body, and that we have increased teacher pay to the highest in the South Eastern United States, and does this also recognize that schools, bulls, and schools are not in the right place? Is there any objection to that? If there is any objection to that? I have all members voted no, and the Committee's substitute has fully funded QBE and the last several budgets since I have been serving in this body, and that we have increased teacher pay to the highest in the South Eastern United States. And does this also recognize that schools, boards, counties, and cities still have the ability to raise their milled rate if their needs exceed that of their assessment growth for their total digest? The gentleman knows what he speaks. He comes from that life of that management before he came here. Have all members now voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 370, the yeas are 96, the nays are 77. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. It is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the House Bill 360, 360? House Bill 360 by frustration of the 104th of being titled to amend Article 2, Chapter 7, and Title 48 of the official quoted Georgia and its head of related income tax, and the compensation rate, and the computation, exemptions, and credits, so as revised a tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic structures. This bill haven't further the committee. I'll raise a means that committee recommends a disbilled dupe pass by committee substitute. The purpose of the best station is to recognize to present the bill, Mr. Leader. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you HB360 designed to jumpstart development in downtown Atlanta in 2025 and 26. Prior to the World Cup beginning in June of next year, many of you are familiar with the Georgia Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which has long supported the revitalization of historic structures by encouraging private investments in historic buildings. This legislation will encourage the development of downtown Atlanta through historic projects from those who are currently in line to receive the historic tax credits over the next few years, if in these developments they're able to obtain a certificate of occupancy. That's complete their projects by 2026. And important to note, this does not increase the cap on the historic tax credits. I'd ask for your favorable consideration and Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. And gentlemen, has there questions to yield the well? Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous questions orders, is there any objection to adopt the committee substitute? Here in the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report, the committee has agreed to shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? No. No. No. All members voted. All members voted this so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 360, 360, the yeas are 168, the nays are three. This bill, haven't received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Is this your first bill? Yeah. Two of our female members tricked me. So I wanted to make sure I thought I would remember your face. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 494 or 494? I'm going to read the caption of House Bill 494 by Representative McClain of the 109th and others to be entitled back to a men part 4 of Article 13 of Chapter 6 and Title 40. The official go to Georgia annotated relating to mopeds. It was required mopeds to be covered by a form of minimum financial responsibility for accident damages. This bill, I remember, the committee on motor vehicles, that committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Representative, this is about mopeds. Do you have a mopeds? I was wondering about that. I'll let you explain. Representative, do you McClain is recognized to present House Bill 494? Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I do have a real simple bill on mopeds. The reason that six years ago I received this from one of my interns, Michael Richards. Michael is probably watching a lot of y'all know Michael. But he was coming to the Capitol and what happened, he was re-ended by a moped. And when he was re-ended, everybody was okay. But that's Michael's car right there. And it was $2,500 worth of damage on that vehicle. And he had a $500 deductible college kid, parents gave him the vehicle. And the reason I said that was because he had to pay all of it. He had to pay the $500 deductible. He had to pay $1,2. He also had to get his car fixed. And then three, I think his insurance rates went up. But it is a real simple bill. It says, no person shall operate a moped upon the highways of this state unless such moped is covered by a formal financial responsibility, which provides further ability to respond and damages for liability on the account of accidents and the amount specified and subparagraph. Of code section 33.7.11. And early today I did put on your desk, there are 25 states right now that do have moped insurance. Of those red states, there was a blue states. You know, Alabama, California, Illinois, Mississippi, Mississippi, Alabama. Did I say that already? I'm sorry, Mr. New York, Burma, Texas, Washington, Alabama, Mississippi. I just want you all to know Oklahoma. Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, how did you know about that? You got it too? All of the rested's could have you come before your family or I was called from Oklahoma where I'm from, it also has it. So all I want you all to know is that this will help there were a lot of citizen's in Georgia, so with that I'll be happily meens Speak, support of this legislation. I know I've had some comments and I want to make sure that I'm here to answer any questions that you all may have, that I can answer. So Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to take any questions. You have a dozen or so. Let's see, have a toast. The Reps. of Rheumann has been angstly mashing her button to the right of the ladies recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is it Demon Neal? Yes I do for my sweet mate. Thank you. So I actually had two questions. The Speaker took my first one. But for our second question we were wondering, can you explain the difference between a moat pad and a motor cycle? Okay a motorcycle is a lot faster than a moat pad. I mean I mean gentlemen knows what he speaks. What can I say? You have another very well-versed member who would like to ask a question. And representing Jason Peridoli to your extreme right over here. Gentlemen's recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen yield. Yes I do for my something. It's funny my wife describes me the same way. Does a moat pad have pedals? A moat pad. Some moat pads have pedals. That's the reason that you have the word moat head because it's like moat pedals but then the scooter. But the scooter part of the moat head is not. It has a flat area. All right well let me just this. So if I'm on a bicycle and I'm making like motor noises is it considered a moat pad then? No that's considered noise on the bicycle. Gentlemen yield for a couple more. This is something I know a lot about so I can stay here all day. Well this gentleman is down on the farm. He makes the way. I don't think he wants to get involved. Let's see. This is a more urban question I think where these things are around. Chairman Martin has recognized for a question. Gentlemen yield for a question. Yes I do. So isn't it true what you represented there to us was you were worried about if something hit the car from behind like that and did some significant damage it needs to be insured. Is that right? Yes I do Mr. Chairman. In fact the problem I think we have a lot of uninsured I guess uninsured motorists hitting and having damages and you becoming liable and you paying. I understand isn't it true that you know I think once upon time you you play a little football here and and linebacker I think. Yes yes. Yes but yes it's a tremendous amount of content I had to have in true and isn't it true that I think if you had a car from behind walking down the road you didn't make significant damage I just wonder if we're going to get you injured. Mr. Chairman that's what I had insurance. Yes I got paid for all my dollars. Yes sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker if there's no other question I do ask for a favorable support for this and I know Mike is watching and he's in Maryland watching so Mike we've taken we've taken Mike's car down but thank you all and Mr. Speaker I do yield a well.

We have our road naming bill that chairman Prince is going to bring to us. He's going to give you some instructions as he presents the bill. Chairman Prince. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As Speaker said, this is our annual road naming bill. We have three there, a memorial, and I ask that you please stand at this moment.

I ask for your favorable consideration of these resolution. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have the other way. Chairman, is he over the well? It's always a special time when members honor an individual by a road naming. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Hearing none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution, will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House resolution? Resolution 7, the yeas, 172, the nays or zero. This resolution haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 638? 638. House Bill 638, by revs and no, still costs the 53rd and others to be entitled. And actual men are to chapter 9 and title 32 of the official code of George Anand's head related to the Metropolitan Land of Rapid Transit Authority. So it's prohibit the stopping or parking of motor vehicle, rather than a transit vehicle, and it does a transit vehicle lane in the city of Atlanta. This bill, I'm in for the committee on transportation. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The committee's representative, Deputy Deborah Silcox, is recognized to present House Bill 638. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I come to you today to present House Bill 638. But before I get into the bill, I do want to sincerely thank the speaker, for her immense help in perfecting this bill, as well as Chairman Jasper's and the Transportation Committee for their input on this bill. House Bill 638 would allow Marta to enforce their BRT lanes. What is BRT? BRT stands for bus rapid transit. And the City of Atlanta and the Atlanta City Council have designated lanes in Atlanta, specifically as transit only lanes, meaning that only buses may ride in these lanes. But in order for people to travel rapidly in these lanes, they cannot be slowed down by other vehicles blocking the lane. House Bill 638 would allow Marta to have cameras on their buses to ticket vehicles that are parking in these lanes. For the first six months of the implementation of this bill, Marta would conduct a public education and awareness campaign, and the cameras would only issue warnings to people who park in these lanes. After six months, the bills of course can be issued a citation. The citations are minimal and match the same fines with the distracted driving bill that we did several years ago. The bill also requires that there be visible signage of the use of cameras in the bus only lane. Violations will not contribute points against a person's motor vehicle record. Furthermore, they will not prohibit anyone from renewing their tag, and will never result in an arrest. The first responders may still access these lanes in congested areas, and the camera vendor will only be paid with grant funding and no administrative fees. The fees may only be used by Marta for public safety initiatives, and finally the bill has a sunset of January 2030. So I would ask for your favorable consideration of House Bill 638. I will be glad to stand for questions. The lady has a couple of questions. Representative Parsons to your left has recognized for a question. Thanks, Speaker. Lady Eel. I was trying to find the bill and I hadn't got enough yet to look at. My question is, where were these cameras being located? I mean, they can't be located on the whole route, can they? No, that's a great question. I appreciate that. They will be located on the buses themselves, on the Marta buses. So the bus would have to pass this car that's parked, isn't that correct? No, they would have them forward in rear-facing, so they could take the tag in front of the, yes. Okay, thank you very much. Great question. Thank you. Any other questions? Yes, ma'am. We have a couple more room things. Grip the jazz-wringed car to your left. Is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman lead a yield? Yes. Thank you so much for this legislation. I do believe it. It's good legislation, but I would like to ask about vehicles that are disabled, not because they just, you know, went to run into the store or something. But what if a person has a flat tire or their car breaks down? Is there any possibility that we can work on the bill to make sure that we're not punishing people who are already kind of in a bad situation? Thank you. So, I think that's a question. These lanes are designated specifically for buses only. And so, there shouldn't be cars in those lanes. Ideally, the cars will not be in those lanes. But right now, it is only, it took only citations for, for park to vehicles. So, I believe as someone could show that the car was disabled in some way. They would not receive a citation for that. Thank you. Thank you. I think the purpose of the press to your left is to recognize for a question. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, does the lady, you? Yes. Thank you. Is it not true that this measure will allow some of us, while we're in the Atlanta area, to drive the bus, that way we can know what time we'll get here in a smart way? That is true. The idea, this is rapid transit. And there are many other cities in the United States that have a bus rapid transit. And it's a very easy and quick way to get around town. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Representative Washburn, to your left, is recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, will the chair let a yield? Thank you. Yes. Is it not true that this legislation and the cameras reference to it have absolutely nothing to do with the schools on cameras which we addressed at length? And past two bills out of the house to deal with, is that not true? Representative Washburn, I thank you very much for making that distinction. Yes, these cameras have nothing to do with the school cameras whatsoever. Will the general lady yield for another question? Yes, sir. Is it not true that this is, in my opinion, very good legislation that will help a great deal with...

that the traffic congestion in the city of Atlanta. The gentleman knows what he speaks. Thank you so much for the question. Lady has no further questions. Oh, you'll do well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies, you're the will. Is there any objection to the previous question to be in order? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report of the committee is agreed to, shall. This bill now passed, all in favor of the passage. The bill will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 638, the yeas are 145, the nays are 22. This bill, however, is either requisite. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you be decaptioned to House Bill 445? House Bill 445, I've represented Martin of the 49th to be entitled to the next two amendments. Chapter 5 of the title, 48, the fish go to Georgia, annotated, relating to adding the alarm taxation to property. So there are vibes and language required to be included in the notices of current assessment. This bill ever further, the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chairman Chutton Martin has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Baker-Layson. Gentlemen, this is a redo of House Bill 36 from last year. We passed it 170 to zero. So if you like confusing assessment notices, an inefficient of bill processes, inefficient of bill processes, you're not going to be for this bill. But if you like the idea of creating a clear assessment notice so our voters will know what's going on. And a better appeal process, so we end clogged the spirit court, you're going to like this bill. House Bill 445 gives property owners with personal property greater than $200,000, the option to appeal directly to a hearing officer where they get a knowledgeable individual to settle the appeal and status of the period court. This is a taxpayer friendly bill. It also gives the counties the ability to procure more hearing officers so on clogged the assessment process. With that, there are no questions. Mr. Baker, I'll yield the well and ask the House again to send this over to the Senate. Gentlemen, you little well. He has no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none report, the committee has agreed to, shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? For what purpose is represented, Donna, who rise? He was. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 445, the A's are 167, the A's are 0. The bill, however, see the requisite constitutional majority is there for the past. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 466? House Bill 466 by Representative Cameron, the first to be entitled, not to amend the Article 3 of Chapter 3, the Title 50. The official go to Georgia and annotated relating now the state's symbol, so as to designate the March tacky horse as the official Georgia heritage horse breed. This bill then referred to the committee on special rules that committee recommends this bill do pass. The gentleman from the very first House District, Representative Cameron, has recognized to present the bill, which is in Mike Cameron. Thank you, Slur, and thank you for your time. Today I bring you HB 466, which designates the March tacky horse as the official Heritage Horse of Georgia. At the beginning, this was brought to me. I didn't think much of it, but the more I got into this bill and looked at this horse, it has a great history in America. It came over with the Spanish about 500 years ago. It was used by Native Americans for many centuries. It was used in the Gula culture in Georgia, South Carolina. It was also used in the Revolutionary Civil Wars, but after the turn of the 20th century New to disease, they started the population started dwindling. By designating this horse as a heritage horse, like it has been in several other states, they are recognizing the importance of this horse, not only in Georgia history, but the horse itself and how we need to preserve the horse. In Georgia, currently, there are only a couple of hundred horses in here. There is some in South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, and a couple other states, South and North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, that's what the bill does, and I'll take any questions. You have a couple of questions. Representative Sains, tell you a lot from down on the coast, has a question. Thank you, does the gentleman yield? Certainly, for my friend from the coast. Isn't not true that though these are important heritage horses, they have no resemblance to the beautiful horses on Cumberland Island, which are actually feral horses since they're let go by the carnigies on the island. That would be true, and I had mistakenly thought they were on your Cumberland Island. These horses are smaller than the average horse. They only go about 14 hands, which is about 54 to 56 inches tall. They're very sturdy horses, and the reason they're called Marsh Tacky Horses is the cows. The word tacky means common horse, but marsh because they have such a large feet, they don't use stuck in mud or in marsh gala. Thank you. Yes, sir. Representative Al Williams has a question of general. Will you represent the Williams's rep? I yield my good friend. Thank you, Speaker. New gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Is it not true that even though they're small, they're very sturdy and sturdy and they're used in the Gologichi culture, was to plow small farm areas and they did a great job because of the size of the hooves and their durability and strength. That is correct. And that's why we need to teach this to our younger people that why these were these horses came from and why and the things that they did in culture and in history. Yes, sir. I yield. And then maybe our urban whip will get an opportunity to plow one of these front-end horse. And I tell someone too, these horses are so small that probably I could get on them without a step ladder. So that helps. You too. It's getting personal now, you know, Mr. Whip. We're if they do the lutes to your right, is recognize for a question. He knows about these horses. Yes, sir. Yeah. Thank you. You named several states that you said have these horses. Do you know how many of those are red states and how many are blue states? I think there are red states. Whether it matter. Great history lessons. But I don't know how they vote. I don't know. It's called to have clay in red states. No. You know my house no further questions. Thank you, Mr. McGraw. You all the well and ask for your favorite consideration. General, as you did the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report, the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 466? The yeas are 168. The nays are one. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 491? 491. House will 491 by Representative Chastain. To the seventh and others to be titled an act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 3 and Article 2 of Chapter 4. The title 27 of the official code of Georgia and its ended relate relating to hunting and non-commercial fishing respectively, so as a move and exception for the use of air guns to hunt wildlife, Ms. Bill M. Ferdinand, the committee on game fishing parks. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Chastain, are you ready to present your first bill? I'm just saying that gentlemen from Blue Ridge is recognized to present House Bill 491 representing Johnny Chastain. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have HB 491 seeding. Really, it hopefully will be a simple bill, but this bill extends the current sunset of July 2025 to July 2030 for the hunting with air guns and air bows. And on the second section, we have two minor changes for fishing with bow and arrow for catfish. And we're changing channel catfish and flathead to any catfish. And we're striking through the Savannah River and changing that to species from the waters of this state. That's really the only changes that we have in this bill. I mean, I can't hardly help. I'm so excited for you to take a couple of questions. I forgot to turn on the microphone. You do have a question from a neighbor. And that's a gentleman from the six, referencing Jason Ridley to your right if you will yield for a question. Yes, sir. This gentleman yields. Yeah, I yield to my neighbor. Good. In section one, line is 12, 315. Could you rate those fours? 12, 315. Yes, sir. For the purposes of this subsection, the term air gun means any pistol, handgun or shoulder held device, such of not less than 0.30 caliber or air bow that propels projectile in the form of a slug shot or arrow equipped with a broadhead utilizing an ignited compressed air or gas. Air guns are legal weapons for hunting big game only during primitive weapon hunts, primitive weapon seasons and firearm seasons. Okay. In this bill about fishing, the second section is about fishing. Okay. So the first thing. So in that first section right there, would what we call up, we're from a potato gun. Is it illegal to use? I don't think a potato gun would be. You sure? Air gun or air bow? Well, it says anything, it projectile that forms a slug. I don't think that would be legal for every one. Gentlemen, has a couple more questions to yield? Yes, sir. I'll yield. For Ripson, Thomas, to your right in the back. Is recognize for a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. My seat made eye were yield. Congratulations on your first bill. I'm curious, do you prefer cat fishing via noodling or are you more of an online cat fisherman? I have heard there is an online cat fishing, but I prefer noodling. Thank you. Congratulations. Which speaker I'll yield the whale? Hey man. That was a pretty good move because you had a lot of questions. You had a whole slew of questions as a matter of fact. The gentleman's yield to the whale is any objection to the previous question being ordered. Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Hearing none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? I'm sure you none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed? Will vote no? And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Part counting rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The stage inquiry. Is it not true that there are members who are concerned that this bill prioritizes special hunting interests over the long term conservation efforts? Of catfish. Yes, sir. I'm sure some people do have that concern, yes, ma'am. For what purpose is represent represent a Montaghan rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Ms. Speaker. The stage inquiry. Give the gentleman your attention. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that I see you about those narrows, but I don't see nothing in this bill about noodling? I think we passed that years ago, representing the covers that in noodling aspect. If all members now voted, all members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 491, the Yees are 171, the days are three. House Bill Henry C. the requisite. The Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 439? House Bill 439 by reps on over the year to 150 second and others to be entitled to amend code section 48850. The official code of Georgia annotated related to compensation of dealers for reporting and paying tax and reimbursement to deductions. So through revised deductions allowed to dealers. This bill I have referred to the committee on banks and banking. That committee recommends a disbilled doo pass by committee substitute. Representative Yurda is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Yurda. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring you House Bill 439. 439 is bill relating to the compensation of dealers or merchants for reporting and paying sales tax and the reimbursement deduction. This means your local restaurant, your local boutique or your hardware store. In 2024 the Georgia House voted to form a study committee on credit card fees, sales tax, ex-size tax and they're impact on Georgia merchants and consumers. The committee looked at the effects of credit card processing fees on merchants and consumers and whether the fees should apply to the state tax portion of transactions. The key recommendation that the study kid committee did come up with was changing the vendor's compensation to support small businesses. Every merchant and Georgia is required to report and collect taxes on sales and remit them to the state. Currently vendors may retain 3% of the first $3,000 and 1.5% exceeding $3,000 of collected tax. This bill proposes to raise this to 3% of the first $10,000 and 1.5% of the collected tax exceeding $10,000. This begins on January 1, 2026. This would help small businesses cover some of the cost associated collecting sales tax. I asked the revenue department when this was last changed and they looked back as far as 2005, 20 years ago and it hadn't been raised since then. With the locals on this bill including ACCG, this bill would add to the bottom line of small businesses that are struggling with the effects of inflation, supply chain issues and finding qualified employees. I certainly also think about the hundreds of businesses that were impacted by Hurricane Helene. Georgia has been voted the best place to do business for the last 11 years. Let's do something to take care of our small businesses in Georgia. I appreciate your favourable consideration. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions for your yield? Yes, sir. Representative Wade to your right in the back. Right has a question. How yield? Well, thank you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Chairman, is it not true that the small businesses that were impacted by Hurricane Helene as they opened their doors? They are expected to continue collecting or remit those sales taxes and this will be just a small token to help them as they build back those businesses out of the recovery for many other things the state has done. The chairman of the study committee knows what he speaks of. Thank you for carrying this bill. Appreciate your efforts and work. Thank you. Representative Roberts to your left. You're welcome. Mr. Speaker, do you yield? Yes, ma'am. I am all for helping small businesses. I was just curious if you know what that financial impact will be, let's say what it would be on last year's revenue from this. I don't have that exact figure, but it was, we actually came up with something that was actually a little bit less than the study committee recommended on the back end with the original study committee recommended going up a half a percent per year. And we did, we'll just take the first year's recommendation. Okay, thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, I yield well. Gentlemen, yield of the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Here in none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Own the passage of House Bill 439, the yeas are 170 and the yeas are 1. This bill here in the seat of requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the House Bill 447? 447. House Bill 447, my reps, and I'm going to the 19th to be entitled to an act of men article 4, Chapter 9 and Title 16, the fiscal to George Anontetti relating to fraud and related offenses. Should also provide for the crime of gift card theft, gift card forgery, and gift card fraud. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary, not several that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. A representative gullet is recognized to present the bill. Jeremy Gullet. Thank you, Speaker. Today I rise to present House Bill 447, a crucial measure to combat the growing epidemic of gift card theft. Sophisticated criminal enterprises are stealing gift cards from stores, recording their information, and waiting for unsuspected customers to activate them, only to drain the funds instantly. This isn't a small time crime. This is organized theft and is costing consumers and businesses nearly a billion dollars last year alone. Because these cards have no value and activated, prosecuting these crimes has been difficult, leaving businesses and law enforcement with limited options. HB447 closes the gap, ensuring these criminals can be properly charged and held accountable. This bill protects George A businesses, safeguards consumers, and strengthens our fight against organized retail thefts. And I urge your support, Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen, I have no questions. Thank you so much. Gentlemen, Jeal to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here in none, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to shall. This bill now passed, all in favor of the passage of the bill. Yes, all those opposed will vote no, Mr. Clerk, where you unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 447, the yeas are 168, the nays are two. This bill, haven't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 331? House Bill 331, by represent of Camp 115th and others to be tunneled. Not to amend Article 111, in Title 4 of the Efficiency of the Georgia Annotated Related to the General Visions regarding animal protection. So it's to prohibit the transfer of certain domestic animals at certain locations. This bill then refer to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Beth Camp has recognized to present the bill, Chair Lady Camp. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 331 is a consumer and animal protection bill. What this bill does, it allows for transfer with consideration of dogs, cats, and rabbits at your home, at your place of business, of veterinarians office, police department or sheriff's office, FFA 4H, AKC events. And any legal location is stipulated in the Georgia Department of Agricultural License regarding animal sales. It prohibits people selling animals roadside, flea markets, and parking lots. The bill protects consumers because it provides more contact with the sellers and information on the animal's origin. In the event there's a health issue or the animal is later to be found to be misrepresented. Further, it should slow down or stop puppy mill type organizations that bring animals from other states in poor health raised in deplorable situations to our state because there are penalties involved. Often animals that are purchased on impulse in parking lots later found to have poor health end up in animal shelters which cost every single one of us tax wise. The Georgia Department of Agriculture and the AKC support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I'm open for any questions. Lady has a question to your left. Representative Moore is recognized for a question. Good evening. Does the General Lady yield? I do. Parliamentary in Korea. I should have said that now now. I know that you say domestic animals but what about these exotic animals? Why didn't you include that in here? Is there something a reason why the exotic animals that are not included in this? Well, I thank you very much, Representative Moore, for that question. The animals that are primarily sold in this manner are dogs, cats, and rabbits. So that's what we're addressing in this particular bill. I'm not objectionable to addressing all animals to be sold in a humane manner. Ms. Lady, for the youth. I do. There are so many people selling snakes and lizards and bunny rabbits. They're not considered domestic the bunny rabbit mate. But that should have been included in this. I'm wondering if there's something else somewhere. Well, we stopped you from putting that in here because that's really important. It does address dog cats and rabbits. So rabbits are included. It does address reptiles. No, it does not. Thank you, though. Lady, you have a couple more questions. I do. Representative Drenner to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General Lady yield? I do for my friend. Thank you very much. Is it not true that my county has been working substantially on this issue? And a couple of weeks ago, I went to Walmart on a Saturday morning and somebody tried to sell me puppies from out of a car. And I just want to say thank you very much for doing this bill. It's good job. Thank you. I appreciate your support. One more question. Representative Gillett, right at the Suner Island, you're right. And it's a recognize for a question. General Lady, you yield? I do. Isn't it true that this is something really important to my county as well? And not only is it addressing, I believe, people getting animals really without being thinking about how much of an animal really costs your life, how much of an animal affects your life, but it also, when animals are not wanted, they overrun our humane societies and their local animal shelters. And this will really help put a stop to that as well. Is that not true? It is true. When I appreciate your comment, I appreciate your work in previous years on the NSW Act.

I know you love animals as much as I do. Lady has done further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield and ask for a favorable consideration on this measure. A lady is yielding the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?

I'd be fiscal to George Annotated relating the other education programs on the Quality Based Education Act. So the authorize, provide that local boards of education, so we authorize to prevent instruction and hunting safety and grades 6 through 12. This bill had referred to the committee on game fishing parks. That committee recommends a dis bill, do pass by committee substitute. We're seeing Chaz, Canaan is recognized for his end the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have House Bill 451. House Bill 451 would authorize local boards of education to provide instruction and hunter safety in grade 6 through 12 by Georgia DNR certified instructors. The course is already being taught in more than 100 schools across the state by over 400 certified instructors. Some of the instructors are from our own DNR law enforcement division, some are volunteers and some are our own local school teachers. The bill requires that any instruction provided must be based on the hunter education safety courses already established by the DNR and it must be taught by a DNR qualified instructor. In crafting the bill, we work very closely with the Department of Education and the DNR to follow what is already being taught in our schools across the state. The lanes we have now just makes it part of the code. I'll stand for any questions and ask for your favorite consideration, Mr. Speaker. Representative McDonald to your right is recognized for a question. Does John Neil? Yes, sir. Does anywhere in this bill is a word, koova, and what koova stands for? I can sure we can add it over to the Senate if we need to. Representative Petrie to your left is recognized for a question. Does Jim and you? I do to the gentleman from the coast. Representative and friend, is it not true that there's not much better we could have young people do in today than being outdoors, whether it's hunting or fishing or whatever else, but is that not true? The gentleman knows of what he speaks. Representative Sanchez to your right. Is recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman you? I yield. Thank you.

What purpose of the review is more? Parliamentary inquiry. The stage inquiry. Is it not true that not everyone wants to see a young man, a young woman between six and twelve, great, running around with the gun outside? Seriously? I'm sure the lady has her opinion. She's welcome to it. What purpose of the review has he got in the rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The stage inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that this bill does not require any local school assistant to adopt this program, but it leaves them the option. If the parents don't want to see their children doing that, they can let their local school board know. I know the lady knows what she speaks for. What purpose is representing Berkshire rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The stage inquiry. Isn't it true that this bill allows for when kids are outside with guns they are trained properly in safety? I'm sure the general knows what he speaks. He has two young boys. Now have all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you log the machine? On the passage of House Bill 451, the age were 159, the age were 16, this bill, haven't received it. The requisite constitutional majority is there for the past. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 593? 593? House was 593 by Representative Green to the 154th to be entitled. I would like to provide for the future elections for the Office of Pro-Bh. Judge Baker County shall be nonpartisan elections. This bill led me further to the Committee on Intergovernmental Coordination. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. The dean of this House, Representative Gerald Green, is recognized to present House Bill 593. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And Mr. Speaker, I can assure you this is not my first bill. Now I want to thank the committees that helped me bring this bill to today's vote. And this is a House Bill 593. And it's to provide the future elections for the Office of Pro-Bh. Judge Baker County shall be nonpartisan. I have letters from the Pro-Bh. Judge, I have the County Commission that has sent, they request that I present this bill to you, my colleagues.

I believe if it's go to George Anitetti relating the rest of the graduating sanctions for vote, for vote. House will wait for probationers violating terms hearing disposition of charge and procedure when probation revoked and counting other than that of conviction. This bill, I have for the committee on judiciary now and civil that committee recommends the dis bill do pass. The grip of the entire upholstice Smith is recognized to present House Bill 535. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of this August body, I bring to you House Bill 535. This is in response to the case decided over across the street and the Kellham case. This bill would fix that and eliminate the confusion and almost all contexts of a person sitting in jail waiting a judication of a case. The Georgia Law dictates that their time sitting in jail counts as time served if their sentence to more jail or prison time. This bill provides a very simple fix. It would count time served for probation revocation cases in the same way as any other case. This how courts count the time served for years before the Court of Appeals decision created the legal fiction that time in jail and only counts as time on probation for purposes of time served calculations. That Mr. Speaker is the bill and I will yield questions. Gentlemen has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well and ask this body's favourable consideration. Gentlemen, yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered.

Will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted if so, I think you have. Looks like it didn't. Wow. On the passage of House Bill 535, the age of 178 and the nays are zero. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 521? House Bill 521, by the way, Mr. Anderson, the 10th and others to be entitled to amend Article 8 of Chapter 36 and Title 36 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tate were relating to municipal DNXation so as to revise procedures related to the DNXation of certain properties. This bill I refer to the Committee on Government Affairs, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by rules committee sub. Chairman Anderson is recognized to present House Bill 521. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, once again, I bring a follow-up bill to some of the actions we've done over the last two years with a little addition here. Section 1 of the House Bill 521 requires that any DNXation, when that occurs, that the appropriate shapefiles be provided to the legislative and congressional reapportionment office. Section 2 of the bill applies only to one particular county and one particular tract of property, which is the 9,000 somebody may have tract of property in Pauline County that is currently owned by, I believe, the City of Atlanta, that they're looking for a buyer for. And all this does is it says that once that occurs, that there is an agreement between the City and the county regarding the future annexation of that property. Section 3 is where this bill started, and that is requiring that when a county wants to DNX county owned properties, only county owned properties, that the municipality must provide a response within 90 days. It's currently in code that the county can request the annexation, but there's no time limit. And this is something that was overlooked when we did the annexation rewrite a couple of years ago. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions. The gentleman has no questions. Thank you. I request your favorable consideration, and I yield the well. Jim, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Here in none, the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the committee is agreed to, shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed, we'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, were you in luck, the machine? I have all members voted for what purpose is represented, Holly Reyes. Parliamentary inquiry. Stategy inquiry, sir. Mr. Speaker, it is natural that this substitute for this bill is actually providing enough transparency for the public and is good not only for the county of the sponsor, but also for those counties that actually find themselves applicable to this measure. I know the gentleman carefully reads legislation, I appreciate his insight. Have all members now voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine? On the passage of the bill, the yeas are 165, the nays are 10. This bill, House Bill 521 has received a requisite constitutional majority and is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption to House Bill 433, 433? House Bill 433, by the way, Senator Ballinger, the 23rd and others to be entitled, an act to amend, act to Chapter 3, title 35 of the official code of Georgia and it's ended relating to Georgia Crime Information Center. So it's a revised Department of Human Services, shall be authorized, access restricted and sealed information that conduct employee oversight in certain circumstances. This bill emphurred the committee and public safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Represented Ballinger is recognized to present the bill. The lady has the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate your attention to this matter. Right now, our Department of Family and Children Services, as well as our Department of Human Resources, cannot access certain GCIC information. According to the NCIC information, this is required of our out-of-state partners that function in the same capacity as our DHR and our division of Family and Children Services, but it's not available to our own in-state Department of Human Resources and Division of Family and Children Services. So this just allows them access to that information, changing the GCIC rules. I'll be happy to stand for any questions. The lady has the questions. Thank you. I appreciate your favorable consideration and I yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to a green to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out this bill now, pass. I'll in favor the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed, we'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? I have all members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? I'll in the passage of House Bill 433, the yeas are 177, the nays are zero. This bill hasn't received the requisite constitutional majority. It's there for a pass. Members, we're moving along now, but I have a request. If you have a space heater, I know it gets a little cool in here sometimes. If you have a space heater, this plug in into chamber now, you need to unplug it for a few minutes. I'm sorry, get up, run around. If you're cold, so you need to unplug them for a few minutes to cause some issues with our circuitry and other parts of the Capitol. The premier of the Senate, they're out of lights over there. Plug them back in. I'm not sure they were doing anything anyway, so what's the big deal? So if you will oblige me with that, and we so we can continue, we won't have to light any candles or anything like that. So if you're in plug them for a few minutes, we'll move on with our day. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 54 or 54? House Bill 54 by Rebson, Clark of the Hundredth, and others to be entitled, and act to amend Title 1631 and 43, the Fish Quoted Georgia annotated relating to crimes and offenses, health, and professions and businesses respectively. So it's authorized, advance, practice, registered nurses, and physician assistance, daughter, home, health care services, to patients of licensed home, health agencies. This bill is referred to the committee on health. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative David Clark is recognized to present the bill or representative Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I bring before you House Bill 54, a bill that allows PAs to order or prescribe home health services. According to the Georgia Department of Human Services, Division of Aging Services, in 2022, 14% of Georgia's population was 65, up from 12.7% in 2019. Georgia's ranked seventh among states attracting older adults. With aging boomer population, the demand for home health care will only continue to rise. According to the World Health Information Hub, home health is vital for those in chronic conditions, disabilities, a short term rehabilitation needs after hospital discharge. Many rural residents depend on home health care to maintain independence and avoid hospitalization or nursing home placement. This care is cost effective, improves recovery and eliminates unnecessary travel, yet rural population still faces barriers to access. Why House Bill 54 matters? In 2020, the Federal Care Act permanently authorized PAs to order home health services if individual states also allow it. Passing House Bill 54 brings Georgia in line with this authorization, improving access to essential care. And also, I know many of you have asked why the APRNs are not included in this bill. There's a committee process that shapes legislation and this remains an ongoing discussion. And I know it's been brought up yesterday in COVID-19, the Governor granted APRN's temporary authority to approve home health services, which significantly sped up patient care. And I recognize the importance of this issue and look forward to working with all of you to always put patients first. I urge all of you to vote and support House 54 and we'd be glad to take any questions. Gentlemen, you are for a question, Mr. Bennett, to your left as recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chair. With the gentleman here, is it not true that by passing this bill, it will allow for continuity of care for a lot of patients that will otherwise have to wait could be weeks and months before they could get that ongoing prescription. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you, great bill. And I'll ask them further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favourable vote of House Bill 54. Thank you. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopt in the committee's substitute? Here in none of the committee's substitutes adopt. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report, the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass on in favour of the passage of the bill? So yes, those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 54 of the Yees are 177, the nasa zero.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 511. This is a piece of model legislation that comes from the National Council of Insurance Legislators. In light of recent devastating storms that have impacted our state, this is a small measure that will help provide an opportunity for our citizens to better prepare to recover from future catastrophic events. I would note that several of our other neighboring states, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina have already passed this legislation and several other states are considering it. This bill provides a way of reducing one's taxable income by way of a catastrophic savings account which can be used when a declared catastrophic event occurs. It works similar to a health savings account. The savings account may be a regular savings account or a money market account, but it must be designated as a catastrophic savings account. One must have the corresponding funds in the amount to receive the reduction and must show money spent or for qualified catastrophic expenses. This only applies to individual taxpayers who own their own home and it must be a residential property that is their primary residence and it only applies to a declared catastrophic event. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill and I would appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, have no questions. Thank you. I yield the way. The gentleman has yielded the way. All is in objection to the previous question being ordered. Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
