TRANSCRIPT
----------
From the Gwynet County area is
Democratic Representative Akbar Ali. His
House committee assignments are creative
arts and entertainment, economic
development and tourism and urban
affairs. And from Canton is
Representative Republican Representative
Bill Finchure. His committees are
Judiciary Juvenile, Judiciary Non-Ivil,
and Transportation. Welcome to lawmakers
to both of you. I'm going to start with
you because you're the youngest member
of the legislature this year at 20 years
21 years old now, but later this week
you will be having a birthday, huh?
>> That is true.
>> Tell us about that. How's it feel to
come in young and and what's that like?
>> Well, firstly, thank you for so much for
having me here. Uh people have been very
warm, very welcoming. Uh I'm very
grateful to have a lot of uh existing
mentors within the legislature that have
uh extended that welcome, provide a lot
of guidance. Uh but as one of the
articles on me said before, uh this
isn't my first rodeo. Uh I used to work
in the Senate once upon a time and um
just done a lot of work within the
community as of late and even
beforehand.
>> You worked in the Senate at doing what?
>> So I worked under now minority whip Kim
Jackson's office. Yeah. Back when she
was state senator. So, it kind of feels
like coming back a little bit
>> almost.
>> Not daunting to you at all, huh?
>> Well, you flatter me. Thank you.
>> I love that. Anything else you want to
tell us about yourself?
>> Well, I I wear many hats. I'm a small
business owner, KSU graduate. Uh, but
first and foremost, I am a brother. I'm
a son, and I'm your neighbor.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> And a graphic designer, too.
>> That's right.
>> I've seen I've seen your websites. Looks
good. Thank you.
>> All right. Representative Finchure,
let's tell tell people a little bit
about you. you've been in law and in law
enforcement, so you've got the legal
background and so tell us a little bit
more about yourself.
>> Well, I started out as a probation
parole officer when I came out of
college at Mercer University and then I
went to law school at night. When I
graduated from law school, I went
directly into the FBI. I was stationed
in Chicago, Illinois. I worked there
until my father passed away and I came
back home and worked as an assistant
district attorney. I started off in
Atlanta with Lewis R. Sllayton and I
worked for Paul Howard if you can
remember those people.
>> Absolutely.
>> And then I moved up to the Appalachian
Circuit and I finished my career there
23 years on top of 10 years and uh then
I retired for a little while and then I
was called back into service and here I
am.
>> That's uh why did you want to come and
why did you want to serve? Well, part of
it is my respect for Mandy Ballinger who
passed away and that's the reason I was
able to fulfill this.
>> And you're in her slot. Yeah,
>> that's correct.
>> Her husband and I talked a little bit
about this and he thought I might be a
good candidate for this. I began to talk
to people in my community and they
agreed. So, here we are.
>> Oh, we're glad you're here. We'll get to
you a little bit more. I want to talk
with you, Representative Ali. one of
your staffers speaks Spanish to help
serve your constituents. I guess that's
a big deal for you. You also want to
increase access to language services for
non-English speech speakers.
>> Talk about that a little bit.
>> Of course. So, it goes back to the first
day of my campaign and even before then
where I visit every single uh minority
owned business and small business within
my district. A lot of them are ethnic. A
lot of them don't speak English as their
first language. And so every time I
visit, which is routinely every month, I
bring with me two translators. Yeah. One
in Spanish and one in Korean uh to go to
every single uh business to both have a
two-way conversation here as to what
services can I provide them and what do
they want in return?
>> Yeah. What else would you like to see
accomplished this during this session?
>> So, a lot of talk about uh public
schools and maintaining the amazing
public schools that we have in Gwynet
County. people move to Gwynette for our
public schools and I want to keep it
that way. I want to keep our gold
standard that we have by updating our
QBE formula, uh, paying teachers what
they're worth, but also having minimum
protected planning time for those
teachers, which will eventually be my
first bill coming up later this week.
>> Ah, can you tell us more about that?
>> Absolutely. So, uh, one of the previous
sessions, uh, planning time for teachers
became a protected measure, meaning that
it can't be turned into a meeting time
by administration or various other
things. However, their lunch periods
aren't protected. Often times, those
lunch periods become a working period, a
working lunch, which I don't think
should be the case when we already have
so much on their plate. And furthermore,
it helps instruction time, especially
with special education teachers.
>> Okay. Well, we'll hear we'll you'll come
back and tell us about that. Take that
one in. Representative Fincher, um
you're also interested in things dealing
with insurance premiums and all all the
different insurance premiums, medical,
car, home. You'd like to see some reform
there. Talk about it.
>> Well, you know, we we passed a tort
reform bill and that is designed to
limit uh the huge
verdicts that you get to these millions
and millions and millions of dollars.
But that should be tied in directly to
insurance rates. If you can limit what's
going to the exposure of the insurance
companies, then the insurance companies
should avoid the citizens with lower
insurance rates.
>> Okay. So, you're going to have something
coming out with that.
>> I think we're going to have uh an entire
package. Um the House of Representatives
tomorrow afternoon
upon adjournment you're going to hear a
uh Speaker John Burns is going to roll
out plans to address property tax burden
faced by Jordans Georgians. We look
forward to I look forward to advocating
for my constituents and all Georgians as
we fight to keep more of their
hard-earned dollars in people's pockets.
>> Okay. So we'll we'll keep up with that
certainly if Speaker Burns is going to
talk about it tomorrow, too. Uh let's
talk uh Representative Ali um about
homeowners associations. I know that's
an area that you care about. First of
all, why the interest and what do you
hope to accomplish there?
>> So, we've seen many instances, not just
in Georgia, but also just throughout
this nation of overreach by homeowners
associations. However, one instance that
I would like to highlight is last year
um a former representative covered this
where uh a a constituent of his nearly
took her own life because the amount of
debt that she incurred due to HOA fines.
I think that that is one extreme case.
but going door todo in my district,
going door to door in other people's
areas as well. It's a repeated need that
we hear that overreach is rampant, that
there's not enough guard rails here.
That's why uh I'm working with several
of my colleagues who've been fighting
this fight for a while now um on the
Senate and the House side to put in some
limited some uh guardrails here to put
in some uh common sense regulations here
such as getting them to register with
the Secretary of State's office just as
a business would or having an
independent oversight committee. Uh
that's a bipartisan bill in the Senate
right now.
>> Yeah. So there this has been talk for a
while. Absolutely. You feel pretty
confident that now that you're here,
we'll get some of that accomplished.
>> Well, you flatter me with that, but a
lot of the credit goes to uh the giants
that I stand on the shoulders of.
>> Yeah, that means a lot to you. Talk
about that. Your the the people who kind
of help prepare you to get come to this
to feel confident at 21 years old to
come into the Georgia legislature.
>> Oh, sure. Um, it is widely known that uh
my predecessor, Representative Shelley
Hutchinson, chose to endorse me in this
race and I have worked with her for a a
wide amount of time, but even before
this, a lot of the connections that I
made was by serving as uh my local party
vice chair and even before that within
the Young Dems. uh a lot of this it's
all relationship building and we need uh
I I see a lot of intergenerational
conflict going on right now but I think
we need to remember that you need to
build up the younger generation with the
wisdom of the older one it's a symbiotic
relationship that's what I try and
embody here
>> yeah I think you'll do very well here
>> oh thank you so much
>> with that kind of an attitude about it
you mentioned property you we talked
about property taxes a little bit
anything more you want to add with that
or anything else you'd like to get into
this session.
>> It's just what what has been happening
with property and it's something the
senator said before. Uh when you buy
property at $250 or $275,000 and then it
turns around and it's an appraised now
for 600,000, you're basically having to
pay or rent your house from the from
your county by paying taxes. And our
goal is to either put a cap or
completely eliminate home homestead
taxes on homestead on the personal
homestead. We want the you'll hear from
Speaker Burns tomorrow how he intends to
do that.
>> Okay. How's it been going so far for
you?
>> And you know in terms of learning
everything, keeping up with things. One
of the lawmakers earlier said 19 hours a
day. Is it does it feel like a lot?
Well, I I choose to come in at 6:30 in
the morning and I choose to leave at
6:30 p.m. Okay.
>> Um and so it is completely because um
I'm here to work for the people that
chose for me to be here on their behalf.
>> And furthermore, I mean, we hit the
ground running. We are already have uh
three resolutions that we're working on.
We already have three bills that are
being drafted. One of which we're
actively working on as I mentioned with
the protected planning time.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. And so
>> we'll keep up with that. You feel the
same way. You feel like you've been
you're getting used to everything. Yeah.
>> Enjoying it, but it's a lot to take it
up at one time. You have a lot to lot to
learn.
>> Yeah. Are you putting in the long days,
that kind of thing?
>> We we we're there. We leave are there at
7 in the morning and we try to stay as
late as we can.
>> I think people don't realize how much
you guys have to work during the
session. What What is the most difficult
part for you? The most difficult part
challenging
>> most challenging thing for me is is to
learn all the names of all those people
in our in the House of Representatives.
We've got a crowd of folk there.
>> Yeah. Yeah. What about you?
>> Challenge.
>> It would be it would just be uh for more
of the same.
>> Again, with the Senate, maybe it's a
little bit easier because there's 56.
With us, it's a whole three classrooms
worth of 180 people.
>> You didn't have a class at KSU quite
that big, did you?
>> I don't believe so. No. So, it there's a
lot to it. So, but you're you seem to
both be enjoying it and uh we're happy
you're here. Anything else you want to
add?
>> Uh just that another thing that's on our
plate is going to is literacy.
>> Yeah.
>> Um we're going to be one in three
children in Georgia do not have
proficiency by the third grade.
And we're going to put a literacy coach
in every single elementary school in
Georgia.
>> Okay.
>> Well, we're going to talk about that.
But I know that's something the speaker
wants to do.
