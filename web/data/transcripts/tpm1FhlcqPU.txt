Good morning everybody. Good morning. You're returning house members. Welcome back to you new members. Congratulations and welcome. I want to take a few minutes to share with you some things about the person that nominated for speaker of the house. You're returning members to know speaker John Burns and have had the opportunity to work with him. To the new members let me share just a few things with you about him that you may not know. He's a successful businessman. He's active in his church and his community. Speaker Burns started his political career at Georgia Southern where he received his bachelor's degree in political science and met Dale who became his wife. He later went on to obtain his juris doctor degree from John Marshall Law School. He was first elected to the house in 2004 and began his service in 2005, 20 years ago. And prior before being elected to the house he served as a member of the State Board of Transportation. In 2015 he was elected majority leader. In 2023 he was elected the 75th speaker of this house. He's been married today for 48 years and is a devoted family man. They live on their farm that has been in their family for over 100 years. They have two sons and five grandchildren. He works long hours every day for all Georgians, regardless of your zip code. He works to make Georgia a better place to live, to work, to raise the family and as he likes to say have a little fun along the way. Education and literacy, health care, public safety and job creation are just a few of his priorities. He's more interested in getting the job done than who gets the credit. He's a good listener and always has time to listen to house members. He's respectful and has a sense of humor with a quick wit. He has a way of simplifying complex issues, cutting through the arguments, the debate and the doubt and the offer solutions that everyone can understand. He gets the facts and then makes decisions based upon the facts. In challenging times like now we need a steady hand on the wheel to help guide our state. John Burns is the right person to do just that. It's my honor and pleasure to nominate the gentleman from Effingham County, the Honorable John Burns, the Speaker of the House. On the election of the Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives for the 2025-2026 term, those voting for the gentleman from the 150-9th district represented Burns should vote yes or green.

My dear friend, Representative Chairman, butch parish, thank you for those kind words. I've always respected you tremendously in your service to your community into this state. And certainly we have a lot of work to do, and we're going to continue to do that. Thank you. Chair Lady Taylor, from either further down in South Georgia than I am, thank you for your kind words as well. They are much appreciated. To a former member of this house who has always been a friend and will remain a friend, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia, Justice Michael Boggs. Let's welcome and thank Justice Boggs for being our friend and taking time to be here as well as in this morning. Mike, we appreciate you. If you will indulge me a few remarks before we get on with the business of the day. I certainly am humbled and honored by your continued trust and confidence in me to lead this body. I'm looking forward to working alongside each one of you in this chamber, the vast, strong, common sense policies that will continue to make Georgia the best place to live work, raise a family for generations to come. Speaking of family, I've been blessed to have a person of great strength and great intellectual ability. All y'all know what that means. She's smarter than I am. To work alongside me, beside me, and some many times in front of me, as I do this job. I thank you to my wife, Dale Burns, whose passion for education, for her neighbor, for her family and her continued strong support to me does not go unnoticed. Dale, if you'll stand, she's in our gallery. Thank you, Dale. I really appreciate what you do for the people of Georgia. Love you very much, and I look forward to continuing to work that we have together, especially on literacy. You know, we've accomplished a lot over the last two years. Together we pass the largest income tax reduction in our state's history. And return billions of dollars to Georgia's hardworking taxpayers. Together, we've invested over $1.5 billion in our critical infrastructure in every corner of this state and laid the groundwork for continued economic development success across Georgia. Together, we've taken the first critical steps in expanding access to quality, affordable health care for the citizens of this state by passing certificate of need, reform, and investing in Georgia's medical education programs and partnerships throughout this state. Together, we made our homes and communities safer by cracking down on illegal immigration, increasing penalties for dangerous crimes and supporting our law enforcement heroes who put their lives on the line daily to keep us safe. Together, we will prioritize the future generations of our state by fully funding quality basic education. We've been funding for pre-K programs, increasing literacy initiatives, and providing pay raises for our teachers and educators.

across Georgia. And together we will continue championing every citizen, business and family that calls our state home. As we look forward to the next 40 next lady days, I am incredibly confident in each member of this body. And I am in our ability to come together to pass measures that make Georgia a better place. We will continue working to access health care. We will continue championing taxpayers and businesses of every size across our state. We will continue supporting Georgia's growing families and providing opportunities for economic security and mobility for every citizen in our state. We will continue investing in education. Bullse green literacy initiatives that are so important to us, increasing school safety and ensuring a brighter future for our children. We will prioritize mental health of our students and ensure that children have access to health when they face a mental health crisis. We will continue to further address public safety by supporting our state prisons and the men and women who work within those facilities. Now you all know this is far from a comprehensive list of the issues we will examine this session. And as I always say, there is nothing we can't discuss in this chamber. We will continue to be guided by the facts, debate the issues that matter most and develop strong legislation that makes a difference, a difference for our citizens, our communities and for this great state of Georgia. Thank you all for the confidence you've shown in me in the past. I hope that I can repay that confidence in the future by being open for discussion as we develop the best, very best policy we can. Now I've got something else to tell you. We're going to do some of those things. We've done a lot of those things. Now I guess what? Let's get to work. It's time. Thank you all. Doorkapers. I think you have those doors locked. So keep them locked. New members, I think you're aware of this, but as is our custom, we will again our day with script reading and words from the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. I'm going to introduce the chaplain of the day. He's a dear friend and he formed a member of this house who served 16 years with distinction. He held many important championships while as a member of this house, my most importantly was probably was the last one he held. He held was the chairman of ethics. His wife Debbie is here with him. Debbie and Randy Knicks have two children, Julie and Jess. They're pretty grown now. They're very grown now. So just a little bit about Randy's background. Randy not only served his constituents here in Georgia, but he also was a member of the US Army where he served as a chaplain. And I don't know how he went this direction, but I know he's a little bit closer to the state line over there, but he also served in the Alabama National Guard. And I'm sure they miss you over there. No doubt about that. Randy is a graduate of Troy State University with a bachelor's degree in business. But what I want to tell you about Randy, those things are important. His family is important. The church that he serves, Hill Christian, United Methodist Church in Lagrange is important. But Randy Knicks is a good man. Those of you in this body who have had the pleasure and the honor of serving with Randy Knicks, know I speak the truth. Those that don't and have not had that opportunity take my word for it. I don't use a good man about anyone very often. So we're blessed and we're I'm honored today to introduce to those of you who do not know Randy Knicks, Chairman Randy Knicks, to bring our message today. And I'm thinking since he knows the posture we're in, beginning this session, this message will be very timely. Chairman Knicks, come forward if you will and speak to us. Thank you Mr. Speaker for that very, very kind introduction. I am delighted to be here with you today. I know it's a busy and an important day and I know I need to be brief. So I think I can squeeze this two hour presentation into 45 minutes. He's already told me that security would be here before that was over. I know he's ready to be speaker when he hit this gable over here while he would like to scared me to death. You know for as he said I served 16 years and I can greatly appreciate every one of you and I do. I appreciate personally your commitment to serve the people of your district. You're willingness to put your name on a ballot and go go through what it took to get elected and you're willingness to be here to serve the people of the state of Georgia. And I just pray that the words I will use for a few minutes here will be used by the Lord that will give you some encouragement and inspiration as you begin this journey of these two years of this session. Now I have been blessed with some very awesome opportunities in my life and serving in this house was one of them. Another awesome opportunity I had was being selected to fly the RF4C Phantom jet in the Alabama Air National Guard. Now that was truly an amazing season in my life and I could spend hours telling you about the exhilaration of flying. Of flying that iconic jet fighter. Flying at supersonic speeds, high speed low level missions, 500 miles an hour at 500 feet or less. And if you don't believe those Georgia Pines at all you just go you do that for a little while. I could talk about nighttime low levels during that which are even more exciting. I could talk about Pukin in the cockpit which did happen and there was a saying that those people who flew in the back see that they're four. There are only two kinds of people those who have and those who will. And I was both of those. I could talk about taking a buzzer in an engine having to shut that engine down and come back with one engine which is not easy to do in the F4. I could tell you about losing some good friends and a crash. I could tell you about air refueling. I could tell you about the close calls and all those things but since I don't have a lot of time I just want to share one brief encounter that I had during the training when I was training to fly F4s. At that time Air Force Navigator Training was at Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento, California. And Debbie and I packed up and we moved cross country from Slapp out Alabama to Sacramento, California in November of 1977. And I started Navigator Training right after Thanksgiving of that year. The first few classes that we had were classroom classes. We spent time learning the basics of flight, the basics of weather, the basics of navigation and all those type things. And our first flights we had were in the T37 trainer better known as the Tweet. If any of you have ever been around a pilot training base you know that sound that it makes it a whistling sound and they call them the Tweets. Now we did three or four of those and those were really for people like myself who had no flying training whatsoever. And it gave us a chance to experience flight to become familiar with it to understand the dynamics of flight, basic navigation. We did a lot of aerobatics and really I think the biggest part of it was just to see who would get sick and most of us did at some time or the other. After three or four of those flights we had what was considered our first real check ride in that airplane and it was a visual navigation flight. In the T37 we had to draw our maps, we had to identify our initial point on the route. We had to have turn points, we had to stay on course and we had to stay on time. Now my big day came and I was assigned an instructor pilot who would fly the airplane, follow my instructions to navigate the route and return the base and he would evaluate my skills and give me a pass or a fail on that check ride. We took off and got to the beginning of the route. I found my initial point and we descended down into the mountains out near Lake Tahoe. We were down flying through the valleys and I made my first couple of turns right on time and right on target and I'm thinking man this is just a piece of cake. Well about that time very suddenly things began to deteriorate on me. I had marked a big pretty good size lake that was supposed to be right in the middle of our course that we were supposed to fly over and I couldn't find that lake. This is a visual navigation ride. I'm looking around, I'm frantically flipping through my maps and if I missed something I'm trying to re-compute my headings and everything and I'm actually just to panic because here I was on my very first check ride and I was about to bust it. I was really really getting worried. Now my pilot sensed what was going on and he said hey let me show you something and he just pulled back a little bit and we climbed maybe four or five hundred feet and right over that ridge line over there was my lake. Well I was kind of happy to see the lake but I was worried to death because I knew I had just busted my first check ride and my heart completely sank and I remembered the unit when I left they all had bragged about we've never had anybody wash out a pilot training or nav training and you know everybody's always done so good and man I just felt like the whole pride of the unit was on my shoulders now and I was about to bust my first check ride. I made a correction and I got back on course and finished mission without any further problems. After we landed my pilot time to put it my gear and come back and meet him the conference room and we would do a debrief as I put my stuff up I was wondering what in the world am I going to tell the commander back at the unit when he finds that I busted my first check ride. What am I going to tell Debbie? She went two thousand miles across country out there and here I was about to fail. Needless to say depression was about to sit in. I walked into the conference room and my pilot was sitting there waiting for me and I sat down across from and he said hey tell me what you think about the check ride. Well to be totally honest I said you know I guess I I must have busted that check ride because you know I got off course there in the middle I was I was lost and he looked at me and he grinned and he said lieutenant nicks today is your lucky day and I thought how is that I said how is this my lucky day he said because you were flying with me. He said as soon as I saw the era I corrected and I got back on course and I finished good everything worked out and he said he was sure that I had learned a lot and he wrote on my evaluation form past move on to the next phase. Well you know I had come from an extreme low to an exhilarating high instead of failing I had passed and actually got complimented for what I did right instead of getting hammered which is what I thought was going to happen I was granted grace and mercy. You know those two biblical terms grace and mercy grace appears about 170 times in the Bible and the word mercy appears about 270 times. Now grace is when God gives us something that we don't deserve our salvation from sin through the blood of Jesus Christ is a grace that's given to us it's a work of God's goodness. John Calvin said grace is the free and unmerited favor of God bestowing upon us blessings that we do not deserve so I had received a blessing. Mercy, mercy is often associated with kindness and compassion God not punishing us for something that we deserve compassion that for ghost punishment even when justice demands it. Now having served here I know that over the next several months you will be on a mission you will be on a journey and it will be full of people who will be flying with you. Problems are going to arise people will get lost. Days will get long and tempers will get short and some people will despair. Let me challenge you this morning during these times to be a merchant of mercy and a granter of grace. Matthew 5.7 Jesus says this blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy. You're not going to overdo it you're not going to give away more than you got it's going to come back to you. And in 2nd Corinthians 129 when the apostle Paul had a major problem God said to him my grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness. At some point in time you may be the pilot you may be the one who's granting the grace and the mercy you may be the trainee like me who's receiving it. If you're granting it be gracious as you grant mercy and grace. If you're receiving it be humble try to make the corrections you need to make and move on. My angel of had this quote and I love it it says I've learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel. Now it's been almost 50 years and I still remember how I felt when I was granted grace and mercy. It is powerful and uplifting so I ask you to be generous and bestowing it on other people and I finished with one last verse lamentations 3 22 and 23 says the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases his mercies never come to an end they are new every morning. Would you stand in joint with me as we pray? Lord I thank you so much for the members of this House of Representatives. Lord I pray that you will give them servant hearts. Father I pray that you will fill them with your grace and your mercy so that they can share it with others. Lord I pray that you will bless their families while they are away because we know that their families also sacrifice. And Father I make this prayer in the name of Jesus who taught us about grace and mercy. Amen. Now if you would please join me in the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you Randy for those words of encouragement and direction. I think we'll put them to good use. Do or keep as you can unlock the doors, but I don't think you want to leave. members, I think you want to stay here. We are going to have something a little bit different from new members than as our traditional day. So members, I would ask you to come back, take your seats. We received a blessing from our chaplain. I think you're going to receive a further blessing as we go into the next part of our morning, Azure. This morning, we're going to treat you to a couple of songs from a dear friend of mine, who I respect very much for her work, respect Azure, Azure Dominican and her husband Mike for being part of her community and all the great work she's done that the two of them do and their business lives and their work lives. So I want to welcome Aisha here. Let me tell you a little bit about for those who do not know who Aisha Dominican is. Work guys are like excuse me, chiming work guys are like the clamor being from Glenville and she is from Glenville, Georgia. That's true. Even though you have to say bills from their communities like we got it. Aisha is a graduate of the University of Georgia with a, well first you graduated from Magnus Scott and then the University of Georgia with a JD degree. So for all you Bulldog fans we're in good state here. So she's had a career in working in the business world and so she's very successful.

Mr. Clerk, to you and your staff, we do appreciate everything you all do. Carried, Scotty, thank you. Let's give these two around, y'all. Our next order of business is the election of the House of Representatives is the election of a doorkeeper for the House for the 2025-2026 term. The House is now open for nominations for a doorkeeper. I recognize the gentleman from the 48th Representative Scott Hilton for a nomination for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Congratulations to you and your family.

Like the clerk, I am seen and not heard, but thank you so much. It's such an honor to do this again. So thank you. Thank you, Betsy. Thank you, Betsy. Members, we have a fair amount of additional important business to tend to. So let's get started. Majority leader is recognized for the purpose of a first day of the biennium. Some resolutions we need to take care of so this House can conduct this business. Majority leader, the frustration you're recognized. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I have a request for the House to approve that the House adopt House Resolution 1. Mr. Clerk, will you read House Resolution 1? House Resolution 1 by Representative Hustration of 104th of Resolution to notify the Senate that the House of Representatives has convened. Are the lights on over there yet? Not sure. Okay. I'll explain the resolution in, Mr. Leader. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Well, good morning, everyone. Congratulations to all of you. This is our first Housekeeping Resolution. We take up each year to notify the State Senate that the House of Representatives is here working. And I ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Is there any objection that the adopts to know the resolution? Chair, here's known the resolution's adopted. Majority Leader, is recognized again for the purpose of offering House Resolution 2. Mr. Leader. All right. Thank you, Miss Speaker. House Resolution 2 is our Housekeeping Resolution, which I would ask the, would it ask for an opportunity to present to this body in just a moment? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Mr. Clerk, will you read House Resolution 2? House Resolution 2 by Representative Hustration of 104th of Resolution, relative to officials, employees, and committees in the House of Representatives. The Majority Leader is recognized as speaking to the resolution. Thank you, Miss Speaker. This is House Resolution 2, which is our Housekeeping Resolution. We present each year at authorizes for the employment of staff for the House for committee of one days that are utilized by members. Authorizes study committees to occur for members of the House. Would ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Is there any objection to the adoption of House Resolution 2? Chair, here's done, and the resolution is adopted. Representative Hustration is recognized for the purpose of offering a resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House adopt House Resolution 3. Thank you. Mr. Clerk, will you read House Resolution 3, the rules of this House? House Resolution 3 by Representative Hustration 104th of Resolution, adopting the rules of the House of Representatives and for other purposes. Representative Hustration is recognized to speak to House Resolution 3. Representative Hustration, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the rules are adopted each by any of them by this body and copies have been placed on your desk with the red cover sheet. As is standard practice, I will just go through the changes that are in the rules so we can go over those pretty quickly. First of all, with respect to Rule 10, there is a renaming of the Juvenile Justice Committee to Judiciary, Juvenile Public and Community Health, will be the name of what was the Public Health Committee, and there is a, number 33 is the Rural Development Standing Committee. In Rule 11, there will be a Judicial Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, spelled out at number 7 there. Rule 18, there is clarification that local legislation will be subject to treatment on the local calendar. But if there is a bill that is ensigned to the Committee on Intergovernmental Coordination as a General Bill, it would require three readings. Just to speak on this, there has been some confusion in the past when bills are introduced as to whether it is to be treated as a local bill or to be treated as a general bill. This would allow for greater clarity during that process, and it makes clear that a bill that is being treated as a general bill requires three readings as would any other standard general bill. Would not be subject to the local calendar and expedited treatment, a local bill would otherwise receive. Alright, then on Rule 40, for morning orders, morning orders will now be 15 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes, and as you'll recall from the past two years, this is an opportunity to recognize groups that have come here to the Capitol that may be in the gallery. Watching, we'll ensure that we have adequate times that we can recognize our constituents, leaders in the state, folks who are worthy of recognition by this body in morning orders. Afternoon orders will be 10 minutes under these rules, and we'll make clear that the afternoon orders should be used for the expression of condolences, or that's when an appropriate time would be for the expression of condolences, absent authorization from the chair otherwise. Also that political speech should not be utilized during those condolences. Moving to Rule 49.2. This would make clear that a member during each session shall not introduce more than 10 bills, and I just want to provide some clarity on this. Certainly to stream on the process with respect to legislative counsel in the clerk's office, when they are processing the amount of legislation that has to come through, it's very helpful for them to be able to process that in the timely manager manners that we have copies out of our desk that we're able to consider legislation and committee. If there this rule certainly, if the circumstances require what allow for exceptions to be made when legislation will be absolutely necessary, where the rule could be suspended. But I will point out that also you as members have the ability to withdraw legislation that you've introduced prior to day 20. If anybody is concerned about exceeding the cap, I'd submit to you that it's very unlikely that a member would exceed this cap with 10 bills per year. It's not per biennium. It's just per year. Also there are exceptions listed out here for local legislation, so that would not apply. Appropriations bills, et cetera. Next, one is rule 164E. So this is with respect to circumstances when multiple ethics complaints are submitted over the substantially same matter, so that the same issue was being brought up repeatedly, either about one member or about multiple members. It would allow for the ethics committee in response to provide a standardized response to those complaints when issued. And then finally, rule 177 is now that we have the office of General Counsel of the General Assembly. This would allow for circumstances of a member being served with a suit that the Office of General Counsel is to be notified in those circumstances. Mr. Speaker, I've hit each of the changes that there is, I think one rule with some minor cleanup changes as well, but it's not substantive. Mr. Speaker, I've just gone over all of the changes of these rules from the previous biennium, and I'd be happy to stand for questions if there are any. Yes, or a mislead? You have a couple of questions. If you'd be glad to yield our rep, I'll recognize the minority leader represented higley for question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the minority leader, majority leader, I'm sorry, speaking in advance, would you yield? Yes, I'll yield. I knew what you meant. I draw your attention to rule 12.2. It's not a new rule, but isn't it true that by voting for these rules, we're given our consent that the committee on a sign must continue without a seat at the table for the majority membership. The committee on assignments, which determines the makeup of committees, is unchanged from the previous biennium. That's right. So again, isn't it true that there's no representation by the minority on this committee? Certainly, no, the minority leader has a great deal of influence here in this body, but the makeup of the committee on assignments has not been changed. This is as it's been to my memory, as long as I've served in this body. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Can I direct you to rule 49.3? On the limit of the number of bills that members can introduce, can we, as a result, expect a better turnaround time from the legislative council about our bills that members are waiting for? I know that members have expressed concern about turnaround time, particularly later in session, and that there's been a great deal of interest in supporting legislative councils so that turnaround time can be increased. Obviously, they do terrific work for all of us here. My council of members is to get with legislative council as early as possible so there can be as much time as possible for that, and with a schedule in place, there'll be the ability to plan for that. One final question of the gentleman yields. Who 173 regarding our excused absences? Isn't it true that this rule does not recognize that we are citizen legislators who most of us have other jobs, and on the rare occasion where we need to be away because of that business, it does not allow for an excused absences, or any allow such that the member who has to be away. For business, their voting record will be compromised because they're going to show that they're going to be not excused. Well, I'll just say this. With respect to rules 73, there's no change from the rules as they were in the previous biennium. I think that we all have responsibilities, personal, professional, and the like. And this very clearly sets out when it's to be classified as an excused absence and when it's not to provide clarity to all members. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Thank you. Thank you for those questions, Leader. Chair now recognizes the minority party will represent park from the 107th representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Leader, if you're straight into you, question. Regarding rule 18.5, in which your presentation noted it was to clarify the process regarding local legislation, can you commit that this new rule 18.5 will not be utilized to undermine the will of local delegations regarding local legislation? So the issue has been, Mr. Whip, that there has been a lack of clarity certain times as to how bills are to be treated. Either to be treated as a local bill, which entitles it to be on a local calendar, or to be treated as a general bill. Sometimes dictated by our rules in other areas. And I hate to give the Senate credit sometimes. But the Senate has very clearly classified those bills very early on in the process, which is then provided members greater clarity moving forward. I believe that this rule 18 is going to allow for us to have similar clarity very early in the process. And so that's my response. Would you for one more question? Yes. So under the House rule, specifically House rule 50, that does lay out specific issues in which local matters would otherwise be treated. As general legislation, including political subdivisions, though of course the rules also give and authorize a speaker the ability to submit any piece of legislation to a committee. And so in light of the discretion that the majority party yourself in the speaker has, again, the request of the minority is to again ensure that the will of local delegations in our caucus and in this body are respected. And I look forward to working with you and the speaker to ensure that that is the case. Well, with respect to the Whips question, my response would be there have been members in the past who have inquired of me what treatment is this bill to receive? Is this a general bill or a local bill? And how is it to be classified during the process? I think the desire here is to provide clarity on that so that members know streamlines the process is fair in the implementation of as bills are considered. These rules can now be followed so that the member can be aware of what treatment that bill is to receive. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, are you one more question? Yes, sir. Representative Buckner from the 137 to your left has a question. Representative Buckner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On page 24, it mentions, you mentioned that by day 20 the bills could be withdrawn. So that if we had more than the limited number, but in the writing there, it says day 15. Did you just, is it day 15 or day 20? I believe you're correct. My understanding is that bills can be withdrawn up to a certain date. And so the point is that if a member has introduced a certain number of bills and they would like to have the ability to bring more bills, they could either be withdrawn timely or they could go to a colleague who'd be able to introduce the bill along with them. And if I could, I used to have to do proofreading so on page 65 privileges misspelled in the heading. Thank you. Well, it's been a great teacher. We'll tell you it's been a struggle struggle my whole life. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, I will yield the well and ask for the body's favorable consideration of House Resolution 3. You have no further question. The gentleman's yield of the well. Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's none. The resolution is adopted. Chair, now recognize the majority of the purpose of offering a resolution House Resolution 4. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I move that the House adopt House Resolution 4. Mr. Clerk, will you read House Resolution 4? House Resolution 4 by Representative Estation 104, the resolution calling a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate for the purposes of hearing a message from the governor. The majority of the leaders recognize to speak to the motion. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I present to you House Resolution 4. This is a resolution to invite the governor and the state Senate to the House Chamber this Thursday to hear the governor's state of the state address. Ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution? You've explained it, right? The Chair, here's none. The resolution is adopted. Let's see, now this is a very important part in this discussion. Now we will appoint a committee of escort to deliver this message to the governor. Let's see who's on there. Let's see. The gentleman from the 26th, representing Lauren McDonald, the lady from the 103rd, representing Suhong, the gentleman from the 9th, representing Will Wade. The gentleman from the 15th, representing Matthew Gamble. The lady from the 47th, Speaker Proteum Jan Jones. The gentleman from the 104th, representing Chuck Astration. The lady from the 141st, represented Carolyn Yugley. The gentleman from the 154th, representative Gerald Green. The gentleman from the 176th, representing James Birchette. The gentleman from the 177th, representing Sam Park. The gentleman from the 121st, representing Marcus Wheathour. The gentleman from the 120th, representing Houston Gaines. The gentleman from the 124th, representing Tray Rhodes. The gentleman from the 122th, representing Spencer Fry. You all will serve as an escort to deliver the message to the governor. And we will move from immediate transmission to the middle of that as well. We have two resolutions that we will need to pass on to the governor. And we will need to pass on to the governor. And I got one ahead of the other. So what we just passed and what we pointed the committee of escort for is to bring the governor here when he addresses this house for the state of the state. Chair recognizes the lady from the 141st, the minority leader for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We would like to have the opportunity to reconsider this house approval of the rules without a vote. We wanted to object to that. And of course, you know, this is my first day. So if you would allow us an opportunity to object. I understand. I believe I gave notice and I apologize that maybe we didn't communicate on the objection, but I believe by the rules of this house that you will have to maybe register your objection on different matter. So that's the ruling of the chair on the ability to reconsider the objection. For what purpose does representative Campbell? You have a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move now. We reconsider our action relative to house resolution three. We've already moved on and we consider another resolution. So that motion would be out of order now. We are moving on to the next resolution, which is I believe resolution. Let's do the immediate transmit. Let's go back and get that. Each year, part of the process here with the Senate, we get a message from the Senate that they have adopted resolution to notify the governor that the general assembly has convened. And then we allow them. Has convened and then we'll have the pass this on to the governor. So here we go. Senate resolution two to notify the governor that the general assembly has convened. There is any objection to adopting the resolution. Chair here's known the resolution is adopted. The chair appoints as a committee of notification on the part of the house, the following members, the gentleman from the 178 representative Steven Meeks, the gentleman from the 160th, 60th representative Leeman Franklin, the lady from the 139th representative Carmen Rice, the gentleman from the second representative Steve Tarvan, the gentleman from the 24th representative Carter Barrett, and the lady from the 165th representative Edna Jackson. The majority leaders recognize for the purpose of offering a resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move. I move that this house adopt house resolution five. Mr. Clerk, will you reach house resolution five? House resolution five, I represent a demonstration 104th of resolution calling a joint session of the House of Representatives in the Senate for the purposes of hearing a message from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court inviting each other, justice, the Supreme Court, each judge of the Court of Appeals to be present at the joint session. I would like to thank the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals for the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House resolution five invites the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia and the state Senate to the House Chamber on Tuesday, January 28, 2025 at 11 o'clock AM. Thank you. That's for your favorable consideration for the state of the judiciary. Thank you. Mr. Clerk, tell me that date again. Excuse me. I mean, Mr. Leader, tell me that date again. May I misspoke January 28, 2025? January 28, not that you spoke correctly. January 28, is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's known the resolution is adopted. That completes our work. I thank Mr. Clerk. If I missed anything, we're good. Remove on the morning orders, pro-tim, if you will.

We are moving on to morning orders. Chair recognizes speaker burns for a morning order. Thank you Madam Pro Tem. I appreciate your patience and your attention this morning. We have a special time in our state for many purposes. But in December, Georgians and Americans join together to mourn the loss and celebrate the life, if you will, of a man who dedicated his life to the betterment of our state our nation and of mankind, President Jimmy Carter. His life of public service began here in this very place, this state capital over six decades ago. And since then, President Carter's leadership, statesmanship, kindness, faithfulness, and love for our nation made an amicable difference in the lives of countless people, both right here at home and around the world. President Carter reached the heights of earthly success and power as the leader of the free world. But I believe one of the most cherished roles throughout his life was as a Sunday school teacher over in Plains, Georgia at his church. One of President Carter's favorite Bible verses, and he lived it, he frequently quoted Micah 6 verse 8. And I think I know that we can all agree that his life embodied these words. And the scripture says, he has shown you, O mortal, what is good and what does the Lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your guide. And I always say that a story seldom told is a story soon forgotten. May we in this body, all Americans, may we always remember and reflect on the life and legacy of President Jimmy Carter. Four states, 76th Governor, a loving father, cherished husband, Sunday school teacher, peanut farmer from Plains. And Georgia's only native son to reach the office of President of the United States of America. If you have it already, I was reminded yesterday as we began our session with a prayer confirmation downstairs that I looked over my shoulder, I saw a portrait. If you have it already, I encourage each of you to stop by this routed portrait on the second floor of our beloved Jimmy Carter from a Governor and President and great human beam. If you will, join me in a moment of silence. Thank you, gracious God, for blessing us and allowing us to celebrate the life of Jimmy Carter and what he meant to not only those of us who have the opportunity to serve, but to the average Georgian, the American, and people around this world. Thank you for blessing us. Lord, we ask you to continue to bless this great state. Amen. Thank you, members. Mr. Clark, we read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Commending and congratulating Thomas Elliott Butler, congratulating Howard, a sunny turner upon these, in ducked to the Georgia Association of Conservation Districts Hall of Fame. And for the purposes that completes the reading of the privileged resolutions. Resilience and adept. The legislative objection to adopting the privileged resolutions. The clerk, the chair here is known and the resolutions are adopted. A couple of reminders before we leave the chamber. Remember leave your oaths of office on your desk. Leave your voting cards in your desk drawer. Remind you that eggs and issues is in the morning. You can be there, be there. We have one more important piece of business that y'all need to hear. So I'm going to ask members, we have a couple of announcements and we'll be, we'll be it. We'll need your attention just a little bit longer. It's a little longer. I think you'll like this next resolution. But before we go to that, so I can have your attention, members take your seats. One of my favorite announcements, representing Val, where are you? Here she is. If you give your attention to the lady in the way our representative has a challenge. And very important now, representative. This will be quick. Guess what everyone? It's our first blood drive of the year. It's going to be tomorrow. The blood drive will be parked in its usual location, which is between the Capitol building and CLOB so you cannot walk from your office to this building without tripping over it all day between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. I'm going to make a recommendation. First of all, I want us to break the record from last year, which was in itself a record in terms of the number of donations we get from this body and our friends at City Hall and our friends at the Judicial Center. The other thing I would recommend is please, before you give blood, drink two full bottles of water. And after you give, when they offer you the gatorade, please drink that also. All right. Thank you. See you tomorrow at the blood mobile. I'm going to be there. You're going to be there representative. Doctor, you're going to give blood tomorrow. Now, I apologize about tension was turned, but you scheduled this. Come back for a question, if you will. So do you mention you scheduled this, so we'll have the opportunity to give blood twice before we leave here? Yes, that is a great question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The reason that it's so early in the session is we always try to fit in two blood drives during the session. And if someone wants to be a repeat blood donor, you need to have 56 days in between so you can make more blood. That way we can have our second blood drive before we get too late in session when people aren't really feeling it. That is why it's tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have one more question. Do you know which house member holds the record for the quickest donation of blood? Is it you? Yes, ma'am. How did I know? I don't know what your time was, but mine was good. So thank you, Representative. I encourage all of you to give that life-saving gift of donating blood. Thank you, Representative, being always positive on and helping us encourage us to get that done. Representative Parish, where are you? You're recognized for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Congratulations, everybody. It's new, even to you all. I want to speak to the Macon Bibb delegation. We want to meet at my office for a brief delegation meeting. Looking forward to seeing you all there right upon adjournment. Thank you. Members, if you will, give me your attention for our last order of business for the day. We are awaiting a resolution to make it away from the Senate back over here. They've already passed it, but I want to allow the majority leader who has done, he's given a lot of time and effort to get this done. And so we'll still have to formally adopt this resolution. But while we're waiting in the essence of time, I think it would be important that he explain and y'all could take a look at this. I thank you like it. Majority leader is recognized. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you very much for your leadership to make this possible. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm pleased to announce that for the third year in a road now, we will have a 40-day schedule approved here the first week. I know that for planning purposes, for our legislative work, our families, our businesses for all of us, it's helpful to be able to plan well ahead. Let me begin by saying that as we go through this, we had one of the latest possible starts this year to begin on January 13th, almost as late in the calendar as you can go. And so that makes it very difficult to allow for the time necessary, particularly for the budget writing process, to get us out as we would typically try to get out earlier. But with planning here, you can see when we'll begin. So first, if this is adopted by the House tomorrow when the Secretary of Senate brings it in here, we'll be in all this week. Next week, we will be off for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday and for hearings. The week after beginning Monday, January 27th, we'll be in Monday through Thursday. Clerk, if you could please flip to the next page. All right, then, as you can see, February, this will be another Friday off that will have the week of February 3rd. Another Friday off will have the week of February 10th. That is helpful as members, particularly coming from South Georgia, need considerable amount of time to get home and need the opportunity to get back to for family and business time. The following week is President's Day. So, President's Day holiday is off if you could move down a little bit. I should mention also Friday, February 14th, Valentine's Day, time to spend with our most important constituent. Right? If you move on down, then we've got committee work day prior to crossover day and crossover day would be set for Thursday, March 6th. Then in March, if you move down, we are going to have time that just naturally was available to us due to the late start of session and the time needed for the budget, where we will have Wednesdays for committee work day in March. So, I know it's often house members. We send so many bills over to the Senate. The Senate says, I just have so many house bills. I can't hear them or consider them. There's going to be ample time to have your bills in the Senate with these committee work days that will be available after crossover day. Then if we could move on down March 17th, which is a Monday, St. Patrick's Day, there's often community events and many of our districts. So, you'll have an opportunity to attend those. We'll be in Tuesday through Friday that week. And then finish it on down from there. If you'll just move up a little bit, Sunny Dye will be Friday, April 4th, the 40th day of the legislative session. So, you have some predictability now. And at the appropriate time, I'll ask for your favorable consideration of this schedule. Thank you for the opportunity to work on it as a majority leader. And I'm very proud. Three years in a row, we have 40 day calendars to present to you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Members, we'll have to wait a few more minutes, but we'll take care of that piece of business so we'll have our schedule ready to go. Representative Adinio, good to see you again. Nice job yesterday at the prayer convocation. Appreciate you. You recognize for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome, colleagues, and happy New Year again. I'd like to announce the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus will be having a Swerrin in ceremony and meeting. And welcome current and new members, we're down in cap 216. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Members, if you will, stay near your desk in stand-and-ees just for a minute while we await the resolution, the adjournment resolution. Thank you. The House will come to order. We are. The resolution is made as way over from the Senate. We can conclude the business of the day. Members will return to your seats. Let's take care of this final piece.

All right, if I can have your attention, I'm going to recognize the majority leader. I'm going to talk to us, get's going to present Senate Resolution 6. Is that correct? Mr. Leader, your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So Senate Resolution 6 is the adjournment resolution that I just went through with you. We alternate years, House and Senate passing at first, and the Senate was just up this year. So Senate Resolution 6 is the schedule I just described, 40-day calendar for your planning purposes, would ask for your favorable consideration. I'm excited we can pass this again on day one. Thank you. Absolutely. I'm very excited as well. All of your questions were answered when we put it up on the board, I assume. Okay, is there any objection to the adoption of Senate Resolution 6? Hearing none, the resolution is adopted. We have a schedule. Members, thank you for hoping to enjoy your families that are still with you the rest of the day. It's a great day to be a member of the House. Great day to be a Georgian. Mr. Leader again, thank you for your work and your team on making sure this happened to some. And put it to the, for us all, to have some organization that allows and respect our private businesses and family events as well. The House majority leader, Leader of the House, is recognized for a motion. As speaker, I move that this House stand adjourned until Tuesday, January 14, 2025 at 11 a.m. On the most of the majority, Leader, this is House stand adjourned until 11 a.m. On Tuesday, January the 14th, 2025. All those in favor, we'll say aye. Opposed? No. Well, that's excellent. It's very clear the nose, the eyes have it. This House stands adjourned.
