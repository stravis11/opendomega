TRANSCRIPT
----------
I really do look forward to serving in this next role as Treasury of the United States.
You went up first, got to call a couple of Saturdays ago, I wasn't sure they dialed the
the right number because I was expecting something in transportation or commerce, but after
I talked to him and they said that the boss wanted me to be the treasurer, I said, yes,
I'll accept.
So it's going to be a great opportunity.
It's going to be life-changing, going to Washington, DC, but I will never forget you guys.
I'll never forget where I came from and thank you for all you've done for me.
Thank you very much.
The Trump administration taps a member of the Georgia Legislature to join his administration
after more than 10 years serving the Alfa Reda area, Senator Brandon Beach heads to Washington
as U.S. Treasurer.
Good evening and welcome to lawmakers on Georgia Legislative Day 35, I'm going to allow
her in Atlanta, more on Senator Beach in the action at the Capitol coming up.
Tonight we're going to dive into a legislative smorgasbord of issues under consideration under
the Gold Dome.
New lawmakers will discuss issues dealing with small businesses and big corporations too
as we examine workforce, housing and community development legislation.
We'll look closer at the Homestead Exemption Bill that passed in the Senate but is headed
back to the House for another vote.
And as things wind down at the Capitol, the debate continues over some of the big issues,
such as the Religious Liberty Bill.
First, let's get today's Capitol report from Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna. Tears and both chambers today, but for very different reasons.
If you look in the bottom left hand corner, it will have the name of the Treasury of the United
States at the bottom left hand corner. And that will soon have displayed Brandon Beech's name on it.
So let's get Brandon to be round the call.
This Senate said farewell to one of their own this morning as Lieutenant Governor
of Senator Brandon Beach as the Trump administration's new U.S.
treasurer.
I love this institution, the Senate.
I love this chamber.
I love the people in it.
And it's a great body.
And it's going to be a great memory for me to know that I served
in this Senate chamber.
The legislators voted on eight house bills.
some of the more notable bills,
HB 92, which would extend the deadline
that counties and municipalities can opt out
or rescind an opt out of,
the property tax homestead exemption.
We've given some more opt-in opportunities.
There wasn't an opportunity to opt back in.
We're letting that be done on an annual basis
as of March 1st.
If people want to opt back in,
and this year we're extending it to April 30th
for those that may want to.
doing their some reasons they might want to. And then we have that they will revisit that decision
if they don't have anything in place in 2027 as well. The bill was passed 52 to 2 and HB340.
The Distraction Free Education Act would ban cell phones from K through eighth grade schools
during the school day, allowing each school system to set their own phone policies.
research shows it takes over 23
minutes to regain focus after a
distraction, meaning many students
never fully get engaged in their
education. Our teachers are seeing
our teachers are seeing the
impact first hand. Over 85% of
high school teachers and 68% of
middle school teachers report that
cell phones are a major problem in
their classrooms. The bill was also
Removing phones creates a safer school environment.
In an emergency, we want our kids
full and undivided attention, clear phone lines,
no misinformation, kids listening to teachers,
kids listening to school resource officers.
If God forbid there's an incident in the school,
I want my child, in your child,
to be able to follow instructions very clearly
without distraction to get out of the building,
get out of a classroom and be safe.
Despite concerns from some Democrats over parents being able to communicate with their
children in an emergency, the bill was overwhelmingly past 54 to 2.
In the house, a tearful thank you from a member.
But I want to thank you.
This is a family in here and you won't believe the calls and the text I've had while it's
amazing and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it if you if you get the chance
read Jeremiah Jeremiah 29 11 for I know the plans I have for you the
classic Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you and plans to give you a
a whole future. Yes. Smith was let go from his job at the Harris County
Chamber of Commerce after voting no on the tour reform bill last week. The
house then took up several bills dealing with public safety and children.
Senate bill 123 defines chronic absenteeism in schools and lays out a plan to
address it. While this is not going to fix chronic absenteeism, this is a
step in the right direction. We're stating that if a district as a whole has a
rate at 10% or higher, they have to have an attendance review team. And if a
individual school has a rate of 15% or higher, they also have to have a
dedicated review team. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. It passed 160 to one. And SB
42, First Lady Marty Kemp's 10th bill related to human trafficking would
increase penalties for sex trafficking minors. It passed unanimously. At
least two courts in Georgia have indicated that the Georgia human trafficking
statute for minors that we passed last year, is similar to the PIPPing and PAN during
a minor statute, which carries a lesser sentence. So this bill will fix that in order to make
sure that we have the more serious and more of a punishment for those that are sex trafficking
and human trafficking are minors.
The house also passed SB 110,
which would revise the definition
of child neglect in Georgia code.
The bill was written after a Georgia woman
was arrested for child neglect
after neighbors saw her 10 year old son
walk down the road unsupervised.
When I was growing up,
my mom would send me into a store to buy something,
would potentially, you know,
I'd walk down the street to go to a friend's house
and with what we've seen in particularly in the media,
with the reporting around this, the concern that rises here is that parental autonomy
that allows for a child to develop a sense of independence, the ability to think for
themselves to really develop and mature, sorry for the feedback here, but that may be subject
to interpretation by law enforcement or authorities inconsistent with the parent's rights and
responsibilities.
despite some pushback.
Mr. Speaker, is it not true that parents who are accused
of neglect often believe that they have not been
neglectful?
The bill was passed 100 to 69.
No session tomorrow, Donna, is committee meetings
take priority.
The House and Senate will both be back on Thursday
and Friday this week.
That's my Capitol report.
Thanks, Sarah.
We're going to talk about the homestead exemption
and small business issues with two lawmakers
familiar with what it means to own a business.
Joining the show is Republican representative Ron Stevens
of Savannah.
He chairs the House Committee on Economic Development
and Tourism.
Also here is a member of that committee,
Democratic Representative Solomon Adesanya of Marietta.
He's also on the business development
and governmental affairs committees.
Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
Thank you.
So, Representative Stevens, I'm going to start with you.
Let's begin with what happened to date in the Senate
with the Homestead Exemption Bill,
which is HB92 and it requires governing authorities
like school districts to opt out
and it gives them the ability to do that
and extends the time for them to do so to April 30th,
which I think was gonna be around the 1st of March
originally.
You've had interest in this type of legislation for 25 years
and you have a paper to show it,
we're gonna show it up on the screen,
but you brought it with you.
I did, I did.
It's funny, it's been 27 years.
years ago, we started trying to come up with a mechanism that would not be a burden to
the taxing authorities, but also be able to essentially freeze property taxes. And we
called it then, it was, I was in the minority, we called it Stevens Day, because we were
the first to come up with the idea. And it's taken essentially 25 years for the rest
of the state, if you will. But up until that time, we've had 60 tax
and districts to also adopt the same procedure.
It's been a fun ride, it's been an amazing windfall
for the homeowner, especially those that want to live
in their home and retire in their home.
And I don't think in our area anyway
with the increase in assessments and homes,
it was very hard for people to stay in their home.
So it's a big deal.
Explain this a little bit.
So what happens is that the school districts
and other governmental bodies will have the option
that thing about it is they're trying to figure out
what they're going to have the money
with this homestead exemption.
And that's the beauty of this thing,
whenever exactly the way that it was back
and 25 years ago, is no revenue was lost.
And in addition to 581,
they placed a cost-living index on there.
So you get exactly the same revenue as you had the previous year,
plus there's a cost-living bump in it.
So it's a great deal.
Okay, so you voted for it, represented at Assignia.
So tell us about your thoughts on it.
I think it's on help for every time you have a bill
that helps Georgians, Democrats,
we have fought hard to create an economy
that works for everyone.
We also understand that it's important
that we have a system where people are not just struggling
to get by, but they can actually get ahead.
every opportunity we have to advance the will of the people.
I'm always on the supportive of it.
Okay, so it'll go now back to the house.
They have to look at it,
but it seems pretty good that it's gonna pass on that.
So I wanna move on to something else.
You have your small business owner.
Tell us about what your business is
and what legislation you're interested in
for small businesses.
Yes, so I'm a restaurant owner.
I have three restaurants in the metro area.
It's called Kale, Mikrezi, who sells salads.
Yes, we sell salads, organic and healthy food.
And it's important to support small businesses.
What I'm pushing back on is the increase in tariffs
by the other party, mainly from the federal down.
That's 25% of you look at the imported goods to the US.
China, Mexico, and Canada account for 40% of the goods
that are inputted into the country.
So imagine I've been at 25% entirely from those,
that is going to crush, it's really going to crush people.
And inflation has been rising over the last three months.
I don't think it's a way to do it.
I think it's misguided.
And I, by and large, think that we have to push back
and create an environment where businesses can thrive.
Because at the end of the day, it passes down
to the consumers, and they're the burden,
they're the ones carrying that burden.
Yeah, so you're really worried about what's gonna happen.
We're gonna have to wait and see though.
Absolutely.
Okay, well, I'll come back to you in a moment.
Representative Stevens, you have two bills
that deal with something different.
Workforce, housing and community development.
HP317 and House Resolution 192.
There's lots of development along
Georgia's coastal area.
You're from the Savannah area,
especially with the Hyundai Meta Plant coming in.
So is your legislation looking to help
manage that workforce a little better?
A good bit, you know, as you know,
We've got 159 counties in Georgia.
Our neighboring state, Florida, has 67.
You can imagine the problem of trying to plan and get infrastructure to all these areas
with so many counties.
All the bill does is it allows for what our neighboring states already do, and that's
to allow bonds to be sold and to folks with private investment to extend infrastructure
where it's needed.
will be able to even accumulate several counties
to come under one umbrella, if you will,
for this WRID, and it should extend infrastructure
and create economic development,
where some of the counties are so small,
they really don't have the wherewithal to do that.
And so you want something that will oversee all of that?
Some kind of...
It's a private investment,
and only for the infrastructure,
but it has nothing to do with cities or counties
and the governing part.
All this is a bond mechanism to fund it.
What's as funded?
The counties or cities take it over and it goes away.
Tell us what's going on down in the Savannah area with the mega plant coming in.
The meta plant, I should say.
They're starting, you know, tomorrow they're doing the ribbon cutting.
It's a big, big day.
It's close to 3,000 acres and for those that have ever gone to Savannah, if you can picture
Tyvy Island, the island itself will fit on the footprint of the Meta plant.
So it is a massive, massive undertaking.
It's about 12 and a half times larger than any project we've ever done in state of Georgia.
It's going to create about 18,000 jobs, I believe, by the time it's all over.
It is probably the biggest economic development project by far that we'll see in the near
future.
And it's going to give these folks in the fastest growing county in the state that we have,
which is Bryan County.
It's gonna give those folks an opportunity to have jobs
and I have to leave the state.
Wow, I've been by there.
I can't believe there's a ribbon cutting tomorrow.
So they're finally getting there.
It is enormous.
You drive and you drive and you're still passing it
when you're down there.
So we'll keep up with what's going on with those bills.
Right now, they're where?
Right now, we wanted to hold them back.
Okay.
There are 54 pages as one of the bills.
So we wanted to make sure that we've added it well
and we'll have a vote next year.
Okay, all right.
I know there's some other things you want to talk about.
Go ahead.
Yeah, so it's House Bill 394.
And that's pretty much to increase the minimum
weights to $15 per hour.
Right now, Georgians are struggling.
And we've got to recognize that.
I am a business owner and I can tell you
that I recognize that challenge.
I recognize that issue and all of my employees
pretty much make over $15 per hour,
even though it's a low-skid job.
But we also have to encourage businesses and industries
in Georgia, and by way of doing that,
legislature has to come up with a bill
that we can advance to say, hey,
this is the minimum wage that we're going to have in Georgia.
I have a lot of my employees.
And people, even at that, the $15 per hour,
a lot of them have to work two jobs to survive with kids.
And with the way it is now in schools
where we're not offering launches at school,
It's difficult for people to get by.
Layoffs and people losing their jobs all over the place.
We've got to, as a legislature,
set the tone by saying,
this is what we want as the minimum wage.
And that's how we can actually
encourage Georgians who, you know, are hardworking.
Yeah, so this session,
you're not expecting anything to happen on that, but.
Yes, sir.
You're keeping hope alive.
That we are, I am, you know,
and that's, you know, what I think we're here
and sent to do, keep pushing, keep fighting,
keep advocating for the issues that matter to the people.
We didn't get any hearing, it was a bill
by a representative on McLean, by the way.
It didn't get any hearing, and he's been
an advocate of fears, advocate for labor union and wages
and ways to advance the agenda of the people.
And we're going to keep fighting for it,
next year is going to be another year,
and we'll push that through, hopefully.
We'll have you back on then, thank you very much.
Thank you both for being here today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So coming up, we have two house members
from different sides of the aisle.
And they're gonna give their thoughts
on legislation dealing with tort reform,
religious freedom, and transgender athletes
and women's sports.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPP.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the State Capitol during the session and year-round,
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen.
I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman.
People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it by acknowledging our own worth.
Oh, please, don't continue.
This is the first time you've ever had a child.
You've never had a child.
You've never had a child.
the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
This is amazing.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking, but look at this, it really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry.
As the session wraps up, the controversial bills that passed on each side of the capital
are now undergoing review by the other chamber.
We're going to talk about some of those bills with two legislators who've seen their share
of action under the Gold Dome as a signi-dial for which is.
Joining us is Democratic Representative Derek Jackson of Tyrone.
His committees include defense and veterans affairs and regulated industries.
So here is Republican Representative Trey Kelly of Cedar Town.
He's Vice Chair of both the Health and Way, Health and Ways and Means Committees.
Welcome to Lawmakers to both of you.
Appreciate you being here.
Great to hear that.
So let's start with one of the controversial bills.
You both voted no.
SB 68, the lawsuit, overhaul, or tort reform bill.
Of course, that's the one that Governor Brian Kemp has as a priority and I want to get
both your thoughts.
I'll start with you, Representative Kelly.
No, thank you for having me to that.
And frankly, I don't feel it's productive for me to unpack
a couple of the reasons that I voted against the bill.
But what I want to focus on is looking forward,
somehow I'm extremely proud that Speaker Burns has announced
and is leading on, which is holding
our insurance company's accountable moving forward.
We heard a lot of conversation during this debate
from hard-working George's and my district
about wanting to see their insurance premiums go down.
And I think the Special Study Committee
that Speaker Burns has initiated
is a logical next step in this process,
So I'm proud to see us lead on that a lot of people want to see something done on insurance your reasons for voting against it
Well, I voted no because it negatively impacts not only citizens but the victims, you know when
Individual gets injured
You should have a remedy and that remedy should be decided by the jury
Senate bill 68 will deny the jury for making sure that the victims are made whole
But also, Senate Bill 68 will not change insurance premiums.
And so you cannot advertise that Senate Bill 68 is going to reduce premiums where there's
nothing in that bill or any of the eight sections that will certainly impact or decrease insurance
premiums.
Well, we'll see what happens, but thank you both for talking about that.
Representative Kelly, and I'm going to move on another thing.
The House Judiciary Committee is looking at SB 36, the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration
Act. In 2016, you voted in favor of a similar bill. The House Judiciary Committee will once
again look at SB 36 tomorrow after hearing hours of testimony earlier, well, actually last
week. What are your thoughts this time around?
Well, I was proud to support it in 2016. I'm proud to support it now. This is an important
bill, but it shouldn't have to be controversial. This is something that 39 states currently
have in place in law. This was a policy that was championed at the federal level by President
Bill Clinton. What we're simply seeking to do is make sure our exercise of religion, our
First Amendment protection exercise of religion, has the same protection that the other four First
Amendment rights have. It simply protects those who want to exercise their religion in the same
way that we protect freedom of speech, freedom of the press, our right to assemble, and the right
to petition our government.
I think our freedom to practice our religion
is just as important as those other four rats,
and I think that's worth protecting.
Yeah, but back then, then Governor Nathan Diel
did veto it, so we'll see what happens.
I do wanna get your thoughts on it
before we go any further.
Listen, we already have religious freedom, right?
I'm a retired naval officer.
The Constitution always already guaranteed us
religious freedom, but Senate Bill's 36,
and you already mentioned Governor Diel why he vetoed it.
And the reason why I continue to fight against bills
such as this, because it would divide us.
No one should be able to use their religion to discriminate.
And this bill will allow that.
So we need to have legislation to bring us together,
not separate us.
I remember back in 2016, the fear was
that there would be businesses not coming into Georgia.
They boycott Georgia because of it.
What do you think?
We've heard that song in dance before.
And they said that with our election bill,
and it didn't happen.
They canceled all started gaming, it's back.
And so I think that's a little disingenuous by our businesses.
I think it's an issue if some of our spokesman's
for our business community make it an interest.
Frankly, they're not leaving 39 other states
and I would hope they wouldn't leave the number one state
in the nation to do business over the last 11 years.
Yeah, what are your thoughts on that?
Well, I think the political climate is different.
I mean, you see in citizens right now
who are mad and upset and if businesses
or starting to take on a principle that goes against the
citizens, they'll end up being boycott.
I mean, let's look at target right now.
Targeted and lost $16 billion because they started doing
something that goes against those who were patronizing
target.
So I think the political climate has changed.
Citizens are upset if this bill goes through not only
corporations will go against Georgia, but the citizens
of Georgia will go against Georgia.
And we'll see what happens.
First of all, we have tomorrow morning
to see what happens in the hearing.
Okay, we're gonna switch gears again
and get into controversial legislation
that would ban transgender athletes
from playing women's sports.
This afternoon, the House Education Committee voted
to pass SB1 out of committee.
Now it's now a compromised bill
that incorporates aspects of HB267 that passed in the House.
And for instance, SB1 now is called the Riley Gaines Act.
The name representative Josh Bonner gave it in the House
and Representative Jackson,
you voted against the legislation in the House?
Why?
Yeah, I voted against this because this is another piece
of legislation.
Again, we'll discriminate.
This will specifically discriminate against those
in the LGBTQIA plus community.
We don't need legislation here in Georgia.
That's going to divide us.
The other reason why I will continue to fight against
treacherous bills such as this is because no,
there's nowhere in Georgia that indicates
that this is happening.
We even talked to the NCAA
that has 510,000 student athletes, 510,000,
and they said they only had nine incidents.
And so this is a bill that's looking for a problem
and that problem does not exist in Georgia.
Where was it in Cali?
With all due respect to my Democratic colleague,
the Democrats are searching for problems
to find what the common sense piece of legislation.
This is about making sure that biological males
don't compete against biological females.
We have title nine protections at the federal level
that were established to make sure
that our daughters, our sisters,
our, you know, mothers looking back historically
didn't have to compete unfairly with males.
And that's something that we need to continue to fight for
is something that we need to address being proactively.
And I'm proud to see the House lead on the Riley Gaines Act.
We have seen unfortunately our daughters
and young girls who spent their whole lives
training his athletes, finally reaching the pinnacle
of their careers, only to be not down by logical males.
And that's unfortunate and it's uncalled for,
and it's something that the citizens of Georgia
will not tolerate any longer.
Yeah, well, it certainly had the support in the House
and the Senate because you had the two bills,
what are you thinking is going to happen next?
I think you're going to find Democrats
such as myself continuing to fight against it.
Again, the Georgia High School Association said
zero incidents, and then again, the NCAA said out of
500,000, only nine incidents.
Come on.
So what?
It's not happening.
I wanted to ask you, so are you happy with this
compromise between the two chambers?
I think it's an important issue, and I think it's good
that Georgia leads on this.
I'm glad that we're not waiting for a problem to develop.
This week in Oregon, a biological male in a high school
competed in a track race against one of the top biological
females in the state, and beat her by seven seconds.
We have different classes, and we ought to be proactive
in Georgia.
I think that I don't ever want a single female in Georgia
to have to experience that heartbreak because a biological
male felt like he couldn't compete in his classification
and came over to hers.
I think we struck a good compromise.
I'm proud to see the Riley Gaines Act move forward,
and I look forward to supporting it on the floor.
You were gonna say?
I'm just saying, this legislation
do not even mention the word safe.
They say it's for safe to have safe woman and girls sports.
They don't even mention the word safe.
Again, this is a bill that's gonna divide us.
It's, and we're not organ.
This is Georgia, it's the same incident.
And we don't ever want to be, and it's common sense.
It doesn't have to say safety.
It's common sense that lacrosse, rugby, soccer,
Any of those wrestling, we don't want biological males
competing with biological females.
That's common sense.
It doesn't have to be in black and white.
That should be something that's strong
when each of our hearts.
I got two sons that play football, Donna,
and then I try to play football against women.
They play football for Duke,
and another one plays at Kennesaw.
They play against other young men.
And so as far as you're concerned?
The problem doesn't exist.
and it should never.
Okay, I think you agree on that part of it.
Yeah.
I was trying to get in,
I don't know if we have really quick,
you have HB196 to deals with pharmacies.
Can you explain that in just like 20 seconds?
20 seconds, it will help our Main Street frontline,
pharmacy health care workers stay open,
address some of the schemes that have been played
by our PBMs to protect our independent pharmacies,
proud to support it.
That's the issue we can both agree on,
both supported it and looking forward
And it has to do with those coupons and all the discounts people get on one
pharmacy.
All right.
Well, I appreciate you both being here and giving me your opinions.
All right.
That does it for lawmakers tonight.
It's a committee day at the Capitol tomorrow, so we won't have a show.
So join us on Thursday when we'll talk about Georgia's move to change the way it's 9-1-1
system operates.
Have a good evening.
