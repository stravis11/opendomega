Amendment number one to House Bill 217 has been distributed.
Senator from the 50th, do you wish to speak to your amendment number one?
Your choice.
Okay, I think the Senator from the 50th has already spoken to amendment number one to his bill,
which is House Bill 217, which is the measure we're now considering.
So, question is, is there objection to amendment number one?
without objection.
Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Chair here is none. Is there objection to the agreeing to the report of the committee which is favourable to the passage of the bill?
Chair here is none and the report of the committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
The chair here is none and the main question is ordered.
The question is on the passage of the bill as amended.
All those in favor of vote, yay, those opposed, nay,
Mr. Secretary, please don't lock the machine.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
All in the passage of the bill, the yaves are 44, the nays are two.
This bill having received the requisite Constitution of Majority is therefore passed.
All right, rolling right along, House Bill 348, Mr. Secretary, please.
Please read the caption.
House Bill 348, a representative of Williamson,
the 112th, and others.
Bill Smith, tell an act to amend chapters 14 and 41
of Title 33 of the Efficient Code of Georgia Ante,
related to domestic stock and mutual insurers
and captive insurance companies respectfully,
so as to expand the lines of insurance and re-insurance
in which a limited-purpose subsidiary
and captive insurance company may engage
to rival definitions, rival-related matters,
rival-in-effective dates,
to repeal some looking laws and further purposes.
Mr. President, the think you're making on the insurance
labor recommends that this bill do pass,
respectfully submitted.
Senator Walker, chairman, Mr. President,
Senator Mallow of the second off with following amendment number one to amend House Bill 384 by replacing two online one with
To amend code section 33-3 of the official George annotated with two qualifications for transactions of insurance generally
Transaction of insurance by insurance owned by states and for other purposes
Mr. President of the center mayor of the ninth offers the following amendment number two to amend House Bill 384 by inserting after definitions
on line for the following to mention every 24,
Title 33 of those CTA by two interns generally,
so as to prohibit an insurer from transferring funds
between affiliates with intent to mislead
regarding the insurer's profitability,
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary,
the chair recognizes the hard-working senator
from Houston County,
Senator from the 20th to speak to his bill,
House Bill 348.
Thank you Mr. President, good afternoon, I know we are all enjoying being here on a Friday
afternoon a beautiful Friday afternoon sunshine about 80 degrees outside and we're sitting
in here and to add insult to injury I'm bringing you an insurance bill which I'm sure
will be thrilling and captivating.
So this bill deals with captive insurance companies, and it deals with a wholly owned
captive insurance companies that have a limited purpose.
and the men's chapter 14 of the chapter 41 of the code to allow companies to accept investor funds to supplement reserve
surpluses. These are investment vehicles that are commonly used by reinsurers. The bill will allow the
commissioner to approve the formation of insurers that are in part directly funded by investors.
It retains with the commission of the full authority to approve or disprove of the formation
activity finances and plan of operation capitalization and assets.
Our current captive law limits the lines of coverage that these captives can write to
five lines of coverage which are casually excluding accident and sickness, marine, transportation,
property, and surety. This bill would remove that limitation which would allow the possibility
of these captives to write other lines of coverage such as cyber insurance or group term
life insurance for their employees or inland marine insurance. But all this would have
to be approved by the insurance commissioner just like he has to approve traditional insurance
companies that would have to have sufficient reserves and be financially solvent to do that.
So this was, this is a department request that we do this to modernize our cabinet statutes.
We have companies in Georgia that are doing this now and they're having to go to other states that
have more open laws to do it to form these captives and we want to make it where they can
do this in Georgia and bring us into the modern era on that.
I'll go ahead, Mr. President, and speak to these two amendments from my good friend,
from the second, center from the second, and I'll tip my hat to him.
are very clever and creative and interesting amendments. I'm opposed to both of them. The
first one would basically not allow a carrier and insurance company that came into the state
of Georgia to do business to leave unless they had a net loss of income over the past five
years, so even if they made one dollar of profit in five years, putting billions of dollars
at risk, and they only made one dollar net over five years they would never be able to
leave Georgia. That's an anti-free enterprise anti-capitalism bill if I ever saw it.
And then the second amendment, I'm going to have to look up what Artifice means, but
It doesn't allow them to engage in a scheme or artifice, which transfers funds between
affiliates or subsidiaries.
Well, insurance companies have to maintain a certain amount of surplus and reserves is
called surplus to be able to make sure that they can pay current claims and future claims.
And a lot of our insurance companies, of course, are national.
I have various subsidiaries, various entities
throughout the country and they need to be able
to move money around as their surplus needs change
from state to state.
So I would oppose amendment number two also.
I ask for your federal consideration of the underlying bill
and I will be happy to try to answer any questions
or I'll just get out of the well and we can move on.
Thank you, Mr. President, I'll yield the well.
You do have one question, if you want.
The senator has yielded the well.
All right, Chair recognizes the senator from the second.
distinguished senator from Savannah to speak to amendments one and two which are both authored by well speak to amendment number one
senator
Thank you, miss president amendment one is a very simple amendment
As we've heard
Insurance companies are losing money hand over fists their bleeding out of every pocket and every which way they're taking on so much water
This bill simply says that if all that's true
They're free to leave the state
But if that's not true, and out of the five years they've been in this state, if they've
made money in this state, in at least four of the immediate previous five years, the
sum of such insurance total net profits from the combination of all policy lines and investment
income, attributable to Georgia are greater than $1.
We heard time and time again that insurance companies don't make any money in Georgia,
and if that's the case, colleagues, if you adopt this amendment and you vote for it, and
they're not making any money in Georgia, they haven't made any money in Georgia, can you
I guess what?
This amendment is null and void,
but if they did make money in Georgia,
and they made money for four years out of the five,
they've been here,
then they can't just leave the state
and say that they're going broken,
cried bankrupt.
That's all it does, Mr. President, very simple.
And if my colleagues hold true to what they've said
about insurance companies,
then this amendment is an easy one to vote, yes, home,
because it wouldn't be true at all.
So we can walk and chew gum at the same time,
and with that, Mr. President, I yield the well.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Chair recognizes the Senate from the ninth to speak to her amendment.
Amendment number two.
All right, colleagues, I bring you a amendment number two, and just to what Artifices is
trickery, cunning and clever tricks, we want to clarify that so we know what this means
in this amendment.
But this amendment is about the deceptive financial practices of insurance companies.
And we've seen this in recent news.
While these companies claim they're operating in a loss,
the reality tells a much different story.
They're thriving in their profiting record profits
while policyholders are struggling
with rising premiums and probably reduced coverage.
We've seen this playbook.
We saw it play out in Florida.
Insurance companies were claiming financial hardship
and citing increased cost and risk
and all the while quietly like hiding
and padding up their bottom lines.
And they do this narrative to justify the hikes
in denying claims and lobby against consumer protections
and it's exploited.
It's a regulatory loophole and it increases profits
at the expense of consumers.
What this amendment does, we don't want this happening in Georgia, what's happening in Florida.
It's not just a question of economics, it's a matter of ethics and it's a matter of accountability.
We have a duty to ensure that hard work in Georgia aren't being taken advantage of.
Under the guise of insurance companies claiming they're in financial distress,
We're false claims too many false claims out there and
If an industry can afford multi-million dollar executive salaries and shareholder payouts
it can certainly provide to
Provide for a fair and transparent pricing and
Transparent reporting to consumers
That's why I'm introducing this amendment. It's gonna require greater transparency
It's going to require insurance to disclose their full revenue stream and
In the end of it we want to prevent what's happening in Florida from happening here in Georgia
So I'm asking for your favorable consideration of amendment two
Unless protect Jordan's oh
There is a penalty hold on
The
We want to make the violation real high
they can afford it. I think $100,000 is that that shouldn't be much if they find
that they're in violation. So asking for support in this amendment and Mr. President,
I yield the well.
Senator, is yo to the weld, is any other senator wish to speak to House Bill 348 or the
amendment one or amendment number two?
Chair, here's none.

Secretary, please unlock the machine.
Mr. President, is it not true that there's a South Georgia saying that amendment one is a good way to scratch a lie and find a thief?
I'm sure the senator knows of which he speaks.
Chair recognizes the Senate from the 20th.
Mr. President, if we yes vote amendment one
would cause insurance companies to flee our state very fast.
Sounds like the senator knows of which he speaks as well.

Chair, recognize the center of the 9th, for what purpose do you rise?
Isn't it true that this bill actually is designed to punish companies who intentionally
have high profitability, and that they can go to jail if they do it?
Senator can state her opinions.
On the adoption of amendment number two, the yeas are 19, the nays are 31 and this amendment
having failed to have the requisite votes has failed.

We're gonna send it from the 45th, speech in the measure.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I bring HB 360 before you today.
In the summer of 2026, the World Cup is coming to Atlanta.
HB360 is an important piece of legislation to make sure our capital city is prepared
to meet the needs of thousands of soccer fans from across the world.
This bill is designed to jumpstart development in downtown Atlanta, particularly in areas
that surround the stadium where the games will be held.
Any of you are familiar with the Georgia's Historical Tax Rehabilitation Credit, which
is long supported revitalization of historic structures by encouraging private investments
in historical buildings.
HB360 encourages developers to complete their historical projects in downtown Atlanta
prior to the start of the World Cup, allowing them to claim those accelerated tax credits
If they're able to get their certificate of occupancy prior to the end of 2026.
Importantly, this bill does not increase the current yearly cap of historical tax credits.
It simply allows developers that have been approved to receive those tax credits in future years.
There is a sunset on this tax credit in 2029, so it would be 2027, 2028 or 2029.
To claim those credits early, if they complete those projects before the World Cup, there
was an interpretation question that was cleared up and been addressed by DMR.
This bill would allow funds to be pulled forward from the yearly $30 million cap.
It would not create any additional funds.
These have already been approved in future years.
It would just pull those back to 2026.
The total if all of the projects in this selected area in Atlanta were completed and had a CO the total cost of that would be $29 million.
Would that Mr. President be happy to answer any questions?
Do you have a couple questions, Senator?
I recognize Senator from the second.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, do you you?
I do.
Senator, I'm trying to understand this piece of legislation and relation to the tax credits and pulling them forward
or certify structures for tax year 2027, 2028, 2029.
So you're saying out of the state allocation
of those tax credits that this individual developer
will be able to pull forward the proceeding years
after forward in the current tax year.
Is that not true?
That is true.
And so will the credits being pulled forward
less than the amount of available credits
that already exists in the total dollar amount?
That is correct.
We're not adding any additional dollars, it just pulls those forward so you would that
29 million.
If they get CEOs on all those projects, being in the construction world and timing of construction
projects, some do run long, but if they all were completed in this designated area around
the stadium, the additional funds would be 29 million that would be pulled forward.
So then in future years where, and it's my understanding those credits actually go out
the 28 that have been applied for in that particular area is 27 and 28 so it's two years
that would be pulled forward so no additional money it's just those future years would
be less.
So the future years would be less and it's also says not just you said up to 28 but Senator
the Legislation on line 16 also says that it would include year 2029 as well so we'd
be lessening the amount of credits available to everybody in the rest of the state but
one project.
No sir what and I'm glad you asked that question senator
No sir what what it would do is these projects have already been approved so
There there would be no taking away from from other folks these projects are already on the books
They've been approved. It's just they're approved essentially around the stadium
Basically and it does go out to 2029. There's about a million that the million dollars worth of credits
That it had been applied for and given in 29
But these projects don't go out that far the projects around the stadium
they've been approved for 27 and 28 so those two years would be pulled back but
there would be no taking or no less credits out there for folks to claim they've
already they've already been approved for those credits it's just
accelerating them so those projects would be done by the World Cup so we've got a
nice vibrant area around the stadium. Last question Senator have we done this
for any other part of the state? I don't know the answer to that
Recognize the approach in for a question. Thank you, Mr. President. Is the senator yield? I do
Senator, do I understand that if hb360 passes
That those that have applied for and been approved for these tax credits for 26 going forward
They're all in a line and they have a position in the line for each year
The total of which maximizes out at the 30 million dollar cap per year, right? That is correct
And that if this bill passes, no one loses their spot in line,
nor are they pushed back or forward, that is correct.
And that the amount of money that they have been approved
for for the tax credit will not change,
will not increase certainly.
And but will not decrease if 360 is passed.
That is also true.
So the passage of HB360 has no effect or impact on the others
that have asked for and been allocated this tax credit out into the future as
far as 2030. That is correct. Thank you Senator. Yes and one other point of
clarity in some of my discussions folks have asked over this jumping in line
and it's not jumping in line the folks that are in you know 27 28 29 if you
can imagine of course Gwyneth's home for me so I'm imagine being on 85 you
We've got a peach pass lane, we've got the other lanes on 85, and they're all traveling
in the non-peach pass lane, but their schedules will not change.
Essentially, we're allowing for these projects around where the world couple would be able
to get in the peach pass lane to be accelerated so that the area around the stadium is very
vibrant for these games.
Thank you, Mr. President, with the center yield?
I will.
What's the number of developers that seek to benefit from this legislation?
I don't know if this is 100% true but in the discussions I've had, I believe there's only one developer that I'm aware of.
of there may be more right that's just what I've what I've been made aware of so
this legislation is going to benefit one developer in the entire state what I
would argue is that this will actually benefit the City of Atlanta it'll
benefit Georgians it'll benefit you know how this area around the stadium looks
when we have the World Cup come and Atlanta and Georgia is showcased to the
soccer world. Senator will you further yield sure how do you say it's going to
help all Georgians don't you think it's going to burden Georgians by having to
pay more taxes because this one person is being exempt from taxes. What I would
say is I mean you could argue tax credits but these tax credits have already
been approved like this is not a new they're not applying this is not a new
developer coming in applying for the credits now they've already been approved
for these projects it's just where they've been approved around the
the stadium, the credits have been proved in 27 and 28.
This would just pull those back to 26.
So we can get those projects done
before the World Cup comes to Atlanta.
I'll be voting no, Senator, thank you.
Thank you.
We're gonna send it from 27th.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Or, Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, yield.
I do.
We keep talking about the World Cup.
But the certificate occupancy does not need to be issued
until December 31st of 2026, or think it's about six months after, so what I'd like to
know is that I can draft this quickly. Would you be in a amenable to an amendment that would
change December 31st on line 19 to June 1st so that we actually ensure this is complete
for the World Cup?
I would be amenable that, yeah.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator, you have no more questions.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. President.
In 2022, the historic tax credit, which is meant to benefit all around the state, was
again passed with a sunset of 2029. It's 30 million per year. And besides the 30 million
a year, it has something in there that no project would get more than $5 million. Because
we want to spread it around to Augusta and Savannah and Albany and Macon and Columbus and
Athens different cities sort of spread it around. Now what they've done, I guess creatively
is we've got one developer that has six projects
that is five billion each.
And they're taking the credit that's
supposed to be used around the state
and consuming the rest of it through 29.
What's left in there?
And moving ahead of other people
when they will get their money as well for this,
I think many people are of the opinion
that this project would happen anyway.
that this credit moving in the front of the line is unnecessary.
So we passed a really good bill earlier today, Chairman Strickland's bill.
We increased the tax credit for childcare from 30% of the federal max to 50% for all the
children around the state of Georgia, $28 million.
We've got a bill that's going to benefit one person that's more than that.
And I think that we're certainly setting a bad presence when we let them exceed the
five million cat by having six projects and that we move them to the front of the line.
I've going to be voting no against this bill.
I'll yield the well.
Senators yielding recognize the center for the excuse me not the center the treasurer of the United States
Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in support of this bill
I want to tell you a little story. I opened a restaurant in downtown, Alpharetta about 20 years ago and the building was built in
in 1910.
And I thought it was a historic building.
And I thought I was going to spend about $5,000
on electrical work.
It ended up cost me $15,000 because nothing was up to code.
When you deal with these historic old buildings,
you're going to run into skeletons in the closet
that you weren't imagining.
So that's one reason I'm supporting this bill.
The other reason is it's going to revitalize this area.
And it's not just for World Cook Cup.
It's a 30-year plan to have the benefits
for the next 20 to 30 years of restaurants and retail
and coffee shops and bars and housing and condos
and just all kind of mixed juice down there.
I could see this becoming very similar to in Denver
about 30 years ago, you wouldn't even
go around Cours Field because it was such a blighted area.
This isn't as plighted, but it's not as vital as it could be.
And I think that you take all those buildings,
and you can really create jobs and economic activity down there.
And don't forget, it's not just for World Cup in the stadium.
We have a thriving convention business
at the World Congress Center, and we need nighttime activity.
And I think this is going to do that with what these developers
want to do, and so I'm fully behind it.
And I want to ask everybody to support it.
Mr. President, I'll yield the well.
The senator is yielding.
Senator in 36, did you have a question?
Would you like to speak?
Parliamentary inquiry.
States are inquiring.
Isn't it true that with the, in light of the comments,
just raised by our U.S. treasure, that this is work that will benefit the place that
we all come to to take care of the state's business. It's going to clean up an area of
historic preservation. And it's a very minimal state dollars that are going to be put with
paired with other dollars, and every dollar that's, that, that, that we've come to this
project is only after the money's spent. So it's a, it's a, it's a modest proposal with
tremendous opportunity for, for seeing a transformed portion of Atlanta that is long
needed to be transformed. Thank you.
Well, I'm a drain choir.
Won't you, Sandra, won't you see if the the treasure there can turn on the press printing presses up there and help us just fund this thing here, so
recognize the
Center from 31st
Is it not true that maybe many years ago if the City of Atlanta wanted to do this, the Atlanta Braves would still be in downtown Atlanta?
We just went straight for the belt right there.
We're going to have a center for the second.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Not only does this benefit pulling forward tax credits for one specific developer, but
I would like to draw your attention colleagues to lines 22, 23, and 24.
At certain capital improvements of the cabbage town historic district economic reuse establishment
of certain additions, there are two from all city of Atlanta and Fulton County Ave,
Lorm, Texas.
Now, Ms. President, I know my colleagues want to vote in favor of this bill, but not only
are you going to get the tax credits, you're also not going to pay taxes on the development
that you're developing.
That's a bad bill, Mr. President, and I leave it at that.
I yield the well.
As Senator from the 53rd.
Senator from the, thank you, Mr. President.
Senator from the 31st, we're out of the Atlanta Braves.
You know, I don't think the Atlanta,
City of Atlanta got involved on that deal with their funds.
I don't believe they're getting involved on this deal.
I'm kind of sick and tired of citizens from Northwest Georgia having to pay more taxes
so citizens in Atlanta can pay less for their special projects.
I used to live over in Cabbage Town when I was over in the house.
Cabbage Town is a historical place, but the buildings are already there.
The studs are already there.
So why should you be able to come in as a developer and have a house that's already built and
try to upgrade it and then get out of all the taxes for it?
You want to upgrade the community, tear the place down, and go build something brand new.
This is ridiculous.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Senator from the 27th Senator did you were did you have something to where you
go off or something amendment okay is there objection to the previous
question being ordered chair here's done previous question is ordered is there
objection to agreeing to the board committee which is favorable to the

All those in favor will vote yay.
I'll oppose nay, secretary, and lot of the machine.
You
All the passes of the bill, the A's are 26, and the A's are 24, and this bill has failed.
Senator from the 41st, what purpose do you rise?
Mr. President I move that we reconsider it is in order all right is there
objection for the reconsideration
Senator senator senator senator from the 19th
Senator from the 1980s for the purpose of your eyes
Just a conversation with the Senate secretary of Senate
Senator from the 14th for the purpose of your eyes
Parliamentary and creamist president states you inquire is it not true that if reconsideration succeeds
Then we can table the bill and negotiate over parameters that would make it acceptable to a majority of the body. Is that not true mr
I believe the senator is up to speed on his rules
.
.
.
.
All right, so on the motion to reconsider the center from the 41st, because we are in
date, 37 Monday, it will be the first order of business for reconsideration on Monday.
that you've given the notice.
We're going to ask the senator from...
We have a special message from the House.
We need the Secretary to read the message.
Mr. President, the following message will be received from the House
to Mr. Riley to hook their oath.
Mr. President, the House is passed by substitute by the requisite
a constitutional majority, the following bill of the Senate,
Senate bill 79, by Senator Goodman, the 8th, and others,
the bill's been toned on act to amend Title 16 of those CGA,
where I do crimes and offenses.
So as to revise, so as to roll to announce the event,
and all the related sentences, necessary to constitute
the offenses of processing, selling,
distributing, and manufacturing of such sentences,
and further purposes.
Mr. President, the following methods were received
from the House and Mr. Riley, the clerk that are of,
Mr. President, the House has disagreed to the Senate
amendment to the following bill, the House, House Bill 86,
by Representative Leber, or the 123rd, and others,
built between 10 and 9 to Menco Section 48, 5-7-4.
The official goes towards annotated way to annual salaries
to certain state officials and cost of living adjustments
so it's to revise provisions related to calculating
and setting salaries and for other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Those are special actions that we'll take up
at the end of these special actions that we have currently.
So now I recognize the senator from the 8th.
Mr. President, I move that the Senate agree
to the House, just Senate Bill 79.
Is there objection?
Secretary Reed, the caption.
Senate Bill 79, my Senator Goodman, the 8th,
and others, built to be in town on that to men,
title 16 of the OCGA, which is crimes and offenses,
so it's a rise to racial demands of fentanyl
and related substances necessary to constitute
the offenses of possessing, selling, distributing,
and manufacturing of such substances to revise
mandatory minimum departure revisions
for defendants convicted of trafficking of substances
and violation of code section 16-13-31
related to trafficking of cocaine, illegal drugs,
marijuana, and methamphetamine, and penalties
to amend various titles of OCGA says to provide
for conforming changes, to write for an effective day,
to write for applicability, to write for related matters,
to write for a short title, to repeal convolcing laws,
and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the House offers the following substitutes
Senate bill 79, it builds between Title IX to amend Title VII, 16 of the OCGA,
where due crimes and offenses, search of vice-versa or old amounts of fentanyl and related substances,
necessary to constitute the offenses of possessing, selling, distribution, and manufacturing of such substances,
and for other purposes, Mr. President, I can please the order.
Senator Leith.
Thank you, Mr. President, Senate Bill 79, come back to the Senate.
I want to thank Mr. President, you and your staff, for all the work that you've done on
the fentanyl epidemic.
I want to especially thank the Walters family who are over there, who have been here while
we've gone through all these bills awaiting this special action, this bill passed out of
the House.
senator if we could have everybody's attention please we're almost done let's
give the attention to the senator in the well thank you mr. President I want
to thank the Walter's family they've driven four hours up here today they were in
the house gallery when this bill passed earlier today and they've stayed with
us all day mr. Gus miss Beth y'all stand up where I can see you thank you
It's Beth, we love y'all, thank you for all the work that you've done, really of taking
a tragedy in Olsen's death and making some good out of it.
This bill, when it went to the house, we agreed to the change.
We took out the possession language that was in the original bill, and this bill now
was solely focused on trafficking.
And so I want everybody, if you're talking right now, I want you to listen to what I've
got to tell you.
this past week, just this past week in Sandy Springs, their law enforcement found
enough fentanyl to kill every resident of Atlanta, Macon, Savannah, Columbus, Augusta,
Valdosta, Brunswick, Warner Robbins, Hinesville, Sandy Springs, Johns Creek, Roswell,
Offeretta, Peachtree City, Chambley, Sugarhill, Newton,
Statesburg, Gainesville, East Point,
Pooler, McDonough, Stockbridge, Union City, LaGrange,
Carter'sville, Forest Park, Winder,
and every spectator that's in Sanford Stadium
and Bobby Dodd Stadium and Mercedes-Benz Stadium
when this is a full capacity.
Just this week in our state,
enough fentanyl to kill two and a half million people,
Nearly one in four Georgians.
That's why this bill is needed.
These folks that are trafficking this poison in our streets.
Again, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership
on this issue, especially for loving on the Walters family.
And I want to thank this chamber.
And I just asked for my children and your children
and the children of Georgia and our fellow Georgians,
let's light this board up green if we can.
I yield for questions, Mr. President, or I yield the will.
You have no question, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Brett.
Does any other Senator wish to speak for against measure?
Senator from 29th?
Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent
to excuse the Senator from the 37th.
Well, objection to the Senator from 37th is excused.
The senator has asked that the Senate agree to the House substitute on SB 79, all those
in favor will vote ye, all opposed, nay, secretary in line of the machine.
You
On the motion, the yeas of 49, the nays are zero and this motion has prevail.
You
You
Senator from the 50th, ready when you are.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I moved that the Senate received from its amendment to House Bill 86.
Senator has moved that the Senate received from his amendment on House bill 86. Secretary,
read the catch.
House bill 86, where I represent a member of the 123rd and others, the bill to mean
tell an act to amend.
Code section 45-7-4, the official code of George Ante will lead to annual salaries, certain
state officials, and cost of living adjustments, so as to revise provisions related to calculating
and setting the salaries of justices as a Supreme Court judges the Court of Appeals and the
judges the Georgia Statewide Business Court and the judges the Georgia State Tax Court to
provide for effective dates to arrive for a later matter,
should be able to look at the laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate offers the following amendment number one
to amend House Bill 86 by inserting up to a core
on line five, the following to revise the compensation
of certain other elected state officials
by striking lines 13 through 16
and inserting a lieu thereof the following one governor,
striking 175,000, inserting 250,000 and for other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you, Mr. President.
House Bill 86 is bill we heard yesterday it deals with judicial compensation.
Thank you, Mr. President.
House Bill 86 is bill we passed out yesterday it deals with judicial compensation for
Supreme Court judges, Court of Appeals judges, and business court judges, there was an
amendment that was added on in our chamber that increased the pay for the governor and
constitutional officers.
That was stripped over in the house.
They've sent it back to us because of the importance of this bill to our judicial system.
I ask that you go along with me to recede if there are people in this chamber that want
to address the salary of the Governor of Constitutional Officers moving forward.
I would encourage you to do what the judges did.
Let's get a study committee together.
Let's let it work the committee process.
But for now, instead of amending a bill at this late in the session,
to address a pretty robust issue, let's stick with what we have.
Let's receive from our position and let's get this bill passed.
I'm happy to answer any questions if not, Mr. President, I'll yield the well.
You have no question, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well.
Does any senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Hearing none.
Senator, from the 50th, has moved that the Senate received
from its amendment to House Bill 86.
Is there objection?
All those in favor, we'll vote yay, all opposed, nay,
secretary, and lot of machine.
You
You
own the motion the yeas are 46 the nays are two and this motion has prevailed
You
You
You
Thank you, Mr. President, I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute to Senate Bill
69.
The Senators move, Secretary Reed caption.
Senate Bill 69, by Senator Kennedy of the 18th and others, Bill Smith-Townel and Act
to amend Title 7, Article 5, Chapter 11, Title 9
of the fish go to George annotated,
way to making and finance and depositions in discovery
and with the Georgia Civil Practice Act respectively,
so as to regulate third party litigation,
financing practices in the state,
to provide a short title,
to provide for a later matter,
to provide for an effective date and applicability
to repeal some lifting laws and further purposes.
Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute
to Senate Bill 69,
to build between Title 9 to amend Title 7,
an Article 5 of Chapter 11,
the Title 9 of the fish go to George annotated,
really, to making and finance and depositions
and we're discovering the Georgia Civil Practices Act.
Respectfully test to regulate
third party litigation and financing practices
in the state to enact a new chapter
regulation litigation and financing practices
and further purposes.
Mr. President, I can place the order.
Recognize the pro-tum.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I'm gonna try to be efficient guys.
I know we're at later in the day and it's Friday afternoon,
but this is Senate Bill 69
that you'll remember that we presented
and voted on unanimously by this body
and send it over to the House.
And I will tell you that they made a few changes to it,
all of which I think are fine.
Let me tell you very briefly.
First of all, this is of the two tort reform efforts
from Governor Kim.
This is the second of the two.
This deals with something called third party litigation funding.
And this is at its hard three measures.
Number one, it is a consumer protection measure
for those people that engage
and need these type of financing arrangements.
Number two, it is a disclosure issue
because it makes it more transparent
when these type instruments are used.
And number three is the national security issue,
making sure that those that are foreign adversaries
that are acting in a financial capacity
don't continue to have access to our court systems,
the way that we're exposed to right now.
So the question is, how is this different
that's been offered by the House?
I would tell you that Section 710-1 simply changed
the definitions to align with the banking departments
or the Department of Banking's practices.
they took a closer look at it and added some exclusions that made it more in alignment
with current banking law.
You'll also see in section 7, ash 10-3 that this new code section is based on consultations.
Again, with the Department of Banking and Finance to clarify that they can deny a registrant
where the requirements are not met.
It also in section 710-4 makes clearer that while the litigation financier cannot pay referrals
or commissions, the attorneys or other outside parties, payments to litigation financiers,
employees do not violate the prohibition.
And I will tell you, senators, that the one main change you'll find in section three
under discovery and disclosure simply takes the limit on third party discovery toward
litigation financiers does not extend where the amount of the amount being financed is
$25,000 or less because that amount is excluded from these types of transactions.
So with that, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions or I'm happy to yield.
You have no question, Senator.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I move to the Senate degree to the House of the Senate Bill 69 as amended by amendment 1.
All right, Senator's move.
Secretary, read the amendment.
Mr. President, Senator Hatchett of the 50th offers the following amendment number one to amend the House's substitute to Senate Bill 69 by inserting after a line 23 after a short title of following to amend Title 40, the Fisher go George annotated away to Motor Vehicle, so as to provide for the Missibility of Evidence related to Seat Safety Bells by placing lines 458 through the end with the following Section 4 Title 40, the Fisher go George annotated away to Motor Vehicles is amended in Code Section 4-H8-76.1, related to use the Safety Bells in passenger vehicles by revising Subsection D and for other purposes, Mr. President.
a complete stewarder.
We're going to sit in front of the 50th.
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll try to be brief here.
Amendment 1, what this does is it relates to a evidentiary or evidence that's allowed to be brought in in the trial.
does is going to change the effective date of this act so that it will not apply to pending
actions that are in court. It only applies to actions that are filed after the effective
date. It deals with the admissibility of seatbelt evidence. There's been some constitutionality
issues that have been raised about changing the evidentiary rules as it relates to this
issue in pending litigation. This will clean that up and I'm happy to answer any questions
but ask for a favourable consideration.
Do you have one question, recognize the center for in 30 second.
Thank you, Senator, would you yield question?
I'm looking at lines 22 to 24, where it says the way I'm reading it is that if I'm not
wearing my seatbelt and I cause an accident that the insurance company can't raise my
rates.
Am I reading that correctly?
That's correct.
Language that we've already passed us verbatim language that we've already passed. Okay, thanks. Thank you
Yeah, no further questions. Thank you, miss president yield the well
Any other senator which speak for against the measure
All right, so we'll take up the

All those favour of their amendment will vote yea, I'll pose nay, say take a lot of
the machine.
