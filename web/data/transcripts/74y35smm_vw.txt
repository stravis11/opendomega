Please help me welcome Reverend Donald Belcher Jr. as a true servant leader in Chaplain of the Day. I speak of Burns Representative Sains and Distinguished Assembly Members. Good morning. I'm honored and grateful for the privilege to be here this morning. Representative Sains, thank you so much for that introduction. I do remember that day when I met Representative Sains and it was interesting. He was sitting across from our desk as my lieutenant and I were interviewing him and prepping him for a career in law enforcement and getting into law enforcement of what he thought he was going to get into law enforcement. I remember specifically asking him a question, where do you see yourself in five years? A lot of times my lieutenant and I would ask that question just to find out what their goals were in life. He gave a very interesting answer. His answer was I would like to be in Atlanta serving as a politician. Mr. Burns, that was definitely different than what we were used to. We were expecting something more like, you know, I see myself as a patrol sergeant and leading my men on the streets where I see myself as a patrol lieutenant. But God had other plans for his wife and as you know, he's here doing good things for the state of Georgia. This morning I would like to say thank you so much for allowing me to be here and serving as the chaplain of the day. This is an humbling experience. Thank you for allowing my wife and I to be here and our children to serve you guys this morning as you start your legislative day. My goal is I pray that the Lord speaks to you through me. I pray that He speaks to you in ways that only He can. And I pray that it's a word of encouragement before you start your day this morning. Proverbs 16 verse 24, the word says, pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and health to the bones. And I pray that's exactly what you find in this morning's devotion. Today's reflection, we're going to be in 1 Samuel chapter 17. And if you're not familiar with 1 Samuel 17, it's the account of David and Goliath. And this account conveys a profound lesson for leaders, including those that are involved and engaged in the pursuit of guiding our society through the intricacies of governance. And this passage here in 1 Samuel unfolds with the Philistine army. The Philistine army was amassing against Israel. And they were coming against the Israelites and they had a towering champion named Goliath. Speaker Burns, his name was Goliath from Gath. Just the name, it strikes fear or should strike fear in someone's soul. And they're standing there. And Goliath was challenging the Israelites in every morning and every evening. He would come out and challenge the Israelites to send forth a champion. And he wanted a champion to come out for a single combat duel in the Israelites. If you read in 1 Samuel chapter 16, the Israelites faltered in the face of this formidable adversary until a young shepherd boy named David showed up. This young shepherd boy named David showed up to the scene and things began to change. You say, well pastor, why did things change when David showed up? Because David knew his God and he took action. The Bible tells us in Daniel chapter 11 verse 32 that the people that do know their God, they shall be strong and do exploits. They'll take action. And here this morning as leaders in this political arena, I know that you often face and confront challenges and adversaries at that time seem insurmountable. You're facing these things that happen in life and you're looking at these votes that come in and you're looking at legislative issues that come before your desk. And I know that sometimes it seems insurmountable, but here in this passage, although a young and seemingly ill equipped David shows up, he shows us something here. He shows us that true strength has not found in conventional power, but rather in the unwavering faith and reliance on the Lord our God. As political leaders, I know you frequently navigate the waters of complex issues and when doing so, it's imperative for you to remember that your strength ultimately comes from a higher authority. Contrary to what we may think at times, but no one that is seated on Capitol Hill from the governor down is here under their own authority. Almighty God has placed you where you are. Almighty God has placed you in the seats, in the positions, in the offices that you hold. No one present is here under their own power, but God has placed you here for such a time as this. See, you've not only been called, you've been chosen. God has chosen you to seat where you're seated. David here is you looking for Samuel, the king. He actually had some skepticism here and he was skeptical with young David, because David showed up and he was but a youth. And Saul even told David, he said, you can't go against this giant, because this giant is a man of war from his youth. And you're about a kid, you're about a youth yourself. And here David gives an audacious response to King Saul's skepticism. And that should mirror the courage needed in political leadership. He said in 1 Samuel chapter 17 verse 37, the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul of the lion and out of the Paul of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. David knew his God. David was reflecting on time's past where God had delivered him from the Paul of the bear and from the Paul of the lion. This was an unwavering trust in God's faithfulness. It was his trust in God's faithfulness and that should be a model for political leaders facing the seemingly impossible. Those things that seem to be challenges in your life, whatever that may be, in reminding that past victories, no matter how small the victory, no matter how significant the victory, it's a testament to God's ability to deliver you and to overcome the adversary. Here in this book of 1 Samuel chapter 17, this encounter with David and Goliath serves as a comparison between the battle of good and evil. It's the battle between light and darkness. Goliath here is the embodiment of tyranny and oppression. And it represents the daunting challenges that you face as political leaders many times. David, on the other hand, David was armed with faith in God, a sling and five stones, but he knew his God and he took action. That exemplifies the transformative power of God's chosen instruments. God's chosen instruments. That's you and I. You are God's chosen people. You are God's chosen instruments to sit where you are to do better things for this state. Move forward. Know your God and take action. As political leaders, I pray this morning that you reflect on this account of David and Goliath and that you've been called and chosen to embody the principles of wisdom, justice and moderation. In the face of the societal giants that we have, it's imperative that you draw inspiration from God's word. Draw your strength from God Almighty and strive to be instruments of positive change in our state. See, if you're not familiar with 1 Samuel chapter 17 here in this account, we see a victory. We see David has a victorious outcome. And this, the culmination of this account here with David's triumph demonstrates to us that victory is not contingent on our own physical strength has nothing to do with us, but on the spiritual fortitude and your reliance on God Almighty to get you through this account also shows a very significant connection between David as shepherd and deliverer. See, Jesus Christ in the New Testament is also often referred as the good shepherd just like David was a shepherd like David Jesus confronted the impossible relying on divine strength from God the Father. He relied on God's strength to overcome darkness, offering hope and redemption for humanity. As I close this morning, just a warning speaker burns, I'm a Baptist pastor, so we get to say that at least three times. So I guess, yeah, speaker says it's already been two. If speaker says it's been two, it's been two. That's my, I got one more. So this morning as I close, that's my last one. The account of David and Goliath offers you political leaders a timeless lesson that faith, courage and reliance on God Almighty can help turn the tides. It'll turn the tides in your life, and it'll turn the tides against those seemingly insurmountable challenges that you face on a daily basis. These experiences, they should help us to examine our faith and determine whether we have the genuine faith. The genuine faith that it takes to please God. I love how a W tozer put it. A W tozer said this. While it looks like things are out of control behind the scenes, there is a God who has not relinquished his authority. My God is the God of the universe. My God has not relinquished his authority. He's not voted in. He don't have to worry about being impeached. He is not kicked off of his throne. He is the king and creator of this universe. Do you know him? Members of the assembly as you lead with integrity. As you lead with integrity, seek the guidance of God Almighty. Because it's then and only then you'll find that true strength comes from Jesus Christ, the ultimate shepherd, Savior and sovereign. Would you stand with me as we pray? Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, as this moment here, this morning comes to an end for me, Father. I know that it is only the beginning of the day for the legislators before me. God this morning, a humbly bow, Father, and gratitude. Father, for the lasting lessons of your Word. Father, I recognize the importance of this passage here in 1 Samuel 17, God, and the profound significance that it has in our lives. And for the challenges faced by our political leaders. And Father, I recognize God and acknowledge the political arena God is sometimes tense and overwhelming with challenges. But Father, I pray that you would grant our leaders the wisdom to emulate David's boldness. God and have a faith that's rooted in you and reliance on you. Father, like David, and still in our leaders, God an unwavering trust in your faithfulness. And God, I pray that they would draw strength from past victories in their life, knowing that they are just a testament of your ability to overcome. And Father, as political leaders, God, I pray that they would strive to lead with integrity. God, and that they would be reminded that victory is not contingent upon physical strength, but spiritual fortitude and a reliance on you. Heavenly Father, be with our leaders this morning. Grant them wisdom, knowledge, and fortitude to face those challenges. And it's in the name that is above all names, and that's at the name of Jesus Christ, that I humbly pray. Amen. Would you follow in the pledge of allegiance with me? Pleasure allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Brother Donnie.

Welcome to the People's House. Members that completes our morning orders were moving on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 896? 896. House Bill 896 by Representative New with a 64th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 5 and title 19. The Fisher go to George Annotated relating to divorce. So, it's a reward for a process by which individuals may change their varied surname to a prior surname. Ms. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee Substitute. Representative New is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good morning colleagues. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about 896. You should have found this flyer on your desk and explained what's going on. I think a lot of us didn't know this was going on, but this bill will streamline the process for individuals who after a divorce is final. It did not change their name back to their maiden name or a birth certificate last name. And it will cut the cost. It will cut the time because you will not have to run an ad. And all the paperwork that goes with it. And these people just want to get their identity back. Currently, to get your maiden name back, first you go to Superior Court. You pay the fee in my county. It's $250. You run an ad in the paper for four weeks. Then you, for an additional fee, you go back to Superior Court, bring the documentation with you, then wait for the judge to hold a hearing, and then he'll sign off. I had a friend. It took her, it was almost $500. Took her over eight months to get this done to go back to her maiden name. A name she's always been associated with. This bill will allow you to go back to the Superior Court, change your name. You'll fill out the petition. They'll charge a nominal fee. There'll be no publication required. And the judge will be able to, with or without a hearing, restore a person's last name to the birth certificate name. It's cheaper. It's a fast turnaround. There's no ad required. And it updates an outdated law. If there are no questions, I will ask for your favorable consideration on this bill. The lady does have a couple of questions. Will you yield? I will yield. To your left, Representative Mary Francis Williams has a question. Representative Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General let you yield? I yield. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. It's one issue of many where court procedures just make it difficult to take care of some issues that just come up in life that shouldn't have to be handled with a lot of time and money and go into court. And I didn't change my, when I got divorced, I did not change my back to my maiden name because my boys asked me not to. But I was given that option by the Superior Court judge, but I can't imagine having to go through all the hoops that you mentioned if I had wanted to. So thank you so much for bringing this. Thank you. Isn't that our true? The lady knows of what she speaks. To your left, Representative Huggley has a question. Representative Huggley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General let lady yield? I yield. In the true that on this day that we're celebrating ERA, I appreciate the fact that you're bringing this bill and you're wearing the purple so that women can have the right to go back to the good name that their dad is gave them. No consequences are there. No, no consequences. The lady knows of what she speaks. I had help you on that one. Thank you, sir. You have another one if you don't mind. I'll yield. To your left, Representative Park Cannon has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I yield. What do our neighboring states do? Is it relates to this issue? That is a great question. I am not sure. But I can find out the answer and get it to you. Representative Gladney to your left also has a question. Kind of in the back. Towards your back. This is the General Lady Yield. I yield. Thank you very much for bringing this legislation. Does this also apply to a concealed weapons permit? Would it automatically change the last name? I didn't hear the first part. Say that again. Does it also apply to a concealed weapons permit? Would it also change on that legal permit as well? This is just to go back to your surname from a divorce. So I'm not sure where that lies, but it's not part of this bill at this time. But it could be continued to next year. Thank you very much. I'd be more than happy to work with you on that. Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you, Chief. Thank you very much. Sir, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here has done the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here has done the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members? All members have voted? I thank all members of voted. For what purpose does Chairman Collins rise? Former Minister Enkory, Mr. Speaker. Stature inquiry. Has it not true that this always cost me a lot of money when the next wife went back to a maiden name? The gentleman's so state sounds like he has some experience there. For what purpose does representative Sharper rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it true that we may should allow people to keep their name while they're married for five years before they change their name? I'm not sure about that. I don't think I'm getting involved in that when that sounds personal. So with that, Mr. Clerk, I thank all members of voted. All members of voted so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 896, the Yees, 167, the Nays are zero. This bill, having receded, was at Constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 904? House Bill 904 by reference to the advance of the 133rd, and now this will be entitled to enact. Proceed to be a title to amend titles 810, 3643, and 46 of the EFCHCOTA George Anatetti relating buildings and housing's commerce and trade, local government, professions and businesses. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Ken Vance, a gentleman from Millageville, is recognized to present the bill. Members, please give the member and the well your attention. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow legislators, I present to you House Bill 904, the absolute, unsexyous bill you will vote on this session. It has to do, let me give you just a minute, worth a history. Back in the 80s, the plumbers, electricians, HVAC people, low-voted electricians, and utility contractors were all separated, and in the 80s they were all put into one bowl for licensing purposes. Each of them had their own rules. They did not coordinate them. They just put them all together, which is what has been operated on since the late 80s. I have with you today something that's taken me a little over a year to do, and that's putting all these together in a reasonable form to add some clarity to this law. 8% of the text changes are to correct grammar, reorganize the document structure, and as I said add clarity. It updates a few items such as names like changing from consultant engineer to professional engineer. It expands the qualifications of electrical inspectors that can serve on the electrical contractors board from the sole person titled Chief Electrical Inspectors. It defines who is qualified to install medical gas in your hospitals. It better defines what constitutes advertising and the qualifications of who can provide these contract services. It addresses the changes in advertising technology to include social media. It changes continuing education from a maximum of four annual hours to a minimum of four annual hours that can be done online. It adds a grace period to find and replace the company's licensed agent, which each company has to have in case of death. It changes that to 60 days. If people are working on a job, then they have 60 days to get those license holders in order. It may be a family member, it may be someone who already has those licenses in place in order for that business to continue. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to have to answer any questions. And I... Gentlemen, please ask your support. Gentlemen, has no questions. I yield the will. Mr. Speaker. You're very... That's a very thorough and comprehensive, hence the bill, and you were right. It's not sexy. So we'll move on. Is there an objection to the previous question being in order? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair here is none, and the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee? What was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose does Representative Kelly rise? Mr. Speaker, after that explanation, is it apparent to you as it is to me that the former colonel of the state patrol has been directing the former executive director of posts on how to present a piece of legislation? It's pretty clear to me by what I wasn't going there. I'm having to live with both of them. Good luck to you. He's right behind you. Have all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, when you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 904, the yeas are 168. The nay is won. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? The House Bill 1077. House Bill 1077 by reps of Cooper, the 45th, and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 10 to Title 49. The official code of Georgia and attend every leg in the Georgia Board of Health Care Workforce. So it's created a grant program to provide funding to eligible institutions for additional behavior health workforce training positions. This bill has been referred to the committee. Public and community health, that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair, ladies, Chair and Cooper, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the House. A rise today to bring you House Bill 1077. Just like I always say, hospitals do not treat patients, doctors treat patients, and the same goes for the people that treat mental illness. And we are desperately short of individuals that are qualified to treat the mentally ill people across our state. And just like we have had programs to help physicians repay their student loans, that is what House Bill 1077 does. It has got a list of people, psychologists, social worker, professional counselors, marriage and family therapists, and others that the board might decide that are desirable and needed to treat mentally ill people across our state would be eligible as they do their year of internship and a qualified and certified program. These programs don't just require a college degree, then there are various years of internship with each one of them. So basically what it does is that while they are in those programs they can apply for loan repayment. The best part of the bill is that as they treat Medicaid patients, there is a big incentive for them to take them. So the best part of our problems that we have is across our state there are not people to treat patients that have insurance and there are certainly less patients, people to treat people that are on Medicaid. So if they will agree to take Medicaid patients, there is an incentive for the gate to get more money to pay off their loans. And the more Medicaid they pay, the more the reimbursement they get to pay off their loans. That will help us because especially our Medicaid population in rural areas is very high. And so if they will work with these patients, that will be a very big plus for our state and for citizens of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I would ask for your favorable consideration. And if there are no questions on House Bill 1077 and if there are no questions, I'll yield the well. You have a couple of questions or? I'll take one or two, Mr. Speaker. To your left, Representative Kinnerd has a question. Okay. Is the lady yield? Yes. I will. Hypothetically, if there's someone who's getting their masters in social work and they go work for one of our CSB's, will they qualify for this repayment plan? As they are filling the requirements for their internship? Yes, they would. Thank you. I'll take one more question, Mr. Speaker. Okay. Chair Lady Dempsey has a question to your. Yes. I will. Thank you so much. So is it not true that in our Georgia, the number of reports involving symptoms of anxiety or depressive order or at a high level? Or at a higher rate, currently, than the national average? The lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I yield well and once again, ask for a favorable consideration of House Bill 1077. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here has none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair has none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. We'll vote no. We'll vote no. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented bird rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true this is a Bernie Sanders' plan to pay off student loans in order for the government to influence the free market? I'm not sure about that, but I'm sure the lady has a strong opinion for what purpose is represented bird chat rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that suicide is a second leading cause of death among people 10 to 14 ages 10 to 14? And this bill will help to rectify that issue we have here. I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks. I'm sure he does. What purpose is chairman leveret rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that one in five adults probably including Bernie Sanders' experience mental illness? Since you mentioned it, I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks. All members voted. Good choice. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1077, the yeas are 165, the nays are two. This bill having to receive direct was at constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1072, 1072? House Bill 1072 by reps of Cooper, the 45th and others to be in title of NAC to a men article 10 of chapter 8 of Title 31 of the EF to Georgia and Ted Irving the Judg repository program. So it was revised definitions. This bill emin for the committee on health committee recommends a dis bill do pass. You were just up there, were you not? Let's see how you do on this one. Chair lady Sharon Cooper is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I mean you've heard me talk about this before. But once again, I want every, I know how many members were here in 2017. Raise your hands. How many? Okay, not that many. So for you, those of you, I want to give a special thank you and for new members and anticipation of your positive vote on this bill. I want to say thank you. This is about the special pharmacy that we have in Georgia called GoodPill.org. It reclaims medications that were going to be destroyed and then redistributes those to people in need across our state. At a very minute cost. Since 2017, listen up. They have filled 796,000 prescriptions that would have cost $64 million. And they have given those to people in need across our state at about a $6 of prescription for a 90 day prescription field. So $6 for 90 days. Something we can be very proud of. And please, it's called GoodPill.org. Please spread the word. And there's only about a five minute honor system to sign up and say you're needy. Please let your constituents know rather than go without their medications. Otherwise, these are medicines that would be destroyed. So what's happened? They are so successful. This is one of only two programs like this across the country. It's totally mail order. They are a regular pharmacy meeting all of the regulations is all for a pharmacy. And they have grown so much. They have now had to move again. And they needed some extra help. So here's why. The bill seems competent. It's not. It gives them two more technician, pharmacy technicians to work for them. Two more than usually a pharmacy can have. It also makes it very clear that there are people that are drug-reverse distributors that go around collecting these medicines that they need to work with our pharmacy and to try to help them get more medicines to donate. It clarifies that if a nursing home, a big nursing home, donates medicine, it's not host-selling. It also clarifies that this is not a pharmacy that carries all medicines. They do not do injectables. They do not do narcotics. And they don't have to be a full flexory. And one of the biggest things that does is since they're getting donated medicines, if they get a prescription for 500 milligrams of an antibiotic, and all they have is that drug in 250 milligram capsules, the pharmacists can make the decision to give two of those to equal 500 milligrams without calling the physician because they're doing this all over the state in the mail order. There was a section that somebody questioned about federal title X recipients. That is talking about working in the pharmacy, working with places that fall under that, like it would be a clinic like the federally qualified health programs in our state. I believe would work under federal title X, and so that they would work together to make sure that low income, you know, some of the lowest people get the medications. And that is an explanation of what this does. It's a cleanup. They need it very badly. And I would ask for your federal consideration of House Bill 1072. And please, patch yourself on a back for supporting where number one in the nation and other states are looking at this program. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I'll yield a well. You have a couple of questions. I'll take a couple, Mr. Speaker. Park Cannon to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes, I do. Does this company provide access to MIFA Pristone or MISA Prostle? I would doubt it. I wouldn't think that those would be medications that would normally be in reclaimed medications. But I don't think so. Representative Newton has a question to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just generally yield. I will yield. Thank you so much for this bill. It makes such a difference. I know that some part of this bill also expands what pharmacy texts in Georgia can do. Aren't they primarily used for inventory and still leaves the pharmacist open to do the counseling that's needed? That's what they are. They are used to help with inventory. And this pharmacy does not get medicines all delivered from them, all packed up. They may just get a box full of different medicines that have to be sorted. And that's why they need the extra text. Thank you for a bill that's going to help our pharmacists counsel people and spend more time with them and get it more affordably. Thank you, ma'am. Well, thank you very much. Now, this is all mail order. So they don't, on this case, they don't interact with patients at all except through the mail. But just having the extra hands to help them get medicines ready to mail out and everything is in been valuable. Mr. Speaker, I would ask for everybody's favorable vote on 10 House Bill 1072. And with that, I'll yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that you...

Here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Did you hear his none the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1072, the yeas are 165, the nay is one, the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10541054? House Bill 1054 by the way of the name of the bill, the 79th being titled the act to amend Code Section 40, 13, 2.1 of the official bill to George Anitetti relating to signature on citation required effective failure to sign exemptions for out of state drivers and electronic capture of signature. This bill I refer to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Here recognizes the lady from down in Clayton County, representative Yasmin Neill to present the bill. Thank you to the speaker, thank you to this body, I present to you House Bill 1054, the traffic signature bill. Originally this bill was designed to do a few things. Reduce negative encounters between law enforcement and citizens, save taxpayer dollars, free up law enforcement for more high priority calls, ensure that everyone goes home at the end of the night safely. This year alone, we've already started to embrace measures like the bill that one of our chairman presented designed to reduce fingerprintable offenses and step away from taking citizens to jail for lower level traffic offenses. This bill addresses the moment of conflict between citizens on the road and officers. Even when I was policing, there was a practice that we would use which would be to write refuse a sign on the ticket and send them on their way. Currently, the process is you get a ticket, you pay the fine, go to court, refuse a sign, you go to jail. What this bill does, get a ticket, refuse a sign, officer says no problem, writes refuses a sign on the ticket and sends them on their way. No more arguments, no more fights, no more instances of officers risking their lives in the tent to arrest someone for lower level traffic crimes. Everyone goes home safe at the end of the night. Now, you are not scot free. Refusing to sign means that you are agreeing to show up to court. You cannot prepay for the ticket and if you don't show, you will get a failure to appear by the judge and your license will be suspended. But that is the trade off but a worthwhile one instead of being taken to jail. Presently, if you get stopped in one part of the state, you can get a refuse a sign ticket if that's their policy and be on your way. On the contrary, if you get stopped in another part of the state that does not support that initiative, you can very well go to jail. This bill makes the practice uniform across the state. When it comes to saving taxpayer dollars, if I arrest you for a broken tail light versus if I take you to jail for murder, at the jail, the cost per head per person is the same. But it's not more. Those that support this bill feel that is the better practice to reserve the spots in the already overcrowded jails for the more heinous of crimes. Additionally, law enforcement heads have told me we prefer this bill. We do not want our officers on the side of the road arguing and fighting with citizens over traffic tickets if a citizen does not agree. Now, making almost saying you can still be arrested to clarify that. But this codifies into law a new practice that officers have that they can choose as opposed to the alternative. All this bill does is codifies into law the ability for law enforcement to right refuse a sign in the instances where the encounter citizen who does not agree with the charge and allows officers to take a safer route if they feel it would make them safe and get home at the end of the night. Thank you to my bipartisan co-sponsors, chairman Hitchens, Matt Reeves, representative Vance, representative Hokem. Thank you to my external supporters, the Georgia Sheriff's Association, Georgia Chiefs of Police who have provided a letter of support, Georgia Municipal Association, Association of County Commissioners, Georgia Department of Public Safety, who the state troopers have stated to me they prefer this option instead of taking people to jail. And with that, I also have the support of the Georgia Department of Driver Services which has confirmed you do not need to change a traffic citation, this will be no additional cost. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield for any questions. You have a couple of questions, representative Gladney to your left. How's the question representative Gladney? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General let you yield the well? I do. Is it not true that as a professional who has an health respect for law enforcement and for public safety and a mother of three adult sons, I have a lot of respect for this legislation and appreciate what it will do for my own piece of mind. To know that my sons have an alternative. Absolutely. Thank you, Madam. Thank you for your support. Thank you so much for bringing this legislation. Absolutely. Representative Kenner to your left has a question. Is the lady yield? I do. Isn't it true that all of our criminal justice resources are stretched thin because we have spent so much time and energy on low level offenses? We would be do better to redirect that to the more heinous crimes? Absolutely. Thank you, sir. The lady has one more and then one you'll need to take. Representative Reeves to your right right out in front of you. Does the General Lady from Clayton County yield? I do for my print. Thank you. Is it not true that this bill de-escalates conflict between law enforcement and criminal defendants on the roadside in a way that does not compromise public safety or guilt or innocence of the defendant and is merely a clerical matter? Absolutely. Thank you so much and that is the deed true. Thank you, sir. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. The lady yield for one more. Absolutely. I thank this gentleman knows a little bit about what we're talking about as the lady does as well. So we recognize Chairman Bill Hitchens for a question. The lady yield. Absolutely. Is it not true that Georgia has reciprocity with every other state in the country? And if you don't, if you sign the ticket and you don't come back, it's a misdemeanor, but you lose your driver's license. They come back and they give it to the Department of Driver Services and you lose your license until you, until the case is dueticated. Absolutely. And I know the gentleman absolutely knows what he speaks. You do a great job explaining the bill. I can tell you that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's more of a legislative common sense, but you're doing that. Thank you. I have no further questions. If I have no further questions, I appreciate your favorable consideration of House Bill 1054. Thank you, Representative Neal. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered to the Chair? Is there an objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, has none of the Committee's substitute is adopted? Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, has none of the Committee's agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. I have all members voted for what purpose is represented by the Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true there are many members of the Atlanta delegation who are thinking about Deacon Johnnie Holliman on this vote in support of this bill? Common sense. I think you're right. What purpose is represented? Holly rise. Father, may I inquire? State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that we are all just appreciative of the role that the sponsor of this bill has taken on, especially for individuals like Johnnie Holliman? So many who have given their lives unnecessarily and officers who have their lives being challenged, and we just appreciate the efforts of this sponsor of this bill. The sponsor has done a really good job. Is have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1054. The yeas are 156. The nays are 10. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 472. 472. Congratulations. House Bill 472 by reps and have crowed 118th and others being titled back to men. Chapter 2, title 47 of the EFIS to go to Georgia and intend to relay the employee's retirement system of Georgia. So it allows sworn law enforcement officers serving in in the commissioner and the deputy commissioner of the Motor Carrier Compliance Division and the Capitol Police Division of the Department of Public Safety to be eligible for regular retirement benefits. This bill I'm referring to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Clint Crowe is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues House Bill 472 currently in its form. What it does is it takes the Motor Carrier Compliance Division and Capitol Police Division of the Department of Public Safety and brings parity with respect to line of duty disability benefits with the other division of the Department of Public Safety. That being the uniform control division or Georgia State Patrol also DNR and GBI. Sorry. All have the same line of duty disability benefits and those benefits would be given to the Motor Carrier Compliance Division and Capitol Police Division as well. This bill originally would reduce their retirement age to 55 to match those others, but that's no longer part of this bill. So now all it does is bring parity to the line of duty disability benefits for the MCCD and Capitol Police Division. And with that Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen has no questions. All right. I'll yield the will. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none.

The families that are in sorrow at that time. Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? The lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you. Safe and respectful. I think that's it. All members vote of this so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas are on the passage of House Bill 907. The yeas are on 169. The nays are on.

Chairman makes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House Bill 1235, I bring to you today, which is just really clarifying language and establishing policy across our state. Late last year we had some discrepancies on how some taxing agencies or tag and title offices in local communities. We're handling the registration of these big 50 ton cranes that move up and down our highways to construction sites. So essentially what it does is it just defines cranes, that special mobile equipment, changes nothing else and allows them to receive a tag and a title after the purchase of that equipment. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker. We'll yield for any questions. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You had to ask for your favourable consideration of House Bill 1235.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you House Bill 1193. It's brought by the Department of Public Safety. This bill is abolishing the amber light permit that's been for decades that you had to apply for with the Department of Public Safety. This bill is now we're going to define who has to use the amber light permit instead of requiring them to apply for the amber light permit. For decades it's been costing $2 for one to apply for this permit, but the cost of doing businesses day in time with inflation and the U.S. Postal Services cost at about $5.25 for Department of Public Safety to produce and send this back to the individual. Now we're going to define who needs to use it when moving equipment, tow trucks around the state of Georgia, and this is what the bill says, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well.

House Bill 111 by reps in a percol, 169th and others to be entitled, an act to amend Article 2, Chapter 5, and Title 40 that Fisher go to Georgia and it's had a related issue with its expiration and renewal of driver's licenses. So as we've read that presentation of a driver's license in certain electronic formats, satisfies the requirements of possess the driver's license while operating motor vehicle. This bill ever referred to the committee on motor vehicles, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Clay Percol is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So I've ranked for you consideration, HP 1001. Sometimes it helps to know where these bills come from. So several weeks ago, I went home to check on my wife and farm after storms came through South Georgia. I got a further next morning to come up back up here to work and about halfway here realize that I'd left my billfold and my workbriches. I had a, you know, it's got my credit card, it's got my driver's license and everything, but I've got a credit card on my phone and I happen to think I've got a state issued digital driver's license on my phone. I and approximately 300,000 Georgians have this that I can actually use to go to Atlanta Heartsfield, get on the airplane and go to our nation's cap or anywhere in the world with just this digital license that is issued by the state of Georgia. This bill simply adds shall from may to take the ambiguity out of the law that the display of a state issued digital driver's license fulfills the state requirement to have a copy of your driver's license with you at all times. You have not considered to a search of the device. If you display this electronic license, I think it's a great bill and I'd love a green on it. And I'll yield a will. Thank you, sir. You have some questions. My bad. I'm sorry. Would you take a question? Absolutely. Yes, sir. I apologize to the members. Representative Nullowicz to your left has a question. Do you know when we'll have a bill where I can also use this at the publics when I need to purchase something or persuade them, convince them because they never believe that I'm over 18. And to the lady I absolutely agree with him. You need to carry your birth certificate along with you. Obviously. Representative Gamble to your right out front has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman here? Yes, sir. I do. On a more serious note. And I appreciate you bringing this bill. I plan to vote yes, but will you just confirm that it is not the goal to mandate any of our constituents or residents in the state to have a digital ID. And that is not the direction that this bill is trying to go in. Absolutely not. You're correct. Thank you. Representative Jasmin Clark to your left has a question. The gentleman will you yield? Yes, sir. I'll yield for one more. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Does this bill also allow for you to use a driver's license that you've like taken a picture of? No, ma'am. It has to specifically be the app. No, ma'am. It's got to be officially from the Department of Driver Service. So I have in the past. It's not the first time I've left my billfold in my other bridges. And so I have in the past. I have taken a copy of it, but that is not official. You need to go online to get the official copy in order to comply with this section. So, Mr. Speaker, I thank the members and I thank you. You had one more question. You're already Douglas has a question to children with yield. Absolutely. You're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. For us up here in the city for clarity. I understand that you said riches. Can you clear it up for us up here in the city? What bridges mean? So the gentleman from the coast probably will come and speak to the bill. He knows exactly what bridges are. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. I was just impressed you had more than one pair. That's all I cared about. That was a good stuff too. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered? Is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here's none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose is representative Jason Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. The speaker is it not true that the gentleman from the 169 left his billfold in his bridges because his wife really worth the bridges? I'm a bent man I bet with you all that one. For what purpose is representative glad to rise? Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry representative. Is that true that as the former director of motor vehicle registration services I am aware that this legislation will prove to be a very expedient process for the residents of the state of Georgia. I'm not sure if the committee will be able to use the key ask as an additional resource to acquire their registration in addition to possibly also getting their driver's license. I'm.

Through the ladies background, it allows her to be expert and have a very strong true opinion. So thank you for your inquiry. Thank you very much, sir. For what purpose is represented? Lisa Campbell rise. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that on this equal rights amendment day, in the times of many of our mothers, many women were not allowed to wear their breaches? And we're so excited today that we can wear our breaches and support this bill. I think lady knows we've established breaches are a good thing. So is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here has done the previous question. Is ordered is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here has done the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage? The bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. I got hung up on that breaches stuff. We already voted on that. I'm glad to educate all you city people about breaches. With that, all the passage of House Bill, clerk, needs to lock the machine. What time is it? It's dinner time. That's what time it is. It's not lunch time. All of the passage of House Bill 1,001, the yeas are 168. The days are 1 that Bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority as therefore passed. I said that pretty quick. I didn't need to say it, didn't I? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1150, 1150? House Bill 1150 by Remson of Collins, 71st to be entitled to amend Code Section 48, 73.1 of the fish go to Georgia, annotated relating the attempting of windows or windshields of motor vehicles. Those provide that fingerprints should not be obtained for offenses relating to operated motor vehicle when authorized levels of window or windshield. This bill I'm referring to Committee of Motor Vehicles. That committee recommends a disbile of do pass. Let's give our attention to the gentleman in the well, Chairman Collins, who's going present the bill, and I'm going to try to do the same, Chairman Collins, so I can keep up here. Chairman Collins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring to you today House Bill 1150. This was a bill that came to me from the Chairman of the Ag Committee. He made a phone call to me back in the interim and said that there was a piece of legislation we need to look at. It was simply that violators of the wind attempt law in our state, the Attorney General's Office had pushed this under a finger-pennable offense, probably four decades ago. Someone is pulled over and issued a traffic citation for violating the wind attempt laws in our state. They had to be fingerprinted. We talked to the Attorney General's Office and yes, that was the case. I don't know if it is jurisdiction in the state that was actually fingerprinting these violators. So, talking with the Sheriff's Association, we drafted some legislation and this just simply removes that as a fingerprintable charge here in our state. Very simple bill. It cleans up some language that need to be cleaned up. AG's office, you know, really didn't have an opinion on it. They didn't want to remove it from the fingerprintable offense list without legislation. So, ladies and gentlemen, here it is for your favorable consideration. I'll stand for any questions. That gentleman has a couple of questions. Chairman Parsons, so your left has a question. I think you're speaker. General Neal, yes sir. Just a question, isn't it? True that I didn't hear any of the testimony and the committee that came out of, I didn't hear any testimony one way or the other. But I respect the fact that the committee has come up with this decision to pass this with due pass recommendation. But isn't also true if you would take another question that I was. I did hear the presentation by the late Representative Calvin Hill of Cherokee County when he passed this bill that actually made that enough felony but a violation probably back 12, 14, 15 years ago at least. One that he in fact was in the among businesses he had was a business to install these but he still felt that having these window, what do you call it, the dime or whatever on them, was a serious enough issue that it should be a felony. In particular, protect law enforcement when cars vehicles are pulled over and they can't even see who's inside or what they have. They have a weapon or whatever. I would just ask, I mean, my question I guess is, isn't it strange? She's the truth. I find it strange that somebody who is trying to hide their identity to begin with, we would now allow them to hide their identity further but not even fingerprinting them if they're actually guilty of this offense. Well, thank you for the question. We're not changing the fact that it's still a misdemeanor. It's always been a misdemeanor. There's no felony charge there. Gentlemen, you have one other question. If you do, I guess I'm still not clear though why that somebody is trying to avoid being identified even to see what's in their car. I still will say a good, if you could tell me, it's plain to me a good reason though why we should not fingerprint them. I guess I'm just missing that. What the connection is, why they should not be fingerprinted if you could. Well, that's my final. I can only speak for my opinion to my friend. It is a misdemeanor charge. It's not a felony charge. To be quite honest with you, in my opinion, and this is my opinion alone, these charges are not being done correctly if you're not fingerprinting people. I don't know any jurisdiction in the state that's going to take in someone for a misdemeanor violation to fingerprint them. That's one of this legislation before you hear today. Gentlemen, you yield for another question to your right. Chairman Dickie. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's Chairman Yield. To my friend, yes. Thank you for bringing this bill. And thank you for that explanation you just gave Chairman Parsons. That's exactly why our local sheriffs contacted me during the year to bring this bill. It was having to take someone in for fingerprinting was a deterrent to writing these tickets, try to get for wind attending it. So I think removing the fingerprinting will encourage our local law enforcement to do a better job in enforcing this misdemeanor that happens. So if I can for the bill, I think it'll be a improvement that the sheriffs won't this bill. Like you. Absolutely. Gentlemen, ask no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, I would yield the will and ask your favorable consideration to House Bill 1150. Has nothing to do with bridges. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none? The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here is none? Report the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1150, the yeas are 168. The nays are zero. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Members, if I can have your attention for one second, I want to introduce you to a visitor to this capital and to our state. This President Pro Tem of Nevada Senate Senator Pat Spiriman is here. She, her district, includes the site of the Super Bowl. And she makes about as much as we do so she couldn't afford that. Thousands of dollars worth of. So we're welcome to Atlanta. Welcome to Georgia. We're glad to have you and we appreciate your service as well. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1183 1183? House Bill 1183 by reps an of density of the 13th and others to be in title next to men part three of article 16 in chapter two, title 20. The official go to Georgia and Tate relating to student health and elementary and secondary education. So it's required local school systems provide certain information to parents and guardians of students in grade six through 12 on type one and type two diabetes. This bill haven't referred to the committee on public health. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair Lady Dips, he's recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know we're all getting hungry. So I'm going to go a little bit quick here, but I want you all to know how important this is. It will be important for each of you when you go home that we did this actually. HV 1183, the purpose of this is to increase awareness about type one and type two diabetes. There are now simple blood screening tests that family members and relatives of someone with type one diabetes can take to determine their risk of developing the disease during their lifetime. By raising parental awareness of type one diabetes, we can help mitigate those risk of dangerous complications that often are present at the time of diagnosis like diabetic keto acidosis or DKA. Should this legislation help prevent one case of DKA, DKA in a child, a sometimes fatal but always costly life altering complication? Our work is well done here this year. Type two diabetes is also a consequential change for families in our healthcare system, presenting at a younger and younger age. That detection will help us save lives and help people prevent having a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure or blindness. HV 1183 amends the current 6 through 12 education code adding that if a local school board of education provides health issue information, it will also provide information about type one and type two diabetes. The materials are non-copy-rided and available for download free of charge. Mr. Speaker, that is this measure. If there are any questions I will take them. If not, I will yield the well and ask everyone to please support it. Lady has a couple of questions. Representative Howard, to your left all the way in the back. Thank you. Dr. Jordan Howard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? I do. Isn't it true that early detection of diabetes, especially in school age children, will also lower the impact of kidney failure, especially in its effect on the African American community? The gentleman knows of what he speaks, it absolutely will. Does the lady further yield? Yes, I do. Isn't it also true that there is a clinical study taking place at Augusta University to detect a new gene that points to the early detection of kidney failure? I know that you know all about that study. Thank you. Representative Barnes has a question, the lady will you? Yes. Representative Barnes. Do you have a question? Yes. Is it not true that tight one diabetes is a genetic condition that exists sometimes from birth? Yes, it does. So the earlier we can detect that, the better. Thank you. Thank you. Representative Jasmine Clark, to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? I do. Thank you for bringing this bill just to clarify, when we talk about risk factors for type one diabetes, since it is genetic, would that be what is presented in that material? I'm just curious as to what the risk factors for type one are, because it's very different than type two. So the information that we will be asking to be distributed is to be very thorough. It's actually on the CDC website, so they will be downloading it from there, making it available on their school websites. It is just simply to educate as much as we possibly can and encourage people to be tested and follow that. Thank you. Thank you. Lady Hasn't up for the questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable support. Good job. Lady Has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1183. The A's are 167. The NA is one. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10691069? House Bill 1069 by Representative Cannon of the 172nd and others to be entitled back to amend Code Section 485, 7.5, the Fisher quoted George Anitettid relating to the assessment of Standing Timber Penalty for Fellow to timely report an effective reduction of property tax digest and supplemental assessment. This bill then referred to the Committee on Ways and Means that Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Gentlemen from down in South Georgia, Maltry Georgia, representing Chas Cannon, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I won't be as long as I was yesterday and I won't mention the word, bridges. I actually just did, but I bring you House Bill 1069 LC500692. This is a Department requested bill that allows the Georgia Forestry Commission to have access to PT-283T form upon request. This form is officially titled Report of Timber sale or harvest and it's the state form provided to county tax assessors after the completion of a timber harvest. One of the roles of the Forestry Commission is to investigate timber theft and the commission uses this form to PT-283T form to ensure that the timber harvest data that's reported to a local tax assessor's office to include their revenue and compensation for the timber matches up with the information provided to the landowner. This is a basic checks and balance policy. Normally, the PT-283T form is only disclosed to local tax officials. So the Forestry Commission has to retrieve this data through a subpoena or a court order. However, local tax assessors have indicated that an official request by the Forestry Commission would certainly streamline the process and make it more efficient. So again, Department requested bill, streamlines of timber investigation process and passed unanimously out of ways and means. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield for questions. You have a question to your right. Representative McDonald knows a lot about timber. He wants to ask a question. Mr. Jimmie Nielsen. No. I yield. With this bill, will there be a report that will be issued on how many trees that this killed to add five words into this bill? No. Well, I was going to ask you the yield well, but we will, now this gentleman does know something about this subject. Chairman Corbett, to your right, has a question of if the gentleman will yield. I will yield, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, yes, sir. Is it not true that trees are one of the best renewable resources that the state of Georgia has? So if we use a few trees here, we replace them more than we cut down every day. Gentlemen, knows of what he speaks. I'm not sure about those two questions, but gentlemen, has no more questions. Speaker, I yield the well. Good move. They certainly planted a seed in your mind and you yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered, the chair has done the previous question, is ordered? Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair has done the report of the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed, will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1069, the Yez are 167, the nay is one, this bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1041? 1041. House Bill 1041 by Representative Stevens, the 164th and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 5755, will the official code of Georgia annotate it? Mr. Clerk. To be titled an act to amend Code Section 50-7S55, the official code of Georgia annotated relayed in creation of the Savannah, Georgia Convention Center Authority. This bill has been referred to the Committee on Economic Development and Tourism that Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman of Tourism and Economic Development is recognized to present this bill, Chairman Ron Stevens. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring to you House Bill 1041. This bill is for the Savannah Convention Center, but looks familiar to you. This is exactly what we did for the World Congress Center to allow those folks to expand. The Savannah Convention Center opened 24 years ago and since then it has generated millions of dollars in economic activity and local lodging taxes, I might add. The bill to my so successful that legislature and the governor put $276 million in expansion doubling its size. The expansion should be complete later this year. The Convention Center is a state-owned building, owned state-owned land and is governed by a state authority and is managed by another state authority, the World Congress Center. This brings me to House Bill 1041. The bill does two things. First, it raises the bonding capacity from $50 million to $400 million, exactly like the World Congress Center. Many of you have seen the new 975 rooms sign a hotel built next to the World Congress Center and expand for the new expanded Convention Center. It will reach its full potential if we can do the very same thing. This bonding capacity will be used to fund capital repairs and improvements of the existing 25-year-old building on the campus includes Riverwalk, for those of you that saw the cave in, includes Riverwalk in the building on the Savannah River. The bonds will be sold by the Convention Center Authority and they will be secured by our hotel Motel Tax Revenue and Cash Reserves. The second thing that it does is establish its condemnation powers, important for only public property, not for private property. Other state authorities have this, like if you will, the World Congress Center has this in stone mountain and we were surprised that we didn't have it as well. This bill sponsored by all six of the Child of the County delegation members and passed out a committee unanimously and Mr. Speaker I'll ask for unanimous consent that you guys vote for the same bill that we have passed for the World Congress Center so that we can move this forward and get us a hotel on the island. I'll answer any questions. General, I have a couple of questions. I'll represent the Al Williams. I think you know where he sits. I recognize for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We'll do the gentleman yield. To my dean, yes sir. Is it not true in spite of it not being in midway, it will be a great economic advantage to the entire region, particularly because of a little plant just west of you. I said not so. The gentleman knows of what he speaks and it is the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Mr. Chairman, you yield for one more. Yes sir. Chairman Petrie, to your left. I'll sit pretty close together but go ahead. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'll ask for a question. We're good for in yield. Yes sir. Chairman, is it not true that the funds to operate the convention center are paid for by the county and the five different cities of Chatham County through hotel and motel taxes? The gentleman is correct and thank you for the question. That is also, these are revenue bonds. They're backed by the very revenue that the gentleman just spoke of. Mr. Speaker I'll ask for your favorable consideration on this bill and I'll yield the bill. The gentleman's yield to will. You all of y'all have asked questions and spoke brought some clarity. So thank you for that. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here's done, the previous question is ordered? Is there an objection to agreeing to report to the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here's done to report to the committee? Is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Of all members voted, all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1041. The yeas are 161, the nays 1, the bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 994. House Bill 994 by reps on a pile of the 33rd and others to be entitled to amend Title 51-52 of the fish go to Georgia annotated ruling the torts and waters of the state ports and watercraft respectively so as to revise liability for the negligent operation of a vessel. This bill ever referred to the committee on insurance that committee recommends a dispelled do pass by committee substitute. Mr. Chairman, this bill would complete the rules calendar. You can do that. It will be a first but we will give you a chance. Chairman Powell is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. I bring you this afternoon in House Bill 994 from a fellow who lives up on the lake. I'm pretty close to the recreational industry and then Georgia, I want to preface this and Georgia, recreation means a lot. We've got a lot of beautiful lakes in this state and none more beautiful than Lake Harlow. But the marinas in this state lease boats to those folks who are lucky enough not to be able to afford their own boat. What we have is a situation in this state that the boat rental business and the marinas are being put out of business because of the liability. There's one of three states that has bicarious liability to the delivery service at Rents of Boat. Now, you would think that those people, the operators at least the boat would be liable for their own errors if there's a toward or something that happens, but no, the owner of the boat is one that bears full responsibility. This is about putting these folks out of business. As I said, we're one of three states that has this and we're making a change. I thought this was going to be an easy bill. I said, you know, when I was brought to this, I said, well, what we'll do is we'll just treat it like car rentals at the airport. You know, well, that was a mistake because it came to mind that that no insurance company offers spot insurance in the state of Georgia, kind of an interesting process. So what we've done, we've eliminated bicarious liability. We've required that the marinas will have a 250,000 for an individual and $500,000 cumulative total on incidences. They'll be responsible for any liability that's caused by their emissions. Say a faulty boat, whether they know or didn't know, they've got to check out the operator to be sure they don't rent it to a bunch of college boys showing up at the lake with a pickup truck full of beer. They got to be sure that these people, if they qualify, they need to have that motor safety course. If our Williams shows up, they know that's a no-no right off the bat. So you know, it's basically a common sense bill and they have to post, clearly post, to the people who lease a boat that you're responsible for your own liability. That Mr. Speaker is what this does and I think that's about the quickest I can be and it'll be glad to answer questions. Gentlemen, have a question. I think Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it sound familiar? Yes, ma'am. So does anything in this bill require the boat operator? So the person renting or leasing the boat to have some type of insurance like what you would with a, when you rent a car? I don't think they can get insurance. We went...

through Chairman Tarvin subcommittee, Chairman Lundson's committee. You know, we thought that folks might be able to, maybe they can adapt their homeowner's liability with an umbrella coverage, who deaths between them and their insurance companies. So there's a demand? But as far as a spot insurance, it's not offered right now. So there's a gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. So if the person operating the boat does something, and it is deemed that it is their fault, then they're on the hook for maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to a boat, or maybe tens of thousands of dollars of damage to a boat. And there's no way to ensure them and their operation in the state of Georgia, right now. I think you're further ahead. Just a quick one. I'll write about that. Thank you. And I would be remiss if I didn't say there's some thanks to give, I'd mention the two Chairman's Tarvin and Lundson, but I also have to give credit to GTLA, the trial lawyers. They actually stood in and agreed with the insurance industry that this is quite the phenomena. Shot me to death to tell you the truth. So I say kudos to them, but this is about saving an industry in the state that brings an untold amount of revenue and recreation to the state of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have one more question, Chairman Deloge, to your right. Has a question, your last question. To your extreme right, Chairman Deloge. The gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that with this bill, one that rents a boat is in the same condition as far as requiring insurance as one who owns a boat? There's no requirement in the state of Georgia for a boat owner to have liability insurance. Is that true, Mr. Chairman? That is true. There's only two. There's only two required insurancees in the state. And that's liability on a car and workers' comp if you got over three employees. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, I thank you. And I thank the good folks in here for their favorable support for a recreational industry and go have lunch. Thank you for presenting the bill, Mr. Chairman. As you did the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 994, the yeas of 163, the neyes won this bill, haven't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. For what purpose does Chair Lady Houston rise? We will see what we can do about that. you are a huge proponent of the voting industry and you have one of the most best vote manufacturers in this country in your district. And is it not true in my district? I have the largest vote building industry under one roof in the world. It's a lady so speaks in states I know is true. It's big. I know that. I've been there.
