TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you Mr. Chairman and Senator, it's my reading of this beginning with the respect
of the questions that were asked previously, that if it determinations made by the EPA
that a manufacturer knowingly withheld, concealed, misrepresented, destroyed, material information
regarding human health risks, that the earlier part of the bill would not apply.
So any concern that the manufacturer may be have this information be aware of this information that's specifically excluded from the legislation that you're presenting here today is my understanding that's correct, correct.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I just want to make sure I'm understanding Mr. Senator.
If you're saying the companies are not allowed to hide the truth or mislead and I understand
that part, but how do they tell the truth if they don't warn?
I mean, you know, it's one thing for someone to ask you and then you tell the truth because
you've been asked.
But I guess it doesn't this sort of prohibit or discourage warning people by giving
this sort of not-immunity but certain protections.
Well, first of all, they're going to do research themselves as the owner or manufacturer of
the product.
They're not going to, they know the consequences, they're not going to put anything on the
marketplace that can cause harm.
Number two, EPA is also going to be testing it with their 500 scientists and researchers,
and they're going to do research on that.
So I mean, it may take 13 years for them to verify that the product is safe and okay
to put on the shelf for people to use.
So again, if they fail to warn about something,
if the science is not there to back it up,
then they should not be held liable for that.
There has to be science and research
to prove that there's something that causes that problem.
And if they don't have the research or science to back it up,
then it's just hearsay.
But when you say there, are you talking
about the pesticide company or the EPA?
Talking about the consumer or whoever's concerned
about the issue that they have.
Okay, whoop, appreciate.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Senator Watson, for bringing the bill.
Is there anywhere in here that says
you cannot bring a claim for wrongful debt?
Yes.
Is there anywhere in this bill that allows,
or disallows the ability to bring a personal injury claim?
Yes, sir.
All right.
In the event that I think our colleagues
are mentioning that there is a determination by the EPA
that the manufacturer was in bad faith hiding something
that would hurt somebody.
Would they be covered under this bill?
No.
Thank you, Mr. Senator.
OK.
Chairman Martin.
Senator, and the leader covered my question on line 42, the car belt for knowingly will withhold information.
Let me see if I can provide a scenario and you tell me if it would apply.
If there's a product out there, the EPA has approved the label and everything's going fine.
Later on at some point they found out that that product caused something and nobody knew about it
You say that happened in 2020 and in 2025 2025 that label that product caused something that nobody knew about
And it injured somebody they would still be able to bring a suit for that injury or haven't forbid that fatality
Or any damages, right?
But they wouldn't be able to bring a suit for failure of Warren because they didn't knowingly conceal or misrepresent
Correct. So the difference there is this does not isn't not true. This does not
Keep the company does not reward the company for being dishonest with the public, but instead
Doesn't penalize them for not being able to look into the future. Correct. Thank you. Yep
Okay, that exhausts all the questions I see here.
Especially Evans, I have a proposed amendment I think that I got when we walked in and I think
that's yours and it hasn't been printed because we just got it and normally what we'd
like to do is get these at least 24 hours before so we can have a chance to get them printed
and get it to it.
But out of an abundance of caution, if you want to explain it, if you can do it shortly
We'll hear from me on that. Okay. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And not knowing that we were going to meet today
I I didn't have any ability I didn't didn't foresee that I would need to get this and this bill just passed out of its
Committee of purview yesterday morning at 8 a.m. Okay. I have been working with
At least the author in the house and and some folks in the hall with the amendment
So I do apologize for for not having it here
But it's one page. I think it could be printed pretty quickly, but it just simply states that
But this will be a regulatory that the amendment just makes clear that it doesn't take out the common law, negligent failure to warn claim that consumers may have, recognizing that this bill requires the steps for a company to make sure they're doing their regulatory compliance and reporting to the EPA.
But if they know something and they've told the EPA but they haven't told their consumers,
I don't think it's right that we cut off the consumer's ability to hold the industry
accountable for not sharing that information with them because the EPA could sit on it
for six months, for a year, for two years.
We just don't know and that's true with any federal administration, Democrat or Republican,
they are slow.
Industry is faster and if industry is going to continue to sell their product, they should
have a duty to inform consumers the same as they have the duty to inform the government and that's
all the amendment does it would not step on any regulatory aim that we're seeking here and I'm
simply asking Mr. Chairman and members of the committee that this amendment be able to be considered
on the floor. I'm not asking this rules I mean I'd love it if the committee wants to pass it in
the men the bill in here but I'm simply asking that the members have a chance to exercise their
right as members of legislators to make amendments to a bill on the floor and
complying with the way you have to do that as a modified structure bill.
Appreciate the consideration. Okay well it's offered here in rules so we're
gonna vote on it right here in rules right now. Those in favor of adopting the
amendment say aye. Those opposed no no no's have it. It's not adopted. Okay now on
Senate Bill 144 is presented without the amendment.
Do I have a motion on that that that be a meant or to be added to a supplemental calendar
that we'll do for today when we go back in.
Have a move in a second in the opposition.
There is an objection all those for putting them on supplemental calendar today say aye.
Any opposed?
They are opposed.
It's on thank you.
Mr. Chairman, and compliance with House rules
we file a minority report on House Bill 144.
Could you clarify to ensure that that will be recognized?
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
You
