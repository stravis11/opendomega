All members voted this so Mr. Clerk will you lock the machines? Doork keepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today, or he brought a whole bunch of good preachers today, I'm going to just tell you. We're going to let him talk about that in a second, but our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 71st House District, representing Judd Howard, representing Diff Howard. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It gives me great pleasure today to introduce our pastor for the day. Randy Barnhart graduated from Atlanta Christian College, now point university in 1976. He went on to get his masters from a manual Christian seminary and a law degree from Georgia State. Randy served a senior pastor with his wife, Wendy, at first Christian Church of Carrollton for the last 12 years and they have two children, Andrew and Benjamin. Wendy is here today along with Randy's brother Steve and we have another preacher, my dad, Alan Howard, and my mom, I'm Ron to Howard here today. And if you indulge me just a second, I'll just like to share that I love that we use the term pastor for the day. Growing up a preacher's kid, I watched my dad live out the definition of pastoral ministry. While he had an office at the church, you'd more likely find him in Emory, Piedmont, or hospitals across this state spending the day with a family when they're in their greatest time of need. Over the years I've heard him say that everyone has a preacher except a preacher and that was no more true than in 2012 when my mom and dad were struck by a drunk driver and resulted in my dad losing his leg and some other injuries that ultimately led him to retire from the church. He had been at the church for 35 years. So over the last several years he's had to have several more procedures and the biggest blessing is having Randy and Wendy at our family side in the hospital. And it means so much when you have that pastoral minister. So today it gives me great privilege to welcome the preacher's preacher and my friend Randy Barnhart to the people's house. Thank you. Speaker Burns, thank you for the invitation. Representative Howard and every member of the house. We thank you for your great service to the state. We don't take lightly the sacrifice, the miles you log, the hours away from family, from personal business, the criticism, the stresses of the work. And even though Americans love to play, get the politician, we really do respect you and we're grateful. And we know that we owe a debt of gratitude. The great true at Kathy is quoted as saying, how do you determine who needs encouragement? He paused and then he answered, it's the person who is breathing. The one who is alive, everyone, everyone, the great Fred Kratik who taught preaching for years over at Canlar at Emory. Had a couple of exercises that he talked about doing when he was getting ready to speak to a group. And one of them, he would write at the top of a single piece of paper, what's it like to be? What's it like to be? What's it like to be a widow of 61 years forced back to work at the night shift at international paper because nobody was ready for the debate. For the departure of her husband. What's it like to be a single mom of four in the cab? Who's got two, there's still endipers and two that are growing faster than she knows what's to do. What's it like to be the dad of a large family in rural West Georgia who drives 30 to 45 minutes to show up at Southwire and work the night shift? I love these exercises because it takes your eyes off of yourself. It takes your eyes off of what you're going to say and makes you think about people who might hear it. Another one of his exercises and I love this one is he would do the same thing, you know, right at the top of a single piece of paper, something where he can write his bullet points again. And this question was what I know about those I do not know. What do I know about them? You might think, well, if I don't know them, I don't know anything about them. But, you know, when you think about it, you really do. You know a lot about every single person you meet. For instance, I'm just now meeting if you will, some of you. And I know that everybody in here has fears. Everybody in here carries battle scars and has pain. Everybody here wants community. Everybody here wants to love and be loved. I mean, we're made that way. But somewhere on that list of what I know about those I do not know, I think near the top, we ought to put they need encouragement. They need encouragement because we all do. I mean, you can bet on this no matter who you meet, wherever you go, whatever their situation is in life. Every person you come across needs a good encouraging word. And maybe you can't solve their problems. And probably you can't. But you can give a little extra fuel for the journey. You can help somebody stand up a little straighter. And so I was just thinking, whoa, I've never been in this place before. So I'm a tourist today. But what would encouragement look like in active government amongst those who govern and who have real differences. And sometimes differences very difficult to work through. I mean, what would encouragement look like? Well, here's what I think. I think it would be people who are more concerned about the people than about the problems. And I know somebody said, we've got things to do. We've got issues. We've got to address. We've got hurdles. We've got to get over. I understand that. But I think encouragement begins when you're willing to be more concerned about the people than about the problems. And I don't mean the people out there, although yes, of course, your representatives. I mean, the people in here with whom you work with whom you struggle and fight. It's hard to be concerned about people. It's hard to be encouraging when all you're thinking about is the issue, the win, the legislation, the end result. Because you're dealing with human beings. I love that story. Following the assassination attempt of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Republican President Ronald Reagan, Democrat Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill. He was among the first, if not the first, that Reagan let come to visit him in George Washington University Hospital. When O'Neill entered Reagan's room, he walked over to the bed, held both of Reagan's hands in his own and said, God bless you, Mr. President. Reagan, you know, still groggy, tubes coming out everywhere, bags hanging all over the room, you know what it looks like. But when he saw Tip O'Neill, they said Reagan lit up like a Christmas tree. And he smiled and he said, thank you so much for coming, Tip. And then holding just one of the President's hands. He got down on his knees beside the bed and he said, I'd like to pray for you, Democrat Speaker. Very Republican President. And he used 23rd Psalm. And when he was done, they said that O'Neill stood up, kissed Reagan on the forehead. Now, I'm not suggesting that every meeting here end with a kiss across the aisle. Although if you do that, will you take pictures? I'd like to see it. But you could do a whole lot worse in this room. You could do a whole lot worse for the entire state of Georgia by being more concerned about the people than you are about the problems. Imagine this house being known as the single most encouraging place in the entire state of Georgia. More than the happiest first grade classroom. This was and became known for the most encouraging place. And well, yes, disagreements will exist and great battles still fought and ideas debated and outcomes sought. And at the same time, imagine this being a place where you literally can't walk down the hallways or sit in a committee without somebody sharing you a personally encouraging word. Without you finding somebody, at whom you can smile and share a word of kindness, if this were that sort of place, I mean, what impact could it have? Not in the immediate, but long term. If this was the culture, the single most encouraging place in all the state of Georgia, what would that do eventually, eventually for that widow at international paper or the young mom and cab or the daddy fighting to keep food on the table in rural West Georgia? Or what would it do for the committee chair who just lost spouse or the representative who got bad news from his physician? Now, if this place, if every member of this house decided to care more about colleagues than about the concerns of the day and they're important and you have to deal with them and know you will. But what if you became more concerned about colleagues than the ideas before committee? I mean, might it have an impact on the state? I mean, you lead. You shape. I mean, might it have an impact in the people of the state of Georgia? Just remember everyone, everyone, everybody needs encouragement. And now to soul in this place, from the speaker to the security guard, from the custodian to the committee chair who does not need a word of encouragement. The prophet Isaiah said this. Encourage the exhausted and strengthen the feeble. Ter, tell fearful souls courage, take heart. God is here right here on this way to put that put things right to redress all wrongs. He's on his way. He will. He will save you. Listen, when I said thank you, I meant it. You do remarkable work here and you do have great impact. You cause hope to rise and we all thank you. So I want to leave you with this word of encouragement. And not all of it will sound exactly like encouragement, but it is, I believe, comes from the late Tim Keller. And he says this. I'm so sinful that Jesus had to die for me yet so loved and valued that he was glad to do it. Or said more inclusively, we're more sinful and flawed than we ever dared believe yet at the same time we're more loved and accepted. We ever dared hope. So let me if you will please pray for you. And for the great state of Georgia. Heavenly Father, I thank you every, for every woman and man in this room for their willingness to endure on behalf of others. For every night at home given up an every dollar of sacrifice given over. So God each one here that they might individually and collectively be an encouragement to us all by being an encouragement. To each other in radical fashion. We ask this in the name of him who gave his life for us all. Even Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Would you join me in the pledge. I pledge allegiance. I thank you. Thank you, brother Randy for those words. Thank you for encouraging us with those words and we appreciate that. Members, doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors. Members, you can join brother Randy in the south any room. Have a photo and thank him for his service to us today. Thank you. Thank you.

Chairman Parish. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, today is Community Health Center's Day here at the Capitol. I know many of you are familiar with them. The Community Health Center system is set up to improve access to quality, affordable health care in Georgia for all Georgians. For the new members that may not be aware of this, this House over the years has been a leader in working with the Community Health Centers in trying to promote access to quality health care all over this state. On your desk, you'll find a map that will give you an outline of where the Community Centers are located. And you can see the ones that are in your district. There are 36 Health Center organizations. There are all nonprofits 501C3s. These 36 organizations have 330 sites in 140 of our counties around the state. Last year, they saw over 700,000 patients who were served at these health centers throughout Georgia. And they provide over 4,500 jobs across this state. The federally qualified health centers, as we strive to improve health in this state, the House has been instrumental in starting these health centers. We started with primary health care. Then we started with behavioral health. And now the student-based health centers are located in the schools to help with that. During the hurricane, Helene, these centers provided health to many people all across this state in health care. They are really the true safety net in this state to take care of folks who have no place else to go. It's my pleasure to introduce some of these people that are here today. Jenny Ren, Denmark, East Georgia Health Care, just raised your hand right here. Steven Miracle from Georgia Mountains, Blue Ridge, Doug Bridges, Medlink, Board Member from Winder, Stephanie Jones, he diversity of health care center in high-ensville. And Albert Gini, who is with the Curtis Cooper Center in Savannah, and Albert is the president of the Statewide Association of Community Health Centers. And Albert, would you come up and just say your word of thanks, please? Well, good morning. I want to thank your speaker Burns, nice seeing you, Dan. I'm Chairman Perish, for your support of the community health centers. We are honored that your continued support has saved lives for many of the residents in Georgia and Georgia. And we just hope you continue to support. And thank you. Thank you all. Thank you all. Thank you all for being here. I'm glad I'm not the only one who does that. I failed to recognize a group of very important people who are with the community health centers in the gallery up here. So would you folks stand so that the house could recognize you and thank you for what you'll do for health care in the state? Thank you. If some of these folks serve your community, they'll be in the south any room. You can come out and greet them and get a photo if you'd like to. Thank you. We have the opportunity to recognize a very iconic company in our state who has a long presence here, but I'll let the chairman give you a little more description. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 48? House Resolution 48. House Resolution 48, Barbara. The chairman of Stevens of the 164th Hitchens on 61st, West Brook of 163rd, Petrie the 166th and Jackson the 165th. A resolution congratulating great day upon the 125th anniversary of its founding. Chairman Ryan Stevens has recognized the speak to the resolution. Representative Stevens. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 125 years to give you some perspective of the jobs that were created down on the coast of Georgia. And this is right along the time that the Wright brothers were considering to invent the airplane. Way before we had the paper industry, way before the sugary, finery, the jobs that were created there, this company has been a staple and has evolved over the years, if you will, to create jobs and sustain jobs. Yes, just for a minute. This is to import it. Conversations will focus on the chairman. Thank you. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As they continue to just to give you some perspective again for these jobs that were created and continue to evolve after 125 years, the domedest on top of this building here today was 11 years old and they're still going strong. Let me hope you'll help welcome the folks from Great Dane today to celebrate the 125 years and I'll give the mic to Rick Mullenex. Would you give him a hand? Mr. Speaker and distinguished members of the House. My name is Rick Mullenex. I serve as the president and COO of Great Dane where I've worked for 45 years. Thank you for welcoming me and my colleagues to commemorate our company's 125th anniversary. What began as an idea to help people work more efficiently have remained our calling card for 125 years. As we look back on each decade, our story is intertwined with America's story. As our nation evolved with changing times, so our company responded with adaptability and innovation also changing with the times. When people pass Great Dane trailers and truck bodies on the road, they may just see a box on wheels, but we see the people behind our products. We see the engineers who invent components based on customers' needs and challenges offering innovations that are found nowhere else on the road. We see our team members, some second, third and fourth generation family members who are working side by side in our manufacturing plants and our corporate offices all united by a passion for building products that help our communities thrive. We see our customers we serve and the people across our nation who rely on our trailers to deliver what they need. Our products like medicine and food and building supplies and also products we simply enjoy like Leopold's ice cream from our hometown of Savannah. So we thank you for this moment and for celebrating more than just trailers and truck bodies, but the resilience, the pioneering spirit and innovations that define Great Dane and keep our nation moving forward. We're grateful for this commendation for it honors those who have come before us and we hope that it inspires the next generation of Great Dane colleagues to follow that legacy. Thank you. Well members, you also recognize a Great Dane trailer by that iconic symbol of a Great Dane in that symbol as well as really the names. So we are some big dogs so it's very important part of where we come from down to Southeast Georgia but important part of commerce across this country not only in Georgia. So thank you all for being here and thank you for Great Dane and what you mean to our communities. Thank you members. Members, if you'll give your attention to the well, please.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Newton, Representative C. Bob Mathis, go talk about being healthy. All right, I want to hear this. All right, pay attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a little bit about your own health today. I'm here with two gentlemen who are along with many others out there who are working on diabetes, recognizing, as y'all remember, we started this February month off with wearing red for heart health. The whole month of February is a heart health month. One of the most key risk factors is diabetes. So we've got, we're working on gestational diabetes, glucose monitors from previous years, but I'm excited. Many of you may have seen out between CLOB and the capital, a big green and white bus. They're out there doing not just a blood sugar test, but a hemoglobin A1C. That kind of gives you your blood sugar over a two to three week period. It's a very important indicator to find out if you guys are having, or any of your staff might be at risk for prediabetes. So it's a quick test. The results are back in a day or two. I'm glad to go over them with you if you need me to. I'm glad to have some members from Quest, our CEO and the Chief Operating Officer. We're glad to have them. They're a local Georgia company. If you would stand and let us thank you for the for the testing. And I want to encourage everybody to stand up and clap and then go get healthy. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, we've had a number of distinguished guests this morning. Now we have a number of distinguished former members. I'm going to ask if you will hold your applause. I'm going to introduce and acknowledge folks on the floor. Let's start with former member Melvin Everson, Rachel Ann Melvin, Noah Plaus. He deserves it. Representative Ken Vance. He certainly deserves areas right right here. Representative Amy Carter. There she is right here. Representative George Brown who served this house in the late 90s, I think. George, good to have you back. And former rep Clay Perkel, I think former area is right here. Let's get him all a hearty round of applause, y'all. Thank you for your service. We appreciate you all. It was good to see you. Members, we'll move on to the rules, calendar. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 5353? House Bill 53, by revs and a bonner of the 73rd and others to be titled, act to amend part three of Article 2, Chapter 4, Title 38 of the Fifth go to George Annotated, relating the George Vetter and Cemetery's, so as to allow certain persons to be buried in George Vetter and Cemetery's, this bill I refer to the Committee on Defensive Veteran Affairs, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Bonner has recognized to present the bill. Representative George Bonner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I rise to present House Bill 53. This is a measure that was brought to us by Department of Veteran Services. The bill expands eligibility for certain service members to be buried in our state, veteran, cemeteries. Currently, members of the National Guard and Reserves are not eligible unless they retire from that service or receive disability from the VA. Now, those eligible would pay the prevailing VA plot allowance rate to cover the cost of the internment. Right now, it's right around $750. Now, granted, this will impact a very small number of Georgians, but as many of you as well, I believe that this is a benefit that we should extend to anybody who volunteered not only to serve our state, but to defend our nation. So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to answer any questions and I would ask you your favorable consideration. You have a couple of questions, General Wilgiel, Representative Hefner to your left. Has a question. Ladies, recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman Yield. To my friend, I do. Is it not true that extending military burial space to veteran spouses honors their sacrifice by ensuring they can be laid to rest alongside their loved ones, reinforcing the nation's commitment to those who have served. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I believe everyone in this chamber feels the same that this is a benefit that we absolutely ought to extend to our veterans. Thank you. Gentlemen, for the year. I do. This policy not only preserves that tradition for military cemeteries as spaces to honor those and remember those, but it also relieves the burden like you suggested in terms of the financial commitment for the family. Absolutely. And thank you for your service. Absolutely. Thank you for this bill, sir. Representative Moore to your left. Has a question. Good morning, Representative. Is this representative you? I do. Is it not true that on behalf of every single military brat, including myself across the United States of America, that we appreciate this bill to come forward for us, we the children of military people. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. And I know that your father had a long and distinguished career and that he is very proud of the service that you now perform. So thank you. Mr. Chairman, will you yield for two more quick questions? We're going to grip into your left. I know to your right. I'm sorry. Has a question. What is gentleman? Will. I do. Isn't it true that I support this bill as a combat veteran and from the standpoint of the cemetery and Millis Vio. Baldwin County when I was in the Senate, I supported and offered the bill in the Senate to establish that cemetery. Absolutely. Thank you for the question and the comment. We appreciate your service and everything that you did your first time around to help our veterans. Representative Clark has recognized for Representative David Clark. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it jump in you? I do. Is it not true that our past and his bill we are honoring and respecting our veterans by expanding burial rights to these individuals? Absolutely. This expansion of

I'd like to ask you to ask a question. I think it's something that everyone in this chamber can agree on is something that we absolutely owed to our veterans and really is the least that we can do. Representative Kay Gabe, Corrie has a question. This will be the last question. Sir, if you yield to him, does Demar Eul? I do. I appreciate that comment and I appreciate your yes vote on this bill. Would that Mr. Speaker I'll be happy to yield the will. General, thank you for bringing the bill. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? The bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 53, the yeas are 164, the nays are zero. This bill had received a requisite constitutional majority. Therefore, passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 51? 5-1. House Bill 51 by reps on a perchetta, 176. Other than that, the bill will be approved by the committee. The bill will be approved by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, so it's authorized the authority to finance and perform certain duties in connection with projects. This bill I'm referred to the committee on natural resources and environment that committee recommends this bill do pass. Please substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. Today I have before you House Bill 51 is a very simple bill. What this bill seeks to do is allow Georgia municipal gas providers to borrow money from Jeefa to increase the size of their gas lines. The problem was brought to me by former chair Perkel. This bill passed out of the chamber last year. House bill 1294 resoundingly. It's a very simple bill that allows Georgia municipal gas providers to borrow money to increase the size of their supply or their gas system. That's all I have, Mr. Speaker. You yield for a question? I do. Mr. Speaker, before I yield, I want to recognize my good friend and important person for privilege with chairman Clay Perkel, who carried this bill last year. He's come down to watch this thing and he's going to be able to do it. I'm going to see what he's going to do. He's going to be able to do it. We'll see how you do. We'll see how you do. He did well with how you do. We're representing green. Chairman Green has a question straight up the aisle. Does the gentleman yield? To my friend I do. Is this, since the House has been in the House of Georgia, a couple of other questions. Yes, sir. You were right. You're exactly right. One of the recommendations was to be able to provide a mechanism to allow for more gas supply in rural Georgia. We have a couple other questions. I'll make sure all the members know we have some folks who are going to speak to this. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. I do. Yes, sir. Is it not true that this bill could lead to increased job creation and improved energy efficiency in our state? I believe Jim will notice what he speaks. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? I do. Yes, sir. Is it not true that this bill could lead to increased energy efficiency? Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, do you have a question? Do you have a question? Do you, gentlemen, recognize for a question? Do you have a question? I do. Yes, sir. I want to ask you about you. You said, I thought I had understood first it was for pipeline. You mentioned sources in pipeline. I just want to make sure I haven't been able to get through every page of the bill. There's adequate, the gentleman, the protection that this would not be used to get in an arbitrage situation that could put the municipal gas companies in a bind if they were. I do feel about this one to ask about that. I do feel comfortable. Yes. So essentially what we're trying to address is a scenario where a municipal gas company is tapped out and they can borrow money to increase the size of their pipes to service more customers. And then that borrowed money will be paid back by the customers that are utilizing the gas. Mr. Speaker. The gentleman has no further questions. Very good. I yield the will. Thank you, sir. Good move. Now members, we have a couple of speakers. One of them is the chair of the committee that passed this out. And I'm going to begin with representatives opposed to the bill. Deputy Speaker, you're recognized to the bill. All in one minute now. Speaker's discretion. I'm going to limit opposed and favor to a maximum of 10 minutes each. To the gentleman's recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to House Bill 51. First I want to say, I definitely understand why this bill is coming through. I understand that there are some energy needs down. in South Georgia and us, external cities that do need this. However, my concern with this legislation is providing a broad solution to a specific problem. And I think we need to be careful about opening the door to allowing the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority to, you know, start to be in charge of regulating and sending out loans for natural gas. When we already have many private businesses who already work in the natural gas industry, as well as local city gas authorities. And, you know, I know that the GIFA's already having some issues with regards to what they're already in charge with when it comes to water and sewage. And I feel like adding on another whole industry, even if it's just for a specific issue, in the future it could cause some hardships for the authority in the future. So I believe that we should leave this with the private sector as well as making sure that with the city authorities that are already working on this. And we can find a solution through that, through those means, instead of adding this to the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority. And I also have to mention that, of course, you know, we got to make sure we do everything we're in power to help with the climate disasters that we are seeing, including Hurricane Helene and the horrific damage that is causing to our state. And the increase of these kind of disasters. And that's why we need to make sure we do everything we can to also focus on renewable energy as well and investing in that. And so for that reason, I'm opposing the bill. And I want to ask my colleagues to also oppose as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the wealth, that's okay. I'll yield the wealth, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, as you are the will, Chair Lady Hagen has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today in support of this measure that strengthens our state's infrastructure and energy security by enhancing the role of GFA in financing and managing natural gas facilities. I want to make it very clear, this GFA does not currently nor would this bill allow GFA to regulate natural gas. That is not the role of GFA. I want to make sure everybody understands that. But what's important here is that reliable energy infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth, public safety, and quality of life in Georgia, including in our rural communities. Our industries, businesses, and families depend on a steady supply of affordable and secure energy. And this bill ensures that GFA has the necessary authority to support and facilitate these critical projects related to natural gas that are so needed for the people. To thrive. This bill addresses a critical need in rural Georgia. Where access to reliable and affordable natural gas remains a challenge for many of these communities. Businesses, families, farms, in these areas often lack the infrastructure necessary to benefit from natural gas as a cost effective and efficient energy source. So expanding this role of GFA will help bridge this gap by allowing them to provide financing and support for much needed projects. We need this in rural areas to lower energy costs, attract new energy industries, and create jobs. So Mr. Speaker, Georgia has long been a leader in energy, innovation, and infrastructure investment. This bill is another step toward ensuring that we remain at the forefront of energy security, economic opportunity for everyone, and responsible governance, and I urge you colleagues to support this legislation to reinforce our commitment to a stronger, more resilient Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Lady, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here you know the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here in the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? No. Have all members voted for what purpose does Chairman Corbyt rise? I'm sure this gentleman knows what he speaks. I appreciate you comment. For what purpose does the representative go steam rise? Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that House Bill 51 aligns with Georgia's own going efforts to modernize energy infrastructure and ensure a stable, affordable natural gas supply for businesses and residences? I'm sure this gentleman knows what he speaks. I appreciate you comment. For what purpose does the representative go steam rise? Yes, sir. State-gen quarry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that granting the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority the power to support natural gas projects will help strengthen Georgia's energy dependence and economic resilience? Sure, the lady believes in what she speaks for what purpose does the representative help to rise? Parliamentarian worry, sir. State-gen quarry. Is it not true that this bill would offer a resource to communities like mine who do not have access to competitive industries in order to help make a more robust infrastructure that will inspire economic growth and development? I have had many conversations with this lady about her community. Now, passion she is about representing them and you are absolutely correct. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your work for your community. For what purpose does the representative go to rise? Parliamentarian inquiry. State-gen quarry, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true that I was the mayor of a community that had a gas system and I recognize how important it is for economic development in rural communities and how important this is to financing economic development in those rural communities? Gentlemen, those of what he speaks has mayor of Silvestre. He did a great job of ensuring that community move forward. Have all members now voted? All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 5151, the yeas are 120, 120, the nays are 55. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 147, 147? House Bill 147, my reps and of Thomas, 21st to know this will be titled next to a men chapter 25 of the 50 that the Georgia and the Georgia technology authority. So it's a provide for an annual inventory of artificial intelligence usage by state agencies. This bill will have referred to the committee on technology and infrastructure innovation. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Who represent Thomas is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand before you today to present the bill at the intersection of technology and governance HB147. This is a bill that requires responsible and transparent use of artificial intelligence in our state agencies. This bill may look familiar to you as it passed this chamber last year or last session as HB988. Unfortunately, it didn't make it across to get a vote in the Senate. So as AI technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our public services, it's critical that we have a clear understanding of how these technologies are being utilized from education to transportation and every government service. And in between the two, the lack of oversight and basic understanding of AI can lead to unintended consequences, including potential biases, unintended privacy infringements. I guess to say it best would be in the words of my good friend, Chairman Perkel, who would say, we just got to make sure it doesn't get too big for its bridges. So with that being said, this does two major things. Again, it creates the definition of artificial intelligence for the state of Georgia. That's now considered the gold standard across the United States. Many states have adopted this same language that we developed last year. Secondly, it mandates the Georgia Technology Authority, taking active role in overseeing AI applications, specifically a comprehensive annual inventory and survey catalog requires that AI system is assessed for its impact before it's implemented. This preemptive evaluation will help in mitigate potential risks or biases safeguarding the rights and interests of Georgians. And finally, it requires that the Georgia Technology Authority develop in a statute suitable policies, procedures, and have these guidelines provided to us. So with that said, I urge all members, assembly, to support the bill, which paves away from more responsive fare and efficient government. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to take questions. Gentlemen, you have a question? I do. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has a question. Ladies recognize? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, you? I do. Thank you so much for bringing this bill with the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence. I do think we need to get a handle on this. My question, though, is artificial intelligence has been around for a very long time. And there are things that we have been using that we don't even realize is artificial intelligence. So for example, spam filters in your email. That uses AI, and I don't think a lot of people recognize that. Are there consequences if a agency does not recognize that AI is being used just because they are unfamiliar with how their technology that they're using is working? Is there a penalty? Is there a penalty? No, it's not. So there's not. By the way, that's an excellent question. It's one that we addressed quite a bit last year in committee. The way that we've defined artificial intelligence precludes those particular items that you're talking about, for example, you can even take it so far as Excel in some ways has got artificial intelligence in it. So it's defined in a way that would mitigate those concerns and GTA testified in committee that they were in agreement. That's not going to be an issue. Thank you for bringing up. That's actually a great question. Perfect. Thank you. Representative Silk Cox, straight up the back has a question if you're gentleman with yield. Ladies recognize. I yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? I do. Isn't it true that you worked with many, many people to develop this particular definition and is arguably the best definition of artificial intelligence in the United States right now? I would agree. And I have to tell you, our legislative council, we brought people in from across the country to develop this. This was just an absolute collaboration of a lot of really intelligent people. I'm very proud of our legislative council. I'm thankful for them and their hard work on this. Fortunately, I get to present it, but it was definitely a collective effort. And this is the definition that is talked about across the United States. And in fact, as you've seen, it has been adopted in multiple states. So this definition will survive six months, which is not easy to do in the technology realm. So thank you. Thank you for the question. Would you further yield? I will. Isn't it also true that this makes the stab at sending ethical boundaries for artificial intelligence for our governmental agencies? It does. And it's probably one of the single most important things that we can do is make sure that this technology is incredible and amazing as it is and how transformative it will be for us in the future. We really need to put some boundaries up now. And this is a good framework to be able to do that. So again, thank you for the question. Thank you for your work on this bill. Gentlemen, take one more question. I can tell you're ready to go, but I'll ask you to take one more. Representative Cox to your right up front has a question. It's Chairman you. I do. Thank you. Is it not true that this bill gives much needed oversight by requiring state agencies to conduct an annual inventory of artificial intelligence usage? It does and that's important because we have to make sure that with these policies in place, we're not unintended consequences, possibly, kept sneering somebody up in something that are not approving somebody for certain things. I was to put it this way. It keeps the human in the loop and that's the most important part in the technology realm. So thank you. Yes, great question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With that, I ask for your favoral consideration and I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered, is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report, the committee has agreed to. Shout out this bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Yes, please. Have all members voted? We're voting all members voted. All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you please vote? Yes, sir. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 147. The yeas are 172. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 8585? House Bill 85, by the rep. Senator Leber to the 123rd. No, this is being titled, not to amend Article 166, the title 15. The official go to Georgia and in Tatey relaying the general provisions concerning superior courts, so as to modify provisions regarding compensation received by superior court judges, Ms. Bill Leber for the committee. On duty to share that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Albertton, Representative Leber, is recognized to present the bill. Chairman Leber. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I think it was in Ecclesiastes, the verse, there is nothing new under the sun. Well, I'm proving that, you know, 2000 years later with my legislative initiatives this year, just as my last bill was won from last year, this is also a bill from last year. House Bill 85 is basically the bill that passed off of this floor three times last year to reform the structure of superior court judge pay. So if you recall that bill, well, let me be a little background. So if you recall that bill, the court judges are the judges who are trial court judges in our state and their state employees, even though they're positioned all throughout the state and the various circuits. They are state employees, but yet they're paid in a system where the state funds apportion their salary and then counties can also, if they're willing, supplement that salary with additional pay called supplements. So we do a very, a lot of disparities in pay throughout the state and it's even led to disparities in pay among superior court judges and spring court judges and we're trying to sort of rein that in and implement a system that's more rational and makes more sense. Let me be clear though, this is not an appropriations bill. We're not appropriating any money. We're not obligating ourselves to appropriating money and we're actually doing just the opposite. What this bill would do is there is a code section currently that has set pay amounts for different state officials, including spirit court judges, we will strike the numbers from that section with respect to judges. We will replace it with a cap that is tied to what is paid to U.S. District Court judges here in Atlanta, but that's just a cap. It's not an obligation to fund any amount of money. We would hope that would happen, but it is a cap. So we're changing that structure and that same cap, the cap is expressed as a percentage of that pay and we're also in a subsequent bill, I hope to bring to you in a few minutes. We're going to do the same kind of system for statewide judges. And we will limit the supplements to 10% of whatever the state pay is so we can try to bring the pay more in line so that it's consistent throughout the state. We also have a provision because there are many counties that pay local officials based on what's peer court judges are paid. We have a provision that will suspend that so those salaries will stay the same if we do increase the appropriation this year so that counties won't suddenly be forced with paying higher salaries to their local officials and they'll have a session next year to come back and change any local laws that they need to change to make those adjustments. So this is basically what we voted off the four three times last year. We've just placed the statewide judges in a separate bill which I'm going to present you shortly. This does not change anybody else's pay. I understand there have been some concerns because there are references to legislators in the statute where I'm ending that we're changing that, but we are not changing legislative pay nor are we changing the legislative expense accounts. If someone wants to do that I'm happy to help with that but that's not this bill. This is just about reforming the structure of the pay of our peer court judges. And that's basically the bill Ms. Speaker I'll be glad to stand for any questions. Gentlemen, I have no questions. Thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen I appreciate your favorable support for House Bill A5. The fourth time's the charm right now. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here and none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here and none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here and none the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Reese rise parliamentary anchor Mr. Speaker. Is it true that our superior court judges are some of the best judges here in the United States in that because they are on seat with one of their colleagues to have equal pay throughout the state we should be glad to support them in what they do and make sure we pass this bill. I'm sure yours are win West George I know mine down in the Gichea to best so we're in the Gichea circuit. What purpose of the leader rise the administration? Mr. Speaker is it not true that due to the competitive salaries in the private sector we need to make sure that we retain and keep great judges that are on the bench currently and recruit new ones for the future and this legislation helps us to do that. I agree with you Mr. Leader. Gentlemen knows what he speaks have all members voted. Okay let's see I think they have Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 85 the yeas are 163 the nays are seven this bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 8686. By representative lever to the 123rd and others to be entitled to act to amend code section 4574 the fish go to Georgia annotated relay annual salaries of certain state officials and cost of living adjustments. So it provides provisions relating to calculating the setting salaries of justices of the Supreme Court judges the Court of Appeals and the judge the Georgia state wide business court this bill ever referred to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends this bill do pass. And general is working his way right on up are representative lever is recognized to speak to House Bill 86. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen this is as promised the same basic bill except just apply to our statewide judges the state wide business court court of appeals and Georgia Supreme Court and when they come online representative martens tax court. It would set their salaries that are the I'm sorry it does not set their salaries it sets a cap on their salary at a percentage of that same same number for the statewide business court court of appeals it would be 90. I'm sorry statewide business court it's 95% court of appeals would be 99 and Supreme Court would be 100% that way we can sort of ensure some sort of salary progression as you kind of move from courts of more limited jurisdiction a court of greater broader geographic scope and jurisdiction. And when the tax court is online it would also be at 95% as well so that's basically that bill it last year we did all of it one we split it up into two this year because there's some the supplements is not an issue of the appellate and statewide judges so I'll be glad to ask for any questions would appreciate your support. Someone has one question to your left representative Kelly has a question if gentlemen yields thank you miss speaker the gentleman you yes or chairman lever isn't it true that in the last couple years we've seen some of our states highest judges decide to leave the bench some of our brightest minds so that they could go pursue other opportunities and this will help us keep those great scholars there. Yes sir I believe it truly will and that's why it's much needed legislation and I thank you for that question. Gentlemen has a question to your extreme right over your representative Jason Ridley has recognized for a question thank you does gentleman yield against my better judgment yes. Oh good I want to blame you on that is it not true that that while some of these judges are leaving go the private sector that once we pass tort reform that they probably won't have the job that's paid as much as it is right now. Oh.

I believe the answer to that question, the wisdom of every member in this house. But thank you for that high caliber question. I knew you should have yielded the well. Gentlemen, have some further questions. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd ask your favor was poured a House bill 86. Thank you Miss Picker. I yield the well.

Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of this bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted for what purpose is representative? The state in Guarante is not sure that justice and judges play a fundamental role in upholding the rule of law and should be compensated fairly to reflect the significance of their responsibilities. I think the lady is absolutely right and since she comes from that world I'm sure she knows of what she speaks. All members voted. All members voted if so. Clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House bill 86. The yeas are 167. The nays are six. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House bill 7373?

This bill having referred to the committee on intergovernmental coordination that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The convener of this House chairman Gerald Dean Green is recognized to present House bill 73 chairman Green. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House I bring you House bill 73 and it's to amend the act creating the Board of Education of Seminole County which was approved back in 1983. And all we're doing here is creating a nonpartisan election for these individuals. It is you're really voting on a local bill but it has to come through as a general bill. And let me tell you right now that the school board sent me a letter and says their representative green. I want to stress that this statement from the Seminole County Board of Education is supported by both Republican and Democrat board members. While we have not taken on official stands and some issues in the past we know that I elected officials here frequently from other individuals who do not have the interest of rural Georgia as a priority. We wanted you to hear directly from us and we've won open dialogue on these matters. Therefore we as the elected voices for the citizens of Seminole County along with our colleagues across southwest Georgia submit our values priorities and values for your consideration. We are concerned about students not parties. And so with that Mr. Speaker I would ask that the House approved House bill 73 for this act for Seminole County. Jim, is you for a question? Yes sir I would. Representative Earhart has a question right at the center. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? I would. Is it not true that nonpartisan elections can lead to more unbiased decision making in the Seminole County school system? I would say that you have the individuals that are no longer concerned so much about parties but are concerned about what is happening in the community. Thank you. One more question if you'll yield to Trinity Camp to your right. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Dean Green, isn't it true that this bill could enhance voter participation by reducing inflammatory partisan rhetoric in our educational elections? Well we are always looking for the best candidates and that's what we want for the students in southwest Georgia and all across Georgia. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you Mr. Chairman. No further questions. He's gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. For what purpose is represented new rise? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that transitioning to nonpartisan elections for the Seminole County Board of Elections will enhance governance and reduce political polarization? I think represented Green did a nice job of educating us all. I'm sure the lady believes passionately what she just stated. All members voted. All members voted if so. Clerk will lock the machine. All in the passage of House Bill 73 the yeas are 138. The nays are 29. This bill and receive the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 116 116 by rep. The total of the 26 and others to be entitled an act to amend Article 5 and Chapter 2, Title 35 and Title 40. The fish go to Georgia and Intenta related to motor carrier compliance division of the Department of Public Safety and Motor Vehicles and traffic respectively. So it's to change the name of motor carrier compliance division of the Department of Public Safety to commercial vehicle enforcement. This bill I refer to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The representative McDonald's is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. House Bill 116 is the bill that dresses important aspect of highway safety and law enforcement in our state. The bill also is a change in the name from motor vehicle compliance division MCCD to the commercial vehicle enforcement division. Along with this name changed the bill was established that officers working in this division will be trained sworn and certified law enforcement officers. The D.O.T. had their inspections division which dealt with weights and the public service commission had their inspection that dealt with truck safety. So the legislature that time decided to combine these two and put it on the Department of Public Safety. In this, when they did that, they made these officers that worked, they made them trained sworn and certified then, but it's never been codified. So not only with this name changed, they will be codifying that all of these officers will be trained sworn and certified. Over the years, I've been carrying legislation for the Department of Public Safety with MCCD trying to pronounce motor carrier compliance division. My friend from Stravon, Georgia, he's always brought that to my attention that I had trouble doing this. But taking this and changing the name to commercial vehicle enforcement will make it easier for me to present bills in the future. I yield for any questions. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. To your left, Representative Hepner has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Sir, is it not true that I will be supporting this bill as the former motor vehicle registration director for Richmond County serving over 207,000 residents in that area? I do appreciate your support and too, I appreciate the support in this bill with the Georgia Motor Truckers Association also and yours too. Do you further yield, sir? Yes, ma'am. It is my professional opinion that the proposed name change offers a much needed clarification and distinction to the vital aspect of this service to our economy. It will help you pronounce it better and me too in the future. Thank you, sir. Mr. Secretary, you're right. Representative Corbett has a question. That's the gentleman you. Is it not true that by supporting this bill, we are taking a proactive step toward improving road safety and regulatory compliance within Georgia's commercial transportation sector. The men in the Zoyde speaks. Thanks for the bill. Representative Meeks to your right. Are you looking already? Good. Do you know the lay of the chamber? I might want to yield to what you yield or did you not yield? I'll take his question. One more. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does dinner menu? Yes, sir. Quickly one last time. What does MCCD stand for? Hold on. I'm going to get my paper back. Shoot. The motor carrier compliance division. All right, Mr. Big. I yield the well. Look forward to your favorable support. Wise man. Just to shout out those folks do a great job of protecting Georgians on the road. So we appreciate the work they do. Thanks for bringing the bill. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in the previous questions ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Here in the report the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted. All members voted. This so the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 116. The Yees are 162. The nasa five. This bill haven't received. Received it requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 1551555 House of 155 by represent of Anderson of the 10th to be entitled. The two men are 7th to chapter 36 and title 36 of the fish voted Georgia and it's either related to procedure for resolving annexation disputes. So it's a revised procedures for selection and objection to arbitrage. This bill haven't heard the committee on governor Laferra's that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Anderson, you're ready. Representative Anderson is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring to you today House Bill 155. This is a follow up to a bill we passed three years ago, which addressed some issues with the annexation dispute resolution process. The bill clears up the log jam that we found after we made the process work better. What we're doing here is we're expanding the pool that DCA can pull from to appoint a resolution board to hear the disputes. We're also clarifying their appointing abilities and making the system so that DCA is not just kicking these disputes out of the process and into the court system. As Speaker, that's in a nutshell what the bill does and I'll be glad to take any questions. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. Representative Fleming, be recognized for a question. He's to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is gentleman. You I do. Is it not true that this bill will help local governments resolve annexation disputes more effectively, producing unnecessary delays and confusion? The gentleman knows what he speaks. It absolutely does. Gentlemen, yield to another question. James Ben Clark to your left. Yes, sir. I'll for questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, yield? Yes, ma'am. For this bill, does the arbitrators do any of them have to be from that local area or is this picking from a pool of people all across Georgia? The pool is people all across Georgia. What we've done to expand that pool, they're defined qualifications for the people that are in the pool now. We've expanded that to include county managers, county administrators, city managers and city administrators because they have the knowledge base for most part to help render these decisions. But it is a statewide pool. Thank you. So, Representative Thomas to your right has the final question. Do you yield? Yes, sir. Thank you. First of all, I want to tell you thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true that HB 155 was developed with input of GMA and ACCG and other stakeholders to make sure that the interests of not just counties, municipalities, but all the affected parties were addressed? Yes, it is true. Yes. And just to kind of clarify that comment, ACCG and GMA are usually on one or the other side of these disputes and DCA has to help resolve them. So yes, this is a collaborative effort. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that that is an amazing feat when it comes to annexation? I think the gentleman knows what he's talking about. Mr. Speaker, I would ask for the bodies favorable consideration and I will yield the will. To make a history on getting them together, the gentleman is yielded the will. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here in none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none of the report of committee is agreed to. Well, this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 155, the yeas are 172. The yeas are 0. This bill, haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there for past? Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 90? 9-0. House Bill 90? House Bill 90 by Representative Station 104 to be entitled to amend Code Section 485, 7.4. The Fisher quoted Georgia annotated relating to preferential assessment, re-bonified conservation use property, and bona fide residential transitional property, so it's to increase the maximum acreage to qualify for an assessment. This bill now has further committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass. The majority leader, ifstration is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Leader. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll bring before you, ladies and gentlemen, of the House proposition today, which is critically important to family farms across Georgia. The next two measures are, I think, in recognition of the strain that all of Georgia, particularly our number one industry agriculture has been under since Hurricane Helene. We need to look at the needs of family farms, and specifically the property tax burden that they face, if not for KUVA, which is the conservation use evaluation assessment. It is a means by which, between farms, between 10 acres and 2,000 acres, can enter into an agreement where property taxes are determined at the use level, not at the market value assessment. This is very important to our state, because for agricultural forestry conservation use, that includes farming livestock, poultry, dairy, timber production, reforestation, and conserving wildlife habitats. KUVA can be utilized for land, and that allows for the preservation of family farms and important public policy, I think, interests for all of us that we preserve family farms in our state. It does so that farmers are able to actually work the land and use it for the stated purposes here. In our agriculture community, often our farmers may have quite a bit of land, but in order to fund their operations, they may not have a lot of liquid cash available funds. If not for KUVA and the land were to be a value at the market level, it would be incredibly expensive to be able to maintain those farms. In fact, that would not be possible for many farmers. Now, this bill simply increases the cap from 2,000 acres to 4,000 acres, and the reason that that's so important is many family farms may have acreage that exceeds 2,000 acres. But unless you put that land in multiple family members' names, there may be an issue that would come up. And actually we've seen that as I've heard from folks who have had to put farmland in several family members' names. There's a position where they, if something happens, say to the father or mother who originally was overseeing the family land and then maybe the children that descendants have it as a speut, that could end up in probate court trying to figure out what to do for the future of the family farm. It's far better if we increase the cap in a meaningful way, but in a reasonable way as well. And so by doubling the cap from 2,000 acres to 4,000 acres, we'll be able to make it clear that this general assembly is standing with Georgia farmers, that we understand the needs of family farms, and it will really be an update based upon what we are seeing right now, an implementation of KUVA, a very successful program, which will allow us to preserve family farmland in our state. Now, bringing forward to you two measures today, I'll speak to separately, but the bottom line is legislative council advises this will require a constitutional amendment. And so I'm asking you on the next two measures, this bill and the following resolution to vote in favor of the measures to stand with Georgia farmers, to make it clear that you care about Georgia farmers, and it's important to you to preserve family farms in our state, really the backbone of our state. And Mr. Speaker, with that I'll yield for questions. You have a couple of questions, do you want to yield for a couple of questions? Yes, sir. To your left representative Kelly has a question. Now you, Mr. Speaker, with a little yield, Mr. Leader, isn't it true with this piece of legislation, we're going to allow more families to hold on to their families farmland because we're going to reduce the financial incentive and financial pressure they would have to sell it. That's absolutely true, but your vote in favor of House Bill 90 today, you were sending a clear message that you stand with Georgia farmers, that you support the ability for family farms to continue to operate into the future. Thank you for the question. To your left again, representing Petrie, would like to ask a question. Gentlemen's recognized. Does gentleman you? Yes, sir. Mr. Leader, is it not also true you've spoken a lot about farmers. Land all across this state is protected from development by having this conservation use purpose. That is good for the environment, and that's the only reason two thirds of this state remains in forest. I think the chairman for the question and absolutely that is true. This koova is available for conservation of land as well, and that it allows for through these koova agreements, a 10 year period in which that land will stay in that use for that conservation or agricultural use. So it's critical for the preservation of, I think if you care about conserving or natural resources in our state that land be continued to remain pristine for the future along the lines of conservation, which I know I certainly care about for my boys future. You'll vote yes on hb90. Mr. Speaker with that, I will yield the well and ask the body's favorable consideration on this measure. Gentlemen is yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose does representative Williams rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that House Bill 90 enhances Georgia's commitment to the Georgia farmers without cost in the state of Georgia? Is it not true? I'm sure the gentleman understands a proposition and knows what he speaks. What purpose is chairman of the agriculture and consumer affairs rise? Representative Dickie? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that this bill builds upon the already successful and essential program that farmers use KUVA and it says a small measure to improve upon that program. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker? I know you know what you speak, sir, because you're right there in this fight. For what purpose is representative health, neurose? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that you are a parliamentary inquiry? Is it a parliamentary inquiry? Parliamentary entrepreneur? Yes, ma'am. I know you knew that. Is it not true? That Richmond County has over 18,000 acres of farm land that includes 123 farms and 154 acres designated specifically to small farmers in Augusta Richmond County. I said earlier, you're passionate about your community and I know the lady knows what she speaks. Is it not further true that this bill would go in support of those in my community who were directly affected by Hurricane Helene and the losses, the devastating losses that we sustained during that tragedy? Absolutely, no doubt about that. For what purpose does will park rise? Parliamentary inquiry? Is it not true that according to the 2022 census of agriculture, the average farm size in Georgia is 253 acres? I'm sure there are a lot of small farms in Georgia, yes, sir. Thanks, sir. And that's a good thing as well. For what purpose does represent a cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry? Parliamentary chairs cannon. Is it not true that the Cuba is an absolutely critical tool for Georgia agriculture? I've heard that stated many times for what purpose does rippenit kill, eagerness? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that agriculture in Georgia relates to one in seven jobs and there are state's largest employer? I've heard it's a number one industry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it further true that it's becoming pretty clear on the board who supports those industries and those jobs and who doesn't? We're going to lock it in in just a minute. I'm going to take one more and ask from the author of the bill, Representative Estration. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this is about property tax relief for Georgia farmers and that voting red against this bill is a message that should be sent to Georgia farmers to know where members stand on the election next year? I understand the gentleman believes in what he speaks. I think all members have voted so Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the past of House Bill 90, the yeas are 111, the nays are 62, this bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Members, we have some, as you all know, members of the committees, we have a very aggressive committee process going on, a lot of committee meetings this afternoon.
