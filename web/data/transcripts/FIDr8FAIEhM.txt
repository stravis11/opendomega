In his free time, he enjoys reading, running, working out, traveling, and completing Honeydew List. Welcome, Mike Davis. Thank you, sir. Good afternoon, Speaker Burns, members of the House, staff and guests, greetings from Hayhara in Lounge County, Georgia. It's a great honor to stand before you today and share a few thoughts. I appreciate the sacrifices that each of you make to our state. It's it's my courtship with Amy. I've been slam dunked into state politics and I've learned more about them than I've ever wanted to know. But it makes me appreciate you all all that much more. So thank you again for your service to our state. Several years back, I read a story in a reader's digest about a young man who was visiting a zoo and the Gaza Strip. Man was working on his doctorate in Zoology. So he had a particular interest in animals. As he was touring the zoo, he stopped at the zebra exhibit. And he immediately noticed there were two zebras there. And he noticed that they looked different than any other zebras he had ever seen. And after watching them for just a few minutes, he realized that they looked just like donkeys. But it was stripes. So he went and found one of the zookeepers and he asked him about those zebras. And he told the zookeeper, he said, these zebras that you have, they look like donkeys with stripes. And the zookeeper replied, yes, that's because they are donkeys with stripes. They said we didn't have any zebras and with the current embargo against our territory, we couldn't get any. So when people come to the zoo, they expect to see zebras. So we did what we had to do. We painted the stripes on the donkeys. Now we have zebras. Do you ever get the feeling that some of the zebras that you're looking at aren't really zebras? Maybe they painted up donkeys. Except maybe we're not talking about donkeys. Maybe we're talking about people. Maybe our colleagues. Maybe our opponents. Or how about this? Perhaps that person you're looking at in the mirror every morning. Is it a zebra? Or is it a donkey? Or are they who they say they are? Or maybe the question should be, is it who I say I am? Or maybe the question should be, is that person I see in the mirror really who I want to be? Or are you the person that you're spouse or your children or your grandchildren think you are? Years ago I had a dear friend and church member in Silvestre. They named Mr. Fred Carter. Representative Bill Yerda is here. He's a mutual friend of both of us, dear friend of ours. Mr. Fred grew up in Jasper, Florida. Fred was an old turpentine man, turned businessman and entrepreneur. He was full of stories. And he left me with plenty of preaching material. Mr. tell me about the old clerk of court in Jasper, Florida. Miss Essie. Miss Essie was an old maid. She lived alone right down the street from the courthouse. Miss Essie had an alcoholic brother who would come and stay with her when he was on a bender. And on this particular day her brother was trying to get sobered up. We stayed with her for a few days. Miss Essie went home from the courthouse to prepare lunch and have lunch with her brother. And after getting everything on the table, the two of them sat down. And she took her brother's hand and began to say the blessing over the meal. Dear God, you said. We thank you for this food that you've so graciously provided. Bless it to nourish our bodies. And God, please help my old drunk brother. And about that time her brother cut her off. Psh, psh, psh, Essie. Don't tell him I'm drunk. You know there's an old saying that you can fool some of the people, some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all of the time. And sadly, we rarely fool most of the folks that we think we're fooling. More importantly, we can never fool God. And if we think we can, we are the fool. Friends, you have a tough job. It's my old friend from Dawson, Miss Marie McClendon used to say, some days you're the bug and some days you're the windshield. No matter what the issue might be, you're expected to take a stand and everybody's watching. Everybody wants to know what you think and what you're going to do. And then there's a good possibility that whatever it is you think and whatever it is you have said, it will be twisted 42 times before it gets back to you. And unfortunately, you will be hell responsible for each and every version. You have supporters with expectations and critics hoping you will fail. And you must take a stand on little issues that affect big people and on big issues that affect little people. You have the pressures of your party affiliation whether you agree with it or not. You have expectations. And you have the temptations of others that are whispering in your ear with their special interest. Legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden said, the true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching. In your case, that may be true, but there's an additional truth. Everybody is watching everything you do all the time. And in the midst of it all, how do you remain true to your constitutional oath and remain true to yourself at the same time? In the first five verses of Psalm 139, David writes, you have searched me, Lord, and you know me. You know when I sit, you know when I rise. You perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down. You are familiar with my ways. Before a word is on my tongue, Lord, you know it completely. You him me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. David was a national hero of Israel, and yet he was as big as scoundrel to ever hit the pages of the Bible. He was an adulterer, a murderer, a liar, and the cheat. But then he was also the only man in the Bible to be called a man after God's own heart. David was the perfect example of a walking, talking, living paradox, and he knew it. He knew who he was. In those reflections that you read in the book of Psalms, or from a man who knows who he is, he knew that he was hopeless without God. I wonder what David saw when he looked in the mirror. Ladies and gentlemen of the chamber, I leave you with this. Georgia could not be the great state she is without the word you do. The fact that you are here today speaks to your character, and his evidence of the trust that your respective district has in you. I pray that you will stay strong in the midst of all the contentiousness of the day, especially in your world, in the political world. Stay true to yourself. Be that man or woman God made you to be. Would you stand and pray with me? Dear God, I thank you for this day and the blessings it brings. I thank you God for these who come to serve our state, giving of themselves tirelessly and sacrificial. I pray that you will guard their hearts and minds, fill them with your Holy Spirit, and lead them in your ways of kindness, compassion, and goodness. As they govern, pour out your favor upon them, give them the peace of Christ, that which surpasses all understanding, watch over this house, our governor, and all who represent and serve our great state of Georgia, and we will always give you the praise and the glory, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. If you'll join me for the plague. The one nation on the path is the individual with liberty to be passed us to the wrong. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors, members. You may join the chaplain in the south any room for a photo. Members before former chair lady Amy Carter, Lee's former member, would we all welcome former chair in this house? Representative Amy Carter. Chair recognizes Chairman Tarvan, chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Chairman Tarvan. Mr Speaker, your committee on information and audits has read the journal from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. On another note, where today is halfway home, Mrs. Day 20.

It has been my honor to be here with you today, serving as your Doctor of the Day. It has been a learning experience. Again, thank you for the invitation. I look forward to working with you during my term as President of the Georgia State Medical Association and continuing to bring the best health care to your constituents and my patients throughout the state of Georgia. Thank you again. Thank you, Dr. Blake. We appreciate your service, and we appreciate you being here today, taking care of us. Thanks for taking your time to be with us and providing this critical service to the members of this body in the Senate. 27 years old. Can you believe it? Happy Birthday. Wow. For the second or third time, maybe. We're going to move on to morning orders. I'm going to recognize two gentlemen for a morning order. This morning that would be very special. And I want all the members of Pay Attention, Representative Al Williams, and Representative Roger Bruce. If you'll come down. Members, please pay attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't come to the well a lot, but today I'm coming to ask you to celebrate a life with me. I would gentlemen that has touched this whole country. He's a native of Georgia, but he has impacted this entire country. His name is Thomas Dorch. Those of us that know him or knew him called him Tommy. I met Tommy over 50 years ago when I was a freshman at Moorhouse, and he was a few years ahead of me at Fort Valley. And he had come and asked me to help organize students across the entire state to get them to get involved in the electoral process to go out and register to vote. And we registered thousands of students to vote in that governor's election that year. And it's difficult for me because he and I were generally friends. That's his picture up there. For those of you that knew Tommy, you know that we could stand here all day long and talk about all the things that he has done and contributed. Those of you that don't know him or didn't know him, I really suggest that you go online and look up Tommy Dorch. And you will find so much information about an individual, as I said, that impacted this entire country. His impact on small businesses and on all the other things that he has done is just remarkable. And it's tough for me. So I'm going to pass this on to Al and let Al say some things about him. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Excuse me, just to let me get a little off here. Of course, everyone came through Atlanta and many parts of this country. And who Tommy Dorch? My friendship too goes back 50 years. When Tommy was first starting out and even when he went on the staff of Senator Sam Nunn, he came to Southeast George of many times. He stayed with the Livian eye down in Midway. He drive down. What a contributor. 100 Black men of America, a great organization that has had an unbelievable impact. Where he served as chairman, the HBCU Hall of Fame, that he organized and put together. His friendship with former Dean Calvin Smiley dates back to Fort Valley State. And Calvin and I have been in touch most of the week. I was following up on how he was doing. And then eventually we had to make the call where we reminisced on what a friend and good person he was. Now every morning when I sit down, I pick up my scripture and I usually read three verses. And I'll only do one. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Who shall I fear is brought me through some tough times. But to Carolyn, the rest of the George family, members of the Georgia legislature, we send out our deepest condolences, deepest condolences for a life well-lived, well-done, thou great, good and faithful servant. Those words fit Tommy Dorch exactly. I just speak a thank you and we yield the well. Thank you, representatives, for that remembrance of a very fine man. Thank you. Now, members, we're going to move on with morning orders. We're going to ask you to see if you can get up and get down in less than a minute if possible. Representative Kendrick is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today is my fourth annual Tech for All Policy Conference. And I wanted to acknowledge the four non-profits that helped me draft legislation for this conference. Partnership for Southern Equity, Urban League of Greater Atlanta. Inspire, EBU, and Generation USA. And I think that you will help me honor our honorees for this conference as they were to prepare Georgia for in the area of diversity and tech workforce. They're in City Hall right now. They were supposed to be here, but we had a time change. But I wanted to name them Christina Newton, Roshanna Novellis, Valerie Maggie, Charles Robinson, Jane Bambri, S. Gordon Moore, Jr. King, Hamid Harbjeb, and Dr. Alex Kermard Carmedel. And my co-chair for this year, Ms. Erica Moore. So thank you for those of you that supported me yesterday and today for this conference. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Gaines is recognized for a morning order in the afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Join by the Athens delegation here up front today is University of Georgia's Family and Consumer Sciences Day at the Capitol. The Family and Consumer Sciences College offers majors such as Consumer Sciences, Diatetics, Financial Planning, Fashion, Merciendizing, and Human Development. Helps students study and apply these principles of design, business, science, and technology to develop healthier people and thriving communities throughout the state. We're thrilled to have Dean Anisa Zonkovic up in the audience as well as Dr. Alice and Penn and several other administrators and students from the U.J. Family and Consumer Sciences College of Georgia, please stand. Be recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We yield the well. Thank you, Chairman and Friends, Representative and Friends. Chairman Greene, Dean of the House, recognized for a morning order. And his friends from Albany. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This was supposed to be a group of individuals from Dirty County and Albany Day. We were glad to have them and host them today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for coming by and speaking to them this morning. But I believe that most of them have left now, headed back to South Georgia, back to God's country. So thank you, Mr. Speaker. You all had a good group there. A really good group. Enjoy being with them this morning. Representative O'Lalley, yay. O'Lalley A has recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good afternoon, colleagues. I'm Representative Phil O'Lalley, from the 59th District in Fulton County. And today I rise and have the great honor to recognize a great Georgian and community advocate, Ms. Maddie Jackson. Born in Jackson, Georgia, Ms. Maddie wrote her first petition at the age of eight, met with President Johnson's administration to help shape legislation protecting the poor, and she even carried the Olympic torch during the 1996 Olympic Games. It was no surprise that after decades and decades of community work, Ms. Maddie became affectionately known as the mayor of Somerhill. Yet at the golden age of 93, Ms. Maddie is best known for her stand against the City of Atlanta in defense of her home in People's Town, and on behalf of other communities livelihoods across Southeast Atlanta. To Ms. Maddie, having a safe, affordable, and stable home to live in was a non-negotiable. At a time when decent housing for Georgians is being threatened by sky high rent prices, a lack of affordable options in Wall Street, now landlords, taking advantage of and profiting off of hardworking families. I challenge this chamber to draw for Ms. Maddie's courage and remember that there is nothing, and I mean nothing more important than a safe, affordable, and stable home. Without it, everything else falls apart. So I want to thank my friends and Ms. Maddie's family and friends up in the gallery for joining us this afternoon at the People's House. May you please stand and be recognized. I'll stand up now. And to Ms. Maddie's daughter, Ms. Cheryl Cahun, happy early birthday. She shares this birthday with her late mother this upcoming Monday. Ms. Maddie would have been 102 years of age. And if I may, Mr. Speaker, one last birthday to one of the greatest men I know. My dad, happy birthday. I love you, Pops.

Speaker and ladies and gentlemen house a brain day a house bill 215 We've been working on this a couple of years and as most of y'all know anything related to health care is like pulling teeth To get it out of out of a committee and move it forward This bill today is going to let you go home and say thank you to a lot of those unsung heroes that save your lives That's the nurses Currently the nurses associate of the board of nursing issues and authorization to be a nurse There's no differentiation between what classification But we have APR ends advanced practical registered nurses these are the nurses that have the extra educational requirements and protocol and clinicals in the such Currently you have physician assistants which most people are familiar with They're also licensed by the composite board, but this bill would do two simple things one It recognizes those extraordinary differences between a normal nurse and an advanced practical registered nurse By giving them licensure or the title that they would be then instead of being just licensed as a nurse They'd be licensed they would be licensed by the nursing board Secondly, ladies and gentlemen this bill does a very simple thing to allow PAs and APR ends to issue those medical placards handicap placards It's doesn't sound like much, but it takes a little bit of a burden off the docs that these people work under those docs protocol Mr. Spooker, I'll be more than glad to answer any questions and if there are none I'll yield the will You do have a couple of questions if you will yield big glad to the lady from the 58 Representative Kenna to your left has a question. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Do you yield? Yes, ma'am Just a question about the different types of midwives that are included in this bill I did see and I do understand the intention of this bill But did you know that there is also as Certified professional midwife not just a certified nurse midwife. So Maybe this bill accidentally doesn't include them or does it intentionally not include them and then would they be subject to a misdemeanor quite frankly for somebody that's heading out of use for a midwife Personally, but I will tell you that there are several specifications and specialty nurses such as a midwives and some of these That they're classified under the APR in Just yielding for a second question. Yes, ma'am. So is there possibly room to look at this bill about how it affects midwives Just to make sure that those certified professional midwives aren't intentionally left out My understanding is that they are classified as an APR in and they're not left out So instead it is being a midwife with a nursing Authorization there'll be an APR in Jim and you to the lady from the 45th chair lady Cooper for a question certainly Yes, ma'am to my dear friend. Okay, isn't it true? This is the bill that this covers that are considered nurse practitioners are the ones that are already our ends That have taken events of course in nurse Moody free the lady is the category that is covered under your bill and for licensure Yes, ma'am you are so right these are the nurses who have the Extra education the masters and the PhDs in all of us. Thank you for the question. Will you yield again? Yes, ma'am? So someone with other training other than first becoming an RN would and then taking the event strain to be a nurse midwife would not qualify for this licensure If the lady so stays Thank you Gentlemen you owe for another one or two certainly Lady from the 36th representative hard for a question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Will you will you? Yes, ma'am Is it not true that this piece of legislation is another positive step that Georgia is taking towards both recruiting retaining and enabling nurses in Georgia To do the best they can to serve Georgians And is it also not true that as a mother of an ER trauma nurse I am especially grateful for this piece of legislation If the lady so states and I appreciate the question gentlemen, you have one more you have one more question will recognize The gentleman from the one hundred and twenty-seventh representative Newton to your right Thank you, Mr. Speaker with the general yield yes, sir Isn't it true that I have the privilege of working with nurse practitioners nearly every day in the emergency department and in office practices And has seen firsthand the incredible values that both RNs and APRNs bring to medical care. Yes, or as you so state Well, I appreciate working with you on this and I want to know I have you have my full support and I thank you for bringing the bill And I thank you and also thank you as being a part of mag in the Doctors for working with me to move this forward and as we had said before I know what a lot of concerns in the past had been about Pathways to hanging independent shingles, but this is not a move to do that Water runs downhill and somebody's got to be in charge and that means the doctors that these PAs and APRNs work under their protocol and I thank you doc Mr Speaker, I don't think it should be any other questions But I would certainly employ the members of the house to pass this bill forward And when you see a nurses at home give them a hug and thank them Thank you chairman Powell the gentleman as yielded the well Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair? He has none the previous question is ordered Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill Chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote note and their clerk will unlock the machine Have all members voted Have all members voted If so the clerk will lock the machine On the passage of the bill the yeas were 165 the nay zero the bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore a past Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to hb81 House for lady one by rooms and a quarter to the 174th and others to be titled an act to amend Code section 222 the official go to George anterley in a low wealth capital outlay grants to local school systems and criteria for eligibility So as revise the eligible eligibility criteria for certain capital outlay grants This bill ever referred to the committee on education that committee recommends a dis bill and do pass chairman corbitt is recognized to present the bill Ladies and gentlemen gentlemen giving your attention please Thank you mr. Speaker members of the house. I'll bring before you house bill 81 LC 491061 House bill 81 revises the criteria For certain capital outlay projects when it as related to low-welt school systems Presently the criteria you have to be in the bottom 25% for splosk collections based on FTE And also the bottom 25% based on property value based on FTE Or you're consolidating two schools where you don't generate enough splosk To over five-year period for your local match. So that is the three Ways you can qualify for this. We're changing that criteria a little bit on the first two uh We're adding to the Bill where if you qualify for the splosk all the Low property value We're adding if you've on it for for a three-year period if you own it year you're on that list for three years We we have every year your splosk collections goes up and down. So this adds some stability to it So once you qualify your qualified for three years even if the next year your splosk collection It is not doesn't meet that criteria The other change uh, we added it on the consolidation piece The schools have to be over 35 years old This this helps us to address the most needed areas First you have some school systems that were being replaced that are younger than that still I earn You know Maintenance and operation funding which helps air conditioning and roofing and and that kind of things They they earn money to help maintain these younger schools. So now we're targeting the most needed areas by putting that 35-year requirement in there and then the Mead of the bill the the main changes where we're once the systems needs have been met uh They will roll off of that List for 10 years and allow somebody else to roll onto that list therefore helping uh a A rule school that would no longer be able they wouldn't be able to afford a capital outlet project to build a new school With without this this grant. So that's what the bill does uh, and I would stand for any questions, but speaker gentleman does have a question oh Yeah, gentlemen from the 32nd chairman Irwin is recognized for a question to your right Thank you, mr. Speaker does the gentleman leave uh You to my friend I do to chairman. Thank you. First of all, thank you for bringing this bill And what I read in this bill this is helping the poorest systems and ultimately helping the poorest children And in this state of Georgia is that correct? The gentleman knows what he speaks. Thank you very much for bringing this bill mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Chair mr. Speaker if there are no more questions. I'll yield the well And I asked gentleman will you go for one more question? I will you for one more question to speak the minority leader Representative German Beverly right in front of you leader Beverly. Thank you mr. Speaker. I have a question around the school systems There could be just an observation. It could be a poor school In a wealthy school system that won't get this attention because it's in a wealthy school system So it's not no less it's not less than 25% my question is is there any consideration to have money go to poor schools that may be in wealthy systems? Like so this this is already in code now. We're just changing to To allow some others to roll on there and by doing this we will possibly help some of the systems you're talking about Actually, hopefully qualify for this. You know, you will be able to will be will we be able to help every school? You know, you know probably not but it's sort of like the young young Boy, it's walking down the beach after a big storm where you have tens of thousands of starfish was washed up on the beach and he's going along picking them up one at a time You're putting them back into water and a man comes along since this son you're never going to Put enough back into water to make a difference He picks one up puts it back in so we made a difference for that one So and that's what we're doing here y'all hit me make a difference and vote yes on this bill. Thank you Thank you mr. Chairman. It was in doubt until then But that story it's a good bill good bill Thank you for the questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered chair? Here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee Which was favorable to the passage of the bill chair?

I'll be brief this bill is a Bill about continuous as hb 143 LC 33 92 90 and the continuous glucose monitors what diabetics use to monitor their blood sugars Whether it be higher whether it be low and what we're wanting to do here is change it from a Medical benefit to a pharmacy benefit therefore A patient can go to a a treating practitioner or a doctor a local doctor and get these monitors These monitors are placed either on your abdomen or your arm according to the manufacturer and it can be readily fixed to your cell phone and it give you whether you have a low blood sugar or high blood sugar And we're trying to treat patients with both we think that this is a a instance that we can Can use to save lives number one. That's the reason I'm for it Number two to give people a better quality of life Number three to give you a piece of mind for for yourself to know where your blood sugars are at at all times and for caregivers That is huge too So I believe that this is going to reduce the number of hospital stays that diabetics have I believe it's going to cut down on emergencies. It's going to cut down ambulance trips Hopefully it will save folks And my years as being an EMT I had opportunities to where we would get calls out that being auto-access somebody's run off the road And a lot of times we get there and it'd be somebody that had a low blood sugar So if it had one of these monitors it will keep them aware of what their sugars are whether they're lower being high Now I want to emphasize that a low blood sugar is more deadly than a high blood sugar All bad and this bill covers both high-poor glycemia and high-poor glycemia. So that's the bill Mr. Speaker if there's any questions, I'll be glad to ask As General will you or he has a question Yes, the Barnes right up in front of you to your list.
