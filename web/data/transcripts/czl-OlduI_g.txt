TRANSCRIPT
----------
Morning everybody.
I ask everybody to take their seats and
we'll call the meeting to order. Please
morning.
Good morning everybody. We're going to
call the meeting to order and we'll ask
for Williams to open us with a word of
prayer. Please
>> let us pray.
Merciful and everlasting God, we thank
you once again for the opportunity. We
thank you for those that have gathered
to help the state of Georgia and his
citizens. Lord, we ask that you guide
our minds. Help us to realize that you
are the ultimate authority and to follow
your word. What is in Jesus's name we
pray. Amen.
>> Thanks, sir.
Okay, let's go ahead and we'll begin. Uh
Jeremy Camp, go come on up.
>> Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm looking at HB948, which is on the
second page, sixth down,
and we are looking at LC 620306S.
This bill is one that creates more
disclosure when someone is foreclosed in
the foreclosure documents to let
individuals know that if there are
excess funds available after all the
foreclosure proceedings, how to get
those funds back.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank
you.
>> Thank you,
>> Chair Lady Hagen. Members, when you come
up, if you would please uh before you
begin, give us the House number and
where it's located on the blue sheet.
Make it easier for the everyone to find
it. If you would please help us move
along. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee. I
have House Bill 983. It is on page two,
a little over halfway down the page.
This bill was requested by the Georgia
Forestry Commission and it its purpose
is to reduce confusion for our counties
and our cities and our property owners
regarding what a prescribed burn is. It
clarifies the definition in the code.
>> Okay. I don't see any questions. Thank
you, ma'am.
>> Representative Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of
the committee. I have House Bill 545 on
the blue sheet is five, the fifth from
the bottom, LC number 481506.
Um, I want to thank the committee for
passing this bill out of rules in 2024.
It went to the Senate, but because of
time, it did not go any further. HB545
is known as the Terry Act. This bill is
designed to create uniformity across all
courts in Georgia in how appeal
transcripts are to be handled. This bill
creates a clear statewide rule that all
transcripts shall be prepared by filing
the notice of appeal with the clerk of
court and
all transcripts are to be requested from
the court reporter listed on the notice
of appeal, eliminating inconsistent
local practices and confusion.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank
you.
>> Thank you,
>> Chairman Corbett. Wait, excuse me. There
is a question. I'm sorry, M. Jones. Just
a minute.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's not for
the author. The previous bill, will you
enlighten
this country boy? And what in the world
is silver culture?
Did Did we answer your question for you?
>> How about 16 different ways, but I'm
going
>> They're going to meet you offline and
talk to you about that. Okay. Thank you.
If y'all have a question be I'm trying
to watch the board, but let me know.
Make sure I recognize you. Chairman
Corby.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of
committee. I'll bring before you House
Bill 956,
uh, seventh from the top on the second
page.
What House Bill 956 does, it gives the
director of the EPD the authorization to
take any actions as may be necessary to
implement provisions of the solid waste
trust fund. That's what we're doing with
this this bill. And I'll appreciate your
favor consideration or answer any
questions.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank
you, sir.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Good morning, Mr. Chairman of committee.
I bring HB57, which is the fourth bill
on page one. This bill does one thing.
It adds stepgrandparent,
stepgrandchild relationship to the
incest law of Georgia.
That's it.
>> Okay.
No,
>> no questions. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Anderson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This morning, I
have House Bill 1027. It's page three,
third from the top. This bill simply
allows MAG participating cities and c
and the one county to enter into
contracts with endusers for electric
service for up to 20 years.
Okay.
Don't no questions. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Jim Jones.
Good morning, chairman, members of the
committee. House Bill 986, second page,
six from the bottom. Uh, four years ago,
we enacted the personal delivery device
bill, which is effectively the robots
that are delivering food. You may see
them here in Atlanta. They look like
coolers with four wheels. Uh, we were
one of the first states to do that. Now,
several states have done it. And we've
kind of learned from what some of our
brethren have done across the union.
We've made changes from a safety
perspective and also a traffic
efficiency perspective. And you'll see
the three changes between line 16 and
line 26.
>> All right. Don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Chairman Williams.
>> Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, my
House Bill 934 is on the second page
number four. This basically transfers
the powers of the securities and
commodities um from the Secretary of
State's office over to banking and
finance. Um this is done in 21 other
states right now and this will help um
reduce some of the fraud and abuse.
>> Okay, we got a question for you with
Parks.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh to the
author of the bill, is it not true that
this would hinder an ongoing
investigation into First Liberty, a $140
million Ponzi scheme? Uh that is
correct. It is 140 in counting and the
folks who have been working on this once
this goes into statute or goes into law
they will automatically be transferred
under the department of banking and
finance. It'll be a seamless process.
But thank you for your question. So just
to clarify, there's an ongoing
investigation in which would it not be
that this bill would hinder
>> Nove
I I I think I just said clearly these
people that are working right now they
will come up under the Department of
Banking and Finance and it'll be a
seamless transition um upon July the 1st
of 2026 and they can all work in concert
work as a team. But thank but thank you
>> Secretary Kelly.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman, Chairman
Williams, isn't it true uh that there's
been a ongoing investigation through the
SEC that is spearheading this?
>> Yes, sir. You are correct.
>> And they're driving the majority of the
investigation.
>> They are. And isn't what's hindered this
investigation is the Secretary of
State's lack of prosecuting this case at
the state end. And that's why we need to
put in the hands of a regulator who
actually is familiar with this territory
>> and also a smaller um web um of working
with because right now the Secretary of
State has a myriad of different
departments they have to be in charge of
and banking and finance. They know
banking and finance and 21 other states
are doing this and they seem to be doing
it very well.
>> Thank you.
Uh,
Representative Evans has a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
understanding your point about 23 other
states doing this, but
>> 21
>> 21 at any time in history until there
was this ongoing investigation, did
anybody ever attempt to make this move
here in the state of Georgia?
>> You know, I'm not aware of that because
I was not the chair of banks and finance
at that time. And isn't it true that the
banks and financing department has
expressed concerns about their budgetary
needs if this change is made?
>> I don't I don't I I don't believe so. I
think they're more concerned of$1 140 to
$150 million that has left Georgian's
pockets.
>> There wasn't a letter that was addressed
to you or to the committee expressing
concerns. There was and that letter was
answered um full committee meeting last
Thursday and we spent about 45 minutes
discussing that in depth and I think we
had um it passed out. I think we had
three votes that were against it in
committee.
>> Isn't it possible um based on language
that's in line 56 that once this
transfer is made that the staff that's
working on this right now could be
completely changed?
>> I don't think so. But you could ask the
Department of Banking and Finance
chairman or Bo Fears who he plans to
hire and fire.
>> Well, you're the chairman. I don't But
the Let me ask Let me ask it this way.
The commissioner of the banks and
banking department will be able to make
personnel decisions after this change
just like they are today. True.
>> That is correct. But in the law, the law
states that they will bring them all up
under the Department of Banking and
Finance at that time.
>> Is there anything to require that that
not change during the course of the
investigation? anything in this law that
would tie the hands of the commissioner
of the banks and banking department not
to make any personnel changes after the
switch?
>> I can't speak for him, but the law says
that he will hire them and they will
have all the benefits that they have had
previously. Now, if they don't perform,
you know, that's that's something
between the the chairman of the banking
and finance or the department of banking
and finance and those said individuals
just like everybody else. have to
perform to keep their job
>> and and that whether they're performing
or not will be determined by the banks
and banking commissioner and his sole
discretion. Drew,
>> that is correct.
>> And and final question, um these folks
that are leaving over from the Secretary
of State's office, don't they have other
duties? Are we not concerned about who's
going to take up that work when they
switch over to the banks and banking
department?
>> All we're working on is securities and
commodities, and that's what my purview
is. um they're going to come over to the
Department of Banking and Finance and
that's what they're going to be solely
concentrating on. I assume the Secretary
of State still has a number of employees
that work on other projects.
>> Has anybody talked about that workload
switch though? I mean, obviously, if
somebody's leaving one department to go
to another one, I would assume this is
not the only thing those individuals are
doing. And I just want to make sure that
the committee at least considered the
fact that workload within the Secretary
of State's office is going to be left
without additional personnel coming.
We're only sending personnel away. It
sounds like
>> Well, a lot of this was thought into um
and we worked on it and this seems to be
a great um compromise for everybody. Um
and it should work assuming this goes
into effect July 1 of 2026.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you. Okay, Chair Lady Smith.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. for
bringing this bill before us. I know
it's complicated. Is it not true that I
actually am in the district in which
these individuals created this Ponzi
scheme?
>> Yes. Yes, ma'am. The lady knows of what
she speaks.
>> Is it also not true that they got away
with this egregious action for several
years because we were peppered with
authority all over the code sections?
>> Yes, ma'am. It has been going for quite
a while. I think they started I think
they said it could have been going over
over 10 years.
>> Is it further not true that I believe
this general assembly is intent upon
wronging writing this wrong for the
benefit of the citizens who have been
damaged by this but also to prevent it
from happening in the future?
>> Yes, ma'am. I I believe that's
everyone's intent in this body. And is
it further not true that I still pray
every day for the ones who are the
victims?
>> Uh yes ma'am, we all do. Thank you.
>> Okay, Chairman Martin.
>> Chairman Williams, just quick question.
The lady uh asked earlier, you know, is
it not true that the um Commissioner and
the banks could replace the
investigator? She asked that question.
You answered yes. Is it not true today
that Secretary of State could change
those this afternoon? Sure.
>> Is is it not true? She also asked about
the people that were moving and the
tasks they were performing. Is it not
true that the task they perform or the
specific tasks that will be moved? In
other words, you're moving the jobs and
the people. Is that not true?
>> Uh correct.
>> Is it not further true that if they were
doing something other than that, perhaps
that's the reason we got the check we
got in?
>> One one could infer that.
Is it not true? We have one more
question.
Chairman Powell,
>> my friend,
again, I've heard all the questions on
this, but I've only got one question.
The security uh division over there,
they're also in charge of investigating
and enforcing the cemeterians and
funeral directors.
>> Yes.
>> And will they will this not change or
will this all stay the same under them?
This is only going to deal with
securities and exchange and commodities.
This has nothing to do with graveyards
or or any of that nature.
>> So those investigations that are
underway, they'll stay at the Secretary
of State's office, but we don't know in
what capacity.
>> Correct. That will be for him to
determine.
>> God help us.
>> Thank you, sir. You have exhausted all
the questions. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Chairman Bonner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning,
committee. I'm bringing House Bill 979.
It's on page two about midway down on
your sheet. Uh this came as a request
from the Department of Defense,
military, community, and family policy
uh division. This creates a process in
Georgia for concurrent jurisdiction on
our military installations as it relates
to juvenile cases. it does not obligate
the state of Georgia to accept these
cases, but under the current under uh in
the federal system, there's no juvenile
process. And so what this would do if
the state accepts it is to allow the
juvenile cases to proceed through the
state and not have to go through a
federal system which does not
accommodate that.
>> Okay. Have a question.
Represent Williams.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I like the
bill, Mr. Chairman. My big question is
if this moves,
especially in an area like my county
where we have a huge amount of military
folk, will there be any help as far as
the expenses that will definitely rise
in juvenile code?
>> Well, we could certainly address that in
future appropriations. Again, u the bill
does not require the state to accept
these cases. It simply provides a formal
process by which a request can be made
to accept. And so um essentially if the
juvenile system cannot handle certain
cases based on their budget, then they
would simply not accept those uh in this
in this process.
But to your point, I would certainly
work with you in making sure that our
communities have the resources they need
because the uh having this available to
the juveniles also provides them with
potential for rehabilitation that does
not exist in the federal system.
>> Okay. Thanks, sir. No more questions.
>> Thank you,
>> Repox.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, page one,
HR99 at the very top is a urging
resolution for Georgia citizens, cities,
and counties to remember and honor the
250th anniversary of America and the
Declaration of Independence.
>> Okay, no questions. Thank you, sir. I I
also have um House Bill 383, which is
threequarters of the way down on page
one. And this is the Georgia High School
NIL Protection Act. And it's putting
guard rails around um NIL contracts in
the state of Georgia, which currently
exist. And it's making sure that those
contracts once the ath student athletes
have graduated that they no longer are
bound by that contract that they can
renegotiate and have to renegotiate at
the next level.
Okay,
no questions. Thank you, sir.
>> Representative Townsen.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is uh HB971,
second page about halfway down. This is
the career academy bill. This is
actually uh follows the original career
academy bill. This will allow homeschool
students and private school students to
attend a college career academy, take a
CTA course at no cost.
And then the school system collects the
FTE and it's an optin for school
systems. Currently the Golden Isles
College and Career Academy in Brunswick,
Georgia is utilizing this as other
careermies across the state for their
incount uh homeschool and private
students and uh it's been really a
win-win for the workforce development,
the students and the school system.
>> Okay, don't see any questions.
>> Thank you.
Hilton Holden, excuse me.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee. I'll refer to House Bill 109,
which is at the bottom of page two.
House Bill 109. As many of you in this
room know, last year we went cell phone
free in our classrooms K through 8,
backed by popular demand. We are now
expanding that to include high schools.
>> Thanks, Chair. Have a question. Jim, uh,
Whip Parks, you have a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Mr. Chairman, how many
other states prohibit high schools uh
cell phones in high schools?
>> So, now we're up to 33 states uh
nationwide uh that are cell phone free.
>> For high schools?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh
any members of the committee have
request?
>> Chairman Green.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh I bring
before the rules committee house
resolution 1050
which is the um our conveyance annual
conveyances and also house resolution
1051 which is uh our easements for the
uh for the year and there are 22
easements and 11 conveyances that and
the Senate will add some more when we
over there.
>> Okay. Any questions for Chairman Green?
Don't see any.
>> L Hugley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have uh House
Resolution 1049 and it's just
designating Fentel awareness day, a
permanent observance each year, the last
Wednesday of October.
>> Okay.
Any other
Leader Estration has one. Go ahead.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page three,
the second bill, House Bill 1023,
continuing with the efforts to maintain
a priority of school safety. I've
brought House Bill 1023, which would
require weapons dete detection systems
in all Georgia public schools. Uh this
um substitute would make an effective
date of July 1st, 2027, would allow for
local discretion as to which weapons
detection systems to provide and would
allow for state grants to help fund
this.
>> Okay, Whit Mark, if you have a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you
for the bill, leaderration. Um is there
a fiscal note or an estimate of how much
this would cost?
>> No. No, there's no fiscal note. The uh
state they through our uh budget have
appropriated funds for lo local school
safety grants and that would make the
funding available for these systems.
>> So is there an understanding whether or
not the 50,000 per school is sufficient
to to cover these if they haven't
already been utilized
>> as discussed in committee there are
available weapons detection systems that
can be paid for with that with under
that uh grant.
>> That's less than 50,000 a year.
>> That's correct.
>> Thank you.
represent Evans, you have a question.
You waves. Okay.
Jim Nur.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh leader, is
it not true that uh quite a few systems
in the state are already proven that
this system is effective and and is
deterring unsafe situations and weapons
at schools?
>> Yes, sir. uh the improvements in
technology and software have allowed for
greater capabilities of these weapons
detection systems and they have been
successful in my opinion in their
implementation where local school
systems have decided to roll them out.
>> Thank you. Okay,
that's got that I'm going to ask Vice
Chairman Lever to come and take over the
meeting here.
All right. I see a new uh visitor to our
committee today.
>> So, young man, I'll recognize you and
let you introduce yourself and tell us
about your
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask
the members to consider House Bill 1215.
Uh this is a a simple bill. This is
simply adding a third judge to the
middle judicial circuit.
This was requested by the judicial
council and the governor has placed the
funding for this in the budget as he has
with two other districts I think in the
Gainesville area and in the Gwynet area
up there. And uh I would ask for
favorful consideration on uh House Bill
1215. Be happy to answer any questions
if there are any.
>> Mr. chairman of the board is just lit up
with questions here. Um, no. Or I'll be
happy to speak offline if they want to
talk about anything.
>> No, you did such a fine job, Mr.
Chairman. I'm There are no questions. I
