Good morning.
I'd like for unanimous consent to excuse the senators from the 16th, the 6th, the 38,

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic of
the Change, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
In the Georgia flag.
I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag in the principles of the way to change, wisdom,
justice, moderation, courage.
Good morning, everyone. It's my honor today to have the pastor of the day, Brian Cooper,
of the Bethel Baptist Church in Richmond Hill. Pastor Brian grew up in a pastor's home.
He's lived in Richmond Hill, Georgia, which I hope that you know is in Southern Brian
County. He's been in my district since I was in the house and now in the Senate.
At the age of 13, he trusted Jesus Christ as his savior. He has served in many
areas of the ministry as an educator, youth pastor, and a pastor for 25 years.
Pastor Brian has been the pastor of Bethel Baptist Church since 2016. He grew up in
the church as his father was pastor for over 34 years. Remarkably, Bethel
Baptist Church was established by approximately 35 organizers and has now grown to an average
of 400 members.
In fact, it is now undergoing construction to double its capacity in order to accommodate
the church's rapidly expanding community.
Pastor Brian, like many of us, loves golf and is a huge, geordable dog span.
He and his wife, Ezio, who is over here in the corner.
Thank you for coming up from Richmond Hill and South Georgia.
give her a welcome here. So they were married June 27, 1998 and have
recently celebrated their 25th anniversary. They have four beautiful children,
Julia, who's married to Sam, Preston, and then Peyton is married to Sarah and
Justin. Pastor Brian, I give you Pastor Brian for the clergy of the day and for
our message of the day.
Well, it's an honor to be here, thank you, Mr. President, and for the opportunity.
I don't have much to say, but I do know this, they've given a Baptist pastor five minutes
that might be a miracle.
And so you pray that God shows us a miracle today.
The Bible says in the Gospel of John, chapter number one, in the beginning was the Word
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
things were made by Him, without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life.
And the life was the light of men. And the light shining in darkness. And the darkness
comprehended it not. I love the unity of the Word of God. If you go back to the Book of Genesis
and you begin there, you'll find that it begins the same way that the New Testament begins with
with these words in the beginning.
I remember being a young man growing up,
thinking I would never be old enough
to get my driver's license.
I remember thinking that it would be,
the Lord would come back or something would take place
and I just would never be able to drive.
And then I got my driver's license
and then I thought, you know, I'll never get married.
Number one, I'll never be able to talk to anybody
into marrying me, but I'll never be able to get married.
I'll never be old enough to get married.
And I got married and we had four beautiful children.
And then they grew up and we're looking forward
driving and dad got the insurance bill and so now we should have never started
driving at all. But the truth of the matter is is sometimes when things begin we
don't always look to the end. When we begin the Word of God in this passage of
scripture you'll find he says in the beginning and I want to remind you this
morning that you're doing a great work. I appreciate I'm thankful for those who
serve in public life those who take the opportunity to help our great state to
help those who are in need, those who are things that need to be addressed. You, you senators
are doing a tremendous job and I appreciate and thank you for that. But the fact is everything
in life begins with God in the beginning, God. The fact that you got up this morning,
this day began because God allowed it. The fact that we serve in this area is takes place
because God allowed it.
In the beginning, God, life begins with God.
And we need to understand that the responsibility that we've been given, we must first view
it from God's perspective.
Why is it that God put us here?
What is it that God is trying to accomplish?
What is it that is pleasing to the Lord?
It all begins with God.
The Bible tells us that the powers that be are ordained of God.
place you hear for a purpose and God always places us in a, puts us in a place for a purpose
greater than ourselves. You understand that as public servants. It all begins with God. And
we must also recognize that if everything we do begins with God, then what we do must
be of eternal value. I remember being a young man listening to a preacher, he made this statement,
And I've never forgotten it, anything done for eternity can never be undone.
What we do has eternal value.
The decisions we make have an eternal value and why we make choices and why we make decisions
we cannot choose the consequences.
We must live with eternity in mind.
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
And that Word was the light that lighted the heart of every man's soul.
we do has an eternal value. And you might ask, why is it important that we understand
that every decision, the direction of this state, the direction of our country, we must
consider God first, why is that important? Because my friend, everything ends with God.
The Bible tells us that Jesus Christ was not only author, but he's the finisher of our
He's referred to in the Word of God as the beginning and the end, the alpha and the
Omega.
And the only thing that will matter when we meet the Lord is what did we do with Jesus?
The gospel can change a life, the gospel can change the course of a state, it can change
the direction of a nation.
The hope is Jesus, everything begins with God.
What we do in the decisions we make, we must consider they have eternal value, because
my friend, every one of us will understand one day that it all ends with him.
The question that we must ask ourselves in the life that we've been given to live is
what did we do with Jesus.
I'm grateful for the day, Senator Watson mentioned when I was a 13-year-old boy, I understood
that God loved me.
He loved me so much that he gave his only son Jesus to die for me.
And I as a young man put my faith in trust in Jesus Christ.
I didn't trust my works and it trust my ability, I didn't trust my heritage.
I put my faith in Jesus Christ alone because I've made that choice.
I know when it all ends, I'll be with Jesus.
I hope today that you know that.
I'm so thankful for you and I'm grateful for you.
church prays for you. We pray for the house. We pray for the leadership of this
state, because we cannot do what must be done in our own strength. We need God's
help. Let's pray together.
Our Father, we do thank You today for Your love. We praise You for Your grace and
Your mercy. God, I ask that Your hand would be upon this Senate. I pray that You
blessed each and every senator, you would bless their families. Lord, guide their decisions.
Lord, may they consider you with every choice that they make because it all begins with
you. Lord, may they understand the value of the decisions that they must make. Guide them,
give them the strength and courage necessary to do what must be done. God help our state
to understand. There's a great work being done here in the capital. Our leaders, Lord,
I pray that You would encourage them today. God, most of all, may we bring glory to You.
The hope of our country is Jesus Christ. May we continue to point people to Him. We ask
this in Jesus' name, amen.

so that we can take up an adjournment resolution and get the Senate calendar.
resolution. That's good. Is there objection? I hope not. It is granted.
You
It's always nice to have our physicians.
We'd like to recognize our good doctors and our senator from the 14th.
This is his second doctor of the day this week.
This is impressive here.
So, thank you very much.
You
You
I'd like to recognize Senator from the 14th to introduce our doctor of the day, Senator.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Folks, as you can see, two doctors of the day back-to-back.
It is undisputed early in the session that Senate District 14
is the medical capital of Georgia.
We're making an early play at medical dominance.
So I have the distinct honor of introducing you
this morning to Dr. Annie Sayed.
Dr. Sayed has specialties in internal medicine
and geriatric medicine.
She has published on issues such as medication adherence,
real frontline, important issues for the state of Georgia,
and part of its aging population.
She also got her medical degree at Dow Medical College
in Karachi, Pakistan, and has been a Sandy Springs resident
in the United States for 20 years.
Another great story about using worldwide talent here
in the states and in Georgia to fill the critical needs
we talked about yesterday.
And so it is my distinct honor to introduce you
and give a few words to Dr. Syed.
Please help me, Walkmer.
Applause.
Well, thank you.
I'm very thankful to the state legislators
for all your efforts to support a strong healthcare system
in Georgia.
And while I hope you all say healthy and don't need my services,
but miss Julia and I will be there if you need anything.
Thank you so much for helping me.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You
We have a second year in a row.
We have a German resolution, which we need to take up, Secretary Reed Resolution of House
Resolution 7779, please.
House Resolution 7779, a resolution relative to meetings and adjournments of the General Assembly
and for other purposes.
That completes the order, Mr. President.
I recognize the majority leader, Senator from the 51st, speak to the resolution.
Thank you.
Good morning colleagues, some great day, exciting day, it's Friday we're going home, we're going to move this resolution through and then you can start making plans for your future.
We're excited to announce that we have an adjournment resolution that has been agreed upon between the House and the Senate, we've worked on it all week.
I'd like to bring a few things to your attention that are important to know, as you recall last year we took off from having legislative day on Fridays through the whole session.
However, we made a few changes to that for obvious reasons.
We've added four days this year on Friday to be session days.
And those days are January the 12th, January 26th, February 9th, and March the 8th.
Those are the only Fridays that we will be in session.
A couple of other things I'll bring to your attention too is the week of February the
the 19th through the 23rd, we will be off that Monday,
that is President's Day, and we'll also be off
that Friday the 23rd.
We looked at a lot of the school calendars
around the state, and a lot of schools are out that week
for their winter break, and so we wanted to be sensitive
to the young families that are in the chamber
of the house in the Senate, give us a little time
to be with our young ones at home or grandkids,
whatever situation may be.
And so we've added those two days off that week
so we can be with our families.
If you look at day 21 and 22,
there's a day off between February 13th and the 15th,
that would be Valentine's Day.
So we'll be off on Valentine's Day this year.
So none of us have an excuse not to be
with our sweethearts back home.
going forward, the most important day that you will be looking at is day 40, which will
be March the 28th, which will be Sonny Die.
I want to thank the leadership in the House, the Speaker, the Majority Leader, the Pro-Tem
over in the House, work with us to get this calendar accomplished again this year.
I also want to thank our Lieutenant Governor behind me, our leadership in the Senate,
the Pro Tem, the Committee on Assignments,
we worked on this.
But I wanna make one other comment.
The reason that we worked on this calendar
a little longer this year was last year
was the first time we'd ever had a 40 day calendar
that we agreed upon.
And one of the things that we learned from that experience
was at the end of session,
we felt like we were pushed to get our budget finished over here
on time to get it back to the House
for Conference Committee on the Big Budget.
And so we have an agreement with the House
between the speaker and the lieutenant governor
that the amended 24 budget will pass the House on day 16.
It'll come over to the Senate.
And we have committed to pass the amended budget
out of the Senate on day 25,
given time for the conference committee report
to be approved by February 26.
The big budget is scheduled to leave the House on day 28.
It'll come over to the Senate.
We will do our work and then we will return it to them on day 38
and give us a couple days to work over the weekend on a conference committee
if needed and then it will be finalized either day 39 or day 40.
Senators, we appreciate your patience while we work through this adjournment resolution.
I think it gives everybody an opportunity to plug these days into your schedules
and build a go-back home and run your business and take care of your family needs.
Mr. President, I'm sure we'll have 100% support
of this resolution, but I'm happy to take questions.
Senator from 29th, you have a question.
Okay, great job, leader, and you have no questions.
Does any of the Senator, which speak for the resolution?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
Chair, here's none of the main question is ordered.
All the adoption, Secretary, and on the adoption, those in favor of the resolution will vote
yay, those opposed nay, Secretary-in-Lock machine.
You
On the adoption of the resolution of the A's are 42 and the A's are zero directorate
Constitution majority is there for adopted.
Serving from 5th verse.
Yes sir, I'd like to make a motion that we transmit this wonderful resolution immediately
back to the House.
Majority leader has made a motion that we immediately transfer resolution 7779 to the House.
Is there objection, objection, motion prevails.
And by the way, a great job, a majority leader.
And the pro team, I know we did have some good discussions, let's give them a round of
applause.
And I'd like to echo what you said in the well there, Senator.
It was the speaker and the leadership over in the House were very good to work with.
We became very popular last year when we had a 40-day calendar.
and hopefully that will ring true this year
in a building that's hard to be popular.
So it's right now you're on top of your game.
So thank you for that.
I recognize the Senator for our 29th form.
