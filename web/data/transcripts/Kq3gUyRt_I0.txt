have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the
machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good
morning. Welcome to another legislative day. It's going to be a great day. We will begin
our day with Scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain after which we will
pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be
introduced by the gentleman from the ninth house district, the chairman of the
House Transportation Committee Chairman Kevin Tanner. Chairman Tanner.
Thank you, Miss Speaker. It's my great honor to come before you today and
introduce a fine man in our community. He's not only a pastor at a local
church but he also happens to be the high school principal at our local high
school. So he's leading not only a congregation but he's leading many many
young people in a very good direction at our local school system. Brody Hughes
is the pastor at Juno Baptist Church in Dawsonville. He's pastor there for the
past five years. He's been in the ministry for the past 15 years. He's enjoyed
the opportunity to earn that time to serve several local churches in and around
our community. He also has been a part of several overseas mission trips to Kenya, Uganda,
Israel, and Egypt. And he's again been in education now 12 years and is the principal of our school.
He is the father of two boys, Sutton and Landon, and has a wonderful wife, Brittany,
who is an nurse, and they're expecting another boy in May. He brought with him a good friend of
his and mine today, former City Council member from Dawsonville, Jason Powers. So if you would
would make him welcome.
Appreciate him being here with us.
Thank you.
It's my great pleasure to introduce Rodi.
Not only is he a pastor of a local church,
old-fashioned Southern Baptist like I am,
but he's also a friend.
So make him welcome today.
Thank you.
You say it's an honor and a privilege to be with this body.
This morning, and we've been praying for you all
know you have tough decisions and things tasked that are set before you. We want to read
out of the 28th chapter of the book of Isaiah in the 16th verse, therefore, thus saith the
Lord God behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation of stone, a trod stone, a precious cornerstone,
a sure foundation. He that believeth shall not make haste. At the turn of the 20th century,
a German philosopher Frederick Nietzsche in his satirical work, the madman, said that if
God died or proclaimed the death of God that they would run into city streets, the madman
and proclaim that we would have to light lanterns in the morning to see our way.
Just a few years after that, 40 or 50 years later, Dietrich Bonhoffer, as he said in America,
concerned with the events that had gone on in Germany at the time as a dark seat of war
and destruction had ravaged his land and he considered his place in what he should do.
Scripture came to his mind, he that believes it shall not make haste, or as he said, he
that believe it should not make or should not flee.
I just came to encourage you all this morning as you have a great work set before you, each
one of you to represent the people of the state of Georgia, to represent your hometowns and
to represent the beliefs that you have within your heart, to stand firm on the foundation
that God has laid, a cornerstone for each one of you to stand on as you begin to build.
I thought about Nehemiah in the 6th chapter, the Bible said, now,
Sanberle and Tobia had come to Nehemiah and tried to distract him from the work that he was doing
and said, come, let us meet in O know that you might take a break and we might get together
and talk about these things.
And Nehemiah responded, I'm doing a great work and I cannot come down.
Certainly, all the distractions of life in the world come and then come to you about
I hope and pray that you stand on the firm foundation
that your convictions have led you to this place.
As God has driven you and your life
to be at the place that you are right now,
and you might be as Dietrich Bonhoeffer was,
that you believe in that foundation
and you would not flee but stand firm
on what he has given you.
The Bible also teaches us in the book of Galatians
in the fourth chapter, Paul says,
having begun therefore in the Spirit,
where shall we now turn?
having begun in your spirit and having God's conviction
on your life, and as He has driven you this way,
I hope and pray that He'll ever lead and guide you
in your decisions as you make these great choices,
not only for yourselves, but for this great state
and these great people.
I would that you might stand and join us now
in a word of prayer.
Our Lord and Heavenly Master, God,
we thank you for this day.
Father, we thank you, dear Heavenly Master,
for your grace and your mercy that you've extended to us.
God, by your graceful hand, God, we pray for each one that is gathered in this house this morning.
God, may you lead them and God them, Father, speak to their hearted, that still small voice.
God, let them proclaim the foundation that you have set before them. Let them stand strong and
tall upon it. God, and let them not flee from the task that is set before them. God, now go with
us, lead us, God, us, and direct us in these things. We ask in our sweet and holy precious name, amen.
led allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, the indivisible, with liberty and justice thought.

acres of land in the last 15 years alone. As a coastal boy, many of y'all may not be

been proposed by the governor.

all of us to attend the Appropriate, the budget hearings last week and making us feel welcome.
I was grateful for that.
last year was my first session, but I've been around the budget process for years.
And last year was a good budget.
It was done in good faith, good people who really care, worked really hard to consider
all the requests that were made, and factor in all those decisions.
And I voted for that budget, and I left, and I thought, that was a good budget we did
last year.
That was a good budget.
So we went home and then we learned about the budget cuts that are having to be made
and that were made beginning October 1 and saying that they were necessary.
And I just wanted to go on the record and say, I'm not buying it.
I was, I'm not buying it.

Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is Human Traffking Awareness Month in the United
States.
January is.
Human Traffking is an evil practice of modern slavery in which victims who are adults
and children are sold for labor or sexual servitude. This evil is perpetrated throughout communities
who are rural, suburban, or urban. In homes where the victims come from poor middle class
or affluent backgrounds, it impacts everyone. And I'm very grateful for the leadership of this house
over the past decade, working to address this issue where Georgia had been one of the primary hubs for human trafficking,
nationally and internationally, and through the fine work of this General Assembly, that has been
stemmed, and I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your leadership on this issue.
Too many in here to name, but of course, Chairman Andy Welch, who initially got me involved in this issue.
I'm very proud of the efforts and I thank the House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

House Resolution 963 by Representative Frazier 126.
A resolution recognizing January 29, 2020 as Sickle Cell Day in Georgia and for other purposes.
Chair recognizes representative Gloria Frazier for an invite resolution
Thank you, Mr. Speaker
As we continue this great day
Recognizing our sickle cell
Constituents who have traveled across the state. I am so honored to have with us today Georgia sickle cell poster child for 2020
His name is Camarth Burton and we initially his nickname is redhead
So I would like for you all to, he's a 13-year-old 8-grader living with sickle-sale
anemia and he currently resides in Savannah, Georgia. Please give our poster
child a round of applause.
I'm also honored to have with us today Dr. James Eggman. He is a professor of the
department of hematology and medical oncology at Emory University. Dr. Emman
actually established the world's first 24-hour comprehensive acute care
sickle sale clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital where he served as a
director for 35 years and also joined with us as Dr. Otis Powell, Dr.
he is a board certified practicing family medicine practitioner with
extensive treatment in sickle sale also honored to to know that Dr. Powell
graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta at Augusta University
At this time, Mr. Speaker, Dr. Edmund will bring us a few words.
Thank you, Representative Frazier, Mr. Speaker and members, for allowing me to say a few
words about this important disease that affects over 8,000 individuals in Georgia.
The outlook for individuals with sickle cell diseases improving dramatically.
Children born in our state are now reaching adulthood virtually all of the time.
There are new treatments available.
Two new drugs just to prove by the FDA adds to the two already present giving us few
four preventive treatments for the disease.
And a few individuals are being cured by bone marrow transplant and genetic therapy
that is on the cutting edge of genetic research.
Unfortunately, despite all of these advances,
individuals throughout the state of Georgia
are not reaching the benefits of these treatments
because they don't have adequate access to health care.
The Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia
is working very hard with Augusta and Emory and Choa
to really improve services throughout the state
by doing outreach activities.
The Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia
is having seminars for primary care physicians
to increase their knowledge so they can take care
of these patients.
They have a network of community health workers
that are coordinating services.
They are actually starting clinics
using federally qualified clinics, faith-based clinics,
and public health clinics to provide direct patient care.
They are also helping youth transitioning to adult care.
And so they're working very hard to improve the services.
So all individuals in Georgia can have these benefits.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, we're going back now to morning orders.
Chair will remind the members of the one minute time limit.
Chair recognizes representative Houston Gaines for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today, I want to take a moment to recognize occupational therapists for the crucial work
they do in our communities.
Occupational therapists provide essential care to patients across our state who have experienced
injuries and illnesses that affect their ability to live self-sufficiently through helping
individuals learn or relearn the skills that they need to thrive every day, including
tasks as simple as brushing their teeth and as complex as relearning to walk on uneven
terrain.
Currently, there are approximately 4,000 active occupational therapists and occupational
therapist assistance in the state of Georgia.
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics,
demand for this field will grow 33% faster than average
demand because of increased aging population.
I want to thank you for your dedication to your work
on behalf of patients across this state.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Chair recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Lynn Smith and Chairman Tom McCall.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair and McCall and I are here today to explain to you about a return to normalcy in our
state of Georgia as far as navigable waters are concerned.
A few years ago, the previous administration expanded the rules and regs on what's called
navigable waters and that's understandable, it means you can run something down a river
and it started including ditches, furrows, I can't name to you all the things that were
included in it.
There's a campaign to try and make the point of a family of four in a canoe and a dry
ditch trying to paddle so it's mainly a best explained through a farmer's viewpoint
So I'll turn the rest of my time over to Chairman McCall.
Thank you, Madam Chairman.
It's a major, major win for agriculture in your state, not only for agriculture, but
also for homeowners with a yard and a lawn that might have water running out of your
downspouts.
The federal government could control, and I tell folks a lot of times now, you can go to
the bathroom on the outside and not create a femoral stream that will come under federal
jurisdiction.
So thank you for reading to me.
Thank you.
