Despite the constant attempts of this general assembly to erase and entire people, I want
you to know that trans people will not disappear.
They will not slink silently away so that you don't have to feel discomfort at their
They will not hide and fear from those who are in power.
In fact, there will come a day.
When trans people and queer folks and formally incarcerated folks
and all the other folks that Republicans have decided are useless,
there will come a day.
There will come a day when they will all sit in seats of power
at this table fighting for the rights of all Georgians.
The Senate takes up another transgender bill.
gender bill, this one banning hormone therapy
and puberty blockers for children,
and garnered the same passion to opposition
from Democrats as with prior bills.
Good evening and welcome to lawmakers on
Legislative Day 26.
I'm Donald Aurean Atlanta.
It might surprise some of you that emergency medical
services, including ambulances,
are not considered essential services in Georgia.
That means it's sometimes difficult
for local municipalities to have the flexibility
to ensure EMS availability in communities.
There's a bipartisan move to change that,
and two of the lawmakers behind it joined the show.
Also, the U.S. Supreme Court could make a ruling this year
that could change access to preventive surfaces
through the Affordable Care Act.
That means insurers would no longer take on the cost
of things like mammograms and colon cancer screenings.
We'll hear from two senators who want Georgia
to be ready if the high court changes Obamacare.
But first, both chambers are scrambling
to get as many bills as possible moving.
Here is the latest from our Capital Correspondence, Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna.
Today at the Capitol,
U.S. Representative Marju Taylor Greene
and U.S. Small Business Administrator Kelly Leckler
paid members a visit ahead of a packed day.
With only two legislative days remaining until CrossHover Day,
House members voted on over 20 bills, including House Bill
89, which requires medical facilities to provide the maternal mortality review committee
with psychiatric records for maternal deaths and set up parianatal care centers.
People and physicians and hospitals have been very reluctant to give us that information
and it is essential to knowing the cause and what happened to them and seeing if their
psychiatric disorder or what they were betraying for was any cause.
the bill passed 16827 and House bill 358 received approval despite opposition from Democrats.
The bill expands the definition of military base to prohibit certain foreign entities
from owning land nearby.
After a lunch break, the House gave final approval to the amended mid-year budget.
It includes an unprecedented amount of money for storm relief and cleanup.
Working together, the House and the Senate built upon the governor's package by including
an additional $18 million in the governor's emergency fund to help me the state and local
match of 25% of the for the degree removal. The House and Senate felt strongly about
adding $185 million in additional relief for the farmers and timber producers for total
and unprecedented appropriation of $285 million.
The amended budget also allocates funds for updates to Georgia's prison system, funding
for hospitals and school safety grants.
The bill was transmitted immediately to the Senate.
The House also passed HB399, which requires out-of-state landlords owning over 25 single-family
homes to have an in-state broker to manage tenant complaints.
If you're trying to develop new housing stock, you are going to be competing with these
entities who are going to raise the prices, take it away from your opportunity.
It's even going to affect the governor who is trying to create workforce housing across
Georgia. This is a big deal.
And an update on Speaker Burns' chief of staff who was injured in a farm equipment accident
earlier this session.
But today our own beloved chief of staff former member of this body, Terry England, stood
the three times with no paying.
Banning gender dysphoria treatment was once again
on the Senate's busy agenda today.
Senate Bill 30 would ban all hormone therapies
and puberty blocking treatments for minors.
This bill is the same bill that we passed last year,
Senate Bill 30, and it outlaws puberty blockers for minors.
Specifically in gender dysphoria, where hospitals
or physicians do this, two separate sections,
two different sets of penalties if you do,
that's basically what it does.
It outlaws puberty blockers for minors
with gender dysphoria.
Democrats try to add an amendment
to allow children currently going through the process
to be able to continue treatments,
but still rejected the bill.
I find it ironic that the party that often claims
to stand for parents' rights,
their Republican Party is insisting on telling parents
that they cannot make these critical medical decisions
for their own children.
Many of the same politicians who claim
that they fight against government interference
and health care options now want to stand in the way
of personal, familial, and medical conversations
with other people's families,
with other people's children.
The amendment failed,
but the bill passed along party line, 34 to 19.
SV 74 would amend a current book ban law
on school and state run libraries,
sharing sexually explicit or harmful materials to children
by clarifying a loophole that excluded librarians.
New law would punish librarians
who knowingly disregard the law,
but protect those who make a good faith effort.
If you look carefully in lines 25 through 29,
the affirmative defense guarantees the librarian,
and thanks to the Center for his recommendations
and committee, not only the librarian,
but workers in the library who might be challenged.
They have the same affirmative defense
if they make a good faith attempt to identify
and remove from access, not remove the material
from the library, but simply to remove it from access
to minors.
Democrats say the bill is more about controlling ideas than protecting children.
Tell the hundreds, thousands of librarians and media texts in Georgia, both Democrats
and Republicans who are watching this dismayed, tell them that they won't be charged.
But I bet you won't, because it's the threat of being charged that's going to make that
librarian comply with the first demand that a parent provides or makes, regardless of
how unreasonable that demand is.
The bill was passed 32 to 23.
And finally, the Senate finalized the amended 2024-25 budget,
sent over by the House, overwhelmingly passing it, 55 to 1.
Tomorrow, the House is expected to vote on a bill
that would prevent intellectually disabled adults
from being sentenced to death.
That's my capital report, Donna.
Thank you, Sarah.
But later this year, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the Affordable Care
Act or ACA.
The case could remove requirements for insurers to cover the full cost of preventive care.
A bipartisan bill, I'll spill 262, is looking to preserve access to some health care services
at no cost, actually that Senate bill 262.
Those services include cancer screenings, medication to reduce the risk of developing diseases,
such as aspirin or statins.
disease and diabetes screenings, and mental health and substance disorder screenings.
The Bill's sponsor is Democratic Senator Sonja Halperin of Atlanta, among the many Republican
sponsors is Senator Ben Watson of Savannah.
I spoke earlier today to both of them, beginning with Senator Watson, who is a family practice
physician and internist.
I ask him why preventive care is so important.
It's really a quality issue because it's shown over the past two to three decades we've
shown how if you drive quality you drive price and that what I mean by that is that about
25 years ago we were not paying for mammograms, we weren't paying for colonoscopies, just
the routine things that we take for granted now.
There were studies shown that if we find polyps in colon, in colon that prevents colon cancers
if we find, you know, breast cancer early, you save lives.
So it's all about quality of patient care.
And that reduces mortality and morbidity.
So it saves the insurers money, it saves Medicare money.
So Medicare actually led the way in starting to pay
for mammograms, starting to pay for flexible
sigmortaroscopies, and then colonoscopies now.
And there's so many other things that we do
from a screening standpoint that are paid for
and are used prospectively.
And that's the important part, is trying to prevent disease,
rather than waiting until you have a disease,
where not only does it increase your risk of dying,
and having all the morbidities associated with that,
but it saves the insurance money, too.
How difficult is it to get patients to understand that?
Wow, I wish it were that easy.
You know, there's still pushback many times
when it comes to just in plain mammograms.
Certainly colonoscopies.
We do have colagor now, which is a DNA-based test
on stool and that is a good screen but you know if that's positive you still have to have a colonoscopy.
A lot of these things are not necessarily fun but you know dying from colon cancer is not a good
way to die. It's tough breast cancer is tough that we all know about. Tell me what even made you
interested in this? Well you know we have over the years gotten so accustomed to being able to go
to the doctor and get certain kinds of screenings without having to pay a copay and it came to my
attention that the Supreme Court, later this year, is going to hear a case about this
very provision of the ACA that casts its future existence into doubt.
And I thought to myself, wait a second, here in Georgia where we already have access
issues to health care, I want to make sure that Georgians are able to still be able to
not have to have any cost sharing for a whole range of services, like cancer screenings,
hemograms and colonoscopies, vision screenings for young people, even falls for our elderly,
all fall under the kinds of services that you do not have to pay for a visit to your
doctor for.
And we have become accustomed to them, as you mentioned.
Over the last, you know, dozen years plus, since the ACA has made this requirement for
both public and private health insurers, we've gotten accustomed to this.
And I want to make sure that we can stay accustomed to it.
The thing about it is the ACA situation is one of those things where you've got to even
think forward.
You don't know if things are going to change at all.
You don't.
And I think because there is so much hesitation and we just don't know what's going to happen
at the federal level on this issue, that is exactly the reason why it's important to go
ahead and make something happen here at the state level.
And we would be joining many other states that have already passed similar pieces of legislation
that will require insurers to still prohibits insurers from passing on any cost sharing
to patients.
So we're not, you know, we're not leading the charge on this, but we would, in fact,
be part of quite a number of states and bills that are pushing this idea forward.
Even the Trump administration really is arguing for the continuation of no copay on preventive
care services.
And for everyone from the infants all the way through.
All the way through.
This would affect our youngest to our oldest Georgians.
What we're doing is we're reacting a little bit of what's been said in Washington.
And there's still a lot of mixed signals that are coming out, but I think that everybody
air on the side of quality because we're driving quality when it comes to
this and Medicare knows better than anyone that it saves them money when it
comes to that that's actually an area of the budget that's been reducing over
the past decade and it always primary care driven by driving quality and it's
not just having to do with mammograms and colonoscopies it has to do with
doing the A1Cs when it comes to diabetes checking people's feet making sure
that they have good eye exams and that kind of thing.
So if you drive quality on multiple different segments,
it's good care, the patience, and guess what?
It saves Medicare money and saves insurance money.
So they are driving this issue, and I think that's a good thing.
So I don't think you'll see anything
that will be done from preventive, anything I would expect
that we would see improvement relating to that.
But having said that, Senator Halpin, drop this bill.
We'll see where it goes.
This kind of bill, these kinds of issues really are not partisan issues.
I'm really excited that on this particular bill, I am joined by a number of Republicans
who've also signed on and recognized the importance of Georgians being able to not let money
be a barrier to their health care in this case.
You're feeling pretty good about it.
I am feeling optimistic, cautiously optimistic about it, and I'm hoping to get a hearing
on the bill.
and you've got not, you don't have a lot of time.
I don't have a whole lot of time
before we get to cross over day,
but I think that it's an important enough issue
to talk about, even if it doesn't make
this deadline of Thursday,
I think it's an important enough issue
that we really need to be talking about it
and not ignoring the fact that this could change.
The facts are is that if you do prevent of care,
either mammograms, colonoscopies, diabetic footchecks,
eye checks and things like that,
And then you save lives and you save morbidities associated with those disease processes.
So it's ever important when it comes to taking care of patients, that's so important.
But it also saves money for the government and for the insurers.
Well, the bill is in the insurance and labor committee and it did not receive a hearing
today in time for a vote by crossover day.
But the bill will remain active for the next session and I want to thank both Senator
help earn and sender to Watson for those interviews.
Well, coming up, a bipartisan push to make sure
our ambulances and those who work on them
are considered essential service providers.
Two lawmakers join us who have a bill
to ensure emergency medical services
are available to more Georgians.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPB.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the state capital during the session and year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
It's good to have everyone back together.
Good news, indeed.
Put your feet up a minute.
It's beautiful.
What does that sound to you, man?
It's what I love doing.
Who put these?
It's like it more a double-wish kid.
Ariel?
Freshly baked biscuits, always.
Well, this is all proving rather cosy, isn't it?
Understanding the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
Hey, this is amazing.
Well, I'm excited now.
Pompei is a battle against time.
This, it really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
I love this life, I love you.
History teaches us to honor the past.
What is your feeling with all eyes wide open?
When you look back, they're like, wow,
that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course
of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
I love all eyes open, yeah.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry.
In Georgia, Centers for Emergency Medical Services receive about a million calls each year.
The Georgia Department of Mental Health says EMS takes care of rapid response, initial
treatment, and safe transport of patients to hospitals.
EMS plays a really crucial role in the health care system, and they have a unique chance
to make a positive difference in what happens to patients.
Now in the Georgia, here are some workforce numbers.
There are more than 27,500 EMS workers.
That is about 258 medics for every 100,000 people.
25% are female, 75% male.
And two people joining me want to ensure EMS is a designated essential service.
Democratic representative, rural Roman of Duluth.
She serves on energy, utilities, and telecommunication, information and audits, and interstate cooperation
committees and Republican Representative Gary Richardson of Evans in Columbia County
is Vice Chair of Public and Community Health and is Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland
Security. Welcome to lawmakers to both of you. I appreciate this and cooperation on this
bill because you both had bills that mirrored each other, but yours has been kind of moved
into his. And so let's start with the background on these bills to begin with. And I'm going
to start with you because you've come on to talk about this issue in the past. Why did
you become interested in the issue of emergency medical services and making them designated
essential?
Yeah, so this is sort of something I like to share with people because it's important
for the public to understand that a lot of these bills that we come up with is direct
sort of responses from them.
My husband's an EMT and we had been sitting with some of his co-workers who mentioned,
oh yeah, we're not designated as essential and I was thinking how is that possible?
Law enforcement is essential, fire is essential and so it was actually through them that I
I started to learn more about this
and it was the first bill I ever worked on as a lawmaker.
And I was really excited.
We actually got it all the way to the Senate
but then sadly ran out of time as it goes.
So, yeah.
But you kept Pope alive and then you had somebody
who had similar interests.
So tell me what's your background
and even interest in this?
Well, I served on the County Commission
in Columbia County for eight years
and I was Vice Chair of the Emergency Services Committee.
So when I got up here, I wasn't even aware,
really and truly that EMS was not an essential service.
I think if you ask 99.9% of the citizens in Georgia,
if EMS was an essential service,
they would say absolutely it's essential.
So I got a call from back home and saying,
hey, we need to work on that.
We need to make sure that we get that designation.
And we in Columbia County use a private company
and pay them a supplement for their services.
And so when they were going through the pandemic
and then the Haleen and they were having all this overtime
and all this extra hours and all,
But they couldn't go and request a refund for some of the extra expenses for payroll and
all of that stuff because they weren't considered essential.
So they could apply for a PPP loan, but that wasn't what they were looking for.
They had to be out there to serve the citizens doing these times of need and for them to have
to take a loan to meet that payroll, it just, it didn't,
it didn't make sense, or doesn't make sense.
So, that's why we wanted to.
And you get to see it personally.
I mean, I can't imagine that people were going through
the storm, they were working hard,
and then yet they weren't being compensated,
and I guess with your husband being involved, you've seen it.
Yeah, so he is, you know, a part-time EMT, full-time lawyer,
and this was just his way of being able to serve the community.
And a lot of times when we're talking about how many more
calls EMS takes per day as an example,
But what they are responding to, the kind of challenges they face in the field, the dangers
they are exposed to, it's just to me, it just didn't make any sense that they're not
considered essential.
And to be clear, the bill is narrowly tailored, right?
It's meant to just reduce some of that red tape, make sure they qualify for some of that
funding without increasing burdens on municipalities or counties.
And to be able to, you know, 16 other states have already done this.
And Georgia would be, hopefully, the 17th of it finally passes this time around.
Okay, so it's HB-154.
So lay it out for us exactly what it is.
Well, it just declares that EMS is a central service.
So that means that it's an essential service
in terms of the people involved.
What can they get out of it?
Maybe break that down a little bit more.
They will be able to, if they,
they can get grants, federal grants.
They can get, you know, monies
when they have to do this additional payroll
and these additional services out there
able to re-keep some of that funding.
And I think a big thing in this bill is that it doesn't do
anything with the zoning category.
That is a large topic, I think, is where the designated
zones and who works what zone to know.
This bill does nothing to interfere, address that.
So it's just about getting the service classified as essential.
And I know that that has been an issue in the past.
But before we go any further, I want to hear from one of the,
of a couple of lawmakers who have EMS services in their background.
Republican Representative Beth Camp of Concord began working
as a 9-1-1 operator at 17 years old.
And she later became an emergency medical technician for a while.
And she talked to me last year about the job
and what she witnessed.
There's fatalities, sometimes they're children,
oftentimes they're violent.
It's just, it's a lot.
And I'll be honest with you, I could shut my eyes
and tell you all about things that happen
almost 30 years ago because they, they're still with me.
Yeah, PTSD, representative Dexter Sharper,
he is a paramedic.
He also talked about the middle strain
of what he's witnessed on the job.
And that's part of it also, if they were to apply for a grant to help with PTSD, if
they're not an essential service, they may have a harder time getting it.
Yeah, it just requires more steps, more paperwork.
For them, it's sort of like you're saying, oh, and I know that's not what anybody is
specifically saying, but in terms of paperwork, in terms of logistics, in terms of technicalities,
you're saying proof to us that you are essential.
And it was, you know, Chairwoman Camp is 100% right.
A lot of what she is sharing are things that my husband and his colleagues will share
with you that these calls don't really leave them and you kind of think about them and
you sort of, a lot of times you're kind of left wondering too because you never get to
see a lot of these outcomes.
Yeah.
I think some of the TV shows get into them when I always think, how do they do what they
do?
Anything you wanted to add?
Well, these people that work so hard in this industry, in this business, and they come
up, they never know what they're going to face when they get a call, when they pull
up and that car is laid over. They don't know what's inside as they have to go in and
try and take care of those people as they're coming out of it. So, I absolutely consider
them essential and I just think it's only fair that they be classified what they are.
Okay. The good news is tomorrow is a good day. Tell me what's going to happen.
Yeah. The hope is that it'll be on the House 4 for my understanding. Okay.
you know fingers crossed and but then you know you got to continue it onto the
Senate so that'll be the next big hurt okay well we'll keep up with this and
we'll certainly be watching so people tune in for our capital report report tomorrow
so let's talk about how the session has been so far with crossover day
coming so your thoughts on how how how things have gone anything in particular
you're glad past or like to see past before Thursday yeah so for us you know
it's a it's a biannual meeting there's gonna be two sessions for this for this
term and the first one tends to be a little slower and then all of a sudden we all realize
where we are in the session and everybody is scrambling to get their bills done so the
days are definitely getting a lot longer. But, you know, I'm really, really excited to
be voting on bills related to housing. House bill 399 was passed out of the house today
which would require those who own more than 25 properties to have a direct contact which
as somebody who has sort of these rental properties in their neighborhood, it's difficult
because you don't have someone to reach out to to talk to.
And on my end, we're continuing to work on issues related
to lowering people's utility rates.
I've been doing a lot of research
on the Consumer Utility Council,
recently introduced a bill on that,
to see if we can bring that back,
because it used to exist before the recession,
and we're hoping to maybe see if there's a way
to bring them back.
We've talked about that one, we'll keep an eye on that one.
You had a drone bill pass, talk about that.
I did, I'm very excited about that.
We passed it through the house last week,
which was my first bail, and that was an exciting time.
And you got a little bit of teasing.
Yeah, you get a tremendous amount of teasing.
And it's your first bail, yeah.
It is very nerve-wracking to go through that,
but it was an exciting time.
And once the bill passes, everybody comes up
and congratulating you.
And it's just, it's a very exciting time
in the camaraderie for everybody.
Both sides of the aisle come up and just congratulate.
Now, we had a couple today that had their first pills
and it just means a lot.
And I guess that's the official stamp
that you're a part of the process in the team.
Part of the family.
Part of the family.
And so now we're trying to get that, we've been assigned.
What does it do?
what it does is that it'll put a buffer around
ticketed events.
So if you're at a concert or you're at another type
of event, just ticketed, disgated,
it keeps a drone from coming in and disrupting
privacy and a nuisance.
You know, I know you've been in some areas before
and all of a sudden drones start going around
and you focus in more on the drone than what's going on
around that you paid to go and see and be a part of.
So hopefully we can get it across the finish line.
I'm excited about the next step.
And we'll just see how that process goes.
Anything quickly you'd like to see before Thursday?
Just getting through.
OK.
I mean, today it was long and the bar is going to be long.
And so we're just excited.
Hang in there.
OK.
Well, I want to thank you both for coming on the show today.
Thanks for having us.
We'll keep up with your bills.
Thank you for having us.
We appreciate it.
You're welcome.
That does it for lawmakers today.
We'll be back tomorrow for day 27.
And that's the last legislative day
before crossover day on Thursday.
And as we bid you farewell,
we want to continue celebrating this show's
55th anniversary.
We'd like to send you off with a look back
at the day legendary singer Ray Charles performed
at the Capitol on March 7th, 1979.
Right.
That's really cool.
Daughter
The phone
This old sweet song
keeps your smile
Or Roger, is there?
Or Roger, are they?
And it's all
Call my mom
Come, listen to me then, spill
