March the 27th is the 160th anniversary of a convocation of meeting between President Abraham Lincoln, General Elysses Grant, and Richard Morrell, David Dixon Porter, General William Sherman, who just months earlier burned down Atlanta. They made it City Point, Virginia to strategize on how to end the Civil War, how to end the conflict between the states. And as a proud descendant of the South and as a proud descendant of the formerly enslaved, it's interesting to consider that only about 24% of southerners owned slaves. The vast majority 76% did not, and the vast majority were too poor to afford slaves. Somehow poor uneducated southerners fought and died for the right to own something that they could not afford. This was a rich man's war fought by America's poorest and least educated. There was a convocation 160 years ago today to end that war. And then just 13 days later, General Robert Ely on April 9, 160 years ago, surrendered at Appomattox. The meeting from 13 days later led to the capitulation 13 days afterwards. Then just six days later, there was an assassination. The 16th President became the first President, assassinated on April 15. Abraham Lincoln spent his last days trying to end the war that claimed the lives of 750,000 soldiers. What's interesting is that the 160th anniversary of Lincoln's last days is during this year's Holy Week. Holy Week 2025 is not only an invitation to remember the last days of Lincoln's leadership, but it's an invitation to remember the last days of Jesus' leadership. The assassination of President Lincoln will be remembered on April 15, on April 18. We will remember the execution of Jesus of Nazareth. But then on April 20, we will remember the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus to Christ. And I noticed in coming here today that you just got new Bibles as you entered this building today, spoiler alert, your new book, Revolve Resolves at Resurrection. How are you going to spend your last days in the Georgia General Assembly of 2025? Exploitation, assassination, execution, or resurrection? Making war or ending war, helping or hurting, being a burden or being a blessing. Jesus is the proof that you can change the world in your last days. So walk together children. Don't you get weary? There is a great camp meeting in the Promised Land. Oh God, our helping ages past, our hope for years to come, our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home. God, we submit ourselves as your servants in this day. May we surrender to the love of Christ. May we surrender to the one who laid down his life that we might live more abundantly. Christ's name we pray. Amen.

you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you till and part of medicine, maybe the most effective part of medicine, and that is the doctor-patient relationship. I don't need to remind you, but to implore maybe if I must, that we've all been in that position where either a pharmaceutical company makes something that's just not affordable, or a payer won't pay, and you have to pre-certify, and God forbid, something of a legislative mandate that may get in the way of anything. So keep that in mind to preserve and protect that as you work through your days here. And once again, thank you for helping to preserve and protect that sacred right. But thank you more for your dedication and your service to the great people of the great state of this great country. Again, thank you very much and have a great day. Thank you. We have some very special guests from Lannan's County here with us today. Secretary, read the caption. In our recent resolution through 27, by Senator Gurman of the Eighth and Others, a resolution recognized in commanding Lannan's county on its occasion of its vice-entennial and further purposes, where Lannan's county was created by a night to the Georgia General Assembly on this summer 23rd, 1825, marking 200 years of a particular history and progress. Whereas today, Lannan's county is home to a thriving population of approximately 120,700 residents and serves as the regional home for economic growth and vitality, whereas Lannan's county is home to moody air force base, which plays a critical role in national defense and local economy. Whereas the municipalities of Lannan's county including Valdosta, Hayhara, Dasha Lake Park, and Rammerton, contribute to the county's diverse environment community that therefore be resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize the command of the Lons County on this occasion of its bicentennial and we send best wishes for a continued prosperity and success, Ms. President, that completes the order. Is there objection to adoption and resolution? Chair here's none and the resolution is adopted. Recognize Senator from the eight. Well thank you, Ms. President. It is an honor for me to have my friends from Lons County here, 200 years since the founding of Lons County. I've also asked for my son, JR, to come up here because JR's fifth grade grandfather was actually one of the first county commissioners and I've always thought he was the first legislative represent Lons County, but he was the second after I researched it this weekend. So for me to be representing Lons County, 200 years later, it's a pretty special thing and just thank you, Mr. Governor, for allowing us to do this and the members of the chamber. And if you don't mind, I'd like to ask my good friend, Chairman Bill Slaughter to say a few words. Thank you, Russ. I want to just tell everyone just really, just how much we appreciate the heavy lifting that this body did for not only Lons County, but South Georgia area. As you know, of course we were devastated by hurricanes within 13 months. We had some localized flooding. We had two hurricanes, straight line winds that just did a tremendous amount of damage to South Georgia. The agricultural industry, the timber industry, there was no one that was left untouched. But with the help from this body right here, we're beginning to get back to where we need to be. So again, I just want to thank you. It's a great opportunity to come before you. It is our 200 by Centennial. We'll be having a lot of celebrations in Lons County. So if you have your opportunity to get down there, come down and just take a few minutes and enjoy our community. You'll be more than welcome. And again, thank you all very, very much for what you've done for South Georgia through these disasters that we've had to deal with. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a very special people from North Georgia with us today. Secretary, read the caption. Senate resolution 443 by Senator Goose to the 51st and others resolution commanding camp policing upon its 100th anniversary and for other purposes. Whereas in 1925, an effort to find a new location for a summer camp, wherever in EDHail and wherever in H.L. Bird arranged to use four dirt floor cabins in an open picnic shelter on two acres owned by the Delanaga Chamber of Commerce located north to town near Cane Creek Falls. Whereas the first summer camp's attendance of 26 campers is grown to over 3,200 summer campers and nearly 12,000 annual guests. The four original cabins have expanded to over 420 year-round beds. And the two acres of least property have grown to 380 acres owned by Gleason. And whereas the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church has been committed to the impacts of decades of Gleason's campers who have practiced loving God and loving their neighbor becoming better and more capable citizens. And I'll therefore be resolved by the Senate that the members of this body command camp Gleason upon its 100th anniversary for its contribution to the Church and Society, the strengthening of the Christian character in summer leadership, capacity of countless children youth and young adults miss present, I completely see you order. Here's the objection to the downtown resolution. Here's none and the resolution is adopted. Recognize the majority leader speaks as a resolution. All righty. Good morning, senators. It's a great day to be. And the State Capitol brings some friends from my district. Today we recognize 100 years of camp Gleason. What began in 1925 with four dirt floor cabins and just 26 campers has grown into one of Georgia's most beloved institutions of faith and community, serving over 3,200 summer campers and 12,000 annual guests every year on 380 beautiful acres near downtown Dallanaga. For a century now, camp Gleason has embodied the message to love God and love their neighbor, words that have guided generations of campers and their growth and their leadership. This is more than just a summer camp. It's a sacred place where lifelong friendships are formed, where marriages begin, and where young people find their place in the family of faith. The camp has been a Dallanaga hallmark. For centuries, it was a gathering place for indigenous people. At one time and even powered the city of Dallanaga's towering iron water will. And today, it remains a source of reflection, inspiration and awe for campers and guests alike. On behalf of the Georgia Senate, and is someone deeply proud of what this organization represents, thank you, camp Gleason, for the impact you are making to many, many Georgians lives. I want to especially thank the guests that are here with me today standing behind me as executive director Russell Davis, board chairman, Reverend Bill Martin, board member Bill Hardman, co-chairs of the 100th anniversary steering committee, Lee Haasmith and Katie Horn. Thank you for the rest of the board, staff, volunteers, and everyone who has shaped Gleason's story over the past century. May the next 100 years be filled with even more joy, more growth, and more young people sent out into the world, ready to depart to serve. Senators, please welcome to the podium executive director, Russell Davis. Thank you. Senator Gouge, the Lieutenant Governor Jones, and members of the Senate, we appreciate this honor, and on behalf of the United Methodist of North Georgia and our Bishop, we thank you for the opportunity to celebrate this 100th anniversary. We look forward to continuing to serve all of Georgia's children, youth, and young adults in building relationships, in deepening their Christian character, in growing their ability to have servant leadership, and to helping to develop new generations for the next 100 years. Thank you for this honor today. Senators, if you or anyone in your family has ever been to Camp Gleason for a camp or whatever, visit, come on up and take a picture with us. Please join us.

Today, we're excited to welcome members of the hope, Animal Assisted Crisis Response Team to the Georgia Senate. They're a national nonprofit, and they pair highly trained handlers with trained crisis response canines, and they've been doing this for 25 years. So today, we've got members of Hope Southeast Region. We've got Sweet Pea and her handler, Melanie Dallas, who many of you also know as CEO of the Highland Rivers Behavioral Health, and she lives in Pickens County. All of her and his handler, Dave Thomas from Caluita County, and Robby and his handler, Tammy McGill, from Gwyneth County, as well as mylamitial Hope Area Coordinator of the Southeast Region who lives in the Cab County. The mission of the organization is to provide comfort and encouragement to individuals affected by disasters and crises by providing animal assisted support. In 2024, the Hope Team from the Southeast logged close to 150 hours and engaged in 1200 interactions with Georgia disaster victims. They're prepared to support our communities on location, and they often deploy on very short notice. These teams are extensively trained in incident command, first aid in CPR for humans and canines, emotional first aid, and trauma recognition. And they work alongside local and national response agencies, such as FEMA and the American Red Cross. Ways that the Hope teams can help you, they can do death notifications, they can respond to traumatic events that affect schools, structure fires, suicides, multi-casual events, emergency rooms, and many other things. So I hope that you all will welcome our emotional support animals today, and I'm gonna ask Melanie Dallas to come and say a few words. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you so much. It is a true honor to be here, and we are so grateful for this recognition. It's also a privilege that we have to serve Georgians all over the state who are affected by disaster. Some of the things that you may have heard about that have happened in our communities are places that we've actually deployed to. We were at the Appalachian High School shooting. We actually had an extended time where we actually supported the school system and families in that sense. We have actually been embedded with Coast Guard. We do yellow ribbon campaigns with the National Guard. We have responded to suicide deaths, just actually recently to support staff that have been impacted, law enforcement, line of duty deaths, and even recently we had 42 teams nationally that deployed to California to support what was happening based on the California fires. So again, it is a privilege that we have to support Georgians affected by disaster, and if you know of a disaster in your area, we've got some information with Senator Kirkpatrick. You can look us up, hope, AACR.org. Feel free to call us if you feel like there's a need in your community. Again, thank you. We are sincerely grateful to be honored here today by the Senate.

I'm going to introduce you the I had the football team up here the other day. I'm going to introduce you the former athletic director at that school. He's a hall of fame coach not in the hall of fame but you know it's H. E. W. L. the wind one state championship. This is number one 14 state championships at the high school that he was at.

But he's been a long time friend. I would like to you to meet.

And I just wanted to bring him here because I call him a hall of fame coach. Majority leader. Majority leader. I'd like to introduce to you all my friend. Former athletic director and coach at Northeast high school, Alvin Copeland. I'd like to thank you very much Senator Lucas. I did not do all that by myself. Coach Luke's worked on our staff too so he was a helping getting all that kind of stuff done. And it wasn't in just one sport. We did it in different sports. Girls basketball, boys, strike and feel. And they they were just good kids and I just love them the death and the things that we have to do is to try to get in the kids ahead and let them know what life is about and what you need to do to be successful. They see me now and always talking about things that I made them do. And of course I didn't really have to make them do it, but they wanted to do it anyway. Little things that happened with us and I'll just tell you this. One night we came to Atlanta to play basketball and we won the game where we played like crap. So we got back to the school. I told them, okay, well I tell you all what. Call your parents because we're going to practice tonight. It was about 11 o'clock. So we got back. So they all went and had coach must be crazy. I hear a mumbling that. I said, yeah, you think I'm crazy. Well, what happened was I made them all dress and come sit in the center of the floor. They all sat down and I got ready in the middle of the circle and I talked for about 10 minutes. I said, okay, get your stuff on and go home to your parents. They looked, but now that turned in. Coach made us play basketball 11 o'clock at night and that is far from the truth, but they love to tell that. But I want to thank Coach Lucas for seeing fear too. Honour me with this kind of award. And I want to thank all the people here who got a chance to see me everywhere. I go folk telling me I've been not do anything because everybody knows. I said, no, that's not true.

Thank you, Mr. President. I'm colleagues today. I rise to recognize and celebrate executive function day at Georgia State Capitol. This momentous occasion marks the first time such recognition has been granted in both chambers of Georgia General Assembly. Understanding the value and significance of teaching executive function, the cognitive and effective skills essential for students and learners of all ages to succeed in literacy, science, math, and everyday life. Recognizing executive function day highlights the connection of a student's overall cognitive skills with their mental health and with their mental well-being. In a world where the demands of daily life continue to grow, nurturing and explicitly teaching executive function abilities is essential for helping students navigate challenges and pursue their lifelong goals effectively. I want to recognize the day in the gallery and thank Sue Chautau and C.E.O. and founder of the E.H.Q. and the Nation leading expert in the brain science of executive function. And I apologize for a mispronouncement. I apologize for a mispronouncement. Thank you. If you all would, if everybody would please give a hand, I apologize. As I stated, she's in the gallery today and I appreciate that. Thank you all and I yield a will. Thank you. I'm going to recognize the center from the left. Thank you, Mr. President. It's my honor to date to recognize some good South Georgia folks. I'm going to recognize the center from the right. Thank you all for being here with us. If you want to thank me, let's give it a hand. Everybody gets done with the masters. They can head down to the Thomasville to the Rose Parade and the Rose Festival. Good food, good quail hunting and good shopping in a historic town town. Then come to Thomasville. Thank you all for being here. Thank you all for being here. Thank you all for being here. Thank you. I'm going to recognize the center from the 50th second. Thank you, Mr. President. I've got a group of students here from the Rome City School System, a school that prepared my daughter well. One of my three children went there and she's working on her PhD in physics. Thanks to their training and they were pretty good training athletically for her as well. Dr. Eric Holland is the superintendent there and his motto is, I believe in you. And so what we've got here today is the Rome City School Student Advisory Council that's a group of students in grade 7 through 12 who discuss how the decisions are made the school level affecting students. They amplify the student voice and equip students take action by advocating for solutions. So this is the group diverse group plays a vital role in shaping the educational experience for the Roam City School students. They provide an available insights and feedback and they've already had meetings with the Roam City commissioners, the Roam Board of Education. And now they're down here with us and if you guys would stand up, we'll recognize you being here today. Good mile round of applause. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. I'm going to recognize Senator from the 28th. You do you want to do it from your chair, Senator? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, senators. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you on an issue that is deeply personal to me. Autism. The autism spectrum disorder affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. It's estimated that one in 36 children in the United States has autism, with boys nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed than girls. Here in Georgia, approximately one in 48 year old children have been identified as ASD. Early detection is crucial as autism can sometimes be diagnosed as early as 18 months or by age two or three. A reliable diagnosis can often be made. However, racial and ethnic disparities still exist when it comes to diagnosis and access to resources. The issue is personal because my grandson, Bryce James, has autism. Six feet tall and is only 14 years old, he is brilliant. But at age seven, he had not been diagnosed. He was nonverbal and he walked on his tipi toes like a ballerina. Once he was diagnosed and he started getting treatments, the young man now makes straight A's and he has won so many medals with the Olympic... What is the one for disabled children? Children like Bryce have immense potential yet they are often misjudged simply because they interact in the world differently. I'm proud to stand before you today to provide additional information on two critical pieces of legislation. The Senate Bill 211 and House Bill 465 that came over from the House with unanimous votes in all the committee process that it went to, including on the floor. They aim to protect some of the most vulnerable citizens. SB211 is the autism missing person alert system at. It creates a statewide alert system designed to locate individuals with autism who go missing. And these children go missing from nursery school, they go missing from middle and high school. They just walk away and often they don't notice that they are gone. They think they just didn't go to school that day. And we know that those on that spectrum face unique challenges often being drawn to water sources like lakes and rivers. And many who have disappeared have been found in swimming pools. But maybe they even their own that they swim in all the time when they are supervised or they are never found. This bill ensures that law enforcement, the governor's office and the community partners can act swiftly and prioritize searches in high risk areas. I was extremely proud to author this bill and I am hopeful that language from this bill can be included in future legislation. We must protect our state's children who have this disorder. And you know many people said that the Matty's bill covered this. But it does not I read the bill, I read the law and it is for cognitive mental disorders like dementia and others. And it is not for autism because autism is a developmental disorder. And it does not include that Matty's law is for adults. And the children are the ones who are missing and never found here in the state of Georgia even. To 11 the autism. Senator, go ahead and ramp it up. You passed your time. I am trying to talk to you. I am from the south. Okay, let me just sum it up by saying that I hope that we can look at House Bill 265 because it bills on that effort of expanding the Matty's call. And Matty's call does not include this group of children. My only difference in the one from the Senate is that I wanted to add a bracelet or a band for those children so they could be diagnosed and not thrown in the jail, get hurt if the police see them running or doing something. So thank you for listening to me. I hope that we can do something about autism in the state of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Recognize Senator from the 7th. Thank you, Mr. President. We are not safer when we silence dissent. We are not stronger when we deport voices of conscience. We are not America if we punish people for daring to speak their truth. Colleagues, I rise today because of what is happening in our country. To legal immigrants, to student activists, to people who dare to believe that America stood for freedom is nothing short of a national disgrace. Let me say this plainly. The Trump administration is using our immigration system as a weapon against political dissent. They are targeting green card holders, visa holders, international students, not because they've broken the law, but because they dare to speak up, because they marched, because they held signs, and because they believed in free speech. Let me ask you this. Since when did becoming an activist become grounds for deportation? Since when did holding a different opinion than Marco Rubio or Donald Trump mean that you don't belong in this country? And I'll tell you something personal that keeps me up at night. I've been out there too. I've organized protests. I've spoken out. I've challenged those in power loudly and publicly. And the only thing that's protecting me from being thrown in a detention center or being shipped off to Guantanamo Bay is the fact that I was born on this soil. My citizenship is the thin line standing between me and the same kind of retaliatory crackdown we are seeing right now. We've seen a Columbia graduate student stripped of his green card and threatened with deportation because he joined a protest. A brown university professor, a doctor detained and deported because of photos on her phone. A Georgetown researcher was detained without charges over his views and his wife's Palestinian heritage. A Turkish doctoral student was just locked up without charges. And these are not isolated mistakes. These are intentional messages. And the message is this. If you challenge us, we will come for you. That should terrify every single American because this is this isn't just about immigrants. This is about the erosion of our rights. This is about free speech and this is about due process. And this is about the fact that the people this country once welcomed as neighbors, scholars, workers and classmates are now being treated like enemies simply for caring for justice. If they can do it to a permanent resident today, they could do it to a citizen tomorrow. If they can arrest someone for caring a protest sign, they can arrest you for wearing a t-shirt. This is not how a democracy behaves. This is how authoritarian regimes operate. Now some of my colleagues will say, well, coming to America is a privilege, not a right. To them, I say, being an American means nothing if we value the, if we abandon the values that define us. Free speech is not a privilege. It is a right. Peaceful protest is not terrorism. It is patriotism. And being an activist doesn't make you a threat. It makes you courageous. Let me remind you, some of the greatest changes in our nation history, civil rights, women's suffrage, labor protections came from people who were told to sit down and shut up. And think God, they didn't. Because the moment we start punishing people for demanding better, we lose what makes America worth fighting for in the first place. To every student watching this, whether you're a student at UGA, Georgia State, Gwyneth Tech or Georgia Tech, I see you. I support you and I will not let this government bully you into silence. And to the Trump administration, if you think you can terrify our students into silence, if you think you can deport a way to set, you don't know a darn thing about the spirit of this country. Because we were built by the bold. We were shaped by the brave and we will not be broken by cowardice in a suit and tie. Thank you, Mr. President, I you go well. I recognize majority leader. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. President. Senators, we have a lot of champions in the building today. There are a lot of groups here from all over our districts. I have one as well. Up in the gallery, I have a group of girls wrestlers that won state championships this year back in January. The team won in the duels and the traditional meat. They're joined today by our superintendent Sharon Head, deputy superintendent Greg Trammell, coaches Scott DeGraf, Sean Mullins and Jesse Ascugh. To the wrestlers, and I may get this name botched up a little bit, Greta, Garbuzovis and Nora Garbuzovis, were individual state winners as well. Thank you, ladies, for visiting your state capital today. And congratulations to your victories and go do it some more and go Indians. Y'all give these girls a big warm welcome to the Georgia capital. Thank you, Senator. Senator, recognize the senator from the 20th. Perry, Georgia's pride and joy, senator from the 20th. This president, colleagues, a former member of this body went to his heavenly home on March 23rd. Clarence Ed Barker. He was 90 years old. He served in this body from 1973, which is the year my father came into the house until 1991. He served with my while my father was here, he also served while the president's father was here. He had a lifetime of service, really fine man. And I know that when he was, we came to the pearly gates, he was welcome with a job well done, my good and faithful servant. So our heart goes out to his wife, Janet, and to his family. I want them to know that they are in our thoughts and prayers. And I would ask the senate to please join me in a moment of silence to pray for the family and as they celebrate the life of Senator Ed Barker. Please give the senator a moment of Senator's acid, every member stand. And remember one of our fallen colleagues. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator. Appreciate you bringing that to our attention. Recognize Senator from 35th. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. I am here to continue to sound the alarm about what is going on in Washington and how it's impacting Georgia directly. And now I'm not talking about a signal chat or attack plans. I am talking about something much more important than that, especially for folks here in Georgia. I am talking about health care. Yesterday the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminated $12 billion in grants to states and local health departments. These cuts could cost Georgia around $200 million. $200 million in funding for mental health services, for health care, and for the well-being of our community. And when you couple this $200 million with the many other cuts that we've seen, the impact of Georgia and its families continues to increase. But I want to warn you about something more specific than that. The administration stated that these grants...

were pandemic era grants that were no longer needed. Well, colleagues, I can tell you what's next on the chopping block. Enhance subsidies for health insurance, including health insurance that is on Georgia access, a program that many of you in this chamber like to tout as a success because it ensures 1.5 million Georgia's. The vast majority of those that are insured under Georgia access are using enhanced subsidies to pay for those health insurance premiums. If Congress does not renew enhanced subsidies for health insurance, it will make Georgia access inaccessible. It will make Georgia access meaningless because 93% of those people would not be able to afford health insurance on the program. And let me tell you what that means for us. That means an additional 1 million Georgians without health insurance. Whether you buy into the half million Georgians that already do not have health insurance, or if you say it's less than that, you're going to add a million people to that uninsured bucket. We have been in this situation before and with a million people without health insurance, our health insurance system will break. With a million people uninsured, our health care system will break. We cannot be silenced on this. We have to speak out on it, but we also have to prepare for this disaster. And for those of you who are wondering why these cuts are being made, I'm going to repeat, it is being made for the $4 trillion tax cut for Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and his buddies. Tax cuts that the vast majority of Georgians won't see in their pay check. This is wrong, it is unjust, it is unfair, and we have to stop it. Mr. President, I yield the well. We're going to send it from the 26th. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank many of us for all of our money. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President. I thank many of us for all of this to try to serve the folks in the state of Georgia and serve our districts. One of the most probably things that I have done as an elected official is be able to go to department heads and departments with one of my constituents has a problem and they say I've called, I've called, I can't get anybody to answer my call. And they have an advocate for them today as I was at home last week. And my wife picked up the phone and showed me something. Now, the gentleman from the 21st, my warm and close and trusted training. But we've had some hot arguments in this body. And sometimes I've vehemidly objected to what he does. But he's won out of Georgia. He's part of this body. And he's been selected to head up the United States and the United States for training. He's supposed to start sometime around May 1st. I won't him not to forget from where he come from. That he served in the body that supposedly was able to try to help him. And I want to tell him when he gets to Washington. When he calls me to help me, I want him to tell them that I'm not a DEI. I'm qualified because I know how to count money. And see if you don't know how to count money, you're in a world of trouble. You can't pay your bills. Folks call you all day, all night long telling you what you owe. And I just want to let him know that when you call me to save with you, I'm not a DEI. I'm qualified and that's what you need to tell him. Why? Because the son of the from the 26 knows how to count that money. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you might not agree with him. I specifically don't agree with him on a lot of money. But he's been chosen. He will lead this body. And I just think it's appropriate that we as his colleagues, even though we don't agree with his politics, give him a round of applause for being chosen to go to DC and work in the new federal administration. So if you don't mind standing and just give him a clap because he can come and join. Mr. President, he's absent. I don't know why, but you know, he's absent a lot of time. I yield a will. Never dull moment. Thank you, Senator, for the 26. Any other points of personal privilege? I don't think anybody wants to follow that one anyway. Senator, for the 55th, do you have a motion? Yes, sir, Mr. President. I ask that S. R473 be removed from the consent calendar of privileged resolutions. Secretary, the caption. Senate resolution 473 by Sir Mangum of the 55th and others built between resolution honoring the Black man lab or dedication empowering Black men and reaching the community and further purposes. Mr. President, I can be sure to order. Mr. President, proceed to Senate rule 3, 1.7. I ask unanimous consent that S. R473 be withdrawn from consideration. Here's the objection. Here, none. Motion granted. Thank you, sir. Do I see the fiance at the center from the 53rd, back there in the bank? Let's give her a round of applause, putting up with the center from the 53rd. When is the wedding date? When is the wedding date? May 1st, May 3rd. You still got time, honey. You still got time. He way outkicked his coverage with you. No, we're glad to have you. He's a man. He's a good man. You have a consent calendar of privileged resolutions. Does any Senator wish to remove the resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair, here's none. And resolution on the consent calendars are adopted. Are there any motions withdrawn or commit? You have a four-year consent calendar of local bills. Secretary, do you have, we have the objections? The president, Senator Jackson of the 41st, parent of the 44th and wicks of the 34th have filed an objection to Senate Bill 350, pursuant to Senate Rule 4-2.8B, which is on the local consent calendar for today. And hereby request that it be removed to the local contested calendar. SB 350 will remove it from the consent calendar. We'll take it out separately. Is there objection to agree into the board of committee on the state and local governmental operations, which is favorable to the passes of bills on the local consent calendar? Chair, here's none. The board of committee has agreed to. Questions on the passes of the bill on the local consent calendar? All those in favor vote, yay, opposed nay. Secretary, I'm not the machine. Thank you. You have a vote. On the passage of the bill, the A's, R 52, N's, R zero, this bill on the local consent calendar, have received the requisite constitutional majority as therefore passed. All right, six, here, three, SB 350 and the amendment, please. Gave the bill 350 by Senator Jackson. The 41st and others, bill has been commendant, and act providing for the compensation of certain County officers and officials to the cab County approved March 31, 1976, as amended, so it is the compensation of certain judges, judicial officers and County officers to make conforming changes already to court names, changed by general laws, related matter, sure pill, conflicted laws, and for other purposes, Mr. President of the State and local government operations, recommends to this bill do pass, exactly submitted, and are dictated and chairment. Mr. President, Senator Jackson, the 41st, offers following amendment number one to amend Senate Bill 350 by replacing 75% on lines 25 and 26 with 80% by replacing 31.984-3266-41319% on line 33 with 32% by replacing lines 47 through 50 with the following. A annual salary of the clerk of the State Court of Ticada County shall be 90% of the annual salary received by the clerk of the Spirit Court of Ticada County and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I'll be right back. Right on the center from the 41st. Thank you, Mr. President. Okay, this is a local bill for the Cab County. We just needed to make an amendment to that bill and that's why it's been pulled off. We're not actually contesting the heart of the bill. We still very much believe in it. But we are making just a few corrections. One, our tax commissioner came in and asked that and it just like everyone else is getting a cola that we would provide a cola for the tax commissioner as well. So that's what you're seeing here reflected. Our Board of Commissioners asked for their salary to not be 31.98% but they have just around even number of 32% which I do think is reasonable. And then we are giving some raises to our state court judges, magistrate judges and private judges. I will say everyone in the Cab County, all the judges involved in this are happy with this. This appeared court judges have asked to not be a part of this bill because later on this year we will be hearing a bill that will impact their salary. So again, this is a local bill. We just needed to make an amendment to get it all really clean here. And I please ask your favorable consent on this amendment as well. Thank you. Senator has yielded. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. And in previous questions ordered. We have a question on amendment number one authored by senator from the 41st. Is there objection to amendment number one? Hearing none, amendment number one is added. Is there objection to agreeing to the 40 committee which is available to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The party committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Senator from the 20th. What purpose do you rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Section requiring. I guess this came through the Senate SLOGO committee. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Can you tell us what the vote was out of the committee? You know, as much as I like to retain all those votes in my hand. I did not vote. I left that one off my memory block here. I am sure the senator from the 41st can enlighten. I will ask her off line. Thank you. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. All those in favor of the bill will vote. Thank you. Thank you. The bill is not allowed. The bill is not allowed. The bill is not allowed. All the pass of the bill, the yeas are 52, nays are zero. This bill can receive direct constitutional measurements for pass as amended. Moving on to the rules calendar. Secretary Reed, House bill 428. House bill 428 by Representative Franklin on 160th and others. New 적lund two, one, title 31 of the official Georgia agency. Dos , member of clovesfire, purple, or spreads and other families.

So it's about that nothing in Georgia law prohibits or prevents an individual from obtaining individual fertilization in the state to rise for definition Try for later matters to our legislators find it's your bill looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order Good doctor from Savannah, Georgia Thank you, Mr. President It's my privilege today to bring you House Bill 428. This was an announced speakers party in early this year and he chose a wonderful person and couple to To carry this bill in the house, Representative Franklin is the epitome of In vitro fertilization should be clarified and legal in the state of Georgia This this bill is a simple bill it's just two pages really just one and a half and it clarifies the definition of in vitro fertilization Then it goes on to state that there is no prohibition it is it is by law in our state It will be in our O CGA and It serves a great purpose in that In vitro fertilization is something that many couples have to go through Representative Franklin and his wife Let me just say that in Senate Health and Human Services, Representative Franklin shared his story Their story together of the challenges of having children and they had spent multiple years 14 years praying about this Natasans chemicals hormones etc vitamins and so forth and had been unsuccessful But now They had been successful through in vitro fertilization itself and so he they were a great couple To represent what in vitro fertilization does for our Does for our community and She and he or their pregnant and do June 3rd and at the end of May We'll be delivering a baby through in vitro fertilization.
