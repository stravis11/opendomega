TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
I want to first of all, I thought about this morning, is that even though this seemed
like a very fast session, it's been a very educational session, I'll say.
And I just want to look at everybody and tell you how much I appreciate the committee
members.
I was concerned I may forget about that at the end.
And I look forward to working with y'all next year again.
And in the meantime, I know several of us have talked about different things that we may
want to work with and talk about over the summer.
So if you have any of those type of suggestions that will help us move things a little bit
forward faster next year, we will be very open to doing that.
So please don't think about that.
I think we've got all, I think all of us
got each other's cell phone numbers
and that type of thing for communication purposes.
So, okay.
Senator Burns, please do the prayer for us.
What number are you?
If you will join me, we'll open in prayer.
Rather, this is your day.
You made it, you shared it with us.
You've given us the opportunity of making a difference.
Thank you.
Be with this committee as we address the issues
before a higher education in Georgia
and give us your wisdom and your patience and Christ's name.
Amen.
So I think we've, I thought I knew what chaos was,
but I think I've learned more about chaos today.
From bills going back and forth,
what's going to be on the agenda,
not on the agenda and so forth, so on.
So we've actually had several things
that have left the agenda that will be tabled,
But most importantly, we've got Chairman Martin here
for two bills.
And we were ready because you got a committee meeting
and started at 130 and we don't want to hold you up.
Yes, sir.
So we, yes, and we will, you tell the bill number
and the LC numbers so we make sure we all,
I don't think we're going to be Jason.
I don't see Jason.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
We have two before us today.
If if if it please the chair, I think we were waiting on Senator out of it's already to come for a portion of
249 I'd go to 319 first. If that please chair. Thanks, sir
Are we still working off the
We're still working off the as-passed house version of mr. Chairman if we're we're doing that we're working off LC 50
zero force seventy nine is that is that correct that's what what what this bill
um we we often hear it's all just repeated again this is this is a simple
simple bill although it's twenty five pages long what what the the action
portion of the bill is all in section two point one it basically dissolves a
portion of the Georgia student finance group the Georgia higher education
assistance corporation will be abolished but with this bill and that is a
section of present rallies function that is no longer needed, loans under that, the federal
loans under that program haven't been issued for, I think almost a decade, the state
sold its portfolio to another state and they have been collecting and remaining money.
So if we abolish this, we're not taking anything away from Georgians.
This is just a superfluous piece of bureaucracy right now.
and by abolishing it, when it's the secession is complete, we'll be able to return somewhere
in the neighborhood of $28 million back into the state treasury for allocation, for the
betterment of Georgia.
It's that simple.
The rest of the pages on the bill, two through 25, or references, as we find them in Georgia
code, which probably tells us that our code is a little larger than it needs to be.
But we're just deleting the references to the Georgia Higher Education Assistance Corporation
throughout the rest of the state code.
And I should think our attorney for finding all those for us.
Can I answer any questions?
Ms. Riley, you won't say anything.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
We'll just reiterate what Chairman Martin said.
This is to remove bureaucracy that is no longer needed, the loans that were serviced
by the corporation no longer exists.
That program was suspended at the federal level.
These were federal loans that no longer are in the control of the state of Georgia.
We sold them off 10 years ago.
The revenue-sharing agreement that we entered into for selling them has expired.
And so now all we have left in this corporation are reserve funds that we can transfer with
the dissolution to the authority, which is the second piece of our three-legged stool,
and then that would be available for higher education financial programs in the future.
I was just going to say at the appropriate time I'll be glad to make a move to reduce
the size of the bureaucracy in the country.
Emotion to be made by.
Oh, I'm sorry, all the way out there.
Senator Moore, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
When I first saw this piece of legislation,
my heart skipped a beat because it was so big.
And then I read it and I was super excited about it.
And I love the term, subperpillous bureaucracy.
And you're going to remove that.
So my question for the author is,
where can I send you an invitation
to join the Freedom Caucus?
So anywhere in the 49th house district.
Thank you.
Oh, Senator, Senator Ho.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Can we use that 28 million to fund the funding formula
for the university system?
I understand we're a little short on those funds
on the Senate side.
Thank you for that question.
The funds would need to be used for higher education financial aid, oh financial aid.
Oh, so needs-based scholarships.
Ultimate decisions would be for the members of the general assembly.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
You need to discuss that in just a second.
Yes, right.
Certainly more.
I also was like you this morning when I started reading and I looked at 25 pages and I immediately
and ask her what and tell me what was all about.
That took away a lot of pressure.
So we have a motion from Senator Hustler.
Do we have a second?
Second from Senator Payne.
All in favor?
Say aye.
I'll read you in.
Okay.
Pass is 100%.
Thank you.
And now we can move on to House Bill 249.
And I still don't see Senator Annoverty here.
If it please, Chair, I believe I can cover his section.
If I'm not sure I have the sub in front of any people,
it's not updated.
If I could, is there a copy of the sub to second,
refer to line numbers?
But as we're moving toward that,
the original, the original bill,
which I believe starts in your.
Senator Chairman, hey, wait a minute.
If it please chair, I'm going to speak to you,
original well first, and then I'll go back
to the Senator Anna Vintardi's portion.
But the original bill that came out from the House
is now starts in section two of this bill.
And the idea, if you recall last year in House Bill 1435,
we put in place a merit-based means-tested program
for students that were 80% through their degree
or certification program.
And what this is seeking to do is right size that.
We found out after we had gone last year,
that most financial planning is done on an annual basis.
So the reason we went with 80% is we figured
in a four year program, it was 25%, 50%, 75%.
So we wanted to help people over that last mile
the last year.
So without you'd be 80%, then you'd be 75% finished.
We did not think that for two year programs,
one is not likely to be 80% through,
after one year of a two-year program.
So what this seeks to do is break those into two parts,
a four-year program, and we did lower it from 70 to 80,
I'm sorry, from 80 to 70,
because there is a possibility with maymasters
and that sort of thing that you could be on track
for a four-year graduation,
but not be quite to the 80%
when you're doing your financial planning for the next year.
And again, this is to make people eligible
for the funding, it doesn't mean they get it.
So if a financial advisor at a university looks,
and you're doing a course at a time,
just because you're at 70%,
you're not at your last mile.
So this makes them eligible.
So that's what we seek to do in lines 32 through 35,
is 45% for a two year program,
70% for a four year program.
And then we were finding good results
in the way the money was being allocated in spread.
So we suggest that we raise the maximum total
award to $3,500 again, only $2,500 at max at the time.
And that doesn't guarantee anybody the $2,500 at any
tranche of the draw.
But our idea is to system wide across TCSG and the
university system implement what has been referred to at
Georgia State University as the Panther grant.
This is helping people to get across the finish line.
So that's what we're trying to do in 249 as it pass the
house.
Now, what we have done, Senator Jason Animatari had a bill that I think you all may have
looked at to allow military veterans that were discharged in all of the senators here.
Oh, then I'll yell to the senator if it plays the chair to speak to them.
You were doing such a great job, I just going to leave you know.
I never want to get between a senator and a microphone.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and real quicks want to say thank you to Chairman Martin for his partnership on this bill and allowing us to work on this together.
So you'll see in section one lines 15 through 20, I think to every senator, this should be familiar, this is the CDL training free tuition for veterans that we unanimously.
passed out of the Senate a couple of weeks ago.
And so we've added this language, you'll see on line 15, subject to appropriations by the General Assembly.
And we also put a sunset on this for June 30, 2025 to work with TC SG on this, which I know the Mark PV in the commissioners office approves.
But this is some old language that you saw on Senate Bill 203 with that I'll take any questions.
I think you have a question from Senator Orren.
Thank you.
Well, thanks to Representative Martin for continuing on this journey to provide financial assistance
to needy students that are seeking to move forward and get their degrees.
This is another step forward and I appreciate your leadership in that regard.
I did for my colleague from the Senate a question I would have asked when we were dealing with
this bill before it and fail to do is you're talking to the technical schools leadership.
This includes both private programs training for commercial vehicle licensing as well as
public programs.
Am I reading that right?
So I think the goal with this, I think is to increase the number of enrollees under the technical college system.
I think the concern that I've heard from trucking companies across the state is that a lot of the private companies were doing training, the level of training and sustainability.
For example, if I go to training and I'm going to work at Senator Nanorak's trucking company in East Georgia,
the retention rate of that employee sometimes is 24 hours to 48 hours because they're not being skillfully trained on how to operate a truck.
And I think we've seen the successes of our technical college, far surpassed in some cases.
believe it or not, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but really the private sector,
because of the level of retention.
And I've heard that from trucking company owners
across the state.
So in the other part of this too,
I know you're familiar with the Vector Center
in Macon and Middle Georgia,
where we have soldiers and airmen and women
being honorably discharged from the military,
from like Robbins Air Force Base,
wanting to do something that's non-military,
non-law enforcement, start a company, start a job.
You know, do something totally different
than what their background is in.
And a lot of that interest has also been
in the trucking industry.
And I know they opened a CDL testing site
at the Vector Center in Warner Robbins
because of that interest.
So that's our primary focus with this section.
And I'm very supportive of the bill.
We were able last year in the budget
to get some more training facilities built in
to our technical college system in some key areas.
I know that Coca-Cola, UPS, anybody you talk to
that depends on trucking in the state, the ports,
et cetera, that we have a shortage.
And this doesn't strictly say that they would get
a commercial driver's license classification,
but this is the training that enables them to qualify for that.
And so does this not apply, it does apply to the private sector as well as to our public.
Go ahead, Chairman.
I didn't look at the gentleman's language.
We just moved over his language.
I think it's a practical matter.
What we're saying, Senator, is it's tuition free?
I don't think we can require a probability to provide a program tuition free.
Yeah.
So we're providing it tuition free and that's subject to us backfilling our university.
I don't think we could.
Exactly.
practical matter, this wouldn't apply to the private sector.
That's something we can get going forward.
No, perfectly clear about that.
If I may to Senator Orox first come in about the moves
that we made with the sport of this Senate committee last year
and both the Senate House and the governor,
I want to refer to this completion grant
as merit-based means tested.
Not that there's a problem with needs-based,
But it's meritorious if you're 70% through a degree,
a four year degree, regardless of your financial situation.
And I think just to call it mean needs-based
is not giving the students that would qualify for this.
I know the senator thinks the same thing,
but I just really like us to start referring
to this completion grant as merit-based means tested,
if you will, but it may as best,
because it is meritorious to put your shoulder
to the wheel and get seven.
And have I have moved up?
I'm in many places in a very tough situation.
And if I could follow up with you on that,
and then I'm through with it.
But the language that's been in the law,
there was put in line 26 and 27, a financial aid gap.
Who's making that determination?
And is there any more clarity on what that looks like?
Is it just simply that, well, I'll let you.
And yet, yes, man, it's a bit subject.
There are some other things that are in the bill that are more objective, if you will.
But we have to, to some extent, depend on our people that are on the ground and our
technical colleges and universities.
And the Laundry of Flexible.
Yeah, and I would be less than honest with this committee and I never want to do that
to say that there won't be some leakage in this program.
There will be some people that avail themselves of this money and do not complete a certificate
or a graduation.
But we have leakage in the hope scholarship we have leakage everywhere.
This is a good investment.
In my opinion, this is a good investment on people that have gotten to this point through
hard work and they merit the opportunity for us to invest in them.
And I think being so speedy and responsive to what we've seen in our first year of the
program to come with this legislation is a really important.
We had a lot of help from the folks at the University System, TCSG, and our financial
eight offices around the TCSG and the University System
have been very, very helpful to get this to students.
And we need to get it out as 56 senators and 180
representatives.
We need to let our constituents know that it's available.
Yeah, I'd like to make a motion HB249 LC500593S do pass.
First of all, I fully support the legislation and certainly completion grants have proven
to be a tremendous asset to our students who are nearing that conclusion point and are
prepared now to enter the workforce, totally, totally support that.
I'd come back to Senator Orick's question a little earlier, in Section 1, just to clarify
appropriations by the General Assembly for such purposes so that the General Assembly
would only support those training programs that are provided through either TCSG or
Is that right?
And in truck driving things, the TCS is not correct.
Yes, Senator.
And I do agree with the authors on increasing the level of support.
For 25 to 3500 because at the end of the day, that's the cheapest $1,000 we could ever spend.
And I fully support the bill.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Section one of the bill to the senator and of a tardy.
You know I think this committee and I think the general assembly needs to recognize where
a lot of the problem comes from when it comes to truck driver shortages and that is that
the federal government has mandated that in order to receive a CDL you have to go to truck
driving training school. And this has never been the case until the last couple years.
So even if somebody was in the military and they were driving a truck and they knew how
to drive the truck, when they got out, now the state is going to be subsidizing a further
education of things that they may already know. Or if we've got farm kids in North Georgia
or in South Georgia who have been driving a truck their entire lives, they still have to
go to a truck driving training school and then they have to pay for that education even
though it's not an education that they need.
So I think the federal government has really burdened us
in that sense, and I think this general assembly,
at some point, needs to consider allowing CDLs,
as long as somebody can pass the appropriate test
to have a CDL in the state of Georgia
without having to pay $5,000 for truck driving school.
But I just want to make note of that to the senator.
Yeah, and my response is to my good friend
Northwest Georgia, and we've had plenty of trucking debates between your family, you
know, running trucks and my dad becoming a truck mechanic in Vietnam and running
writer truck shops all over Metro Atlanta. I think the goal of this is, well I do
believe that that is true in the sense of, you know, those maybe that run trucks in
the military and are honorably discharged. I think the vast majority of those
that are being honorably discharged from the military, like my dad was, I think their
goal, I think, is to find a career that's outside of maybe what they were doing.
So I think if you're, for example, maybe an MP officer or something doing something else
in the military, and you want to make a life for your family, most of them don't want
to go into law enforcement.
I think a lot of them want to kind of go into the upbringing and carry on kind of the
traditions that your family and my family kind of had the opportunity to
experience. So I think that's the goal and I think based on the experience of
what we've seen at the Vector Center and one of Robbins and I know that another
one would just open in Cobb Canyon and at Chairman Martin and others were
instrumental in making that funding happen with Chad and Yutji Tech. I think
that's kind of the bigger picture here I think in terms of who will be
ultimately impacted by that. Yeah Senator I I support section one I just
Phil it's an it's an undue burden on our state yeah thank you at the risk of
well stay my welcome I know there's a you have a motion on the floor so I'd
like just after after we get an affirmative vote here I'd oh you can add something
to the gentleman's point. We had a motion by Senator Beach and a second
by Senator Orrick so we take a vote and all the favor raise your right hand
that's 100%. Thank you. Oh 99% God what I want now Senator I'm not going to answer the
gentleman's no I'm just I know I present I would recommend remind the
Senator that this year on House bill 155 I believe it was unanimously supported
in the House and the Senate we made licensure by endorsement easier in this
day for people come coming from outside so I'd be happy to work with the
Senator, I'm sure this senator and I would do something like that for CDL where you can
bring your work from another state or from the military and get your license without
extra seat time if you would.
I'd be happy to work with the senator on that.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We're going to go work on some Senate bills up in the House.
Yeah, we're going to take just about a one and a half minute recess, so y'all just hold you thought what you say.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm chairman Martin.
We need to who's carrying the two bills.
It's bonkers.
I'll take care.
Both of them?
Okay, good.
Yeah.
And I'm going to host committee.
Okay.
I got a bell over there.
Okay.
Thank you, thank you, Brandon.
Thank you.
You
You
You
You
You
You
I think y'all remember me telling you at first about chaos and that's kind of what happened
this morning.
I think I I take full responsibility for messing some up so but anyway we move
them forward and all we're ready and we're going to ask Chairman Hopkins come
forward for Senate bill I should give him a house bill 1.20.
That bill was about helping the disabled by moving the yard marker at a $2,000 limit
on the entire assets savings to 200,000 plus.
What it did was it started at 529A,
similar to the 529 Path to College.
They could save funds into that,
they could be used for the disabled needs
towards vans, ramps in a house.
They had an opportunity to move out of the house
of their parents and live on their own
and receive a paycheck rather than a handout.
This was a big thing for the disabled,
I had a good friend of a physician in Gainesville,
he has a son that was run over
and we actually raised money in the church
through the community and had Randy's house built
and Rachel's house across the street for young women.
What this bill does is it completes the circle
for really a good idea.
And the missing part of the circle was
on the house side in ways and means
they did not want the state being at risk of any money on this project.
So that means the parents had to bear the cost of the administration to set up other plans.
Dick, you know, that creates a financial hardship on people that are already behind the eight
ball financially with their loved one.
And I will have to give credit to a state treasurer.
He came to me this summer and he said, you know what they're doing in other states?
moving out of Ohio where we were, where the states joined together in their program, they
were moving out of Ohio back to their home states, joining the 529 plans together.
Does it combing all the funds but uses the same board and uses the efficiency already
present of the outreach for the 529 Path to College and it really builds a program up.
35-year-old last year testified that 70% of BHDD participants would qualify for this if
they knew about it.
We have an opportunity to help the disabled in this state by simple move of moving this
back, combining the boards.
And this is a bill that actually you voted on last year, passed through the House and
last year.
it put on this bill that added a different subject title of a school project and even
some of your own centers had a hard time with that.
I did not have the chance to get it back on the floor.
I could have done that but we had an ailing speaker back there at that time and I recognized
that and chose not to get up at the 11th hour and push him to do something.
There's always another day and I think this is the other day you do have an amendment to this bill. It's a
friendly amendment
When we presented when I presented the bill in the house this year
One of our chairman felt like the governor really wanted to be on the board the governor does not want to be on the board
So the amendment if you want me speak to that I think you have the amendment
The amendment online, the 30 strikes, the governor's a chairperson, and then online 29 after officer of the board, it says the board shall elect a chairperson from its membership.
That's only change. And that's the bill. We have a few people here that are in support of the bill. I know the hours late, and you may want them.
Just have them wave at you or whatever whatever you want to do, Mr. Chairman, and you have this hand out in your book, too.
Times appropriate, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a motion do pass on LC 540201S
Yes.
Back many substitute.
Back many substitute.
Back many substitute.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thank you.
Do you have to do this first or second.
Do you have the right hand?
Yeah.
Okay.
We also need to have an emotional and a mental solution.
You are right.
We are back many substitute.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
You still need to go out to the mental hospital.
Yeah.
The mental hospital is in the middle.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then I'll make a,
I'll make a change per motion to amend LC540201 with amended
language of LC540201S.
We can keep his original motion and then just have someone else
motion to amend it.
If you want to do that, yeah.
OK, OK.
OK, then my original motion stands.
OK, so who make the motion?
And I'll make a motion to amend it by substituting this language in L3P4, O2O1, I asked it.
L121, struck the government's chairperson, L121, can I see the chancellor in L121 on an
African Ministry of Office for the Board at the board, Jolly Lefick, chairperson from the
members of the board.
Very good.
Second.
Okay.
Any other discussion?
I'll sign out.
Did it get signed?
Yeah, it got signed.
And we need to vote.
All that's over.
We're voting on the amendment.
We're voting on the amendment.
We're voting on the amendment first.
Yes.
Raise your right hand.
Okay.
All passed.
Okay.
Now we're voting on the bill itself.
That's a minute.
Okay.
As amended.
Yes, sir.
Is there a page?
Yes, sir.
Is there a page?
Yes, sir.
Is there a page?
Yes, sir.
Okay, we need a second so all in favor raise your right hand
I saw I know do that I really want to pay attention to you
Yeah, I didn't want to give me a credit for anything. Thank y'all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Well, thank you. Thank you committee this pleasure again
Again, just remind y'all, during the summer time at all,
in order to make us more efficient next year,
we need to talk about anything.
I'm wide open, okay, so please do.
Thank y'all, thanks.
You
