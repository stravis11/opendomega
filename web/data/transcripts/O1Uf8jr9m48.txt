in this session except by a special order of the speaker's office.
They're coming.
For us to want to talk about his budget up there the other night after it was over, it depends
on one day you bring him.
We're going to begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the Chaplain, after which
we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our Chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 179th House District,
the chairman of the Committee on Information and Audits, chairman Don Hogan, chairman Hogan.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today's pastor is Mark Baker.
He is the founder of the great works ministry
located in Brunswick, Georgia.
He was born and raised, where he was born and raised.
He's a man of vision.
He's a dynamic teacher of faith and holiness.
Pastor Baker is known as a very humble servant
who is energized and pushing the vision of others.
It is the desire of Pastor Baker to help each generation
believe in the promises and faithfulness of God.
His teaching have been told globally
and has impacted many lives in various ways.
He's strongly supported by his loving parents,
James and Luminous Baker, his beautiful wife,
Lady Laura Baker and their children.
And he's the glue I heard this morning
at the chamber about somebody being the glue
the whole thing is together. He was one of the ones that had the glue, the whole Brunswick
and Glen County together in our recent tragedy. We worked tirelessly and he did also in helping
try to heal our community and he's a great work of ministry. So I welcome Pastor Mark Baker.
Thank you so much to our speaker, David Rosden, as well as to my good friend again,
Representative Don Hogan.
I'm blessed to be here on this morning and I'm blessed to see so many of you off faces
today.
Let us pray.
Father, we thank you for this time that you allow us to go into your word, and we pray
that you were on these lips of clay and let us speak
nothing but your truth, that your name will be glorified
and that your name will be lifted up in Jesus name.
We do pray, amen.
This morning I was, since I was asked to do this,
Mark chapter 11 and version number 22 has been a very
familiar verse of scripture for me for many, many years
because it speaks of Jesus and he tells his disciples
after he had just cursed a fig tree that had not buried fruit for three or three years.
And so Jesus said to his disciples in March 11, verse 22, he said unto them, have faith
in God.
And many times in life we find ourselves in situations like all of us are in today having
to find out where do we get faith from.
And in the word of faith it says, and more than anything, faith is simply personally believing
in God's Word.
And in Genesis chapter, we found out in scripture
where as it talks about how God created the heavens
and how God created the earth.
But John one in one, I love it, it says,
in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God
and the Word was God.
Joshua 1 and 8 tells us again that we
should never let the book of the law depart from our mouths,
but we should meditate in them day and night
that we may observe to do according to all that is written in it, but then we'll make our own
way prosperous and then we will have good success. I often tell people I wake up every morning,
not just because I'm a pastor, but I try to acknowledge God in His Word because in Proverbs
chapter 3 He says in all of your ways acknowledge me and I will direct your path. And so as we acknowledge
God. And I'm sure all of you all this morning, you acknowledge God in all of your ways.
Proverbs, Psalms 103, in verse number 20, it says, blessed the Lord, you his angels,
who excels in strength, who do his word, heeding to the voices of the words of God. Every
morning, angels are looking for us to acknowledge God. And how do we acknowledge God again? We
acknowledge him through his word. And so this morning, I want to
continually encourage many of you all as well as myself. Let's
continue to acknowledge God. And the way again, we acknowledge
him is we acknowledge him through his word. James chapter one, it
says, brothers, count it all, Joel, when we fall into various
trials, knowing that the testing of our faith, work of
patient, but let patient have his perfect word that may we may be
perfect, not better than anyone, not enticing anyone, but let
patient have his perfect word that we may and that we may. And he
says, if any of you like wisdom, he say, let him acts of God, who
gives to all men's liberal without reproach. He said, I will
give it to you. But he say, let him acts in faith. As I close
this morning, Hebrews chapter 11 verse number one, it says,
Now faith is the substance of things hope for.
And it is the evidence of things not seen.
When we look at second Corinthians chapter four,
around about verse number 16, it says,
why we look not at things which are seen
for the things which are seen is just temporal.
It's the thing that is not seen is eternal.
Many people ask me again and say,
why do you continuously speak the word this way?
Because Isaiah said, God Himself says,
bring my words back to my remembrance and that's so important in the hour that we're living in
with all that is taking place in our land and I want to encourage many of you all today,
especially with love ones. I dealt with so much over these past months, even with this virus,
but I'm constantly holding to Isaiah chapter 53 where he says he was wounded by our transgressions
and he was bruised by our equities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him.
And by his stripes, we are healed. First Peter 2 and 24 says, you were healed.
So if he healed us on that cross, you may have a loved one. You may have someone close to you,
but I want you to continually to have the faith of God. Even now, he was loving him in verse number
six is without faith it is impossible to please God and it says he who comes to
him they must first believe that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek
him and I want us to not just to believe just to believe I want us to have faith
and have what I just gave you Mark 11 in verse 22 have faith in God and what
What is that faith?
We're almost 4 and 17 and he called those things which be not as though they were.
This morning as I pray with you and I pray for your family and I pray for all that the
Lord will do for our great country and our great state and I pray by faith that everyone
that is here this morning, that God will continually to answer your prayers according to that same
mark, chapter 11.
It says you can say in verse 23, it says you can say to this mountain, mountain be
You remove, be cast in the sea, and doubt nothing in your heart.
But believe the things that you say will be done, you will have whatever you say.
So he said, therefore, when you pray, believe, and you will receive.
Let us pray this morning.
Father, we thank you for this day, Lord, and I thank you for this opportunity that you
have allowed me to stand here, and I thank you for our speaker, God, and I thank you that
You are continually to use him, God, in ways God like never before.
And as he will continually lead God in all of these that you have placed here, God,
that will continually lead this great state and not only state, but this country, Lord.
We ask God that you will continually to show yourself mightily and show yourself
strong because we do have God kind of faith.
And in Jesus' name we do pray, Amen.
Let us pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic
of which is staying one nation ungodly, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Door capers will unlock the doors.

We have some announcements so listen up chair recognizes for an announcement chairman tanker sleeve
Thank you. Thank you mr. Speaker. I'd like just take a minute to remind you we've had so much communications come in
On our desk, but the the speakers office sent out a very important memo this past
Friday, January the 7th, and it's all about local redistricting.
I really urge you to take some time and review that memo with careful thought.
At the very least, you can run your legal notice in your legal organ that's in your district
as soon as possible, that could come from Legislative Council.
So once the ad has ran, then you can go ahead and work on your bill and get it through.
But our recommendation is to have legislative counsel draft that ad for you.
And then if you're redistricting bills affect the 2022 election cycle, we recommend that
these bills be passed out of the house during the first week of February.
So I'm around and available to answer questions and we'll get any questions you have answered
by the appropriate office.
Thank you so much.
