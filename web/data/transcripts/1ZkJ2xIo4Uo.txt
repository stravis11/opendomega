TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, and thank you for joining me
as I introduce my newest piece of legislation, SB 413.
A few years ago, I began this journey
by passing SB 75, which was a crucial piece of legislation
that allowed victims of stalking to be able to move without
penalty from their leases.
This is an overlooked population of people who
needed to be protected. And so this bill SB413 builds on this work in the same way that
victims of domestic violence and stalking need to be able to move quickly to safety.
So it is true for those who are victims of gun violence. And so today I am excited
and honored to be able to carry this piece of legislation that will allow all victims
of gun violence to be able to get out of their leases without penalty so they can move to
a place of safety.
Today I have with me really the brain child of this movement, someone who works in this
type of field and who brought this issue to me and so it's really my great honor to
introduce both two incredible warriors but first we'll begin with Dr. Amber Hannah.
She is a surgical resident who works at a great hospital nearby and she's here in her personal
capacity to advocate for vulnerable patients and knows firsthand just how life-saving SB
14 can be.
And so again, it's my great honor to introduce her to you all and she speaks about the importance
of this bill.
Dr. Hannah.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Senator Jackson, one for listening to us and two for inviting me today.
Good morning all.
I am so excited to speak on behalf of myself and trauma providers here in Georgia who support
doing this necessary work.
I would first like to tell you why even surgery for me and specifically why trauma.
It was a decision that I made based on the impact that I saw that patients in their most
vulnerable state in our vulnerable moment. We serve as a bridge between someone
to most worst moments and possibly their greatest testimony. My passion for
trauma stems less so from just the operating room but more so inspired by the
passion that attending mentors like Dr. Smith have outside of the OR and really
in these communities. People underscore what it takes to really do surgery. It's
It's not just what happens within the operation, but the prep before and really the recovery
after.
Specifically for trauma, a lot of the hospital stay is preparation for life outside of
the hospital and helping patients adjust to their new normal.
This is especially true for victims of firearm injury where the injury itself isn't the
only theme causing a wound.
It is also the mental, societal, and emotional wounds that inevitably follow.
And our support after that initial injury is paramount.
You know, in this past six months, I have been able to dedicate my time to practically
intimate, implement what the intersection of advocacy and surgery looks like.
And during this time, I was able to host Senator Jackson and other Senate Democrats at our
hospital and show them the normal flow of what an interpatient might look like in our hospital.
That experience sparked a discussion about the work that our community violence specialists
are doing and our trauma providers are doing that we can help move the needle forward.
Senator Jackson agrees with us that gun violence is an issue that must be addressed, but
in addition to the violence itself, we must also focus on emerging survivors back in society
safely and with the proper support.
There are currently a lot of specialists as well as providers that give services like
free medical aid, but housing does continue to be a problem.
And Senate Bill 413 would potentially remove difficulties
in providing these services specifically with housing.
There are innumerable situations where patients are re-traumatized
due to their living situations, and there is a very real risk
of re-injury due to the proximity of prior violence.
For survivors to properly rehabilitate themselves
after firearm injury, it does not just stop at medical care.
It requires the emotional, financial, and relational support,
and giving people peace of mind in knowing
that they can leave a space that wants to traumatize them
is a step forward in survivor's journey of recovery.
This gives survivors a sense of agency
and a locus of control, and that's an invaluable gift
that we can give them.
Providers like myself do extremely important work here
in Georgia and in Atlanta,
but we can't do this work alone.
It takes public leaders like Senator Jackson
and her team to translate this work into legislation
so that we can continue to heal patients
outside of them hospital and release them
into conditions that allow them to thrive
and not just survive.
Resilience needs action and that action
can come from this bill, the Senate Bill 413.
I'm excited about this legislation
and the potential impact here in Atlanta and Georgia abroad.
And I am proud to work with Senator Jackson
and other mentors that I am passionately working with,
and I hope that other providers will come along
and support us in this bill to ease the burden
of firearm violence here in Atlanta
and in the Georgia community.
Thank you to Senator Jackson for collaborating
with us for a better tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you so much, Shadda Hanna.
And I do want to just take a moment to say that
for so many people when it comes to talking about guns
and this building, it's often a non-starter.
Passing good gun legislation is really difficult
and these particular circumstances,
but the reason why I brought this bill forward
is because I believe this is a place
where my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree.
We can agree that fundamentally when bad things happen,
people should be able to move to a place quickly
to interrupt cycles of violence
and to make sure that they can live safely.
And so that's why I'm bringing this bill
and this climate because I do understand this to be
something that bipartisan participation can get involved
so that we can get it across.
With that, I want to introduce our next speaker
who comes to us as a long standing gun advocate.
This is not necessarily the legislation that they'd hope for,
but this legislation that they agree is important
and I'm so grateful to have Heather stand with us
and represent the majority of Georgians for gun safety
as she talks about the importance of SB413.
Thanks Heather.
Thank you so much to Senator Jackson
for sponsoring this legislation.
And for Dr. Hannah for coming down
and speaking about her life saving work.
I am Heather Hallett.
I'm the director of Georgia Majority for Gun Safety.
And we have spent a lot of time.
We come up here every day and advocate for the foundational gun safety laws that we
know can reduce the rates of gun violence.
And I just want to take a moment to underscore the reasons why we do this and urge our legislators
and the public to not look away from the impacts of gun violence.
The toll that it takes on not just individuals, not just victims, but their families and
communities.
It is unbelievable when you spend time with victims and hear about the ripple effects
on their lives, whether that be emotional, economic, or simply the fear of walking outside,
which SB413 addresses and we thank you so much
for sponsoring this urgent legislation.
We do this because we know that the foundational laws
that we fight for, universal background checks,
secure storage laws, red flag laws,
and funding for violence prevention initiatives
and education, we know that these laws work
And that if we can reduce the rates of gun violence in Georgia,
then there are fewer people who need the protections
that SB413 provides.
So if we can do that work and even save one victim
from all of the ripple effects that happen
because of a gunshot wound, we know that we are doing good.
And the thing is, is that we also know
that the majority of Georgians agree
on these foundational gun safety laws.
We can make progress, but until then,
we need bills like SB413 to protect the victims
from further harm.
So I urge your support for 413,
and I again, thanks Senator Jackson for her advocacy
and for writing this legislation,
and for all the heroes who are here
fighting on behalf of gun violence victims
in the state of Georgia.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Before I take questions, I do want to take a moment
to thank the advocates who are here today
in support of this legislation.
And I want to name Grady Hospital for being the place
where every gunshot victim in the metro area
goes to be attended to.
There are people standing behind me who care for those folks,
not just on the surgical bed,
but also beside them as they begin the transition
from being a victim to being a survivor.
And so I want to thank them for their hard work
and thank the good people of Grady Hospital
for really investing in victim care and services
and also being violence interrupters and communities.
I also want to thank so many others who have stood
in the course across the test of time
to really fight for good gun legislation in the state.
It has been a long journey,
and it will continue to be a difficult and hard road
for us politically to do what's best for Georgians,
but I'm grateful for each and every advocate standing
behind me who's done that work.
So with that, if there are any questions
from the press, I'm happy to receive them now.
Yes.
Yeah, thank you. So the question is why specifically on gun violence or fire on violence and not all violence in this bill.
So for one thing, this is really just a course of a path that I've been on. It started with domestic violence even before I was an elected official.
It expanded to stalking. And now we're at gun violence. And part of that is about just how the legislative process works.
and what's feasible.
At the end of the day, what I love it for any victim of violence to be able to get out of their lease, yeah, sure.
But we've got to take this one step at time.
It's what's palatable, what my colleagues can do.
And ultimately, we're trying to do the things that save lives most quickly.
And so we know that gunshot victims are particularly susceptible
to having repeat experience of gun violence in their homes or around them.
So we want to get them moved as quickly as possible.
But thank you for that question.
Are there other questions?
With that, this concludes our press conference.
I'm so grateful and do urge your support on SB413.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
