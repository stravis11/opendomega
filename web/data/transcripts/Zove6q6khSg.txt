Representative Williams, who happens to be a veteran of service to this great country in the U.S. Army, veteran Williams. veteran and representative Williams. thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning, Deez and everyone of you. I'm deeply honored and saddened to introduce the chaplain of the day. how prophetic is it that the chaplain today is having to be in the week that has sat in this entire country, the loss of three great Americans. chaplain Tom Faglin brings us a whole lot of expertise in his word. normally we go through a lot of things about the blah blah blah, who are you coming from. I'm skipping across the field this morning. chaplain is accompanied by General Wilson and staff from Fort Stuart Hunter Army Airfield and also here is Mayor Carl Rouse from the city of Hines. the reason I'm skipping across this we were talking and the chaplain had a profound thing to say to me. 23 years ago he in Atlanta the Lord called him to minister to soldiers. He was here on another mission with a seminary that they were setting up. he was called and how can you hear preacher Lessie be called and he's here today to get up the thoughts of all of us with heavy hearts. especially those families who had to suffer through this week. So it's not to prolong the time like to present to you what Stuart Hunter Army Airfield. vision chaplain Tom Faglin. it's an honor to be here Mr. Speaker thank you Mr. Williams for the introduction. it is a particular personal pleasure just to be here. Georgia is near and dear to my family's heart. not only did the Lord call me to minister the gospel to soldiers here in Atlanta. I also became a citizen here in the state of Georgia. and what is now known as Fort Moore after my first combat deployment that of Hunter Army Airfield. almost over 22 years ago. My comments are strictly going to be the reading of scripture this morning. my wife and I every morning we read a little Old Testament. We read a little New Testament and this morning we read from Psalm 116. and I think in most appropriate after I read Psalm 116. We'll stand for prayer and then we'll execute the pledge of allegiance. this is the word of the Lord. I love the Lord because He has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. because He inclined His ear to me. Therefore I will call on Him as long as I live. the snares of death encompassed me. The pangs of shi'ol laid hold on me. I suffered distress and anguish. then I called on the name of the Lord. The Lord I pray deliver my soul. glorious is the Lord in righteous. Our God is merciful. The Lord preserves the simple when I was brought low He saved me. return on my soul to your rest for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. I believed even when I spoke I am greatly afflicted. I sit in my alarm. all mankind are liars. What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits to me? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people. precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints. O Lord, I am Your servant. I am Your servant, the son of Your maid servant. You have loosed my bonds. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people in the courts of the house of the Lord. In Your midst, O Jerusalem, praise the Lord. I invite you to stand and pray with me. Heavenly Father, precious in Your sight is the death of Your saints because of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, your beloved son, most precious. It is through the death of Your Son that we are made saints just through the simple belief and trust in Him. So we come to you this morning asking for mercy and for peace because of the promise of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus which changes everything. O my God, I pray for Your peace upon the families of Sergeant William Rivers, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders, Sergeant Breonna Muppet. O Lord, we thank You for their service. We thank You that in and through their service they represent the love of Christ and the willingness to raise their right hand and the willingness to lay down their life for the love of their neighbor's freedom. Pray for comfort upon their brothers and sisters in their unit and Lord your peace upon their families. For our families here from the great state of Georgia. O my God, I thank You for the leadership that You've given to this house and as this house moves through a period of bereavement with the loss of Chairman Rich Smith. I ask that You would give them comfort that they would be able to entrust Chairman Smith to you as one of your saints. I pray for Your peace upon His family, upon His wife Clara. O my God, we thank You for the third infantry division. We thank You that they are deployed right now and in their deployment they are expressing love of neighbor that they are even just preventing an escalation of oppression that they are preventing war. Lord, I pray that You would bless the dog face soldiers that are cross Europe with peace and safety and security. Pray that Your hand would be upon our leadership. We thank You for General Nori for Command Sergeant Major Reffer. For General Wilson here with us this morning. Bless his comments to us in a few minutes. O my God, I thank You for the leadership here within this house. You give wisdom to Speaker Burns and those who advise him to each member of this house, Lord to the Senate. O my God, to a governor. I pray for wisdom for our president and for strength and health for President Biden and for those who advise him. And Heavenly Father, we pray for peace across this world. The those who would seek to disrupt and to oppress and to take the life of their neighbor. Lord, almighty God, that You would bring them to submission. They would stop that there would be a cessation of hostilities, that there would be a fear of You that causes us to just think through our actions and to think through what Your love.

Members, we will move on to morning orders. If you will, members will all return to the floor. Take your seats. We have some very special timely morning orders this morning that I will recognize some members for a special morning order. And then we will have our invite resolution. So members, if you will please return to your seats. And give representative Stevens, representative Hitchens, representative Al Williams, and representative Tyler Paul Smith, your attention in the well. Now we will have a time limit as always on morning orders, but there will not be one for this morning order. So members, if you'll join me in standing. No, this way. Then it's up to you. No, but you'll call it. Unfortunately, this second time I've been up here this week for somebody that falls to life in a laminated duty. But as many of you know, we lost three soldiers over in Jordan just a couple of days ago. And uncommon, in this instance, they were reserves, but they all three from Georgia. And one of them is from the city of Savannah. And I just wanted to speak to her for just a moment. Army Specialists, Brianna, well, in the Savannah, Georgia, along with the other two were a hit by a drone strike on their container housing unit at a support base known as tower 22. Brianna listed in 2019 upon graduation from Windsor Forest High School, which excelled in math and reading served as the Bands Drum Major and participated in the Junior ROTC program. Brianna served as a specialist just like her mom who retired from military few years ago in networks in real estate. She was deployed in August 2023, and she was expected to return home to Savannah and July or August of this year. Brianna's alma mater, Windsor Forest High School, were honor her this Thursday, and on Friday, the family will travel to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to attend her homecoming. Can we get a moment of silence please? Thank you. Thank you, Miss Speaker. I'm here on behalf of the young lady whose life ended much too soon in Jordan, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders from Wakecross, the District of our Steen Chairman of the Shed, a Whipershed, it is always difficult when you have to send condolences to a grieving family. But to really get the impact you must have served in combat to know how families suffer, making just not wanting to get that telephone call, not wanting to be told that is your loved one. I remember my mother waiting to hear what was happening with me in Vietnam. We didn't have the technology you have now, so once a week you might make a satellite phone call, Carl Hitchin, those who I'm talking about. But when the call came into that family, profound as it was, chaplain this morning stated it best, precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of one of his saints, as Psalms 116. And so we pause to think of memory, to think of family, to think the citizens of where county and surrounding counties that this directly affects. It's hard enough to lose a daughter for any reason, but to lose one like this. But the beauty is that in defense of her country she gave her life. She made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy and hope to continue enjoy. So we ask only to continue to pray for this family, pray for their strength, as they journey to dova del aware, to receive the main due remains. We look when she comes home to the dirt of Wayne County. That many of us can be there. And in the other two locations of these three heroes to show our respect. Thank you very much and thank you Mr. Speaker. I made this announcement a day ago, I spoke with Ms. Sanders mother. At the time, the only Georgian I knew was Sergeant Sanders. So this is just compounded the emotions for me certainly to find out that we have three Georgians that were killed. I'm going to read from this here. It's been a difficult week for us here in this house in particular, the loss of so many leaders, the loss of Chairman Smith. And certainly the loss of these three young children taken too early soldiers and having come from a military family is very near and dear to my heart. The sacrifices that our military men and women give for us every day. They stand on the line willing to do whatever it takes to protect our freedoms. But I rise today with my colleagues from around Georgia to recognize those citizens and these soldiers and Sergeant Kennedy Sanders of Wakecross. Kennedy was killed serving her country overseas in the drone attack in Jordan. This attack hits home for all of us here in Georgia. 718th engineer company from Fort Moore suffered the worst losses while there were injuries across the board. These were the ultimate sacrifice. These men and women are from different corners of Georgia, from different communities. But what they have done and commented is they've given their selfless willingness to serve. They volunteered to serve our nation working together to keep us safe far from their families and loved ones putting their lives in line. Now while we remember today these young people in Georgia, we need to also remember their families, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and children. This is going to be a time for them that many of us have felt. But if you can imagine, try to imagine, it not happening home, being across the ocean of another country. Imagine that, that suffering they feel, the helplessness they feel. So please keep the family in prayer. They've met each made their communities proud to their service and sacrifice. They have made Georgia proud. They've made their nation proud. They certainly made me proud. I'm proud to stand here as a Georgian and an American. We oftentimes get into debates in here. This is not a debate. Everyone in here is standing up. Everyone in here recognizes the sacrifice they give. And I thank each and every one of you. At the same time, we mourn the loss of Kennedy or fellow soldiers. I hope that their selfless service serves as an inspiration to young men and women from around our state and our nation and recognize that we can come together here in solidarity. This is one thing we certainly can do that. Please join me in a moment of silence for our fallen Georgia citizens. Thank you Miss Speaker. Miss Speaker, members of this August body, this is by far the hardest tribute that personally I've had to make while serving in this great house. Today we rise to honor the life and sacrifice of one of of Carlton's finest Sergeant Williams, Jerome Rivers. He along with his fellow soldiers were killed on Sunday, January 28th, 2024 in Jordan when a one-way unmand aerial system impacted their kind container housing units. He and the other two of our fellow Georgians gave the ultimate sacrifice and service to God in country this same day and defense of not only our freedom, but for the freedom of those who would seek to live not under tyranny, but as free individuals with those liberties, they so desperately are in need of and are fighting to maintain. Our community mourns this loss. Words cannot convey our heart.

break. Miss Rivers, our prayers are with you. She noted that Sergeant Rivers was always smiling, always happy, always worried about his family, always took care of his family, just a hard worker for his family. Her husband of almost 11 years, he leaves behind a teenage son as well. In the words of President James A. Garfield, the love of country they accepted death and thus resolved all doubts and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue. Please remember his family, the family of the other service members that were killed in your prayers. Ladies and gentlemen, this house please join me in my own own house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you members. I remind us all, there were the tragic loss of these three individuals, but we also should remember those that were injured that are recovering and I mean, our prayers are they can recover completely and I remind each and every one of us that freedoms we talk about on so many occasions has never been granted to us without sacrifice. I think we know that our freedoms are not free. Someone is taking care of that to our servicemen and women. In these three, soldiers we are eternally grateful. Thank you members. Members, we continue to need your attention. We have a special invite resolution this morning. So with that, I want to invite Representative Al Williams and our friends that have traveled from Fort Stewart down in Southeast Georgia in beautiful liberty and Brian counties. What else is in the Brian and Liberty long, Macintosh, a lot of counties down there and we want to invite general and I'll let Al excuse me, Representative Williams make the introductions. Representative Williams. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, I'm profoundly, profoundly honored to stand. I'm going to ask if the speaker would allow that to join on the front seat to form a third ID soldiers that's Captain O'Connor. I called him Captain. I think he was a private but come on in Jaguar. And Representative Gladney, I'm not sure whether she acts like a Colonel Colonel, so we'll just, I don't know what a rank was. And I'm not certain, but I'm representative Clark. I think he's third with a part of the third ID. But let me say this very briefly as General Wilson prepares to come. Third ID is one of the most decorated divisions in the history of these United States. It was of course the division that Audie Murphy was a member of the most decorated military person in the history of these United States. Third ID has served the World War I, World War II, Korea, Afghanistan and Iraq. We used to say we were deployed so much until literally many children went through about seven, eight years where they didn't get to see their father, their mother very much for several of those years because of deployments. But probably the most profound statement that we make about for Stuart, there are 459 trees planted there for each warrior that gave their lives and the defense of this country. And we are eternally grateful. General Wilson comes to us today as the deputy commanding general from maneuvers. It's a little mouthful, but the interesting thing about it is the very same position that our current Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin held as a bigaday of General at Fort Stuart. And I told him for the last night he was talking about him in the paper and they said that he was from Alabama, the record Lloyd Austin is from Thomas Field, Georgia, Georgia, Bone and Bryant. But we now have another general. One day we'll call a four star written all over him. I'll get my money next week. He's doing a terrific job with the third ID down in Liberty County. We have 20,000 soldiers and over 2,000 civilian civilians attached with an economic impact of $4.9 billion a year and that's billion with a B, which is the largest federal impact of military in Georgia. Without any further ado, we're going to take about an hour and let this general command say what he has to say. Cheryl Wilson, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the speech. Thank you. Take it along as you like, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Speaker Burns, honorable representatives of the House. I'm Jeremy Wilson and I'm a proud dog face soldier. I would like to start by saying how incredibly humbled and honored I am to be with all of you today. And on behalf of Major General Chris Nory, the command star Major John Repper, and all the dog face soldiers currently serving forward. Thank you for all your support and this wonderful opportunity. I would also like to extend a special thanks to Representative Owl Williams for all that he does for all of us. If we're nominating our division, Ford Stewart and Hunter Armier feel for this incredible honor. Third Infantry Division has a story passed which extends from the Marne River as Shatto Terri in World War I to today where over 4,000 dog face soldiers currently served across the eastern front. Deployed to Europe to deter further aggression and strengthen relationships with NATO partners and allies through times of war from the Marne River in France to the thunder run in Iraq. Our communities here at home have consistently and faithfully rallied behind our soldiers. From care packages sent to troopers deployed to heartfelt homecoming celebrations. You, Georgia have stood firmly behind us during challenging times. And for all that we thank you. Ever since the division unfurled its colors at Fort Stewart in 1996, the people of this great state have provided our dog face soldiers and families a wonderful place to train, work, and raise a family. Because of that dedication to our soldiers and families, more and more of the soldiers who transitioned out of Fort Stewart and Hunter Armier field choose to stay in Georgia. Roughly about 40 to 45 percent, which is a testament to the high quality of life and wonderful opportunities available in this great state. As many of you know, the Army has changed to outpace the rest of the world to maintain that tactical advantage against our adversaries. The Third Infantry Division is leading this effort, modernizing our equipment, and advancing our capability and capacity, always standing by to answer the nation's call. It is with the same tenacity that we look forward to working with all of you to improve the quality of life we provide to our greatest asset, our dog face soldier and their families. We need you and our families need you. There are a lot of veterans on the floor today. First, I'd like to say thank you for your service. It mattered. The impacts are immeasurable and it is set the foundation for the rest of us to move forward. At the same time, I implore you to continue to encourage the best young men and women in your communities to serve in the Army. It's an important mission, meaningful work, and a great career. We have a responsibility to ensure the future generations carry on the Army's legacy. In closing, I'm honored to be able to join all of you today to work together to foster a community that positively impacts the lives of the soldiers, veterans, families, and all members of the coastal Georgia community. Thank you for your time. Rock of the morn, not fancy just tough. Thank you, General. Thank you, House. We've always stood behind our veterans and what we can do to make your lives better while you're actively in Georgia as a member of the military, but also when you retire and we like it when you stay in Georgia. You have a special part of who Georgia is about and we welcome you and we certainly appreciate to the other members of your team. Thank you for your sacrifice. Thank you for the messages they chaplain. Georgia is a special place. Fort Stewart is a very special place. And I'll close with this rep, I'm going to help him. Go Army. Begging. That's all right. There are a couple Navy guys while I'll add it. Beat Navy. I'm going to recognize we're going on the morning orders. I'm going to recognize while I have him here at the microphone of representative Williams to do a quick recognition. Thank you, Miss Peac. I just want to recognize the many people that came from Liberty County in the Heinzville area to show their support for Fort Stewart Army Airfield Day in the direction of our CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, Leo Poole and with all of you standing just let the House thank you for being here. Thank you. Members, you may join. Members of the third, I'd be right here out in the any room for photos. But I also want to thank I mentioned several counties, Chatham County, happens to be the home of Hunter Army Airfield. So thank you for your contribution there as well. Okay, we have a whole slew of morning orders now. We could be here a while. So members, I'm going to ask that you will be responsive to a absolutely tops, two minutes. Hopefully you can do it in a minute, something like that. If you can that would certainly help us take care of our further business for the day. So I'm going to recognize Representative Penich for a morning order. I only have one minute. So when I say Shalom y'all, Shalom y'all, I'll work on that. Please help me welcome the immediate past president of the Atlanta Film Society Board, Sarri Earl, who is present. The Atlanta Jewish Film Festival is celebrating their 24th anniversary. It is the largest Jewish Film Festival in the world. The Film Festival stands as a cornerstone of our city's cultural diversity, enriching Atlanta's landscape as one of the world's largest Jewish Film Festivals. In this challenging time, the festival's mission, in these challenging times, the festival's mission to foster social and cultural understanding through film is more vital than ever, uniting diverse audiences in a shared journey of discovery. The festival transcends mere entertainment, acting as a vibrant community hub that brings together diverse voices to explore our common challenges and shared humanity.

Representative Yalkoye is recognized for a morning order. Representative Koye. Good morning, colleagues. I am up here this morning to recognize a gentleman that is always back there in the South entrance. Come rain, cold, or sun. He's there every morning to thank us. He always says, good morning. Phil Looney is a great guy. He says, good morning with a smile, but his face is covered with beard, so you don't see this smile. But I ask him why he does that, and he told me that what we do is a lot of sacrifice. And that was his way of appreciating us. My colleagues, today Phil is up in the gallery, and I think it's our turn to appreciate him. Thank you, Phil. And thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Representative Townsend is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Any fellow Kwanian's come on down.

Actually, Mr. Speaker, a former representative, Shalmugve, President Don Lewis, Bruce Fosie, and Kate Gouge-Koolidge. Let me tell you some of the things we've done over 100 years. One of the most things we're a diverse group, of course. We've actually started the Boys and Girls Club down there. It's the second largest boys in Girls Club in the state. Our board directors did that. We're very proud of that. And we've raised that. We're $2 million to pass 100 years. There's probably more than that. We have some great events in the community. Come on down, Kwanian's, a great event to the community. It says, as the Brunswick Stubilee, the home of Brunswick Student, the United States of America, guys. That's where the Brunswick Stubes created. So, when those were in Virginia, West Virginia friends tell you different, tell them they're wrong. If not, call me. We also sell Christmas trees.

Representative, did you say they were going to be here at 2.16? Like in the morning? They'll be here by the south there at 2.16. I can tell you that. Room 2.16 in the morning. Let's see. We have a group effort here. So, I'm going to call down Representative Corbett, Representative Jason Ridley, Representative Stevens, Representative Hatchett, really, Representative Wheatour. Y'all listen up. This is an important day and I thank a lot of folks here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I get you. I don't think I'll call you as well. Here we go. You're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I rise today to recognize a special group of parents, teachers and students that are in the gallery. This group is here to help us recognize January 31st, 2024 as dyslexia day at the Capitol. I got introduced to this group, decoding dyslexia to a constituent of mine. Her she's a schoolteacher. Her son was having trouble reading. They told her, you know, he's a boy. He just learned slower. Representative Ridley and myself, that probably been true. But in this case, it wasn't. He had dyslexia, she got him tested. He had dyslexia. Got him the help that he needed. He's went off to excel in school and he has a very bright future. So Gabe, if you're out there listening, keep up the good work. But he would thank you. The key is early detection and with help from Chairman Jasper's, Chairman Dubner, and now Chairman Irwin. We have made great strides to address dyslexia and early detection. I encourage everyone to take time today and talk to the parents, teachers and students then room 230. They'll be grabbing go lunch. Go buy and get a chance to talk to these kids. They've got a great story and let them tell you how they got where they are. I'm going to ask them if they'll rise. All the ones with decoded dyslexia rise and let us house welcome to your house. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, families and young people for being here. We appreciate your advocacy and we look forward to working with you. Lots of exciting things going on and we want to be a part of it. Thank y'all. We appreciate you being here. Chairman Collins, the chair of the Public Safety Committee, is recognized for a morning order representing Seaball, representing Hitchens, or a whole bunch of you. Any members of the public? Oh, the committee is coming with you. Yeah, the committee is recognized. That was smart guy. Yeah, the chairman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the distinguished group of men and women across our state, the chiefs of police and heads of law enforcement agencies. We have over 700 chiefs of police. General, I'm just saying, this is a special group that protects us. Members, please take your seats and pay attention to this announcement in the well of this morning order. Continue, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're here today to recognize the police chiefs and head of law enforcement agencies in Georgia. This distinguished group of men and women make up 700 police chiefs and heads of law enforcement agencies throughout the state, managing over 45,000 peace officers. We have several of these men and women in the gallery with us today. And you know, you can't have a good flock unless you have a good shepherd. And these men and women who are our police chiefs throughout this state, they shepherd their flock and they make sure that we have the very finest in law enforcement that serves and protects us throughout our cities and communities across the state. So if you would, ladies and gentlemen, would you please stand and give a hand to those who are in our gallery. Please stand for recognition. Please stand, Chief.

He has over a 40-year law enforcement decorated career in public safety. He's a chief up in Dunwoody. Let's give him a round of applause. You know, I think the chiefs of police have probably one of the toughest jobs in law enforcement coming from local government. You know, you sheriff has to serve an elected body. But the police chief has to please a mayor and council members and God bless them for what you do. Thank you for being with us today. You're so right, Mr. Chairman. So right.

Members, we're ready to move on to the rules, Candler. Thank you for your patience and your participation. 8-7. Members of your return to the floor, we have a couple of issues we need to take up so we would welcome the members back to the floor. We're keeping us if you'll close those doors to the any room that would be helpful. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 8-7-8? House Bill 8-7-8 by Representative Lomston of the 12th and others to be entitled to amend Article 1 of Chapter 6 and Title 40. The Fish go to George Anantetti relating to general provisions relative to the uniform rules of the road. So it's to provide for proper procedure for passing a postal service vehicle. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Motor Vehicle, second committee recommends a dis bill, do pass. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. The chair recognizes Chairman Lomston to present the bill. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I bring to you House Bill 8-7-8. Many of you may remember back in about 2-15 this body passed a bill which is now current law which lays out the proper action for a motorist to take when approaching a sanitation vehicle, which is displaying a flashing yellow amber wider red light. And it's in the process of picking up curbside waste. It requires a motorist to slow down and pass a sanitation vehicle using the adjacent lane to pass, assuming it is safe to do so, or if not safe to do so, reduce speed to a safe and proper speed for existing conditions. Like the sanitation vehicle that travels in a stop and go fashion postal service vehicles also engage in a engaged and mailed delivery delivery do a similar type of non-standard stop and go manner. All we're doing with House Bill 8-7-8 is to add postal service vehicles to an existing code section. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I would appreciate your favorable consideration. You have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I yield the way. He yields the well. The very important service of Georgia is delivery of the mail. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? The chair has done the previous question. Is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The next question is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Thank you. Have all members voted. All members voted. So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 8-7-8. The yeas are 165. The nays are won. The bill having received their records at Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 9-76? House Bill 9-76 by Representative Lehood of the 175th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 2-21 of the Fisher Code of Georgia annotated relating to primaries and elections generally. So it's a revised that ballots used in optical scan voting system. Shall we use paper with a visible watermark security figure? This bill I refer to the Committee on Government Affairs and Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman John Lehood from down Lounce County Way has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I've got House Bill 9-76 and what this bill does is requires a visible security feature on our ballots. Both absentee and ballots produced by the ballot marking devices. And this is a low cost high value measure and appreciate your considerable favourable consideration today. I'll take any questions if there are any. The gentleman's yielded for a question. Chair recognizes Representative Park Cannon for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes. Awesome. Just a first question. How much is this going to cost? Does the Secretary of State wait in on that amount and how they're going to have this go forward? Yes. The Secretary's team has weighed in and the estimated cost is a one-time cost of approximately $110,000 to set up the printers to do this. And so there will be no cost to the local election offices or counties. Do you yield again? Yes. So you're saying that this $110,000 is going to pay for paper that gets printed on. And so is this redundant because we already have a security paper? How is this different than that security paper we currently have? So the bill reads that at least one of the security features on the paper must be visible so that the voter can see it with their eyes. The current security feature we have is not visible to the human eye. It requires a wand to verify the ceramic coating. And so this is a visible security feature that would be printed on the ballots. Thank you for one more. Thank you. I appreciate our conversation about this before. We're not sure if other states do this, but what would the penalty or the remedy be? For example, the SOS accidentally issues a set of ballots without this paper. Is there a remedy for the county? How does that work out so that voters don't get disenfranchised? It would be no different than a deviation from the process has prescribed them all today. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. You have a couple more questions. Okay, I'll take a couple more. You take one more? One more. Chairman Tarvan to your right in the back of the room. The gentleman yields. Yes, sir. Over the past elections, 2016, 18 and 20, we saw people from all walks of life and both parties and even independence, complain about the election. It's a shame we have to do this, but I thank you for bringing this bill because it will bring more confidence from our people who vote. And it's something we need to restore. Paul show that 80% of the people think there's been a problem in one of those elections. Our governor's race, then our presidential race, our governor's race, and then our presidential race. So I thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you for your support. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to green to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 976. The yeas are 167. The nays are one. The bill having received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, House Bill 905 and 985 are postponed to the next legislative day, which will be tomorrow. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Honoring and commending the fire fire as the Georgia Recognition Day at the State Capitol.

Recently in Clayton County, in Forest Park, we had a member, a Georgian, that passed away from hypothermia on January 22nd. It was found at a Marta bus stop off a Riverdale road. There's something that we all can do about this. We've had a little money to our budget so no Georgian will ever pass from hypothermia. It's something that's simple that we can do. It's a legacy that we can lead that under our watch in this legislature, no Georgian will die from being unsheltered, homeless, hypothermia or any other preventable death. Thank you, Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Representative Bernal is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I'd like to wish my best friend and my cousin, Althea, Cartman Cooper, happy 75th birthday. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Hutchinson is recognized for an afternoon order. Here she comes. Good afternoon colleagues. I know that this is a somber week and I know that Chairman Smith would want me to bring this news to you. Instead of introducing a child available for adoption, after the last session I went back and looked at all of the children I have introduced over the last four years and I am here to tell you not one single child is still available for adoption. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That means they have been adopted. They have another permanent outcome but they are no longer on that website. So I'll put together a short video of all the kids that we've seen over the last four years. Thank you. Great work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. And a frontlaugh for Airbus and Leather I'm on stage. That's strong, representative. That's strong. God bless all those young people and their new families. That's really awesome. Really awesome. Representative Matt Duning. Representative Duning. Members, give your attention to the gentleman in the well. Members, if you'll cease any conversation for a moment, especially after the order for this family. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, my community has lost a great man and I can stand here and tell you that because he was my father-in-law. It's tempting to define an accomplished individual by their achievements, especially one so grand and lasting is what Jim Mathis brought to the community of Gainesville. But to do so would be to miss the man himself. And when people remember what he meant to my community, to his friends, to his colleagues and most especially to his family, they remember the kindness, the positivity, and the determination that forged a legacy. He was dearly loved and revered by his two daughters who were blazing their own similar trails that he showed them before he passed. His grandchildren too are recipients of a boundless spirit and he was thrilled in his last days to watch them take their own first steps of leadership. But he didn't have a passion for trying new things that some led to a surprise here and there. The story goes that he bought a house in 1980 when my mother-in-law was nine months pregnant and presented her such a house that she had never seen. My wife and her sister also recount that there would be an odd dog or cat that showed up at the house that became a member of the family. Once again, unbeknownst to anybody in the family. He went on to become a private pilot and he always said that weather permitting was his first course of action. But once again, the girl stated that they often got up and turned back around because he had not checked the weather. I would say that his most treasured accomplishment was bringing the 96 Olympics to his hometown of Gainesville. He partnered with two other local philanthropists and they were the pitch to bring the canoe and kayak and rowing to Gainesville and when he finally got in front of the Olympic selection committee in a way that only a good Southern gentleman could do they asked why bring it to Gainesville and he showed him a mason jar full of Lake Lanier water. And he said it was calm and flat just like all those athletes with warmth. And thus the Olympics came to Gainesville, Georgia. Diagnose with Parkinson's disease 10 years ago, he faced down his own concerns with valor and resolution. Even during that final challenge, he loved his family, he gathered us often and he remembered his community and I'll leave you with this quote. The essence of life is to serve others and do good. That was a quote.

from Jim, we will forever be in his debt, and I ask if you would join me in honoring him with a moment of silence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Quite a gentleman. Our love and prayers go out to the entire family, but especially the Katie Mathis Dutnik. Tell her what we're thinking about her as we all of you represent. Okay, here's the predicament we're in. We're out of time, but I'm going to do this. I have five representatives starting with, see if I can do this in alphabetical order. Representative Anderson will go first. Representative Ballard. Representative Jackson, I'm not sure I'm going to get that one right. Representative Gullet and Representative Gamble. I'm going to call on you all in. Y'all have one minute, one minute, and we'll start with, oh, let's change that. Let's start, ladies first. Representative Ballard, you recognize for a afternoon, afternoon order, Representative Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When I was engaged to my Air Force husband way back in the 90s, I was told by a military spouse never rely on your salary to help pay the bills because you won't be able to get a job wherever you move. And that is the case for too many of our military spouses who come to Georgia. There is a lot of military, a re-regulatory red tape, and I would like to fix that. And I have dropped House Bill 880 that will help our military spouses. And I hope that you will support that as it moves through the process. Thank you. Representative Anderson is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, with the events we've experienced this week, I know for me, and I'm sure for each of you, it's caused a lot of reflection, a lot of thought about our lives. I've thought this week about unwavering support, unquestioning companionship, and unconditional love. And while all three of those describe our Black Lab nox back home who I'm looking forward to seeing, even more so, I'm looking forward to seeing my wife Kim. Each of us have spouses, companions, families back home that we think about when these events happen. And as you go about your day, as we prepare for the weekend, remember them. When you get home, give them an extra hug. Tell them you love them and tell them thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the whip. Absolutely. Representative Derek Jackson is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last week at this time is when my wife and I receive a notification and an alert from Kennesaw State University that there was an active shooter on that campus. And for two and a half hours, like any other parents, we actively tried to reach our son. He's safe. There are no fatalities, but we have a climate, ladies and gentlemen, about active shooters and how that impacts families. So Mr. Speaker, this is a gust's body. We have to do something so that way no other families, parents and children have to continue to deal with mass shootings and how that play a psychological role on us all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Representative Gullet is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just want to acknowledge the credit unions here in the Capitol yesterday and today. There are almost 100 credit unions in the state of Georgia. 2.2 million members of those credit unions with an economic impact of $2.5 billion. So thank you for being here. If you see a credit union that's in your district, make sure you say hello. They're doing great work for us here in the state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So, all of them this morning, they're a great group and they are a vital part of our economic success in this state serving their members. We appreciate them too. We certainly do. We'll see you at Representative Gamble. He's recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, the associated general contractors are here at the state Capitol. Many of you stopped by the breakfast they had this morning and visited with some of their members. And I wanted to take an opportunity to recognize a program that you've been invited to in the fall every year for several years now that A.G.C. coordinates. And that is the skills challenges that they have around the state where students from our skilled trades, and particularly the skills USA clubs that many of you are familiar with, will go and compete against other students in the various trades that they are skilled in. It's one of the most encouraging things that you will get to experience as a legislator. We need to support this. Last year in 2023, there were 104 schools that participated and 2,100 students had the opportunity to compete in all of the different skilled trades that skills USA represent. So I wanted to take a moment to appreciate the associated general contractors for all their work. Let me echo that as everyone been to a skills USA competition, you haven't, you missed it. It's really awesome. Those young people are learning some great skills and doing great work. So we're representing Gamble. We appreciate your advocacy on part of them. Keep doing it. It's a great program. We do, the contractors are certainly very, very important and enabling us to continue that program. So thanks for that. That concludes our afternoon orders, except Chairman Meeks recognized leadership Wayne.
