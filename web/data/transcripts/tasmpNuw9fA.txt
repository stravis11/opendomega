Good morning everybody, let's call our meeting to order, please go and ask Jim Williamson
to open us up with word of prayer.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Chris, Assembly Follow-A-God, we just thank you for the gift of this day.
More to even now is we face these storms that about the role of the Lord.
We ask to protect the people and the property and the paths of the storm,
Father.
We pray that you bless our families, those who work here, Father.
And in your name, just ask for wisdom and discernment in the matters
that we get to deliver right now.
Every decision, please, on your side.
May I assist in Christ's name, I'll be there.
Thank you, Jim Williams.
Before we get started this morning,
we'd like to recognize some special guests
we have visiting with us today.
Young man, Michael Boswell and his mom, Beth,
they're from Scriven County.
They're back here.
They're going to be pageant.
Michael's going to be pageant for us today.
and also Andrew Blitchington is back here with him
and his mom Katie and Billy
and they're from Scriven County
and we're glad to have them with us.
Thank y'all very much.
Senator, come on up and I wanna ask you a question
before we get started.
Yes.
Could I get an autograph of you today
so I could have it in the case?
I'll see your name.
I will.
I will say this, Mr. Chairman, thank you all for having me to hear this bill, but I will say it's going to be an honor to serve George in that role.
I didn't realize the treasure has been in existence since 1775, and I'll be the first Georgian to represent us in that role.
So I'm excited to do that.
So thank you.
Bring before you, Senate Bill 244, this simply has two parts to it.
Part one deals with a prosecuting attorney if that prosecuting attorney is disqualified for
misconduct and the cases then dismissed by the courts.
Those that were indicted have the right to go back to the courts and ask for
some attorney fees and reasonable cost to petition the court.
Part two deals with victims that were convicted that then become innocent.
There's an avenue for them, then, to be restored.
And this is something the House added, Chairman Dempsey,
and can speak to that if you have any questions to part two.
And something the House has worked on for a long time.
They added the SB-244, and I'm okay with that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Don't say any questions.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
And if it's selected, Representative Chairman Martin,
Chuck Martin will carry it.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I'm bringing, Paul has got me, I'm bringing SB 10
before you.
Today, I appreciate Senator Goodman allow me to use his legislation, which is already
passed the Senate in Representative Ford's district as a vehicle to do two things.
One, it quantifies a procedure and practice for judicial officers and second, it has
House Bill 199's language in it, which passed the House unanimously preuse in the year
and just getting hung up a little bit in the Senate.
So we're trying to give them another opportunity to get that done.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have Steve Ocean.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee.
I, too, am grateful for Senator Kim Jackson, allowing me to use Senate Bill 170.
This bill, you'll recognize the same language.
It will create a grant that rural hospitals will be able to use
to buy generators to increase the capacity that was found
insufficient during Hurricane Helene.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you so much.
Cameron Anderson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, kind of to repeat my colleagues' comments.
So I want to thank Senator Robertson for allowing us to use Senate Bill 175 in our governmental affairs committee
Senate Bill 175 is an elections bill a few things that it does that allows the speaker to lieutenant governor to
Remove their appointments out of session. They can appoint that's to the state elections board
They can appoint now out of session, but I cannot remove those until the session is back in
It also delays rulemaking
making implementation for the state elections board. If rules were not taking the rule-making authority
away from the elections board, but if they're promulgated within 60 days of the election, then they're
delayed until 30 days after the election. To avoid some of the confusion we had last year,
we're also removing the administrative tie of the state elections board from the secretary of
state's office to the state accounting office. That's where the state ethics board has
administratively tied to. We are also removing the state from the Eric reporting system, but
that is being delayed until July 27. And that gives us time to prepare a report. The state
elections board will head that up over the interim and as well as a either a House or a committee,
looking into alternatives to that. So that implementation is delayed for a year and a half to give
give us some time to further review that.
We are restricting the drop off the weekend
before the election day on Tuesday,
just on the Saturday and Sunday for absentee balance.
That was a point of confusion.
We're trying to promote consistency across the state.
We have a lot of days already built in over two weeks
of absentee voting and days and opportunities.
We are allowing the drop off of those absentee balance
on the Monday before the elections day.
Let's see, there are some other things
related to giving municipalities
in municipal only elections, the option to opt out one
or both of the Saturday requirements now.
If there's any state or countywide elections at all,
then they must open the two Saturdays
that are currently required in law.
And then we're allowing a referendum question
to be placed on special statewide ballots,
such as the PSC election that's coming up later this year
to allow communities to put a splotced referendum
or something requiring a referendum on the ballot.
Okay, have a question, boy, who it part?
Thank you, Mr. Sherman.
So with respect to Eric and the majority party's effort
to remove a tool that's been clearly been demonstrated
to protect voter integrity,
what data justifies cutting off Georgia
from this multi-state voter tool.
And if you're not going to move forward
within until 2027, why is it currently
in legislation for this year?
Many times we fail to act without compulsion,
so we're putting a date in here
that will require compulsion on our part
to investigate that.
As far as data that I used in my interpretation
and consideration to leave this in the language,
if I look at, from the Census Bureau,
the migration data, the top seven states where people move from Georgia into Georgia, none
of those top seven states participate in the ERA program.
There's only 24 states currently participating, and so while we're getting a lot of information
through that program is how much of that information is relevant to what's going on around
us.
The only bordering state that participates in the program is South Carolina.
understanding they have similar legislation before their body now so again
pushing that implementation out so we can review options outside of that to see
what they may be it gives us two legislative sessions if we need to do
something different thank you for the question later hugely has a question thank
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author of the bill.
I appreciate limiting rule-making, rule changes 60 days out.
But did you consider that once an election has started,
there shouldn't be any changes on the rules?
Because people need to know the rules of the game
when they start.
Yes, ma'am.
And that's exactly why we put this in place.
Again, there was confusion last year, there were rules that were passed at the last minute
before the election, Gabrielle, the Association of County Election Officials, had asked for
90 days.
We had some discussions, the State Election Board representatives discussed with them to
try to negotiate because we don't want to constrict and confine the elections board as much
as possible.
So, it was finally determined and agreed to in that discussion by both parties at 60 days.
So that's the reason we're limiting that.
Representative Evans has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the chairman and the well,
or at the podium.
What is the wisdom of moving oversight
of the state elections board from the Secretary
of State, which is elected by the people
to the state in a counting office, which
is a bureaucratic agency with no oversight from the voters?
OK.
Very good question, and let's make sure
we understand what we're talking about here.
We're not talking about oversight.
What we're talking about is budgetary and human resources
responsibilities, only administrative tie, okay?
Anything oversight for the State Elections Board
is provided by the appointees.
That would be the legislature, the governor,
and currently the two parties.
So that's who overseas and regulates that,
as well as the legislative body.
They can only do what we, the legislature, allow them to do.
The Secretary of State's office does not necessarily
oversee the State Elections Board.
All we're talking about is budgetary and human resources
administrative responsibilities.
And does the State Accounting Office have those kind of responsibilities for other organizations
and if so, which ones?
They do and specifically the State Ethics Commission.
There are some others, but that's the one that I've had the most discussion with because
it's a similar type of structure.
The State Ethics Commission has a larger staff than the State Elections Board does, but
we're in kind of a period trying to rebuild the Elections Board and put them back to
their original intended purpose.
Where would I look to find that?
The original intended purpose.
What year would that, would we go to look
for what the legislature did?
I don't have the direct answer to that.
I'd suggest legislative council could direct you to that.
Well, when you said back to the original purpose,
I'm just assuming you must have looked at that
to be able to determine what was the original
intended purpose.
The state elections were put in place
by the legislature to be separate
from the Secretary of State's office,
which is a constitutional office,
to provide certain levels of service
and also oversight over some of the election's activities.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, you don't see any other questions.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Senator Sassler.
Hey, Mr. Chair and members committee,
bottom of page two, Senate Bill 36,
bill that takes the basic protections
that citizens enjoy from federal government intrusion
on basic religious rights and apply it to state
and local governments.
I'd like to take questions.
Okay.
Thanks, sir.
Let me see you quick.
Senator McLean.
Morning, Mr. Chairman and committee.
Just here at the top page four, Senate Bill 173,
it's a bill to establish an uncontested motion procedure.
Just move civil cases a little faster, reduce backlog.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
You don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Senator Strickland.
For Mr. Chair and members of the committee, you have two, one that have not presented yet
on page three about halfway down, Senate Bill 132.
This is dealing with the process where someone's competency to face criminal charges has been
questioned.
It requires hearing to standardize the process and the front end, and then it speeds up
the process for competency evaluation, also restoration for those with non-violent misdemeanor
charges.
Okay.
I don't see any questions.
Mr. Chairman, page four, halfway down.
So they'll 207, I presented before.
This is our third year of our effort to standardize
a process for how occupational life
and board still will criminal records.
OK.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you.
Appreciate y'all.
Any requests from the committee?
PM Newton, this is just a follow up on SB 141
structured rules, sir. It's a bill that deals with two time frames that were related to local
governments on the length of time for appeals from 30 to 45 days and allowances for local governments
on historic renovations. What's that number? SB 141, the last one, only one under structured rule.
Thank you. Okay. Here, Martin, I didn't know if you were ready for half study committees today or
you want to do this? No, we'll hold that up a little bit. All right. Let's go ahead and set us

Mr. Chairman. So Chairman Powell was carrying this bill considered in judiciary non-civil. This
substitute only addresses two aspects of the bill. First of all, line 81, the word
subject 2 has been added. That was the request of the House sponsor and has been
updated. The other change was on page six of the bill. Originally the bill was
for the purpose of allowing prosecutors to accuse certain crimes rather than
submitting them the grand jury for a bill of indictment, this restores the original
language with respect to that, with the exception of a statutory citation in line 128, which
was in Chairman Powell's substitute in judiciary, non-civil, would ask for the committee's favorable
consideration.
Okay.
