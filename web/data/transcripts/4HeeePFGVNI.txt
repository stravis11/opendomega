TRANSCRIPT
----------
Morning everybody.
If you will go ahead and take seats and
we'll we'll get started. Uh we're going
to open the meeting. Ask uh
Representative Williams if you would to
open us with a prayer this morning.
>> God of our weary years, God of our
silent tears, thou who has brought us
thus far on the way. Most holy and
everlasting God, again we come thanking
you. Thanking you for the many
blessings. We thank you, Lord, for those
things that we did not see that you
protected us from. And now, Lord, we
gather as a unit. We ask you to be with
us. Control us. Make sure that we
remember that we sit for the people of
Georgia, not for each other. For it is
in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
>> Thank you, sir. Uh it it's come to my
attention that some of the members may
not have a binder at your desk where
you're sitting. Let me encourage all the
members to sit toward the front maybe on
the first three rows or so. So we'll
make sure that we get everybody but we
want to make sure has everybody got one
now? We should have enough but we want
to make sure everybody gets one.
Okay. If if not let us know and we'll
try to make sure we get those around to
everybody.
Okay, let's go ahead and uh see what we
got this morning. Uh Representative
Bonner.
>> Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I didn't
realize you did this meeting just for
me. I really appreciate that. Uh it is
an important bill. I'm bringing before
you House Bill 980. Uh this bill creates
the Georgia Ireland Trade Commission,
which is a 15 member commission composed
of appointees from the House, the
Senate, and the Governor's Office. uh if
uh passage of this bill will join 25
other states that currently have this uh
and another 15 or so that have this
pending. But this creates the commission
that allows us to interact and um
enhance our trade relationships with the
country of Ireland, which as you may
know is the is currently the largest
English-speaking country that still is
in the EU. So by uh one of the benefits
of this is gives us access directly to
those EU markets through the country of
Ireland. Uh we've got strong cultural
and economic ties with Ireland already.
They're one of our larger trading
partners and this will further enhance
that effort for us. There's no cost uh
to the state. Um and all of the funds
that are uh utilized for this purpose
are to be raised uh from private uh
entities. So with that, Mr. Chairman,
I'll entertain any questions.
>> Okay. Have any questions?
Don't see any. Thank you, sir.
>> All right. Thank you.
>> Okay. We don't have anyone else on the
wall over there. Uh, Chairman Williams,
you have a request, right?
>> Thank Yes, sir. Can you hear me?
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee. I bring before you this
morning, House Bill 945 is halfway down
on your blue on the front of the blue
sheet. It's LC620310.
This is the Department of Banking and
Finances housekeeping bill. As always,
it comes with a a full support of all
the regulated industries. There's been
many discussions, meetings over the off
session, and as we continue to
streamline, improve efficiencies, and
better protect the consumers of Georgia
through our entire bank financial
landscape. Uh there's three
measures in this that included this bill
of particular importance I'd like to
highlight. The first is for the first
time we're going to uh put some
financial
protections for for our elderly
population where there's suspicious
activity uh or if there's suffic
suspicions of financial fraud. Uh it
would allow institutions that been
trained u to spot financial fraud to be
able to place a transaction hold of up
to 15 days. Um, again, this would only
apply to citizens that are 65 or older.
Um, and it would allow financial
institutions to request that senior
citizens u name a trusted contact on
their accounts uh that the financial
institution could reach out to
in the situation where they might
suspect that grandmother or
granddaddy was being
a victim or an apparent victim of a
financial fraud. We know what's going on
in our society these days on that. The
second thing we're touching is first
time there are
there are kiosk virtual ATMs that uh
ATMs across the state of Georgia that
accept uh that you can do cryptocurrency
transaction transaction zone and right
now there's really no consumer
protections for these cryptocurrency
ATMs. Uh this bill would provide
protections for the first time uh user
uh that they would be protected. They
could only uh deposit up to $2,500 on
their first transaction. Uh subsequently
after they become a frequent user of the
ATM, the transactions could go up to
$10,000 a day. But importantly, there
would be clear disclosures uh to the
consumer uh that the the transaction was
irreversible. It was high risk of fraud
and your cryptocurrency subject to
volatility. And the third thing is it's
adding some more
guard rails around litigation financing.
Right now litigation financers
financeers who were uh approved during
the tort reform legislation of last year
uh have to register just one time. This
would require annual registration of
financial
litigation financers financeers
in case the company was sold. They just
we don't want to know who owns not
there's any criminals involved and who
owns the financial litigation firm.
That's a rather lengthy explanation. Mr.
Chairman, happy to take any questions.
>> Okay, we got a couple of questions.
Chair Lady Cooper, you have a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's not really
a question, it's request. Is this bill
it moves forward? Could you consider
maybe on instead of just that one time
at $2,500, maybe doing it two or three
in case there's some way that they can
get around them? This is the biggest
area of one of the biggest areas for
fraud for elderly people in the nation
and they're taking hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of dollars for people. So,
thank you very much. But
>> it's it's a great question, Chair Lady.
the and I failed to respond that that if
if if the suspected financial abuse is
reported within five days and and and in
fact financial fraud, then the kiosk
operators will refund
100% of the transaction. So this this is
a huge win for consumers in it all by
itself. after five days and you were
able to prove it. Uh you do get your fee
back which is right now you don't get
anything back. So it's a great step in
the first in the right direction. Thank
you.
>> Okay, Whip Parks, is that yours?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you
for the bill. I I certainly appreciate
um the safeguards to address financial
exploitation especially of the of
seniors. The one question I had was is
there any recourse um to to overcome
this five day hold or uh you know up to
15 additional days if it is something
that you know an elderly person needs
you know what if an elderly person has
an emergency and needs these funds is
there you know bypass mechanism that
would address that type of situation
thank you part to answer your question
that's what the trusted contact would be
for obviously no financial institution
has to do this but those that go through
training It's all about protecting the
customer. Uh I can see your concern. I
would have similar concerns, but you
could take it up the ladder rel
relatively quickly with management and
get more eyeballs on the situation. This
is just a good first step in preventing
that fraud. Nobody wants to deny anybody
access to their money for a legitimate
purpose. We just don't want anybody to
be abused. Thank you.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
Thank you, sir.
Jim Chasers,
House Bill 704.
And this bill simply uh eliminates the
unnecessary reporting from the
Department of Audits for one report that
deals with architects and engineers that
do business with the state of Georgia.
We do it monthly and then they give a
comprehensive one annually.
The monthly one,
the
people that submit the information to
the department of audits,
only about 70% do it on a monthly p
basis, but 100% do it on an annual
basis. So the monthly reporting is
inaccurate to begin with. We're not
eliminating it. We're just going from
monthly to annually. And I don't have a
list, but I could show you what the
report looks like. I didn't prepare
adequately this morning. I had another
meeting. And it's just a list of
architects and engineers.
And it just has the dollar amount of any
contracts they do with about a hundred
state agencies
and and departments. That's all it does
and I'll be happy to answer any
questions.
>> Okay. Have a question. Uh leader Hugley,
is that your
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh to the
gentleman, uh talk to us about why it's
important to remove the subcontractors
from the reporting.
>> I'm sorry, I don't understand that.
>> As part of what you're doing, you're
removing the requirement for them to
list their subcontractors.
explain why that's important.
>> Uh, I I don't
I don't know how to answer that because
that's not what I understand the bill
does. The bill simply goes from
monthly to annually, which we're already
doing, but eliminates the process for
monthly. That's all it does.
>> So, let me just ask you this then. uh
why would you not go to a shorter
interval? If you if you say monthly is
too burdensome, why would you not go to
quarterly or semianually as opposed to
going from monthly to annually?
>> Okay,
we've only got about 200 accounting
personnel in the Department of Audits
and all we're trying to do is utilize
their time wisely. That's all we're
trying to do.
it in committee. There were some
off-the-wall questions that had no
bearing whatsoever from what I
understand,
but I wasn't in the legislature at the
time when this accounting
was important. It was because they were
afraid that the engineers in Atlanta,
Georgia would monopolize
the business of engineering and
architecture throughout the state. and
they wanted to make sure that engineers
in the rural areas and architects in the
rural areas would have a shot at that
business.
That's that's it.
>> Well, I understand that transparency is
important and that's why I don't
understand why we would go from monthly
just to an annual thing. But I
>> if I was if I I better prepared, I would
have brought a copy of the of the
document and I'll give you one when we
get to the chamber so you can see what
I'm talking about.
>> Okay. We got a couple other questions.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, thank you
for bringing the bill. Uh, Chairman
Shokus, as as I read the the bill um on
70 and 71 um line 7071,
it doesn't provide for any level. It
says all all contracts, architect and
engineering firms. So, so it doesn't
seem to me that it would be removing the
subcontractors. It's all contracts
period for architects and engineering
firms with the state. Is that correct?
Yes sir. Thank you.
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> Okay. Uh Quart.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um along the
lines of what leader Hugley was asking
and and how what you just stated
earlier, you know, this monthly
requirement was to prevent the
monopolization of contracts uh with the
state of Georgia. My understanding is
that uh there's a 10% statutory limit uh
with respect to state contracts. Um how
are you you know, with this bill going
to ensure that um we don't see this
monopolization of state contracts since
my understanding of moving from a
monthly report to an annual report would
potentially create a one-year blind
blind spot essentially when it's
retrospective as opposed to forward
looking. Well, as I said earlier,
the source of the information only 70%
of the people are complying and so the
monthly reporting is not accurate in the
first place.
Number two is that these accounting
firms when they they bid on projects, I
mean, not accounting, but these
architectural firms and engineering
firms, you know, when they get a a
contract,
it's a long-term situation. They've got
it's like across the street in our new
office building, that same architect and
engineer is going to be there throughout
the project. So I and historically we
haven't had any of that issue where one
has monopolized it. There's over 400 on
the list and I'll be happy to show you a
copy of it because this passed out a
committee unanimously last year.
>> Thank you.
>> Represent Evans, you have a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, Chairman
Chokus, the I think the concern about
the subcontractors comes because in
lines 32 and then lines 40 through 42,
it specifically crosses out language
that talks about if there are subs that
are receiving uh more than a certain
dollar amount. That also has to be
shared who those subcontractors are.
That's all crossed out. And then
starting at line 70 is where we're being
specific about what's going to happen
going forward. And that's not there. And
since the state is not contracting with
subcontractors, they're now only
contracting with contractors. That means
that information goes away. And maybe
that was inadvertent, but that's the
concern. And I was wondering if you
could speak to why we did decide to get
rid of that subcontractor reporting.
>> Okay. If and as I said I'm not
completely prepared for this and I
apologize but the way I understand it
these hundred agencies and departments
do the uh do the the u contracts out
individually. We don't have a state
agency that's doing that and it's based
on the funding that we as the
legislature provide. So, you know.
>> Okay. Uh, leader Fraation.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, Chairman
Chokus, is my recollection correct that
when this bill was considered in
committee, the department indicated that
the issue was that either reporting is
not being made or when the reporting is
done, the information may be inaccurate.
And in order to provide actually greater
transparency, there's a plan for there
to be a dashboard where this information
would be more accurate and readily
available to Georgians who may want this
information, actually providing greater
transparency and greater public access.
>> Thank you, Mr. Leader. I I appreciate
you explaining it more better than I
have. U and going to that on the
internet. It is on the internet. That's
how they they don't publish a book. They
provide this information on the internet
every month. It's available. And
speaking to the dashboard, the dashboard
is an interactive
uh uh way of reporting on the internet.
And so creating a dashboard, then the
user could actually go out and
um put in the parameters of what their
search is on this report and find out,
you know, how many contracts there were,
what the amounts were, the length of
time, the locations. This report doesn't
provide all that information. and it's
just got a dollar amount and a uh a date
and that's it.
>> Okay. Thank you, Chairman Cooks.
Obviously, there's several questions
about this. Let me encourage the members
if you have some questions to try to get
with the author offline and get your
questions answered so you understand
where we're going with that. Thank you,
sir.
Um, okay. Let me tell you sort of where
we are.
Uh we're not going to set a calendar for
tomorrow, Wednesday. We're going to have
the judiciary come over and visit with
us tomorrow. So that'll that'll take up
some time. Then it's my understanding
that the appropriations is going to come
out Thursday, have a committee meeting
Thursday. So what we will do as a rules
committee is we will meet immediately
upon adjournment of the appropriations
committee and set the calendar for
Thursday and put the budget on there at
that time. So that's where we are there
with that. So let's go ahead and and set
a calendar for Thursday. Now that will
be uh legislative day 13 under the uh
modified structure 985.
Have a move and a second. Is there any
opposition?
It's on. So that will be our calendar
for Thursday, but uh be aware that we
will meet after the appropriations
finishes their meetings on uh on
Thursday. Thank you.
