you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed thank you We will begin our day with our scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. I'm going to introduce a special guy as our chaplain of the day. He's a gentleman from what district is that, Matt? 128th almost gave you my district when I was looking at the script, but I won't do that. 128th district in middle Georgia. Mag Jackson is a friend to all returning members in this body and you new members get to know him. He's a fountain of strength and calmness as we go through the hectic days of this assembly. Now I want to tell you a little bit about Mag, Mag that I didn't know, other than you're a really good guy and a handsome man with a beautiful wife battery. So all those things said, Mag is like some of the rest of us. He's educated beyond his intelligence, but he handles that much better than I do, but Mag was educated to Albany State and he attended also Georgia College in Millageville. Pretty cool. Good to find school. He had a career with the state and till he entered his second career with the state and public service. Mag is a pastor at St. James Christian Fellowship Church Inc.. He was elected to this body in 2008. I think one of the best stories I probably have ever heard, Mag, about folks attending church is when you were getting ready to open your services that day and who rolled up the speaker, David Rolston. You're ready to date for you and for your congregation. So with no further ado, my friend and our friend, representing Mac Jackson, Mac Shores, speak to us. Well, good morning. Thank you, Miss Speaker. And congratulations to being elected as the 75th Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives. And congratulations to the Georgia Bulldogs for a perfect 15 and old season and another national championship. Go, dogs. And as I stand here today, I can't help but think about my friend, the late Speaker of the House, Speaker David Rolston. He was a true friend and as Speaker Barnes just said, he surprised me on a Sunday morning when he showed up at the church. I seen all these state trooper cars driving up and when I walked into the foyer, there was Speaker David Rolston. He was a true friend. And I know that he enjoyed the win on Monday night because he was also a true Bulldog fan. And he brews chapter 12.

Verses one through two you'll find these words We're for seeing we also a Compass about with so great a cloud of witnesses Let us lay aside every weight and the seeing which thus so easily be set us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith Now the question comes to mind how do we look unto Jesus in this new year? How do we keep our eyes on Jesus? Well the Lord Jesus Christ when he walked the earth He said in Matthew 25 31 through 40 When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory And before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another As a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand But the goats on the left then shall the king send to them on his right hand calm You blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world While was hungry and you gave me me I Was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you cloned me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me Then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord When did we see you hungry and feed you a thirsty and gave you drink When did we see your stranger and took you in or naked and cloned you or when did we see you sick or in prison and come unto you and The king shall answer and send to them Verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it until one of the least of these my brothers you have done it unto me There's a song that says if I can help somebody as I travel along the way then my living shall not be in vain Ladies and gentlemen happy new year will you stand with me in prayer? Heavenly Father as we come before you we thank you for another new year We thank you Lord God for a new speaker speaker Barnes father for a speaker pro-tem for leadership teams in this great body Father and we ask that you bless them give them wisdom give them knowledge that they might lead the state of Georgia Father Father we know that you're concerned about people for you say it in your word by this shall all me and know that you are my disciples If you have love one for another Father we thank you that we can emulate and we can follow the Lord Jesus Christ and when it's all said and done We'll give you the praise on in the glory in Jesus name. Amen Let us pledge a leave you You Members you may adjourn to the if you'd like to get a photo with the pastor with Mac to the South any room and have a photo with the with the chaplain of the day Mac, thank you.

Majority leader Thank mr. Speaker I move that the House adopt house resolution 4 Clerk will read the caption House resolution 4 Representative abstrace from the 104th adopting the rules the House of Representatives and for other purposes chair recognizes the majority leader Thank you mr. Speaker I'm here today to present to you ladies and gentlemen of the House the proposed rules for the House of Representatives for this biannium and Copy is out on each of your des What all what I propose to do today is just to walk through the rules As they're presented to you here identifying any changes Which may be a difference from the rules that we had over the previous biannium and just Any changes that you may see in your experience here as a House member So the first changes in rule one Under the previous rules Committee rooms were not included as a location requiring decorum So committee rooms have been added in addition to the House chamber and the other locations that are referenced Next changes to rules seven This would put Responsibility for invite resolutions on the speakers office So currently that was under the rules committee and this would allow the speakers office to help coordinate invite resolutions Uh rule 11 adds an ex officio for the health committees So we're just at the ex and issues this morning heard speaker burns Outline his objectives and his priority for health issues and that is reflected in rule 11 Rule 18 Improves the process where there are no Delegation local delegation rules To provide a circumstance for the for a chair to call a meeting and pass local legislation So as many members are aware under the previous rules if you had a local delegation that did not have rules it required unanimous support from members And this would allow in a circumstance where there are no local rules For a hearing to be held and by majority vote of the local delegation for that local bill to be considered in past Rule 40 Restructures morning orders and afternoon orders and what I would just say to you is I can summarize it this way This may be the most noticeable change that you will see But it will allow for certainly greater efficiency as we have guests coming to the capital and as we consider important measures So going going forward what we'll do is have an opportunity to recognize visitors who have come here to the capital In the morning as we have that was often of course part of morning orders But then what we have typically had morning orders were members speak on issues There of importance to that member that will take place after the business of the house is completed Now what you're going to see here is actually additional time allowed for that for that speaking under these rules So under our previous rules 10 minutes We're allowed after day 20 for for all morning orders 20 minutes before that point And under this new proposal there be 10 minutes for recognition and 15 minutes for members to Make a point of personal privilege So there would be combined 25 minutes daily and that would be maintained throughout session So that would not drop off at a certain point So it's actually going to allow for Greater recognition a greater opportunity for members to speak to issues of importance and will allow members to Have some predictability if they're inviting groups here to the capital who they may want to recognize when they come here rule 48 puts into It's reflects a current practice that has been followed in the house allowing a bill to be acted on in committee prior to that bill being second-read on the floor so A lot of what you're going to see in these proposed rule changes are us working to update our rules to reflect what's commonly being done Already in the house without issue to make sure that our rules are very clear that that's permissible and that's what Rule 40 would do I'm sorry rule 48 would do rule 49 Makes clear that on the final day of the legislative term when bills cannot be Assigned to committees because of the late point in session that a member cannot introduce legislation that day However that rule can be suspended of course and the real reason for that is on signy die We don't want to put a real burden on our clerk's office with a lot of legislation being introduced Which does not have an opportunity to be passed if it's introduced on day 40 There isn't a chance for it to even be assigned to committee On that date and so that just clarifies that issue and would be of help administratively All right, so rule 82 would provide for a potential fine for a second or subsequent offense For transgressing the rules So this is only a second or subsequent offense and that would allow up to now $1,000 to be the fine And so that's the that is the update there and we're talking about circumstances which I would submit our very rare what we would hope would be very rare But that makes clear what the sanction would be What the maximum of that sanction would be Rule 107 Makes clear that a bill that's on the rules calendar and is postponed will remain on the calendar until acted upon by the house Now members of the house who have been here in previous sessions are familiar that that already occurs So if a bill is not acted upon and it's postponed It's subject to being called off the rules calendar for the speaker to call for a vote At a later point in time and this just reflects that reality in the rules Rule 129 provides a clarification That a member may not vote after a machine is locked So your opportunity to vote is when the machines are unlocked and to put And to vote your machine at that time the Next change which really goes along with this are the clarifications provided in rule 136 That makes clear that a member who wishes to submit a letter on his or her letterhead with the word limit to provide To be provided into the house journal to accompany his or her vote That that clarity is provided so if a member chooses to under rule 136 to submit such a letter That may occur, but a vote may not be made after the machines are locked And I'd submit that that's very helpful to the clerk's office as well so that they're not asked to vote a member after the machines have been logged Rule 139 reduces the length of time required for machines to remain open So you all may remember this issue from last year with how long does the bell need to ring So so this would address that make Clarity as to that But it's but it would be subject to the discretion of the chair Rule 160 Is a reflection that I'm really excited about this year So as we all know we're Thanks to speaker burns and Previous speaker Jones working on this issue We are restoring the page program here at the state capital for the House of Representatives And it is going to be part of an educational component where pages who come here to the capital will have a chance to participate in an educational programming and there'll be a A series of events for them to do it won't just be them just come and show it up here with our outstanding page staff helping them and then them leaving They'll be more to Take in as they learn about the state capital, but as part of that The number of pages will be five will be the number for members And we believe that that's going to allow a real success as we implement this new page educational program And I want to thank the the speaker and the staff that's worked on that for making that possible going forward I'm really excited about talking about that with my constituents Rule 162 will set a limit on the introduction of resolutions So privileged resolutions are currently capped this just updates a reasonable number of resolutions Per session or biannium that a member may Introduce as far as privilege resolutions go Rule 173 Provides that when a member is excused for the purposes of ordered military service that The House rules comply with Georgia law so there's existing Georgia law that places certain requirements on What pay is or isn't to be given under those circumstances of ordered military service And this just updates our House rules to ensure compliance with statute Rule 175 Concerns third-party communications that are an important part of the legislative process So what I'll just briefly do here is talk about rule 175 and 176 So as many members here are aware we have a constitutional Legislative privilege now what that entails is that allows communication that takes place as part of public policy debate and discussion To be protected And that is a member's choice as the weather as the weather to exercise that but the purpose is To preserve the separation of powers that we have in the state the legislative branch Having free and open debate and discussion about proposals that are appropriate And for that legislative privilege which again is constitutional It does not exist because of our rules or because of some other statute and there is a long history and In recognizing this privilege At the request of legislative counsel we are seeking to include a Provision reflecting that legislative privilege in our house rules And this is really done for several reasons first of all it reminds members about it Helps to educate allow for a discussion to take place Allows constituents who may have contact with a representative or an elected official To have maybe a greater sense of relief that that legislator can determine whether or not that communication might become public at some other point Which could be a real benefit to the public and finally? It's just a reflection of what is already in place through constitutional means that legislative privilege and And again, this is at the request of legislative counsel And it is for the purpose of ensuring that the legislative privilege that is afforded to legislators like each of you Is reflected in our rules and is and is well known By by the membership here I'm happy to answer any questions mr. Speaker if there are any out submit that the rules that are before you here today are First of all addressing cleanup matters that That are important to to work on every by an even when we have new updates But also proposals to ensure greater efficiency Greater ability for us to recognize our constituents when they come here to the capital and more time for us to Debate and and bring up issues that are of importance to us I rather than having a more limited time to do so in morning orders. I'll be happy to answer any questions General will you have some questions? Yes, sir I recognize the gentleman from the 61st to your left There's any Bruce Over here wait way in the back. Yes, sir. I'll see with gentleman you. Yes, sir I just want to get clarification you know in the past We might be in a committee meeting we might be somewhere and you get here after Roll call and we will come down and sign A vote are we saying we can't do that anymore? So it so your presence your attendance is unchanged and in that respect what The difference here would be if you're going to vote on a legisl on a bill If you're going to vote on a bill it has to be done before the machines are locked Okay, but just on a bill because sometimes we vote on stuff. There's not bills Yes, sir. Yeah legislation. Thank you for let me clarify bill or resolution It's if you are late to to session and your presence is to be acknowledged You know, either there's an excused in place or the some other means is necessary in order to reflect that you're here. That's unchanged General you yes, sir The gentleman from the 107 My already will our question. Thank you mr. Speaker A leader of station. Thank you for the summer of the changes. Would you be so kind as to you to a few questions? Yes, sir. I'll be happy to So to begin with is it not true that the change to rule 18.1 could significantly undermine local control and provide the majority party the unilateral ability to pass local legislation That is opposed by a majority of legislators who represent accounting or city No, I completely disagree. So as the Members are aware we have under we have had circumstances in the past where either there are no local rules in which the Our house rules required unanimous support by the membership of the local delegation in order to allow that build a pass And what that effectively has resulted in is the ability of one member To hold up legislation local legislation which may be supported by All other potentially a wide margin comparatively of the local delegation to see that local bill pass and and In the spirit of ensuring that Matters that are of importance can be considered when there are not local delegation rules And update is provided to rule 18 now additionally As we have seen in the past there are circumstances when local legislation that is potentially very contentious Is ultimately debated potentially as part of a local calendar here on the floor And what the updates to rule 18 will allow for is that debate to take place potentially In committee which is an appropriate location for vetting of legislation for support or opposition of local members to be heard out and the committee where the bill was Was sent has a chance to make its recommendation after hearing from all involved and making a determination as to What the will of the committee is so so I appreciate the reminder to all the county delegation member chairs the file of their rules But just to clarify and again for the abundance of doubt During this session and in future sessions the majority party will not Or y'all commit to not passing local legislation that may be opposed by a majority of the local members who represent that Political subdivision whether it's a county or city Yes, so as I said the updates to rule 18 allow for vetting of legislation within committee Which I'd submit is a really good thing that's certainly how our legislative process is set up to allow for witnesses to allow for debate by members To allow members to appear potentially and to speak for against legislation in committee Which is particularly appropriate with local legislation where There are local interests or issues or greater knowledge as to the Issue at hand in the local bill from the members of that delegation So rule 18 will allow for greater efficiency in that regard not believe is a very good improvement to our rules And to clarify it would be the majority of that committee not the majority of the local delegation That would be able to pass that bill out of committee is that not true? So I don't believe that that is specified in the rules that are here It would just and it would allow for that issue to be debated and discussed in committee if necessary I just know that all members here ought to want to protect local control to ensure that people of George are able to hold accountable They're elected representatives Leader of stretching do you further yield? Yes, sir

Not true that the amendments to rule 1.9, 8.1, 8.2, and 9. Is it not true that that may restrict or chill the free speech rights of Georgians who may come across this great state of Georgia to come and testify in committee meetings to have their voices heard on legislative matters that may affect their lives? Well I didn't catch all the rules that you cited but I would just say generally no. The rules that are before us here today including the changes will actually promote free and open discussion of issues that are to be determined. You know we're each sent here to reflect our views on public policy matters that come before us and the and part of that also is having rules that are understood by all involved so that the rules are very clear and up front that we follow adhere to those rules and that there be an opportunity for free and open discussion to take place by legislator certainly as they're communicating with each other or as bills are being debated in committee. So just as a refresher rule 1.9 prohibits visual assigned visual displays by the committee chairperson rule 8.1 prohibits noises rule 8.2 prohibits any use of recording devices and of course rule 9 empowers the committee chair to clear the room based on what I would assume is a subjective understanding of disorderly conduct. So what we have is a need and I appreciate the minority whips questions because we're both attorneys and we know the importance of certainly in the courtroom having an opportunity to make arguments and to have a have decorum in place so that we're able to do so and I'm very proud of this house. We had cameras in our committee rooms allowing public access to our committee rooms that is maintained that is unchanged here they allow for debate free and open debate to take place in our committees is the cornerstone of our of our rules and and I think that that is that is a great thing that we should be very proud of. So I would just submit that any any cornerstone of free and open debate also requires there be decorum within a committee and a committee chair empowered under the rules just as the committee chairs have been in the past helped to protect that. Does the chairman yield from one last question? Yes sir. Is it not true that the amendment to rule 48.3 and the creation of rules or the codification of rules 175 and 176? Is it not true that that will reduce transparency in the legislative process and potentially increase the risk of corruption to the benefit of special interests particularly in light of the creation of leadership committees that allow for monies to be received by both parties while we are in session to the detriment of the people we serve? No what's what is done with these rules is a preservation of the transparency that we have and to make clear with respect to certain practices that are in place or protections that we have say constitutionally that that's reflected in our rules and that's a very good thing and I appreciate the gentleman's prepared questions today he clearly is thought a lot about this including bringing up rules that have been in place for many years and and so I think that that discussion is fine but I'm also happy to really focus on what are our updates to the rules that we've already had in place so that members are aware of that. Thank you leader. Yes sir thank you. Thank you Mr. Wip for those questions Mr. Leader thank you for those questions we have a couple more of you yield. Yes sir I yield for one more. Maybe a couple okay these rules are important. Yes sir. I'd recognize the gentleman from the 11th chairman Jasper's for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker do you yield please? Yes sir. You know majority leader is stration thank you for your work and diligent work on these rules and rules update and isn't it true that these are just an update to ensure the effective movement and work of legislation in the house. Yes sir that's exactly right that's that's what these rules are and I think the House members can vote proudly for these rules here today. Chair now recognizes a gentleman from the 3rd House District representing Horners. Hello one second have a little technical issue there representative Horners. Okay try again now. There we go all right thank you. Is it not true that on rule 139 it used to be 60 seconds and now it's 30 seconds to vote and it is saying or until the speaker has determined sufficient time will the chair guarantee that the speaker gives us 30 seconds to at least vote because the 60 seconds to 30 second window I mean we could be out there we could be on the hallway I just want to guarantee all right to vote. Yeah I know speaker burns and I know his character and the leader that he is and I can assure the gentleman that there's going to be no issue with that whatsoever I know that the representatives a newly elected member and I'm excited to serve with you under our previous rules 60 seconds is a long time if you counted out you know that's a that's a long long period of time and so just greater clarity to provide for a shorter period of time but in the discretion of the chair to make it shorter if it feels ridiculous to go that long then that's updated in the rules. Mr. Luder isn't it true that we're going to ensure that we start on time and we're going to finish on time and but we're going to be proactive as we move through but I guarantee all the members you will have an adequate opportunity to be in here and cast your vote to represent your people that will be no doubt that will occur. I recognize the lady from the 57th representing the Evans for a question to your left. Mr. Luder. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the majority leader yield. Yes ma'am. With regard to the changes in rule 175 about legislative privilege I just wanted to get some clarification because since we're just saying that if any legislator consults with a non-legislator then that's going to be able to be covered by the privilege at the legislators discretion is that right? Yes. We yield for one further one. Yes ma'am. If it's just that it can be any non-legislator does that mean that if I as a legislator anyone else in here consults with members of the executive branch that that while it wouldn't otherwise be covered by privileges now all of a sudden going to be covered by privilege and shield the public from being able to see those executive level communications with legislators. No I expect that the way this would play out is a member who may have questions because we can't all be experts on every issue that comes up before us we rely on others who do have expertise that that communication in order to help us make those determinations would be protected but but as far as rules already applying to the administration of the executive branch that would remain unchanged. I know I said only one more but any good lawyer always has another question will you yield for one more? Yes ma'am. How are you able to ensure that because this rule says non-legislator doesn't say non-legislators that are not in the executive it doesn't have any other caveats on it so how are we to ensure that the public is still going to have access to those executive level communications? Of course I think the circumstance that you're talking about would be the executive branch attempting to claim legislative privilege which is outside of its branch not constitutional scholar but it seems to me inconsistent to claim that the executive branch the administration will be able to claim legislative privilege it's a separate branch so so ultimately this is about ensuring that the General Assembly members the General Assembly can receive fair and impartial communication to help make determination as to public policy matters and what is already in existence constitutional legislative privilege remains unchanged it would just be reflected in the rules. I'm just concerned that a legislator will now be able to make communications with an executive privilege I understand the executive can't do that but that's my concern thank you for the question. Thank you. Mr. Leader let's recognize the lady from the 56th representative minor to your right. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. I have just a very short question for 1.9 I just would like to say that I do feel like you know we just had redistricting and in redistricting we did have props and so I feel like 1.9 is saying in circumstances like that if a legislator wanted to have some props to further say what their bill is providing that this bill is saying that the chairman would have discretion to say if the legislator can provide that proper not can you clarify that for me. Yes ma'am so the as we're all aware the speaker chairs debate in the presentation of legislation here in the chamber rule 1.9 would require the chairs approval for having these items in the House chamber. Further clarification? Yes ma'am. So I do know that you know say for example if we wanted to present something in the chamber we might have to get it approved through House media services and that's approved through the speakers office but this says House committee rooms. I see there's two sentences to rule 1.9 so you're talking about the second sentence. Yes. Yes so the chair of the committee would have similar consideration within the committee room and so certainly for your example so for a redistricting proposal and I sat through many of these meetings of course the chair authorized a visual display of the legislation under consideration so those were presented. Thank you for the clarification. The next question would you further yield? Yes for rule 1.2.9 I'm just thinking about on the first day when we had roll call sometimes the machines will have a malfunction and so if there is a malfunction someone can't vote is the follow up to that just doing 1.36 so they can have a record of it or what happens if there's a malfunction? If there's a malfunction the member is certainly going to be able to vote. The only issue of the clarification was if a machine vote is taken there's no malfunction of the machine and the machines are locked a member cannot then approach the clerk and say vote me yes or vote me no on that bill once the machines are locked and there's no malfunction of the machine and it's a machine vote that is it when the machines are locked that is there's no other opportunity to vote on that measure which I'd submit as consistent with our rules otherwise just makes it clear. Gentlemen further yield. Yes ma'am. I would just say if you're going if we're going to go forward with this vote it might be helpful to just put that in there for everybody's sake I don't know the procedure for adding the malfunction part but it might be helpful just going down the road because even though our body is distinguished a body ten years from now might not be as distinguished. Well I want to thank the general Eddie for the point and I would just say my office is always open if anyone upon reviewing these has ideas for ways to further clarify the rules please come and talk to me what I'd submit to you is what's before you now reflects the orderly debate that we've had in this chamber in the past ensures that we have clarification and updates for what we've already been doing and prospectively looks to make our process even better going forward as I've outlined and for that reason I would ask for your favorable consideration of House resolution for the rules of the House for this biennium. Mr. Speaker if there are no further questions I will yield the well. There were a couple more Mr. Leader but we'll cut it off right there I think we've thoroughly discussed this situation. I think I thought so or that many things have been outlined by the leader or policies that we've passed and we've utilized in the past this just clarifies them in in the document with our rules so there's no doubt about where we are and to the ladies point I think we've always worked very closely with the with the clerk when there's been a technical problem that we would make sure that that members vote was cast at the proper time this is when someone comes back and attempts to cast a vote after the machine is locked and we move forward. Excuse me. Got you. Okay is there any objection on the adoption of the resolution adopting the House resolutions for the 20 23 20 24 term there is objection does the gentleman move gentlemen moves. At this time I'll be glad to recognize nope just one minute we'll recognize you for a parliamentary inquiry on the adoption of the rules of the House all those in favor of adopting the rules of the House will vote yes or green all those opposed will vote no or red or red and the clerk will unlock the machine. What for what purpose is a gentleman does the gentleman from the third district rise I want to make a motion. We'll the floor is open for a parliamentary inquiry emotion would be out of order this time you have a parliamentary inquiry. Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Why do members not have the time to read the rules before they are placed on our desk I mean we were at breakfast until about 10 30 and I wanted to make a motion to table. The rules were on your desk last night for your review and so I think we do have a very robust discussion this morning and a very thorough explanation from the majority leader so with that I believe we are in a posture that we can move forward on the adoption of the rules. Chair would recognize the lady from the 106th representative Hutchinson. Parliamentary. What purpose would you like to recognize. Mr. Speaker is it not true that with rule 40.1 I would no longer be able to recognize children available for adoption unless they are in the gallery. No that's not correct you will still have that opportunity in the afternoon orders. Yes ma'am that would be that morning orders that is correct afternoon orders. Thank you. Yes ma'am. So the process will be as soon as we complete the rules calendar then we'll move into afternoon orders so that will give you ample opportunity to make any points and bring attention to any issues that we as members need to be have attention brought to. Chair recognizes gentleman from the 21st representative Thomas for what purpose do you rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that we've had a minor but very substantial change rule 79. It's on page 32 of the new rules and the previous rules it was on page 31 specifically saying respectfully address him herself to Mr. Speaker and Madam Speaker has now been added and I think that has to do with the great leadership of pro-tim Jones and we're glad to have a female and see female leadership in this house and I just wanted to recognize that that wasn't in her rules before and it is now thank you. Our rules are very thorough as they should be what purpose does the gentleman from the 73rd rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that the return of the page program and its current form is the result of not only the hard work of the speaker's office but in particular Mrs. Burns and that the focus on. The gentleman knows what he says states there's no doubt about that. Chair would recognize the lady from the 89th representative Evans whereas. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Yes thank you Mr. Speaker isn't it true regarding rule 8.2 that many of my colleagues are very concerned about transparency and public access for the citizens of Georgia especially in committee hearings and I and isn't it isn't it true that I will hope that the chairman of committees will give permission to citizens to take photos of themselves or of the of the hearings while they're and especially while they're providing testimony this is something that's very important to our citizens and I'm very concerned about and I just want you to know that are isn't it true that many of our colleagues are very concerned especially about. This this limitation in committee hearings. Is that 8.2? It's 8.2 yes sir. Is that the recording video that you're referring to? Yes for example Mr. Speaker I have citizens that have come to testifying committee and they're giving testimony is a big deal to them and they would like to have a family member take a video of them giving testimony and I'm very concerned that how this will be handled. Will you give will you ask your chairman to allow this to happen or will you ask your chairman not to get permission? Excuse me yeah. To the ladies question all of our committee meetings are on video and they are archived so the members family or any other interested citizen would have access to that testimony at the committee meeting. I understand you have a further inquiry. Yes sir I do have a further inquiry but it is isn't it true that it would be that the citizens that that's an extra step for them to take to get to have to go to get that testimony I mean to get the video and it would be very nice for them to be able to just use their own camera right then and there and to take that so I'm my question is would you give committee chairman a permission to give permission or are you going to say no cameras in committee rooms? I believe because of the of our openness and recording of our committee meetings I believe we're I think we covered that and I think it'll be a little maybe a little bit more strontious for the for the citizen but but there'll be a good quality it'd be available and they will have access and I think that's what we need to make sure that we have that transparency and I think we've covered that but thank you for your question chair recognizes the gentleman from the 168 from the coast representative Williams for a question for thank you but to speak of all of our inquiry. State you inquiry certainly we appreciate the first ladies efforts with the page program but what about those of us that have made 10 promises already for pages not knowing that it was going to be reduced to five. I'd say he has a problem. I was on the campaign trail man I would I needed 25. Representative Williams let me tell you the page program is very very important here. We're trying to make sure that the page program as it has been structured in the past was important to young people of this state but we're making sure that this experience as a page is very meaningful and there's educational and I believe we will we will this there is a new day if you will we've not had the page program as you know for several years now because of the restrictions but I believe this will work and we're we're going to try it I think we'll if we need to make tweaks to it we will do that as well but I think it's something we need to work closely with and try to make it work and accommodate as many people as we can so thank you for your question at this time we're going to move forward have all the members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of the house resolution the eyes are 94 and the nays 77 and the rules of this house have been adopted thank you the clerk will read the caption to a group a privilege resolutions recognizing and commending Dr. Alex Carma Dail recognizing January 26th 2023 is national guard day at the state capitol and for other purposes that completes the reading the privilege resolutions thank you mr. clerk is there any objection to adopting the privilege resolution resolutions chair here's none and the resolutions are adopted would recognize representative waspren from the 144th to come down and introduce the doctor of the day to the well representative waspren here he is if you'll come to the well representative waspren if you give the gentleman your attention a lesson gentleman the house is a privilege for me today to introduce our doctor of the day dr.
