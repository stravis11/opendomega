TRANSCRIPT
----------
and start our press conference. Thank you so much to everyone who is here to talk about SB 522,
Donna's Law, especially Katrina Breeze who flew in for this hearing and is the one of the
main individual spearheading the adoption of Donna's Law around the country.
Today we want to talk to you about SB 522. We want to talk about tragic but preventable
circumstances where individuals are dying by suicide and have not been given all the
tools that they could be to prevent that outcome for themselves and for their families.
is on the rise, but many are preventable. And it is rising faster here in Georgia than
it is in other states in the Union. Over 48,000 people died by suicide in the US in 2021,
and nearly 1,700 of those were Georgians. In 2021, 226 of those deaths were among veterans,
and 60% of Georgia suicides are by firearms.
We don't hear about suicides by gun the way we hear about mass shootings,
but we can't sweep the facts under the rug.
Suicide is a leading cause of death above homicides.
And people may think of them like they do sometimes erroneously think of gun violence
violence is an urban problem, they may be thinking of suicide by gun also as an urban problem.
In fact, in both instances, it's more prevalent in our rural communities.
Thanks to the compassion, personal experience, and hard work of Katrina Breeze,
we, Senator Harold and I, are today presenting Donna's Law as one method to prevent suicide.
I'm going to let Katrina tell her mother's story in more detail, but she suffered from bipolar
disorder and this tool was not in place in the state that she lived in before she spontaneously bought
a gun and committed suicide. So how does Ghana's law work? It creates a way for people battling
suicidal thoughts to voluntarily put themselves on a do not sell list for guns.
People can voluntarily and confidentiality, confidentially suspend their own ability to
purchase and possess firearms.
They would decide this, knowing that there are a person that maybe has battled depression
in the past, has had suicidal ideation in the past, and in a moment when they're not
in that low, they realize that they, when they're in that state, may be at risk of doing
something spontaneous and taking their own life. And when they're in their right state
of mind, they say, I want these tools available to protect myself. If I'm not always, as I
am now, if I do have that low, again, where I'm experiencing suicidal ideation, Donna's
This law is easily implemented and at a very low cost, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
will create two forms, a form to get on for a person to voluntarily place themselves
on the do not sell list and a form for the individuals to get themselves off.
A person can file the form with the probate court in the county where they reside or
complete the form with their health care provider.
receipt of the form via either method, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation contacts the FBI
to put the individual's name on the NIC system, which is the National Incident Criminal
Background Check System that gun merchants utilize for background checks.
The goal of Donna's Law is prevention.
It is a lifeline to those who are vulnerable to self-harm and it gives those individuals
the freedom to choose to help themselves so that they can live. Georgia would be the fourth
state to adopt this legislation. The other states are Washington State, Utah, and Virginia.
We have a number of experts because that I'm excited for you to hear from today.
In addition to Ms. Breeze, we have practitioners in the medical field as well as
and one of our citizen advocates
who's an expert in suicide prevention,
who can tell you some other important relevant facts
about what Donna's Law would do to help.
So, but first, I'm gonna turn it over to my co-sponsor
on this legislation, Senator Sally Harrow.
Thank you, Senator Parent.
I too want to thank everyone for coming today.
I've actually been working on Donna's Law,
the Donna's Law bill for the last couple of years.
I've been trying to get bipartisan support,
because it seems like if there's any piece
of gun legislation we could introduce in Georgia
that could get bipartisan support, it would be this one
and it should be this one.
And we are still hopeful that we'll be able
to get that support.
When I realized that Senator Parent was also working
on this bill, we decided to pair up.
And pairing up resulted in us getting a hearing today
in the Senate Public Safety Committee,
which we're very excited about.
Just recently, this bill took on new meaning for me.
Shortly after Senator Parent and I filed Senate Bill 522,
a young woman who is a family friend tragically
died by suicide with a fire arm.
None of her family members knew that she had that gun.
done. There are too many people hurting in our state. The COVID-19 pandemic
expanded and intensified a growing mental health crisis in Georgia. Mental
health America ranks Georgia 49th in the country for access to mental health
care. While we work on removing barriers to access, Donna's law will help
people who experience suicidal ideations to protect themselves from making an irreversible
decision. Studies show that suicide attempts are hasty decisions made during a short-term
crisis. Donna's law can help those in crisis and their mental health providers to save lives.
I now would like to introduce the woman
who is why we are here today, a Katrina breeze,
who was able to travel here today.
And we're so grateful that you are here.
Yeah, I really appreciate it.
This was my mom, Donna.
We call her Mama Donna in New Orleans.
She recently died by shooting herself in the head
with a handgun.
She had just purchased that same day.
She did not want to die.
and she did not want to shoot herself.
She wanted to live and she wanted to play
with her grandchildren, but her bipolar disorder
created an impulse for suicide.
She was aware of this and frightened by her altered state.
She knew that she was in danger and she immediately
took proactive steps to protect herself
from suicide every way that she legally could.
She went to her doctors and psychiatrists regularly
and maintained daily contact with them.
She then voluntarily committed herself
to impatient psychiatric care multiple times in a row.
She tried everything she could to not kill herself.
Despite the best psychiatric care,
my mom was forced to leave her hospital programs
and she impulsively Googled for nearby gun stores on her phone.
She drove to the gun store
and bought her first gun and shot herself.
Our family called the police five times that day
to prevent the tragedy that was unfolding.
My mom wrote to her psychiatrist
that same day, desperately begging for help.
My mom had never even held a gun before.
She took the gun to the public park
and she shot herself under a tree.
I know my mom would have signed up for this list
because she definitely did not want to die.
Had my mom been involuntarily committed
to the psychiatric hospital,
she would have been protected
from an impulsive suicidal gun purchase.
But because she took the initiative
to voluntarily commit herself to a psychiatric hospital.
She was not protected from purchasing a gun.
A voluntary waiting period to purchase a gun
could have saved her life.
I want to be on this list too,
because families like mine desperately need this tool.
Thank you.
Thank you, Katrina.
Next up is Chelsea Piot.
Thank you, Senator, and thank you for having me here today.
My name is Chelsea Piot.
I'm the Associate Area Director for the Georgia Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide
Prevention, and our chapter is in support of Katrina and Donna's Law.
So I'm speaking about this issue today, not only as a representative of AFSP, but also
as a suicide law survivor.
I lost my father to suicide by firearm in 1996,
so I was very young at the time
and didn't know what resources were available to me.
My journey with AFSP has been instrumental in my grief
and just wanna share a little bit about what AFSP does
and how we can support.
So we are the leading not-for-profit organization
and our mission is to save lives and bring hope
to those affected by suicide.
And we do that through research,
education, support, and advocacy.
And I know we touched on this earlier,
but just over close to 1,700 deaths in Georgia in 2021
were suicide deaths.
And 60% of those were firearm deaths.
So at AFSP, we strongly encourage gun safety and safe storage,
safe usage.
And research shows us that putting time and distance
between a person who is at suicide risk
and the lethal method can save their life.
So that's what Donna's Law would help to do
is to put time and distance between someone
who is in that suicidal crisis.
So AFSP again is happy to be here
and support Donna's Law and support Katrina as well.
So thank you.
Next up is Dr. Peter Ash.
Thank you very much.
I'm a professor of psychiatry at Emory University.
I also sit on the legislative committee of the Georgia Psychiatric Physicians Association,
which is basically the leading professional organization representing psychiatrists in
Georgia.
And I am happy to say that the GPPA does support this legislation.
I'm authorized to tell you that.
And really what this does from a psychiatric point of view is it allows patients who anticipate
that they may act impulsively to put themselves on a list so they can't buy guns.
I think from a mental health perspective, we understand that many mental health conditions
most, in fact, wax and wane.
And as mental health practitioners,
we try to help patients have insight into their condition.
One classic example, particularly for these kinds of issues,
is bipolar illness, which different people
have different courses.
But the characteristic course is there's
a period where the person is actually normal.
They're not experiencing symptoms.
And then, often biologically driven,
their mood shifts and they may get depressed for a while
and then after a while come out of it,
back to normal, then they may get a little hyper
and manic and come back.
And so these people can, while they're in their normal state,
can clearly anticipate, because they've had a history,
that in the future they're likely to get depressed
for periods of time.
And given that, we try and help support
Our patient autonomy to really, when they're doing well, make decisions about what should
happen to them when they're not doing so well.
In a way, this is analogous to the psychiatric advance directive, which was legislation
that was passed in Georgia back in 2022, which allows patients, when they're doing well,
to give consent for psychiatric treatment of whatever sort they want when they need it
later and may not be in a position to understand the pros and cons of treatment.
They could also appoint an agent, but for purposes here, so we have a history now of having
mechanisms so that patients, when they're doing well, can make decisions that will affect
how they're, what happens when they're not doing well.
And Donna's Law, I think, is another instance of this, where they can protect themselves
to that.
Another thing about this law, particularly from the perspective of a psychiatrist, is it
provides a clear way to take up with a patient considering when things aren't going so well.
For example, a very large percentage of inpatient psychiatric admissions are precipitated by
a person either making a suicide attempt or having serious suicidal thinking.
So they come into the hospital in that state and then they're treated and by the time
discharge comes around, they're improved.
And at that point, you discuss with the patient, you know, what's the safety plan going
to be going forward.
And this provides an easy, clear way to bring up an issue about, well, what about, you know,
the idea that you might get impulsive and when you get more depressed, you know, you may
feel like hurting yourself and here's a way you could protect yourself from that.
So that would be not only helpful to patients, but would be helpful to clinicians as well.
And I think these kinds of things like the psychiatric advance directives on which we have
a fair bit of research.
They are generally accepted by patients
because the patients feel that it increases their autonomy.
It increases their ability to make decisions.
Often people caught up, particularly in the mental health
system, feel, well, other people make decisions.
The doctor says this, the doctor says that.
And ways that you can help the patients feel
that they're in control of what happens to them
are very valuable.
So with that, I'm personally, and on behalf of the GPPA,
I'm happy to support this bill.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Dr. Ash.
Next up is Kim Jones with NAMI.
Thank you, Senator Harrell and Senator Parent
so much for this bill and for your support
and work on this bill.
Thank you, Ms. Breeze, for being here today
in my regards for your mother as well,
you're a brave woman.
Again, I'm Kim Jones, Executive Director of NAMI Georgia,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
And I am here to offer support for this bill.
We think it is a good bill that allows people and peers
to have choice and control over the process,
which is very important to those we serve.
And that is exactly what House Bill 522 does.
This bill will also, as was just mentioned,
broaden the opportunities for clinicians and counselors
for patients' needs and give them more opportunities
to also help those that we serve.
So we're just here today to say thank you
to our senators for bringing this forward
and participating in this process
and helping us make a better Georgia for those we serve.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kim.
And finally, we have Roland Bain.
Good afternoon. My name is Roland Baim. I'm one of the co-founders of the Georgia
Mental Health Policy Partnership, along with Kim and the former chairman of the Georgia
Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. I am also the father of a 29-year-old
young man named Kyle who took his life in August of 2019. I am delighted to be here to
to lend my support to SB 522.
As you've heard, it does a number of things.
But one of a couple of measures that maybe are worth noting
is that this is not just a bill that's designed
to help those who may be suicidal.
This is a bill that sends a lifeline to their family,
their friends, their colleagues, their classmates.
This is a way in which an individual who might otherwise
take their lives is able to move beyond that.
As was mentioned, the best thing to put between yourself
if you're suicidal and the act is time.
And this gives that time.
And while some may be concerned that somehow it implicates
firearms and may in fact sort of impede or encroach
on Second Amendment rights, this
is fully consistent with our Second Amendment rights.
Our rights don't require us to have a gun.
Our second amendment rights give us the option
of having a gun, just as it gives us the option
of saying, I will not have a gun,
or I will not have a gun for a certain period of time.
And so by being able to put that time
between the individual and the act itself,
lives are saved, lives are saved not only
for those individuals, but for every suicide death,
135 other people on average are affected,
And those are immediate family members, friends, classmates,
colleagues, things of that nature.
And those who are affected by suicide
are themselves at a higher risk of suicidality
in the years to come.
So this offers an off-ramp for an individual.
It provides a blessing to that individual's family,
friends, colleagues, and classmates.
And it is something that is fully consistent
with any conception of what our rights are under the Second Amendment.
So I think that this is a perfect vehicle as Senator Harrell was mentioning to sort of
move forward in terms of saving lives and bringing hope to Georgians who might otherwise consider
taking their lives by firearms.
So thank you both for bringing it and thank you for your efforts.
I'm so sorry for the loss of your mother.
Thank you.
Thank you.
questions. Thank you. That's all of our scheduled speakers, but we're happy to answer any questions
if there are any. I was just going to ask, you know, we're doing toward the end of the session
here. You know, what do we, what do we feel, how confident are you feeling that this bill is going
to get any kind of a vote? Well, our goal is to a, say, thank you to Senator Albert, the chairman
of public safety for having a hearing even though it was introduced late in the session.
Do you want to speak about your work with him over the last few years?
Sure. So our terms are two years. Two years goes very quickly when you're only talking about 40 days
in each of those years. So it is common for it to introduce issues one term and then carry them
through the next term, and I think we have some long-term goals like that.
It is actually quite an accomplishment to have gotten the hearing today, because like
I said, I've been trying to get that for two years, and it's difficult to get anything
heard in this state that has anything to do with a firearm, and so I think we have taken
and tremendous steps forward in getting the discussion started.
You answered my question with that.
I was just going to ask about conversations with colleagues across the aisle.
But it sounds like you spoke about some of their hours and hours.
Yeah, and I think there are going to be an opportunity for some good conversations
with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
Obviously, especially the Republicans over the interim.
and hopefully as we get into next year and that was one of the goals of introducing the bill
in a full hearing, even though we knew that it would not be eligible for a vote this year.
And I think the opportunity that our colleagues had to hear from all of these individuals and
experts can start to the education process. And when we get into next year and for meetings ever
the interim, there'll be more time to explain some of the nuances and answer educate folks on
on suicide and suicide prevention when they may not know,
for example, that those that don't survive a first attempt
often do not try to commit suicide again.
So I think there's some opportunity for education
after hearing from some of these experts today
and we'll hope that we can work to build
towards a bipartisan vote in favor of Donna's law next winter.
That's very important.
Yeah, come to the conclusion.
You know, a number of, sorry.
Just in case.
It's a very important point, some people think that once you become suicidal,
you remain suicidal and you will continue to attempt until you ultimately complete that suicide.
But the facts show that to be a boldface lie. What you see is individuals who have attempted
suicide but have not completed, 90% of them will not go on to die by suicide,
so that if you can save a life in the short term, you've saved that life in the long term.
and what a minimal investment for such a tremendous return.
So.
Thank you.
There we go.
Any other questions?
Well, thank you all so much for being here, and we hope to see you again next year
as we continue pushing this legislation forward and try to save George and Flags.
