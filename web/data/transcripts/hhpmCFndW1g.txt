So we'll move, we'll move our, we'll, we'll open the meeting here.
Representative Barrett, Carter Barrett, how are you, sir?
We're glad to have you today.
Representative Barrett, if it would be the pleasure of this committee if you would allow us
to appoint a subcommittee on your bill and work with you over the summer to get this
bill perfected.
This bill's got a lot of good parts in there and I'd like to appoint a subcommittee if
that sounds good to you and we'll move your bill that way.
That's, let me see your own number two.
If you're on number two, if anything,
you want to say to us what I point to setting me to anything?
No, I'm just delighted at that idea.
It's a great idea.
And given the unusual circumstances in the economy
and banking today, the timeliness is perfect.
So thank you, folks.
Absolutely.
I really appreciate you working with us.
And we're trying to obviously come to a great bill.
I'll appoint Senator John F. Kennedy
as the chairman of the subcommittee,
Senator Sonja Halpren and Senator Mike Hodges, if you three will, you two will serve on the committee and get this thing done here and
Hopefully we'll bring something back to us and we'll be able to
Have us good bill very good sir. Perfect. Please stay with us because we're fixed have something very enlightening here from our
Our resident person who knows about banks. Mr. Boefears is gonna come talk to us about the state of banks in Georgia
I can't think about a more interesting topic. Thank you representative. Thank you so much
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Come on up, Mr. Fears. Hey, Tony. How you doing? Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Fears, it is wonderful to see your smiling face here today. Thank you for making changes in your schedule to accommodate us. I apologize about us getting pushed back. And I apologize by always getting seems like we are schedules get kind of cramped up together.
But I think it's extremely apparent
that we hear from folks that knows about the banks,
understands about the banking conditions,
what's going on in the United States today in some areas,
and tell us how strong our banks are in Georgia.
And if you don't mind, I'll turn the floor over to you, sir.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate the invitation and the opportunity
to address this committee and talk about the state
of banking in Georgia.
In light of the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank
in California and signature bank in New York.
There is, I think, there is fear and uncertainty
in the market, and that's really understandable
when you see what's playing out,
how it's being presented in the national press,
and also what I would probably term
as a dangerous speculation on social media.
However, notwithstanding how it's being portrayed
in certain circles, the state of banking overall
this country is very strong, and that's especially the case in the state of Georgia.
The department, for those of you who are unaware, we have two primary business lines, and the
first is the non-depository area where we regulate money service businesses, which include
money transmitters and check cashews.
We regulate mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers, and we regulate small dollar lenders.
The other side of our business is the supervision side, and we regulate banks and credit unions.
And so part of that regulatory oversight involves routine regulatory examinations, where we go
in, us and our federal partners, and we look at the condition of our banks and credit unions.
And sort of the examination, what we do, it's called, there's a camel's rating that comes
out, and that stands for, we're looking at the institution's capital, we're evaluating
their assets, we're evaluating management, we're evaluating earnings, and as relates
to kind of what specifically is happening right now we look at liquidity and we look at
sensitivity to market risk so we look at interest rate risk and we do that with our federal
partners and then when we're not conducting examination though we're getting routine
reports from our banks and we are making sure that there's no outliers there's no issues
in those reports and if we see anything that causes any concerns we reach out to our
institutions and we work with them until we feel that we have we understand the
reason for that outlier and we do that until we're satisfied. So that's kind
of the general overview of what we do. Specifically as it relates to Silicon
Valley Bank and Signature Bank because they are chartered in New York and
California. They're not chartered by us. I do not have any special insight on
on those institutions.
I do, you know, I'm able to look at what is publicly available
and look at that data and so I'm able to determine
and the department has been able to determine certain
characteristics that are present at those institutions
or were present at those institutions
that are not present, those characteristics are not present
in our state chartered institutions.
And I'll just try to identify a couple of those
for the committee but first before I do that,
I do want to emphasize a very important point is that deposits are insured by the federal
government.
The FDIC insures deposits.
And a penny of insured deposits has never been lost in this country's history.
And so the deposit amount, typically people will reference there's a $250,000 deposit
amount, FDIC insurance, but your bank relationship and the FDIC, that relationship can be structured
so that you get greater coverage than the $250,000.
Signature and Silicon Valley Bank, it's important to recognize that they had a number of uninsured
deposits.
I think the signature bank was roughly 90% was uninsured according to public reporting.
Silicon Valley Bank was higher than that, and that's a high number.
But the federal government, even though those were uninsured deposits, the federal government,
the FDIC, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and President Biden determined that these
banks posed a systemic risk.
And so all the deposits, whether are insured or uninsured, were covered for the depositors
of those two institutions.
So kind of stepping into, so going and looking at the characteristics of these institutions.
The first is both of these banks focused on providing services to technology-type companies.
So fentex or the venture capitalists who support those fentex or cryptocurrency companies.
They had a concentration in that area.
It's important to remember that within the last year or so, those companies have struggled
economically, and there's been a number of layoffs and FinTech companies in the crypto
space and a number of those entities have filed bankruptcy.
In Georgia, we don't have that concentration, right?
We're much more diversified, I'm unaware of any Georgia state chartered bank that even
banks a crypto company.
So we do not have that concentration.
A second distinguishing factor is the level of uninsured deposits.
As I indicated, those uninsured deposits, according to some publications, were 90% or more,
there is no Georgia State Chartered Bank that even comes close to approaching that number.
And so because of that, those deposits have a tendency to be volatile, especially if
there's any loss and confidence in the institution.
So what appears to have happened with Silicon Valley Bank is that information was disseminated
by social media, the depositors lost confidence in there, and they withdrew their funds, fearing
that they would lose access to the funds in the uninsured deposits, and that the bank
would fail.
What happened, though, is that was a self-fulfilling prophecy, because they withdrew the funds
than they failed, even though that bank had assets far
in excess of its deposit liabilities.
So it was technically solvent by $40 billion,
but it was a liquid.
So that caused that failure.
And the final distinguish, the final piece
was the security portfolios of these institutions.
And so what has happened during the pandemic,
a number of banks, they were flush with deposits
coming into their bank.
But there wasn't a lot of loans to be made
because all these PPP loans were made to these institutions.
And so they were flush with capital, and they were forgivable.
So there's no reason to borrow from a bank,
because you already have this money.
And the banks needed somehow to deploy it,
so they put a lot of those funds into securities.
And when the interest rates were relatively flat,
that was fine.
But within the last year when there
had been the interest rate raises,
that's created unrealized losses.
So essentially paper losses in the bond portfolio, right?
And so with Silicon Valley Bank, I think that on Wednesday,
so two days before it failed, it
announced that it had liquidated a portion
of its securities portfolio, roughly $20 billion.
And it had to realize of loss of $1.8 billion.
And that was made publicly available.
And that's what fueled the crisis, or fueled the run.
I think it's worth noting that currently most banks
have unrealized losses in their securities portfolio.
But that's very important because it's unrealized losses.
They're not recognized.
And there's still worth the same thing
when they actually redeem them.
And our banks have done a very good job of accounting
for that interest rate risk by hedges or other mechanisms.
So they do not have that same exposure.
But I think what's very important to emphasize
is because the Fed recently issued a,
the Federal Reserve, I apologize,
issued a liquidity facility in light of these recent failures.
It's the bank term funding program.
And what it does is if a bank pledges
that securities, the securities at collateral, as collateral,
the fund, the facility will provide funding
in the face amount or the power value of the securities
as opposed to market market.
So if the security is say $1,000,
they'll get $1,000 back instead of the haircut at $900.
And so what that means is if this facility
had been in place two weeks ago, Silicon Valley Bank
would not have had that significant loss of 1.8 billion and my hypothesized that neither
one of these banks would have failed and so they would have been around for years if that
had happened.
So based on those three characteristics, we don't have those in our Georgia State Chartered
Banks and so I'm very confident in the safety and the strength of the banking system in
the state of Georgia.
With the parameters you all have in place, is my understanding, you know, you could almost
foresee a bank that's not, you know, working or getting their job done before it would
fail.
You'd be able to know in Georgia because we have these parameters in place.
Yeah, so I think there's, if you look at Georgia, like if you look at our history right
during the Great Recession, we had a number of banks that failed, right?
And but those none of those were liquidity failures, those were all capital failures.
And so you have an incredibly long runway for lack of a better word.
Under federal law, it's prompt corrective action.
Once a bank goes drugs below two percent tier one common equity capital, the FDIC has
to take possession within 90 days unless that institution is able to raise its capital.
So because of that, if you look kind of good to step back to the great recession, even
though we had a number of state charter banks fail, the FDIC was able to find acquires,
we was called a whole bank purchase, right?
And so both the insured and the uninsured deposits were acquired.
We had a handful of banks, I think it might have been three, where the uninsured deposits
were not acquired, but because we had that long runway, bankers would work with their
customers to structure their deposits so that very, very few Georgia
customers, I mean, 10, approximately, in this 81 banks failing, lost any
funds. So to that extent, we do. With a liquidity failure, you know, that's,
you know, at least if you look at Silicon Valley Bank, right, and you look at
signature. It's a Silicon Valley bank. It's social media fuel, right? So this is
something that we didn't see during the Great Recession. This is something that's
that is very different. I think another thing that's important, so it's it's
that social media driven and and so that creates some concern about how how that
and this certainly plays out the run on the bank the run on the banks for
example and so part of it because it is social media fueled and it's also the
the change in banking like mobile banking so you know if you look at it it's a
wonderful life everyone wants to kind of make the run the bank they talk to
their banker their banker discourages them right explains how safe the
institution is how you can structure deposits well that doesn't happen now so
in Silicon Valley bank I believe there was an effort to withdraw 42 billion
dollars in one day, so which is pretty significant if you're $160 billion in deposits.
So that's kind of hard to anticipate that, but there are, again, if you have access to
liquidity, and I think the Federal Reserve's liquidity facility that I just mentioned,
right, where you can get your securities at par of value, as well as other, you know,
HLB lines, the Federal Reserve discount window, when you have access to that, there is adequate
liquidity in the system.
Well, the concern was that, you know, people, 2007-2008, and we had the big issue with,
you know, the meltdown, whatever you want to call it, back in those days, where people
went underwater in banks, obviously, with lots of banks in town, it's an entirely different
situation that we're facing today.
I mean, they're not the same animal is the real state being in a water which created
all this landslide effect.
Yes.
And I think that, and I do agree that it's different, but I think the reality is you're looking
at massive, unsure deposits of these institutions, right, which we do not see.
You're looking at having to recognize losses in the securities portfolio, which we would
But not have to do now, and because of A, steps that have been taken by the banks, but
B, the Federal Reserve's liquidity facility.
And C, you've got massive concentrations in industry that is having significant economic
issues right now.
And we do not have that.
We don't see that concentration, so it's very different.
Well, I think it's extremely important that people at Georgia realize that Georgia Bank
and Commission and Georgia, the politicians in Georgia, Georgia State, the whole people
We support the banks, I mean, our banks are in great shape,
and I wanted people to hear that.
I wanted people to know it.
And I only got any questions from the committee.
And I want to ask some questions.
I want you all to know.
Excuse me.
Ten.
Ten.
Thank you, Commissioner, for giving us that report on Georgia
banks and the charter.
What about those big banks operating Georgia that
are not Georgia charter banks?
For example, Truace as an example,
that's a North Carolina charter bank.
Yeah.
So, again, I don't have any unique insight into those banks.
We do not regulate them.
State of North Carolina regulates them
or say Bank of America they're regulated by the OCC.
What I, those institutions overall,
I think that they're equally strong
because they do not have those concentrations,
they wouldn't have to realize those losses.
What I would say is that we have been in daily contact, sometimes multiple times with
regulators, both at the state level and at the federal level, discussing the banking
environment in this country and what they're seeing and concerns they're seeing.
And I can say overall in this country that regulators are not that concerned about what
they're currently seeing in the institutions, it's especially true in the southeast.
As it relates really to the bigger banks, the report that we are hearing is that they're
on the whole, that there are net inflows of cash instead of outflows of cash.
So I think what's happening is you're seeing customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
and maybe other banks that are maybe Fintech focused or crypto focused, they're taking
their funds and they're moving it into what they view as safer banks, more diversified
banks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Number eight.
Thank you.
Senator Hodges.
Thank you, Commissioner Fair.
The instance that you were talking about earlier during COVID there was a lot of money put
into the bank system, a lot of federal money.
Almost all the banks were flush and you were right, loan demand was terrible because of
the PPP loans. So there was a lot of investing, an awful lot of investing, most banks, some
banks didn't, some banks stayed short, approved to be smart, but a lot of banks bought
Treasury's bought agencies and with rates going up, I mean you can see the issue when there's
liquidity, you know, liquidity run or liquidity demand and you have to sell some securities
that you have a loss in, which is what happened with Silicon Valley.
My question to you is the banks in Georgia that what is the availability of that Federal
Reserve liquidity facility to the banks in Georgia that most of the banks that you
regulate, I'm sure there's some non-member banks there, you know, non-holding company
type situations. So, is everybody, can any bank, every bank in the United States, can
get into that facility and they just basically, if they've got, like you said, a $1,000
bond and it's because it's at a higher interest rate or a lower interest rate, it's now worth
$800. You can get $100. You can get $1,000. You get $1,000. That's wonderful, isn't it?
It is a wonderful facility.
And also, I'll ask you to mention again how you're working with other regulators, you're
working with the FDIC, you're talking because again there aren't just small banks in the
state.
There are some large banks.
Correct.
Yes.
So we're working with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the office of the Comptroller of the
currency. We have daily calls with you know it's hard to say that it's every
state regulator but every state regulator is invited and you know we're
discussing trends that we're seeing outflows and flows of deposits and you
know facilities what we can we're I mean we're having conversations about
potential acquires for institutions. So it's a very far-reaching discussion.
One last question. Do you happen to know the percentage of uninsured deposits in
Georgia? I think that the so that's a tricky question. And the reason I say it's a
tricky question is, A, when you sometimes when you pick up uninsured deposits, so
if I have $251,000, right, that's even though only 1,000's uninsured, it's
going to pick up the entire amounts $251,000. I think also the call report, as you know,
is incredibly detailed information and it goes into liquidity and it pours into that.
But it does not necessarily capture everything. And I think as the commissioner has frequently
he said, is liquidity is more an art than a science.
And so, for example, we look at the data,
we'll see what's reported as the uninsured amounts,
and then we'll reach out to our institutions.
And we'll find out, well, let's say that it shows
that they have 30% uninsured deposits.
We'll reach out to them when we determine, well,
10% or 15% is collateralized because they're public funds
and they're fully collateralized.
So we've got to pull those out, or that they use intrafi or C-dars, which are programs
where you can take the deposits and send them to other banks so that you get fully insured.
And so it's hard to quantify, but it nowhere approaches 90%.
Okay.
Mr. Chairman, I just one final comment is that in almost 50 years in the banking business
I've been through a number of really scary times and I think the recession 2009-10 was probably
the scariest time.
I commend the state regulators and federal regulators for putting our banks on a path to not
be in that position again, to have better capital, to have better reserves, to watch our
liquidity and I appreciate as a banker and as a bank customer, as a bank shareholder,
and a regulator, and excuse me, a legislator or a good job that you guys have done.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Mr. Fears, thank you.
That was in the state of the states of banks.
We'll call it in Georgia.
There you go.
We needed that.
It was good to hear.
It's refreshing to know that it folks like you are watching over, so make sure they're
dot-nies and crossing tees. Thank you. That's what it matters. I like to take this moment. Thank
the committee for our for our year this year. This is probably our last meeting unless something comes
up and I don't know about in our in our time frame. Wednesday night is our committee dinner,
supper and night. Pure talk of Rhea. Please know that's 6 p.m. Is that right? 6 p.m. I want to thank
Ms. Emily and Ms. Sarah. They make everything happen in our office. You can't ask for any better
finer people than these two girls right here and whatever happens to them. I hope they
come back with us next year. I really do. I like to recognize our state treasurer, Steve
McCoy, Steve. He's been exciting working with you. I've learned a lot from you. I can
tell you right now you confuse me every time you tell me something. So I just want you
to know that. But I really appreciate your knowledge and your intelligence on that
level. But thank you kindly, sir, and that. And last but not least, you know, he's been
It's been fun chair in the banking committee.
I've met a lot of friends.
I've learned a lot of new things.
And I hope that we continue next year
and hope we're as positive this time next year as we are again.
And once again, thank you for rearranging your schedule
to come and speak with us, Mr. Fears.
It was very kind of you.
Thank you very much.
And I appreciate the opportunity.
Meeting adjourned.
