non- civil that committee recommends
this bill do pass by rules committee
substitute representative Rob Leverett
is recognized to present the bill
representative
Leverett thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen the house I apologize for
taking your time again tonight but this
is an important measure Senate Bill 12
is no longer what it originally came to
us as as chairman Anderson said this is
a house upgrade we have combined into
Senate Bill 12 we've removed the
original language and place three house
initiative initiatives that
overwhelmingly passed the house last
year and this year one was House Bill
375 which was a bill of mind to deal
with when conservators can settle claims
of their war of of award a person there
incompetent person there appointed to to
to look after and to act on behalf of
House Bill 291 was representative
Scoggin bill that would expand the list
of professions or or medical disciplines
that can evaluate someone for a
conservatorship or a guardianship case
and the reason for that is is probate
judges are having a hard time finding
doctors to do this and if you've ever
had to go through a
guardianship where it's just it's it's
emotionally wrenching and anything that
drags that out or delays it is just is
horrible um you're basically having to
have a someone declared incompetent to
have a conservative or Guardian
appointed it it it already is a
slow-moving process and if there's a
delay in finding someone to do an
evaluation it can be very detrimental
and then finally we have a house bill
1264 that is representative Stevens bill
that provides for um impaired Health
Care Professionals um in monitoring and
Rehabilitation have a a professional
healthc CARE program for the ones who
basically when they're impaired means
they may be be going through a a bout of
depression or they're having a drug
issue other medical professions already
have these programs where they can
surrender their license and then go
through a program to to get better um
and this we're doing it here for um
professional counsil social workers um
I'm sorry for
um yes professional counselor social
workers marriage and family family
therapists and nurses there are other
profession that already have this kind
of program we're just expanding it to
those professions as well so we the
these are all measures you've previously
voted on uh the the worst of them was
161 to zero the others had more yes
votes than that and I ask you just
reconsider them so we can try to get
these done because they are desperately
needed for uh probate judges in the
administration of justice and for these
medical professions Mr Speaker I'll you
for any questions well chairman Collins
is already standing so I think he has a
question gentleman yield to Chairman
Collins yes Mr Speaker I'll
yield uh gentleman's recognized for a
question thank you uh being an attorney
you're well versed I know you'd
mentioned uh in this piece of
legislation that deals with people who
are incompetent is that correct I I
believe so I couldn't quite understand
the question but you're you're asking if
the bill has to deal with people who are
incompetent yes sir does that does that
help us deal with the Senate any any way
it it would cuz I think we need to file
a number of those but uh will'll have to
take care of that on a different day but
thank you for the
question representative Tyler Paul Smith
to your left chairman Smith has a
question does my friend the gentleman
yield yes sir Mr chairman Mr chairman is
it not true that the posture we are in
with this bill is because of shenanigans
going on across the hall yes sir uh with
the gentleman friend still yield
absolutely Mr chairman is it not true Mr
chairman that having done some probate
work myself and I'm sure that you have
many other practitioner members here in
this legislature that this process will
achieve the right results in a timely
manner for those that need it most
that's absolutely correct sir thank you
thank you for the question gentleman has
no further questions thank you Mr
Speaker ladies and gentlemen I would ask
your support for Senate Bill 12 and ask
you affirm your affirmative approval of
it thank you gentleman has yielded the

349 Senate Bill 349 by Senator hler the
52nd Alberts the 56 Estes of the six
echles of the 49th and others to be
entitled an act to amend chapter 5 of
title 48 the official code of Georgia
anotated relating to Ador taxation of
property so to revise Provisions
relating the setting of militates this
bill ad to the committee on ways and
means that committee recommends that
this bill do pass by rules committee
substitute chairman of ways and
means chairman Blackman is recognized to
present the bill chairman
Blackman thank you Mr Speaker fellow
members I think most of you know that we
spent a good part of uh the summer and
fall looking into um tax credits and
exemptions and believe this body put
some some some good thoughtful ideas and
sent them over to the Senate uh there
were
some I guess some uh changes made that
that didn't please some folks and we
were asked to uh maybe send some
language back over that uh address that
once again so this is uh substitute to
Senate Bill 349 it includes the as left
the house language on the film tax
credit with a couple of changes from
1180 it takes the 10 million aggregation
number down to 5 million and it includes
a trigger to implement the 2 and a half%
limit um as it bounces off the revenue
uh shortfall Reserve fund so it would
have to fall below 10% in order for that
trigger to be hit hit that has not
happened in over a decade um it
also adds disabled persons to the
affordable housing tax credit uh per uh
uh conversation I had with
representative glaze as a matter of fact
and I thank her for her her passion and
and her suggestion there we also clean
up the language on data centers um and
the commission structure there and uh I
would I guess close by just saying this
addresses a lot of concerns it is
considered considerate of of all
stakeholders and ultimately adds value
um for the taxpayers of the state of
Georgia I'd be happy to stand for
questions Mr Speaker if there are any
you have a couple of questions

the rear all the way in the back oh to
your right does the gentleman

best to to to do what's right for the
taxpayers and the industry and I just

by in the Final Days of our
session we'll always
wish that we could have done more on
some
things and there are a few items that we
may have had to
trim or cut in order to balance this
budget we worked with the Senate perhaps
like never
before on this
budget and I want to thank Senator
Tillery and our Senate colleagues for
their Spirit of comaraderie and how we
work
together in this budget for the
last probably 12 days every day weekends
included to meet the needs of
Georgians the Senate was able to
maintain or enhance many of our
priorities of the house and we actually
agreed with some of their ads
too this is a good budget for
students late yesterday the governor
revised his Revenue estimate to increase
Lottery funds by 40 $8.2
million his revision letter referenced
the work and
recommendations made by this House's
working group on early childhood
education led by Speaker protim Jan
Jones the conference committee version
of the budget now includes enhancements
to the Georgia prek program including
salary adjustments for lead and

personnel and just so we are
clear this
budget does
not include funding for teachers to
carry guns in
[Music]
schools oh

time this is a good budget for Georgians
who need mental and behavioral health
support from this
state $2.5 million to expand jail-based
competency restoration
programs a million dollars to further
expand our apex program that provides
Mental Health Heth services in our
schools and while this budget does not

ongoing funding for that program and
$500,000 for Behavioral Health support
services for those experiencing
homelessness

level we initially wanted but the House
and Senate agreed to 18.6 million or
select OBGYN primary care and Optometry
codes as well as increase reimbursements
for speech language pathology Audiology
physical therapy and occupational
therapy
providers this is a good budget for
Public
Safety $
45.9 million is appropriated for $3,000
increases for law enforcement
officers the conferees agreed to $10.7
million in new funding for the
Department of
Corrections to make infrastructure and
Technology improvements to detect and
prevent
Contraband to promote both inmate and
Correctional offer officer
safety this is in addition to the $19.7
million added by this General
Assembly just a few weeks ago in the
amended
budget and if any of you
have seen any of the news this evening
you have seen where our Corrections
Department
issued warrants on quite a few
individuals for doing just what this
technology will will
prevent the House and Senate jointly
funded a $2 per DM increase for County
correctional institutions at a cost of
$3.5 million an item that we've been
working on for more than a
year 25 million for the sexual offender
risk review board to address the case
log back backlog case load
backlog the Senate agreed with the house
to fund an infusion of $19 million for

reimbursement to the 50th percentile of
Market rates for child care
providers the Senate added an additional
$4.6 million to improve Market rates for
the Caps program recipients and we have
agreed the senate had reduced but the
conference committee restored funding of
$6.3
million to provide breakfast and lunch
for reduced price eligible students St
at no
charge the budget includes more than
$255
million for cost of living adjustments
for state employees and
$373 6 million for salary increases for
teachers it's also a good budget for
taxpayers the conferees agreed to $5
million in the state elections board for
thirdparty ballot audit to ensure
accuracy in
elections $4 million is provided to the
Department of Labor for modernization
and automation
improvements and $1.5 million for the
Secretary of State to address backlog in
the Licensing
Division and
maintain standard Office operating
procedures and coverage to meet customer
needs
$866
million in capital projects for school
systems
colleges
universities and state funded state
agencies funded with
cash rather than
bonds reducing the future debt
obligations while still meeting the
needs of our growing
state
in
conclusion over the last few
days I have been very
vocal with how many how some
agencies and certain Constitution
officers
think that this
budget is just a
suggestion it's not a
suggestion it's the
[Applause]
[Music]
law some of our frustration
is reflected in this
budget I will not highlight specific
examples but one
issue that has
become most
apparent is with certain
agencies that provide Direct customer
service to our
citizens we are funding agencies and
programs thank you Mr
Speaker we are funding agencies and
programs with the
expectation that money we are
providing is actually going to deliver
Services
effectively efficiently
and with an attitude of public
service with the approval of speaker
Burns I have asked for a closer look at
those agencies and how they deliver
services in some
areas we can do
[Applause]
better
[Applause]

said I'd like to thank a few people who

Integrity package um that includes
Senate Bill 189 that crossed over from
the Senate
and it also includes U uh a sub to House
Bill
976 and a few other measures and I'll
just run through it um the highlights so
this
bill does several things it um ensures
that parties have uh that have ballot
access and at least 20 other states will
have access to the ballot in Georgia for
the presidential
race uh it clarifies and further defines
residency requirements for voter reg
registrations it uh further defines
voter registration challenges and
probable
cause it provides for the option of
limited use of handmark paper ballots in
local
races that impact 5,000 or fewer
voters it eliminates the QR code on
ballots for the purpose of official vote
tabulation by
2026 it requires the timely processing
and reporting of mailin
ballots uh the mailin ballots will be
required to be uh processed and reported
those that have been collected by the
Monday ahead of the election immediately
prior to the election will be required
to be um reported out by 8:00 p.m. on
Election
night uh section n includes um language
from house bille 17 uh that's chairman
Alan Powell's language on chain of
custody uh section 10 requires the L
processing and reporting of votes cast
during the early voting period and those
shall be required to be reported and
processed by 8:00 pm on Election
night u in section 10 lines 548 through
568 include um chairman Shaw Blackman
language from uh House Bill 426 relating
to open
records section 11 um relates to pre
certification a precertification um
ver optical character recognition
verification audit that is an
alternative to the QR code and what this
will do it's a pilot program that will
begin as soon as this November uh and it
will count every single ballot uh before
the election certified using the text
portion reading the text portion of the
ballot section 12 12 is an amendment
brought to us um by a Democrat member
that relates to um allows flexibility on
dates of local elections to fill
vacancies um Mr Speaker that's a summary
of the bill and um the hour is getting
late and we have a lot of more work to
do and so um if there's you have a
couple of questions if you'll take them
I'll take a couple questions uh
representative Jasmine Clark to your
left has
question thank you Mr Speaker does a
gentleman yield yes ma'am section six of
the bill talks about handmark paper
ballots and I'm very curious um which
Counties have um uh less than 5,000
registered electors okay so uh thank you
for the question
and how this will work this may not be
for an entire County uh there are some
counties with fewer than 5,000 voters
but this could be for one County
Commission seat where they're uh
district is 5,000 impacts 5,000 or fewer
voters and we have situations where um
where that does occur and this is
optional for the local government to uh
petition the state election board to use
the handmark paper ballots in those
limited cases and can I ask a follow-up
question to that yes the current ballot
scanners that we have that we use in the
state that are normally used to read the
QR codes that we uh use on our ballots
are those ballots scanners able to read
the text or go back and forth because
presumably we would be using those same
scanners in larger elections do they
have that capability now and if they
don't how are counties supposed to pay
for the ability to actually use these
ballots are you referring to the optical
character recognition Okay so uh the
exact same scans that that are used to
scan the uh the ballots when we cast our
votes those same scans will be used used
in the optical character recognition um
tabulation all right um thank you for
that thank you you have another question
and we have some speakers signed up uh
just for your information uh chairman
Tarvin to your right in the back is
recognized for a
question gentleman y yes sir excuse some
of my questions here I've got about
three but I understand it removes the
Secretary of State as the from the
election board that's correct that's
correct well we got some messages that
maybe it it compels the investigation of
the Secretary of State by name and that
he cooperate is there anything in this
bill that says that so we are this bill
does remove the secretary of state from
the election board understand and it
does change the um uh the notification
requirements of the board when they uh
have a meeting to address emergency rule
changes uh the secretary will now be one
of the parties notified since he will
not be a member of the board
and U but I believe your question was
does this well it we uh got some
correspondents that says it compels that
he be investigated by name renberger and
that he cooperate with investigation I
didn't see that in the bill do you it
it's not in the Bill thank you so much
sir for
Bill Mr Speaker U there's no other
questions I'll yield the well we have
some questions but we do have some
speakers gentleman's yielded the well
the wisdom of the rules committee
they've limited discussion on this bill
we'll um first hear from those opposed
they have up to 30 minutes up to 30
minutes representative Draper is
recognized to speak to the
bill give the lady in the well your
attention please thank you Mr
Speaker good evening I Rise this evening
in opposition test B
189 this election bill has uh one bill
number but the truth is it is a lot of
different election bills put into one
package and there are some good bits in
this bill and there are some neutral
bits in this bill and there are some
really bad bits in this bill too bad
parts that are based on lies and
fear-mongering and that are going to
stretch our election administrators to
their absolute limits and deny people
their right to
vote I cannot believe that we are still
bending over to a common omate election
deniers conspiracy theorists and
unindicted co-conspirators when it comes
to election
policy I can't believe that we are
justifying sloppy and rushed policy
choices by saying we need to bring more
confidence to our elections when you
know just as well as I do that there's a
very vocal minority out there who will
never be confident in the process so
long as their candidate is not the
winner you know the policy of not
negotiating with
terrorists I wish we had a policy of not
creating laws to Plate conspiracy
theorists and one of the biggest
conspiracy theories that I have heard
not only out there but repeated by
members is that our voter roles aren't
clean and that we need to challenge
voters in order to clean the
roles because what this bill
does is it makes it easier to challenge
a person's person's eligibility to vote
and it makes it more likely that voter
challenges successfully kick a voter off
the
roles that's what's in section five of
page eight of this bill and we will hurt
more eligible voters than we will help
with this
section so in opposing s SP 189 today
I'm going to make three
points first I'm going to explain to you
that this idea of unclean roles is false
and intended to justify taking action
that is not
justified second I'm going to show you
how Mass voter challenges are being
weaponized they do not clean the roles
but they do hurt both eligible voters
and election
administrators and third I am going to
tell you that the real motivation behind
these making these voter challenges
easier I'm going to tell you what that
is so let's start at the top this
narrative that we have
[Applause]
unclean voter roles is
false did you know that election offices
are constantly going through voter list
maintenance it's required by both
federal law and by Georgia law and it
helps ensure that only eligible voters
are voting election offices are always
adding new registrants on or taking
ineligible voters off election officials
utilize high quality data from various
sources including the Georgia Department
of Public Health the Social Security
death Master file um and the department
of corrections to cancel records
belonging to deceased individuals and
those with felony
convictions when someone dies there is a
process for removing them from the
roles when someone moves and registers
elsewhere there is a process for
removing them from the
roles in odd years election offices go
through a supremely robust list
maintenance process where they remove
voters from the roles who have been
inactive for a minimum period of time
last year we removed half a million
voters from the roles in Georgia and
that was without a single voter
challenge being
placed the list maintenance process that
already exists strikes an important
balance between taking people off the
roles when there's actual quality
evidence that they are no longer active
or eligible to
vote and protecting Georgia voters right
to vote protecting them from being taken
off the roles are arbitrarily or
erroneously and that balance is
everything because again we are talking
about someone's fundamental right to
vote a vote a right that is so precious
that people have shed blood for it
people have died for
it and so here the key question is about
regular list maintenance is it working
is taking people off the roles on
regular intervals working
and the answer is yes there are folks
here who want to pretend we have a
massive problem with our roles and that
if there is a name of a dead person on
the roles that's a real security
risk but set aside the fear-mongering
and The Logical leaps and the facts
reveal that actual voter fraud in
Georgia is in infintiy
small so the Heritage Foundation
actually keep keeps track of voter fraud
and between criminal investigation
criminal convictions excuse me judicial
findings official findings civil
penalties and diversion programs they
have found that there were 21 instances
of voter fraud in
Georgia since
1997 let that sink in
So In fairness that information may not
be completely up to date uh since today
it was just reported that the first vice
chair of the Georgia Republican party
voted illegally nine times while he was
under F felony
probation but let's add those nine and
let's say there was 30 cases in Georgia
in 27
years with millions of Georgians voting
in every Statewide
election when people say our roles are
unclean and that that is a problem and
that that's going to have a material
effect on on our elections they're
trying to scare you because there's
simply no evidence of it and it
shouldn't dictate our
policy plus our election officials are
already handling it they're already
conducting that list maintenance at that
regular plan interval and to the extent
that a challenger finds a person on the
roles who has died or that has moved
that person was going to come off the
roles anyway with or without that voter
challenge so the idea that we need some
busy
Joe Schmo to come out with his own voter
list of challenges to the county so that
the rols will stay clean that's
crazy it has never been about cleaning
the rolls it's about causing
chaos so let me paint a picture for you
that's perhaps
relatable let's say that we're making
Thanksgiving
dinner and we're serving 10 dishes
turkey sides rolls all the pies you've
got everything t timed perfectly because
your guests are going to be over at 4:
and you've only got two
ovens and then your mother-in-law comes
over early and she starts telling you
how she would do things because she
thinks that she knows best and she
prefers that you make the stuffing
outside of the turkey and she likes to
make her rolls with a different kind of
flow and she insists that you should go
to the store to pick up the canned
cranberry sauce and all of a sudden your
your food is getting burned you don't
have enough space in the oven and you
realize you forgot to defrost the
turkey the process was working it always
worked it was going to be a delicious
meal and then your mother-in-law messed
it up with all her ideas and that's what
Mass voter challenges are doing with our
election offices they're causing chaos
they are forcing election offices to
process voters out of order out of
priority because because some people do
not have an understanding of how list
maintenance
works or maybe they're just pretending
not to understand how list maintenance
works but hopefully you do understand
how it works now so let's move on to the
second Point voter challenges don't do
anything to clean the roles but they do
hurt voters and they hurt election
administrators last year when I spoke in
opposition to sb22 to the bill that
prohibits election offices from seeking
outside funding I stood up at this Dice
and I warned this body that the weapon
about the weaponization of the voter
statute voter challenge statute and I
told this body that the challenge
statute was no longer being used for its
intended
purpose the idea behind voter challenges
is to allow a person with personal
knowledge of a voter's inab
ineligibility to flly flag that voter
for the county right so example you know
that your neighbor has moved to Florida
to retire they moved a year ago but then
you go to your Precinct in Georgia and
you see them voting so through the voter
challenge statute you can alert your
county office to look into your
neighbor and to be clear no one takes
issue with that kind of use of the voter
challenge statute but that is not how
the voter challenge statute is being
used
today rather is being weaponized against
voters in specific counties against
election administrators in specific
counties and yes against taxpayers in
specific
counties which specific counties
counties with large numbers of
Democrats how is it being
weaponized Challengers are challenging
hundreds and sometimes thousands of
Voters at one time there's no regard for
individual
circumstances they don't know the people
that they are challenging they don't
know where they live or what their
situation is most of the time they're
using a list they have purchased from
the national change of address
registry and since T oh excuse me since
2021 we've seen hundreds of thousands of
voter challenges flood counties like
chadam cob decab fet forye Fulton
gwet Mass challenges
Mass meritless voter challenges and I do
mean meritless because overwhelmingly
these Challengers are not providing
sufficient evidence to withstand the
threshold of kicking someone off the
voter
roles let me give you just one example
of a meritless challenge exactly one
year ago an educated sophisticated voter
in Fulton County and her entire family
had their right to vote
challenged they were names on a list of
many names that were indiscriminately
supplied to the county on a mass
challenge form and what made that
challenge stand out in particular is
that the voter was literally a sitting
member of the Fulton County Board of
Elections she was actually the Fulton
County gop's nominee to the
board so needless to say that challenge
was thrown out and we can all agree that
the challenge in that case was
objectively a waste of time and a
mockery of the
process and I want to be clear about
something just because a mass challenge
isn't successful at kicking voters off
the role it doesn't mean it's not
harmless it is harmful it's not harmful
it is harmful it's very harmful and
that's a feature not a bug for the
people who are filing these
things so let me explain to you what
happens when someone files a mass
meritless voter
challenge the county receives the voter
list the challenge list one two they
have to stop the work that they're doing
whatever it is preparing ballots
training pole workers checking inventory
registering voters they have to stop
that work that they are doing by law to
deal with the challenges within days of
receiving it three they have to notify
the challenge voter by May to tell them
they have been challenged and that there
will be a hearing within 10 days of the
notice to determine whether the voter
will keep their right to vote four then
the staff spends time to prepare for the
hearing they must research each
individual that the individual
challenged voter they have to consider
any evidence the voter submits and then
they have to speak with Witnesses they
have to reach out to administrators all
of this takes time and resources away
from them doing their jobs in a system
that barely has any time resources or
willing Personnel
left five then they have to hold the
hearing these
hearings separate from their regular
board hearings have been known to last
for
hours and six after considering the
evidence the election board makes a
decision on the challenged
voters so again regardless of whether
the voter has kicked off the roles or
not and let me reiterate because most of
the time they are not you now have
scared voters by telling them that they
are challenged and you have ground
everyday election administrating
Administration functions to a
halt we had an opportunity this year to
fight back against meritless voter
challenges we had an opportunity to do
what was right to stand up for a
hardworking election officials and to
stand up for voters and the fundamental
right to vote and what we are doing
instead is the opposite with SB 189 we
are making voter challenges easier to
bring and easier to
sustain so that leads me to my third and
final Point why are we passing a bill
that will make voter challenges easier
to bring and easier to sustain what is
the real motivation behind this
provision have you ever heard of Eagle
AI unless you're a big election nerd
like me I'm guessing probably not but
you need to learn about it because it's
a big part of what election deniers and
conspir theorists it's a big part of why
they're supporting this
bill many of those same folks support
Eagle
ai ai it's a tech company that was found
right after the 2020 election key
supporters include Georgia serial
registration Challenger Jason Frasier
and former president Trump lawyer CA
Mitchell
don't Google the company to find its
website you won't find it they keep a
pretty low profile but they've been
working for years on a tool to
streamline the voter challenge
process the tool pulls data off the
internet which by the way is lowquality
data far less reliable from what our
election offices
have and that data is used during the
list maintenance process right so the
tool will flag a voter because they have
a missing comma in their name or they
have an initial instead of a middle name
it will flag the voter if they're
deceased and these are either
insignificant issues or there are issues
that would have been picked up during
the regular Miss list maintenance
process and by using this software with
just a couple of clicks any amateur
sleuth can compile a list of mass Mo
voter
challenges and an email will be
generated with the correct language so
that they can send that mass voter
challenge right to their election
office so it is a scam and it is a
racket and it's going to cause the
number of voter challenges before the
2024 election to
explode and what are we doing with s SP
189 we're adding kerosene to that
fire the eyes of the country will be
watching Georgia in the months leading
up to November are we going to be a
state that leads with truth and facts or
are we going to bow down to lies and
obstruction don't say that you don't see
this coming because it is coming and if
you vote Yes to SB 189 you are choosing
the grifters over
Georgians Mr Speaker I yield the
well lady has yielded the
well representative ran is recognized to
speak to the
bill
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues today I
rise in strong opposition to Senate Bill
189 my colleague has very succinctly
presented a lot of the concerns with
this bill and I want to stress on some
of
them almost every year we do this almost
every year we come to the chamber and
around this time we rush through a bill
related to voting because it's great for
election season but the problem is it is
terrible for our democracy
the reality of the situation is we
cannot govern by algorithm we cannot
govern by what our social media feeds
are telling us Time After Time After
Time these bills come forward and we can
literally walk to a different part of
the building and speak to the
stakeholders relevant to these
bills but instead of doing that we're
instead choosing to governed by
algorithm I don't need to play into the
stereotypes that all of you have about
other countries around the world but one
of the bedrocks of our country is our
belief in our electoral
system and election experts have looked
at billions of ballots studied multiple
races and have found no evidence of
systemic voter fraud and when there was
systemic voter fraud we've caught
it but we can't keep coming here as
elected officials people TR trust us
people look to us as authoritative
figures and when we lean into these
conspiracies when we lean into this
rhetoric we are telling people that what
you are seeing what some random person
who's going to lose nothing tweets out
is
true the internet is a beautiful thing
it is an incredible thing it has brought
us together it has it's exposed us to
multiple
perspectives but the reality situation
is our job requires us to sift through
all that noise
and come to the truth we have access to
these stakeholders and we can go talk to
them today in our counties in our cities
and in our
building and I've come up here before
and I've explained it to yall we cannot
keep mandating these unfunded
requirements by our counties this is
impacting counties around the entire
state it doesn't matter what party it is
the professionals who are doing this
work the people who are as apolitical as
you can get these days are the ones
bearing the brunt of all of
this just so y'all
know my voter file was
purged my voter file was purged if you
look me up right now it says the first
time I voted was in 2020 and I've got
the Selfies to disprove that and the
reason is that people kept trying to go
through the voter log over and over and
over again and I got caught in that
that's how data sets work the more times
you run it the more more likely you are
to run into
mistakes and so when we keep enabling
these challenges when we keep enabling
these people who literally can just send
out a tweet or write a blog post or post
a podcast or put out a YouTube video and
instead of going you know what I hear
what this person is saying let me go do
the hard work of verifying whether or
not what they're saying is
true instead we go I'm going to lean
into that and I'm just going to do what
everyone's telling me to do
we have a responsibility to push back on
lies not turn them into
legislation I'm very serious about this
election Integrity is so important but
what we don't realize is by continuing
to lean into election Integrity this way
we are actually eroding election
Integrity when you keep telling people
that our voter roles are wrong that our
machines are hackable that our elections
aren't secure there there's massive
voter fraud instead of doing the thing
that we've done for centuries which is
the peaceful transfer of
power you are enabling forces in our
communities and our country that are
dangerous and
fundamentally a threat to
us frankly I'm surprised the people who
care so much about security continue to
make us less secure because once again
social media algorithms have put us in
bubbles information bubbles
that mandate that we take these
positions we can literally walk to the
Secretary of State's office and have a
conversation with them we can literally
walk to different parts of our
government agencies and have
conversations with them that is our job
and what this bill does is it tells
people no not only have we not been
doing our jobs but in fact government is
fundamentally evil and
corrupt sorry y'all we're part of
government whether you like it or not
our job is to make this system better
not continue to score cheap political
points every single year at the expense
of our democracy and I know this sounds
hyperbole or whatever the case may be
but so far the voter challenges from
foresight to Gwynette from fton to Decap
from Hall to
Clayton these voter challenges have
continued to be baseless and yet we have
election officials wasting precious time
60 to 70 hour weeks for months just to
get through these voter challenges you
don't think that's precious time
required to prepare for the next set of
Elections to update our systems to clean
up the voter registration
roles so we keep enabling this
incredibly undemocratic
process instead of reminding people that
this is what makes who we are as a
nation
incredible it's like we've forgotten
that it's like we've forgotten one of
the most fundamental things that's
incredible about our
country we have we've been peacefully
transitioning power for
centuries but you don't think that this
constant chipping you know it's like a
death by a Thousand
Cuts that's what these bills do it's a
death by a Thousand Cuts you don't think
that's going to have an impact
you don't think that plays a part in the
psyche of our constituents who want to
believe in our Democratic processes but
they hear from their elected officials
oh I'm sorry that might not be the
case we have got to end this cycle
enough is
enough again experts have reviewed
billions of ballots over the
years there has not been evidence of
systemic voter fraud
but if we keep doing this and this is
not an exaggeration because I I'm I'm
hearing it from more and more people who
say well my elected official said it's
happening even when I know that elected
official knows it's not
true even when they've privately told me
I know this is not
true but our constituents don't know
that our constituents aren't in these
halls with us where we're kind of like
you know I I don't really support this
but I'm just going to have to vote for
it because it's an election year they're
not in these halls with us and they are
hearing what we are saying to them and
what we're signaling to them and I
promise you if we keep legislating by
algorithm I I don't know what that
future is going to look
like and so I really urge people to get
out of this like partisan element of
when it comes to elections I know this
is politics I know this is how this
works but of all the things I really
think elections should be the place
where we say enough is
enough because would sincerely hate
sincerely hate for us to get to a point
where we can't even hold elections
anymore without it constantly
consistently being a problem and where
frankly my biggest concern is that
people completely disbelieve in the
system moving forward and it's going to
become harder for us to hold
elections we've had election workers
threatened we have had um voters
intimidated this has happened all within
the past four years we our memories are
not that short and so I urge you today
one from a procedural perspective this
bill doesn't work but from the
perspective of protecting our
democracy right and our peaceful
transfer of power we cannot keep doing
this we owe it to our constituents to
sift between what's right from wrong and
not governed by algorithm thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the
well ladies yield of the well represent
park Canon you have about three a little
over three minutes remaining on the
time thank you Mr Speaker members I rise
in concern about lines 94 through 96
which apparently were added to this
measure which address those who do not
have a permanent home as to where they
register to vote let's be clear Georgia
has strict voter ID laws so for
individuals who are unhoused it's
already
difficult enough for them to prove who
they are many times they have an expired
license and rely on a voter ID card that
we're not even able to use in order to
vote I ask why do we even call it a
voter ID card if you can't use it as ID
to
vote secondly Georgia has no homeless
voting rights statute if it really has
no Provisions that protect those who are
homeless in general that's why the
National Coalition for the homeless NCH
created the you don't need a home to
vote
campaign as of now in Georgia you could
list the address of a place where you
usually stay or a map or coordinate
nearby where you feel comfortable and
that makes sense because you could be
unhoused in any part of any
County this bill makes it really
confusing because now it says any person
of this state who is homeless shall put
their permanent address as the
registrar's office of the county in
which the person
resides how does that make sense that
everyone in Fulton County who is
unhoused would put the government
Center's Address
it just simply does not make sense I
recommend that we look at the National
Law Center on homelessness and poverty
and reclaim that voting is a common
right even when you are
unhoused lastly I'll recommend that
everyone take a look at the film called
rigged I hosted a film screening of it
in my district it outlined how one
individual did thousands of voter
challenges and when he was met with one
of those individuals whose vote he
challenged a military professional who
had to go out of state for our state's
military when he was face face to face
with that person and asked would you
apologize for challenging this man's
right to vote he
refused today I think we need to refuse
to vote to this bill because it allows
for the increase of voter challenges and
it does not make sense for those who are
unhoused I will be voting no and I
recommend that you vote no to this
measure thank you Mr Speaker I yield The
Well the lady has yielded the well that
completes those opposed to the
bills representative representative
Anderson is recognize the speak in favor
of the
bill I hope you won't take it but you
have up to 30 minutes okay I will not
take that Mr chair uh speaker thank you
for uh recognizing
me colleagues as I was sitting there
listening to the uh the the previous
speakers my uh my discussion in favor of
this bill has evolved a little bit my
original intent was to talk only about
the sections that were not discussed
which would be the uh like section one
which further separates the powers
between the executive and the
legislative branch by removing the
Secretary of State as an next official
member of the board uh and then also to
Define how in section two how the the uh
emergency rules and regulations that
come before the board that that because
of that separation the secretary is
added to the list of
notification uh as well as other
Provisions in this bill but hearing the
discussion we just had I wanted to
actually turn to the bill itself and
look at the context and the content of
what the bill has a lot of discussion
was had about section five regarding
challenges and let's look at section
five I'm going to start at line 179
where we start adding uh some language
to current code line 179 through
184
defines the probable causes that can be
used for
challenges lines
184
through
189 actually through 195 excuse me then
defines what will cause insufficient
probable cause for challenges so I
contend that what we have done is we've
defined how you can challenge and Define
the parameters that those challenges can
be found
insufficient looking at line 190 through
192
any challenge of an elected elector
within 45 days of the Primary runoff
primary election uh or runoff election
shall be postponed until the
certification of that primary election
of run or runoff is completed this
prevents last minute challenges from
delaying elections it prevents last
minute challenges from causing you as as
a uh uh as a candidate from having to
deal with those kind of issues and for
the electors having to deal with that
and then 193 through
195 any challenge of an elector who is
deemed elig eligible pursuant to The
Residency determination provided for in
paragraph 810 or 11 of subsection a it
goes on and basically that's referencing
section four of the bill we just had
some discussion about section four
regarding homeless section four provides
a mechanism for the homeless to actually
have the opportunity to vote that has
been left up to local jurisdictions up
to this point we're defining that in
code and then it also goes further to
Define how people's residency is
determined and this is something that
takes the most amount of time in dealing
with challenges how do you determine the
actual residency of those challenges
colleagues I contend that our bill
actually makes the process of
challenging more difficult and it
actually is designed to clarify clarify
what constitutes a valid challenge
clarify what constitutes an invalid
Challenge and with that Mr Speaker I'll
yield the well and ask for everyone's
favorable consideration gentem yield of
the well that completes the discussion
on the bill we do have a minority report
represent excuse me is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered chair here's none the previous
question is ordered now we're ready for
our Minority Report representative Stacy
Evans is recognized for up to 20
minutes thank you Mr Speaker and good
evening colleagues I Rise and opposition
to Senate Bill 189 just wanted to talk
about some of the points we heard from
the pro Side Of The Ledger here um the
first thing we heard was okay we heard a
lot about section five but let's talk
talk about the rest of the bill and all
these great things that are in the
Bill well I would love to be able to
vote on all those parts by themselves
because there is good in this bill as
was said there were there are neutral
Parts in the bill I'd love would love Mr
Speaker if we could vote on those things
separately but our house rules don't
allow us to amend or pull out parts and
instead all this was mashed together so
we have no choice but to vote on it as a
whole considering all of its parts and
that includes section
five so I wish we could I do agree that
there are good parts in this
bill we heard hey we're we're we're
preventing these last minute
challenges 45 days anything that's done
within 45 days in an election we're
going to we're going to put that to the
side and you deal with that
after I'm not really comforted by that
for two
reasons number one does that mean we
pile all this up and we deal with it
right after the election and all those
folks that wanted to to deny elections
and find all these reasons why the
election is not valid and all these
voters um we not qualified we're going
to spend all that time calling the
election into question and less than
until all those voter challenges are
resolved so that's not very comforting
to me the other thing is that you know
if you if you study the election code
like probably most of us in here
don't there is no systemic list
maintenance allowed 90 days before an
election by federal law 90 days not 45
days and in a state like ours where we
have a good early voting period you're
getting pretty close anyway so I'm not
comforted by
that and I'll leave you with
this
why ladies and gentlemen I was here once
before and I left for a couple years and
I came back every year since I've been
back we have done an election bill we
have given new rules new regulations new
UNF unfunded mandates unfunded mandates
to our local election boards and said
you figure it
out you figure it out we're not going to
give you any more money we're going to
try to put limits on who you can even
hire we wanted to do that today you
figure it out
how about we wait and see if some of
this is working we have we have come
down here and passed bills that affect
elections like I said every year that I
can remember and every time we do it the
proponents of those pieces of
legislation come to this well and say
this is going to secure our elections we
are going to have the most secure the
most Fair elections that you can ever
have and then the next year we have to
come back and open up the code again so
are you lying then or El liing now is it
now going to be the most secure or we
going to come back next year and do it
again more unfunded mandates for our
County elected officials how about we
see and I'll also say this you know I
got a
5-year-old he was down here earli or he
couldn't stay very long because he was
trying to pull out the microphones and
wanted to climb on the chairs but they
have a game they play in his class
called fiction or non-fiction the
teacher describes a scenario and the
kids have to say fiction or non-fiction
ition how about next time somebody calls
you with a conspiracy theory or their
idea about why this voter is not
eligible to vote how about you pause for
a second and ask yourself fiction or
non-fiction and if you think it
sounds like fiction how about instead of
rushing down here to write another law
to appease somebody in your District who
wants to spread fiction how about you
say you know ma'am or you know sir
I don't think that's
true we've done audit after audit we've
done study after study our elections are
secure there is no widespread voter
fraud how about you tell them
that I think we would be able to make a
lot better use of our time if we were to
tell our constituents when things are
fiction instead of writing another bill
to appease those that want to spread
lies
thank you Mr Speaker and I yield the
well the ladies yielded the well that
completes the Minority Report now we'll
go on Cher time Chairman's time
representative chairman Le Hood to
recognize for the chair's
time thank you speaker and I'll be real
brief one of the speakers that opposed
the bill mentioned that um they use the
word crazy to describe this this bill
and some of the ideas in this bill
what's crazy to me is the idea that
anybody in this chamber would be okay
with a fraudulent vote canceling your
legal Vote or anybody's legal
vote we don't have a government by the
majority we have a government by the
majority who
participate and we want to increase
participation and to do that we want
need to increase the
confidence of our voters that's exactly
what this bill does fraud makes votes
not matter what this bill does is ensure
that your legal vote does matter U Mr
Speaker I encourage everyone in here to
vote green uh for the Integrity of our
elections and I'll yield the well

will you read the caption to Senate Bill
494
494 Senate Bill 494 by Senator Watson
the 11th Robertson the 29th katrick the
32nd and others be entitled act to amend
chapter 23 of title two of the official
code of Georgia annotated relating to
the Georgia hemp farming act so it's to
regulate hemp products this bill have
inferred to the committee on agriculture
and consumer affairs that committee
recommends that this bill doe pass by
rules committee
substitute chair recognizes leader f
sttion to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker this is uh the
uh house substitute to Senate Bill 494
what uh we did in this bill is collect
legislation from Senate Bill 494 Senate
Bill 437 House Bill 458 worked in
partnership with the Department of
Agriculture to address consumable hemp
products and other hemp related issues
um you'll recall that we had a
conference committee last year that we
passed it went over to the Senate failed
by one vote that had important uh
regulations in this area this year we
had a conference committee report that
was on the desk in the Senate T Tuesday
of this week they have still not voted
on it so we're now taking important
consumer protection measures to address
hemp products that are currently out in
Georgia and just to run through it here
this would ban a sale ban the sale to
persons who are uh under 21 uh limit so
that sales are not made within 500 ft of
schools clarify that certain hemp
products are illegal provide details for
retail wholesale and manufacturer of
consumable hemp products uh proide
provide a certificate of analysis for a
sticker label placed on consumable hemp
products and provide random testing Mr
Speaker I know that the hour is late but
this bill has been very carefully vetted
with the Department of Agriculture it's
going to provide important consumer
protections to address products that are
already out there right now and keep
Georgian safe it's a needed bill bill in
our current times and due to the
inaction of the Senate on the conference
committee report I'd ask for your
favorable consideration I'm happy to
answer maybe one or two
questions gentleman has no questions I
yield the
well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair hears none the previous question
is ordered is there any objection to
redrawing the committee substitute chair

recommended a a person who was eligible
for one of the diseases for medical
cannibis then they went to the local
health or went to the Department of
Public Health to get a card well the
problem was the Department of Public

to do with mental health claims and

keep sending my children to the Senate
to have them just do unspeakable things
to them um but the they took they took
our house Bill
1409 and they added section 2A into it
which is sort of a uh a provision that
was being discussed in the co uh
discussions and I know many of you have
been getting texts and Communications
from constituents and from your local
hospitals uh objecting very strenuously
to 2A so what the house Amendment would
do is
delete section 2A um as I remember from
the Marty Robin song El Paso shock by
the foul evil deed I had done we're
removing the foul Evil Deed from 1409
and and making it sending it back in the

act to amend title 42 the official code
of George anator relating to penal
institution so as to require the
commissioner of Correction to report
certain information regarding the
immigration status offenses in home
countries of persons who are confined
under the authority of Department of
Corrections chair recognizes chairman
Petri to explain his motion thank you Mr
Speaker um uh this is House Bill 11:05
we passed a few weeks ago this is the
Georgia Criminal Alien track and Report
Act of
2024 uh as most of you remember we uh
this bill simply ensures that when
individual uals have committed crimes in
Georgia and are uh jailed and in custody
that uh when we determine they are
illegally in this country that we fully
work with Federal immigration
authorities in informing them of their
presence and in honoring any ice
detainers I will speak to the changes
made in the Senate and they are as
follows uh the bill now uh penalizes
local government leaders who support
Sanctuary policies and violation of that
prohibition um with a misdemeanor that
you'll see in section six it requires
the department of audits to review
immigration compliance reports that are
submitted by local governments and
Sheriff's offices most of you will be
surprised to know that we haven't been
doing that they are voluntary compliance
reports that are required today nobody's
auditing them we're going to change that
in this measure now with the Senate
version Senate version requires the
department of corrections to post on its
website ACC quarterly report of
aggregate data on the number of ice
detainers in our state prison uh which
would be consistent to the report that
local jails will now be doing on the
version you passed a couple of weeks ago
um the Senate version requires that DNA
shall be collected from convicted felons
in the Georgia Department of Corrections
who are subject to immigration detainers
that was an amendment in the Senate and
the bill finally uh implores the State
Board of Pardons and parols to not
release relase any illegal alien from
confinement prior to the completion of
their senates unless they are assured
that Federal immigration authorities uh
will uh Deport such alien upon release
uh those are the uh changes made Mr
Speaker and I'm glad to accept a
question if you if you if there are some
there are a
couple I'll accept one Mr Speaker whip
park right in front of you has a
question whip Park's recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker um
representative Petri I I know that you
very much care about this issue yes sir
but is it not true that this bill uh
that a lot of concerns have been raised
by law enforcement uh that this bill
will undermine their ability to keep
their Community safe by requiring them
to essentially act as if they were uh
immigration law enforcement officers and
is it not further true that again uh
there's a lot of concern in the
community that uh this bill will
potentially tear apart families and
cause a lot more harm uh than uh it may
be intended is that not true uh no sir
that is not true I appreciate your your
position and I respect it very much and
I appreciate the question I disagree
with that fully so uh as it relates to
law enforcement this bill is endorsed
and supported by the sheriff's
Association in the interest of Public
Safety I'm glad you reminded me of that
I needed to say that um what we are
asking law enforcement to do is with
that small subset of people people who
have committed crimes in our community
and are already in the country illegally
and I would remind you that entering the
country illegally is a civil and
criminal laws have been broken by virtue
of people illegally being the country
they subsequently uh commit a crime in
our
communities working with ice which is
what ice wants us to do uh I don't think
anyone in law enforcement believes that
is uh too much to ask but thank you for
the good question sir were you for one
more uh one more sir is are there U
Provisions still in this version of the
bill that would withhold State funds
from law enforcement offices that do not
comply if any local body so a a a county
who uh has a separate Jail from a
sheriff a municipality or a sheriff so
we're talking about jails we're talking
about individuals in custody that refuse
to follow current law that's been on the
books for 18 years by the way I have to
remind you that since we didn't discuss
that today but from the previous
discussion current law for 18 years if
they refuse to honor that law that is
correct they they risk losing State and
State administered Federal funding that
is correct sir thank you for your
questions thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the well the gentleman has yielded the
well on the gentleman's motion that the
house agreed to the Senate substitute
the house bill 1105 all those in favor
will vote Yes those opposed we vote no

bill
1105 chair recognizes represent Daniel

409 Mr clerk will you read the caption
house will 409 to be entitled act to
amend chapter 80 tile 36 of the official
code of George an relating to General
Provisions applicable counties Municipal
corporations and other governmental
entities representative Daniel is
recognized to
explain the amendment
thank you Mr Speaker I'll make this
brief the hour is late this bill is not
what it originally was the language in
this bill is actually the language from
House Bill
1284 I stripped my own bill because I
thought it was that important on the
other side and some friends um if you
remember at the beginning of session my
colleagues and I got up here and we
recognized the death of an 8-year-old
little girl in our community and what
this bill does is it strengthens the
penalty for people who pass stop school
buses um the Senate did also make an
amendment to clean up some Charter
School language and I ask that this
house agree and her family is up here as
well this
evening I'll take any questions if you
got
them represenative Parsons to your left
chairman Parsons is recognized for a
question thank you speaker lady yield I
do well isn't it true that in principle
I agree with much of this actually I
authored the original bill that allowed
for uh third parties to put the uh um
cameras on school by stop arms and have
a several penalty for that but are you
uh line 70 through 73 are you really
comfortable with increasing that fine
and that penalty that much I am so this
was something that was discussed pretty
heavily in committee
and my answer is although we are
increasing this fine the biggest issue
that we have is the behavior from the
driver it's not the school bus's fault
it's not any other issue other than
people are just continuously doing this
um there's actually a nationwide study
that is done every year and in a single
day over 95,000 instances take place um
and so it is
something to to give you a short answer
I actually had it higher than that
originally um because the state of
Indiana has it set at $10,000 and so
this was the the lower lower cost all
right do you further yield I do I
believe 737 70 through 73 actually is
not does not refer to the Civil part
this actually has to do with if a uh
police officer or if the bus driver
actually reports that and of course a
bus driver one of the reasons we I even
uh initiated the bill for the third
party to to pay for the uh camera on the
stop arm is because the bus driver
really is too busy driving the driving
the bus and protecting the children to
really catch these things because he has
to write it down on a form turn it into
La law enforcement with a a a license
number uh different uh different
information about the vehicle many of
those would get away in places where
they don't have the stop arm camera that
takes care of it so many of these are
going to be are not going to be
addressed anyway and for that to be
increased to $1,000 or by confinement
for not more than 10 12 months or both
that seems very very extreme does it not
so that's actually so the way that when
I discuss it with ledge council is that
that particular part is not for the
camera that is for an actual that is
correct yes that is if a cop sees them
do it and do you further yield I'm sorry
but I do and on line 79 this does refer
to the Civil increasing that penalty
from $250 to $1,000 yes well isn't it
true that let's put Let's uh give her
the question let's answer it and let's
move on okay well I just would just say
is it not true that there's going to be
a lot of people who are going to be very
unhappy if we pass this bill and it goes
to the goes to the governor because
these are tremendous increases in this
and a lot of people have a problem with
it anyway I've had to defend this thing
for the last seven or eight years that I
even did it but to have these penalties
increased this much is going to cause a
lot of problems and a lot of people be
very unhappy with this with this
legislation is it not true I will reject
that premise a little bit because I do
believe that it is a preventable
Behavior if people continue to choose to
pass a stop School Bus knowing it is
against the law they should be penalized
accordingly and believe that this piece
of legislation does just that thank you
Mr Speaker i y the well if there are no
other questions on the lady's motion
that the house agree to the amendment to
house bill to the agree to the Senate
substitute as amended by the
[Music]
house oh we are on the L's motion the

Bill 409 all those in favor will vote

for what purpose is representing Kenard
rise parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
isn't it true Mr Speaker that if someone
an employee or a volunteer is driving a
vehicle for a nonprofit or a business
that the ticket would actually go to the
business or the nonprofit and not to the
driver I'm sure the gentleman probably
read pretty carefully on that bill for
what purpose does representative
Alexander
rise she
WS for what purpos is representing
Daniel
rise Mr Speaker isn't it true that in
committee we discussed whether or not it
would apply to businesses and the answer
was actually that there is a court
process already in place where you can
go and appeal this
finding I'm sure the lady recalls of
that discussion in committee can I ask
one more question Mr Speaker if it's a
parliamentary inquiry I'll let you
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true that while $1,000 is a
fine that is obviously going to make
people full
upset um it is much cheaper than having
to pay for a child's funeral or the
counseling that these families have to
pay when they lose their
children I'm sure the lady has worked
diligently on the bill and she
understands all the propositions of the
bill and the members are um certainly
very diligently considered every
proposition of the
bill
for what purposes representing Saints
rise parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry is it not true that this measure
helps protect the the uh youth of
Georgia and ensuring that we have proper
and appropriate penalties to to p uh
prosecute those who uh impact their
safety I'm sure the gentleman believes
in what he just
stated I'm getting ready

of the official Cod of Georgia annotator
relating to education food drugs and
cosmetics health insurance professions
and businesses this bill I referred the
committee on Judiciary non- civil that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by rules committee
substitute chair recognizes chairman
Tyler Paul Smith to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen this all gust bu I bring to
you Senate Bill 157 I want to thank the
majority leader and chairman Strickland
across the hall we've really worked on
this bill for over the past year and a
half or so and so this bill would move
us to position of where those who are
applying for jobs after they have paid
their debt to society would be able to
have that record
clean these boards currently look at
your records that go back for many many
years and so this would limit review to
5 years after a MISD aminor conviction
and 5 years after that incarceration for
a misdemeanor conviction this 5-year
limit exempts uh the most serious
misdemeanors and felonies as well as
felonies that are commonly very re re re
relevant to licens and decisions such as
fraud or embezzlement the 5-year look
back period is also based on what we
know about recidivism data shows that
most recidivism happens within 3 years
of an arrest and almost all recidivism
happens within 5 years of an arrest
lending on this data can help boards
enhance the efficiency of their record
reviews this why States like Arkansas
Oklahoma and Indiana limit consideration
of most offenses to those that occurred
within the past 5 years by leaning on
what we know about that recidivism we
can help boards spend more time on the
fenses that truly matter Mr Speaker the
changes that we made here along with
what the majority leaders uh good
Insight was that we make sure that those
who are applying for jobs within Finance
those records and convictions can be
looked into to make sure that
individuals who have not been
rehabilitated do not enter into these
institutions and have a more likelihood
or substantial chance of recommitting Mr
Speaker that in is in essence the bill
and I'll stand for any questions
chairman Knight has a question to your
right yes sir chairman David nice
recognized thank you uh Mr Speaker does
my friend you yes sir to my friend
um to my friend I I I've I've got some
hesitation on here because I I'm trying
to understand some of the the the
shifting change in in what we
historically have have have looked at as
far as license and our license process
isn't it true that that license process
is to make sure that we are protecting
the
consumer uh the folks who are using the
professions or the
the you know the areas of of work here
yes sir is that true yes sir that that
would be true and I I would say that
those involving moral turpitude could
still be considered under this
legislation and and for inquiry um I I
guess I'm I'm curious as to some of the
language in here as far as
um you know data that is collected and
turned in um uh as far as uh looking
online 376 through 380 mhm I'm not sure
what what is the relevance of of that
where ethnic and
racial uh distribution of life and
applications how is that
related to the fiduciary responsibility
of these boards to the consumer to the
Georgia public yes sir I think within
this look back period uh within this
license and application they can see uh
usually uh if my f friend the gentleman
from down south would recall your
likelihood to recommit is within 18 to
25 or 24 months is what the most recent
data would show and so uh We've we've
hammered this over the years and So
within that 5year time period of the
license and application you would see
that the likelihood of recommitting
would occur within that first 18 to 24
months final inquiry sir my friend and
again this is rhetorical I have I have
some reservations here but um as a
learned you know as a licensed
professional your I know up under the
bar give the gentleman your attention
please for he has a question which acts
his own you know it's licensed for for
for
attorneys would this would
this type of
legislation would it fit up under the
licensing process and the State Bar as
far as its standards and its ethics of
how it looks at its attorneys yes sir I
I'll note that this legislation still
preserves the authority of the boards to
evaluate when a conviction is relevant
to that profession and whether that
applicant has been sufficiently
rehabilitated to overcome a related
conviction uh I I'll just leave this to
my friend uh uh here in the end notably
the most serious offenses will still be
able to be considered by those boards
regardless of how old they are uh you're
looking at uh potentially seven deadly
serious grade felonies would still be
considered thank you sir
gentleman yield for another question
I'll yield for one last Mr Speaker I
know the hour is late and there's okay
uh representative ntz to your left has a
question does gentleman yield to my
friend from maretta
yes thank you is it not true that part
10 addresses dry
needling that is my understanding does
gentleman further yield I do is it not
further true that after 40 days of
sitting in these historically accurate
yet ergonomically terrible chairs I will
need to go have my hips dry needled in
order to be able to walk properly uh I
couldn't speak to that but I'll probably
have to go uh have some of that
performed
myself thank you thank you Mr Speaker

code of Georgia anit relating to zoning
procedures as pertaining to counties and
Municipal
corporations representative Reeves is
recognized to explain his motion thank
you Mr speakers house colleagues I
present to you house bill 9005 as
amended by the Senate uh sections two
through the end of the bill Section 8
are largely intact from what we
overwhelmingly passed by the house it is
an amendment to the zoning procedures
law that clarifies that U permits and
administrative type permits are not
required to go through the zoning
process that is a choice of the local
government officials it's not a
requirement that'll help building uh go
uh smoothly and that's something we
passed overwhelmingly and I'd like to
acknowledge the great work of
Representative Roberts over two years to
get that achieved during the Senate uh
several weeks ago at the committee level
in the uh state and local government
committee uh Senator G committee uh the
president protm of the Senate requested
section one to be added to the bill uh
this is a very narrow Amendment to the
annexation procedures under Georgia law
which would in very limited
circumstances allow a property that is
10 acres or smaller to move from one
city to another city not to a County uh
but to another city it gives due process
to the city that would uh be proposed to
lose the property to file a challenge
under georg's uh annexation challenge
law it gives a narrow window of 2016 and
17 as the formation of the new city and
the property must be commercial not uh
residential so those are very limited
circumstances I would point to lines 27
through 30 of the bill that was language
that the attorney for one of the cities
that would be affected got added to the
bill to uh provide some due process and
uh the ability to be heard on issues of
bonding um again it's very narrow and it
is something requested at high levels
from the Senate that was done through
the open process over the last uh two to
three weeks uh not not over the last few
days so I commend this to you I
respectfully request your agreement to
this Senate substitute on this good bill
that will help building permits and it
has this very narrow amendment to
Georgia annexation law uh and Mr Speaker
I yield the well you have one question
I'd like for you to take if you don't
mind thank you Mr Speaker representative
Bruce has a question in the back thank
you there's a gentleman y I do I do I
really need y'all to listen to this
please is it not true that the amendment
that you're talking about was will only
impact the city of South Fulton and it
came about as a result of a
developer that did not get his
way and came and talked to one of his
friends in the Senate and asked us to
allow a city to take land from another
city because they did not get the zoning
that they
wanted is that true representative Bruce
I I believe there are two sides to that
story but there are four cities that are
affected as best we could tell South
Fulton Union City Stone Crest and
Lithonia it's very narrow also the bill
sunsets in
2027 and and that's it is it not true
that that what you just described is the
same developer that is trying to take
land because he did not get the zoning
that he wanted that's the bottom line
what we're doing is we're Crea I I
really need y'all to keep quiet for a
minute please gentleman ask your
question and then we're going to let the
gentleman
answer is it again is it not true that
the developer did not get his way and as
a result of that we're asking this body
to take sides and allow a city to take
land from another city without the city
having a say in wanting to do that
that is that's the question
representative Bruce I would draw your
attention to page two of the bill zoning
uh bonding many issues can be considered
by both cities in an arbitration
proceeding under Georgia law by the
Department of Community Affairs if there
is an objection and the city that would
propose to lose the property would be
able to present its case and would win
by the preponderance of the evidence if
there is zoning or other issues that are
at stake it gives a full and fair
opportunity to be heard it gives due
process thank you Mr Speaker I yield the
