TRANSCRIPT
----------
For your patients, we had to get some things printed for you and the clerk's office printed
them as quickly as they could but it just took a little while so thank you for your
patients and your understanding.
You're going to be passed out three substitutes for your consideration and we'll go ahead
and get started on this.
First of all, House Bill 397, Rule Substitute, LC 473558S, and Chairman Anderson is going
to explain that to us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the committee for accommodating us here.
House Bill 397 passed out of committee as a combination of three separate bills, trying
to address some issues that we felt were necessary to be addressed before the 26 election.
There are some components of a couple of those provisions or a couple of those sections
in the original bill that pass out a committee that are controversial.
So what we're trying to do at this point is to find a consensus bill that we can get
to the Senate.
So the author and I and leadership can continue working with the Senate Ethics Committee
and their chairman to make sure that we address the concerns and issues that need to be addressed
before the 26th election and are not put in a pinch and a bind next year trying to push things through.
Okay, you've heard the explanation, any questions?
Okay, don't you need?
I have a motion and a second House Bill 397 Rule Substitute, LC 473558S do pass.
Is there any objections?
Okay, it's passed. Okay next House Bill 529 Rule Substitute
LC-55-05-89S and
Leader registration is going to explain that to us
I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
So what we have here is just a cleanup measure for representative Barrett's bill
with respect to the changes, I'll draw your attention to line 62, 63 of the
substitute. There previously had been additional language there related to the
nature of the automatic renewal. This just makes clear it's for a period of one
year on the following page. There's some additional cleanup language just to
ensure that this legislation meets with the authors intent which is to address
circumstances of automatic renewal of subscriptions where there's not
disclosure to or opportunity for the consumer to opt out and this chairman
rules committee I'd ask for the favorable consideration of the
expert.
