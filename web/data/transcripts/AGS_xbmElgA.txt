I couldn't get my mic working right now.
We still haven't, still haven't problems up here.
It is now time for the morning devotion.
All senators, please take your seats and
cease all conversation.
I would ask that the doorkeeper secure the chamber at this time.
I'd recognize the newly elected pro-team from the 20th to introduce our pastor of the day and leave us in our pledges of leases.
Senator?
Well, good morning. Happy legislative day too.
Please join me in the pledge to our nation's flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
And now our state's flag.
This is a Georgia flag to the principals for which it stands, wisdom, justice, moderation, and courage.
Well, this is indeed a pleasure today.
I have the pastor of the day that is Reverend Tom Caruth.
He is the pastor at Perry United Methodist Church, where I've attended since I was a child.
And he not only is my pastor, but he is a very good friend of mine.
Reverend Caruth is, he's the senior pastor of Perry Methodist Church.
He's a native of Dublin, Georgia.
He's a graduate of Dublin High School, Duke University, and
Emory University's Candler School of Theology.
Before entering seminary, he served as youth minister and
pastor churches across Georgia, including Alpha Methodist and
Bloomingdale, and Byron Methodist before coming to Perry
Methodist Church in 2021.
Tom is married to his wife, Shelly.
She's originally from Duluth.
We have four children that attend the Westville School,
Holland, a junior, Olivia, a freshman,
Presley, a sixth grader who is serving as a page today for us,
and Dax who is in pre-K.
Presley's best friend, Shiloh, also from Perry,
is serving as a page today with her.
Tom's hobbies include preaching sermons
that probably should have been five minutes shorter,
He says, playing rock music with friends, including my brothers and my sons and eating the
best pizza in his life at Ghost Runner's Pizza, who is the proprietors there or my two
sons Wade and Cody.
Tom is just an outstanding guy, he's very inspirational.
His sermons, and his friendship, and his ministry really mean a lot to the Walker family
and I'm just proud to have him here with us today.
Thank you, Tom.
Good morning, Mr. President, Mr. President Pro Tem, you know, Senator Larry Walker has
has never been President Pro Tem until I became his pastor.
I don't know if there's a correlation there, and I don't think there is, but it is of note.
I'm so honored to be here, I'm nervous, but tomorrow I have to guess lecture for my
daughter's ninth grade class about religion at her school.
I'm way more nervous about tomorrow.
So I'm actually glad to be a little less nervous today.
It's only day two, which means a few things are true.
I would expect for y'all.
Some of you, especially, I think there's a couple of servants
for the first time.
You might feel a little bit like I do,
going, I can't believe I'm here.
You know, I already took a selfie a minute ago,
just to kind of prove it was real.
You've probably taken a picture of your name on your desk
and texted it to some friends or family saying,
I can't believe this is real.
Maybe others, if you remember that time.
For others of you, it's not your first rodeo, right?
You know where to park.
You know which meetings really start on time
and which ones aspire to.
You already have a strong opinion about the coffee.
You know that by day two, the excitement is gonna start
to wear off and it's gonna give way to something called work.
Scripture, it turns out, has something to say to both the first
timers and the old hats.
In the letter of James, it says, if any of you lacks wisdom,
you should ask God, who gives generously to all without
finding fault.
That's a great promise.
If you lack wisdom, ask God who gives generously to all, no fault, like no problem.
He doesn't say if you lack intelligence, he doesn't say if you lack experience.
He definitely doesn't say if you lack confidence.
James says if you lack wisdom, because wisdom is different.
is what helps those who are new hold on to the all of this moment without being overwhelmed
by it. And wisdom is what helps those who have been here a while keep this work from
becoming old hat. Familiarity is a gift. I have been here one time before several years
ago at the invitation of Senator Walker. I was glad I knew where the parking place was
today because there was so much traffic and I came in on two wheels. I was grateful for
that familiarity, but as you may know, the phrase is familiarity breeds unfamiliarity
and unfamiliarity breeds contempt. What once felt weighty, weighty can begin to feel
routine, what once felt sacred, can feel procedural.
So wisdom is what restores gravity to work we've done many times before.
Recently I heard someone say, you know, speaking about American government, and I know we're all
grateful for our country and for grateful for the principles of our state, said, you know,
It's not Congress or the Senate or the courts that keep democracy functioning the way it
should be.
It's not the Senate, it's not the House, it's not the courts, it's senators, it's representatives,
it's members of the court, it's judges operating with integrity, acting from principle, acting
from character. That really spoke to me. It's not the system. It's not the rules. It's you.
You called to this moment. People showing up. People exercising restraint. People choosing
justice over convenience. People working together, even when agreement is hard. Every one of you,
regardless of party or tenure or title, brings something irreplaceable to this room today.
And every day, your conscience, your moral compass, your willingness to listen, your ability to say,
I might be wrong. One time I preached a sermon and somebody came up to me afterwards and said,
Pastor, I would agree with you, but then we'd both be wrong. That's good, isn't it?
Do we have the ability to say, hey, I might be wrong, or hey, let's slow this down.
Or we can do better.
That's why James' invitation means so much.
Wisdom is not certainty, it's not having all the answers.
Wisdom often begins by the weight of a decision saying, I need help with this.
I was in seminary at Candler, living in Atlanta.
I happened to be in recovery from alcoholism myself.
I wasn't supposed to be here, you know what I'm saying?
I can't believe my life is the way it is today.
So I'm a member of a 12-step fellowship, which we don't talk about.
It chooses to remain anonymous.
But I was meeting at Atlanta Diner right up the road with my AA sponsor.
And we were working the 12 steps and I had several years of recovery and I'm in seminary but I was frustrated because I had a problem and I felt like it's either going to be this or it's going to be this and I don't like what am I going to do?
I'm rocking a hard place, I don't like either of these choices and he said, Tom, you know you got what you call a suckers choice.
I said, what's that?
And he says, well, anytime that you think it's got to be A or it's got to be B and both
and you don't like either one, that's a sucker's choice because both choices suck.
Forgive me for saying that in the chamber.
He said, anytime that you run up against a sucker's choice, he said, I believe that
God's will is almost always something other than I have already thought of.
It's usually not A or B. It's usually like P or L. Wisdom is saying, wait a second.
Maybe it's not A or B. Wait. Let's ask God. Let's ask wisdom. Let's ask spirit.
it. Let's listen for something speaking to the deeper things. Today, early in the
session, I pray that first day excitement would not fade into cynicism, that long
experience would never harden into indifference. Come on, right? Let's believe in
something. May wisdom guide not just what you decide, but how you decide, how you
speak, how you listen, how you treat one another, because long after laws are passed, it's
the character of the people in this room that will be remembered as what kept things moving
in a good and orderly direction. Amen? Would you pray with me? Oh yeah, we'll stand up.
I got to do a funeral this week at Perry Methodist Church where I served and I was honored
to get to meet again Senator Sam Nunn.
We were having the funeral for his former law partner,
Jim Geiger.
And afterwards, someone said, people come up to me
and say, wow, it was Sam's cousin, George.
People come up to me and said, man,
we need more people like that.
I'm so proud of him.
He stands on principle.
and George said that he would reply.
Well, that's great and all,
but you shouldn't stand out.
That shouldn't be remarkable
that a senator would be that way.
Shouldn't we all be that way?
Amen?
Gracious God, give wisdom to each person in this chamber.
Wisdom equal to the weight of their responsibility.
wisdom to seek justice, to practice restraint,
to work together with humility and respect,
guard their consciences, strengthen their character,
and remind them that their decisions matter deeply
to real people across this state.
May their service be guided by what is right
and not merely by what is easy.
Amen.

Why is this numbers in here?
Mr. President, I rise to ask for unanimous consent to excuse a senator from the 26th.
Without objection, Senator from the 26th is its queues.
Thank you.

You
If I can have everyone's attention, please, we have a very, very special resolution that
we would like to present, and to any of you who may or may not appreciate your admin,
y'all to be in here to show your appreciation, because we're about to recognize the best of
the best right here.
So, Secretary, read the resolution.
Senate resolution 561 by Senators Brass of the Sixth and
Others, a resolution recognizing and
commending cartrelia Denise Samson on her outstanding service as a legislative assistant,
serving many senators over the years with the Georgia Senate and now as a director of
constituent services with the office of the lieutenant governor and for other purposes.
Whereas since 1996, Cartrelia Denise Samson,
fondly known as Denise, by all those who know and love her,
has served in the Senate as a legislative assistant.
Whereas since January 2023,
she has been the director of constituent services
for the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, and whereas,
she has diligently and conscientiously devoted
innumerable hours of her time,
talents and energy toward the betterment of her community and state
as evidenced dramatically by her 30 years of superlative service
as a legislative assistant.
And, whereas Denise has served with honors and distinction
with the Georgia Senate and her vision
and unyielding commitment to the state of Georgia
have set the standard for public service.
And now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate
that the members of this body recognize
and commend the cartrelia, Denise Samson,
for her her efficient, effective, unselfish,
and dedicated public service to the state of Georgia
and extend the most sincere best,
which is for her continued health and happiness.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
His objection to the adoption of resolution chair here is done.
The resolution is adopted.
Before I introduce my old roommate, he also had the opportunity to have Denise as his
admin.
I wanted to say a few words, Denise Samson has been by my side ever since I got elected
back in 2013, which is now in our 14th year and I will tell you, she is the absolute
best. I knew she was good because when I first got here I had my sweet mate was a guy named Jason
Carter and I knew Jason was going to have the best of the best and so when he left and ran for
governor I told Denise I was like I want to keep I want you to stay with me and she said well they've
all for been more money to go with the other party and I said I don't care what they offer I'll
match it, you know, but at any rate, Denise is always in a great mood. Those of you who know her well
know that she's never had a bad day. She is a very good at what she's does. She's very
professional at what she's does. And any time, any and every year, we always have that matter. The
new admins get hired or the interns that come and work for us for a season. They always find their
their way to Denise's office because they feel they feel wanted, they feel loved, and
they feel appreciated, and she absolutely is the example that I give everyone of what
we need to strive through as far as administrative service individuals.
So I love her like family.
I know Senator from the six feels the same way I do.
And every senator who has had the opportunity to have her before we were fortunate to have
her obviously feels that way too, 30 years is a long time in this body.
She doesn't look like she looks 30 now, but so it's amazing that she still looks as young
as she does having been around having to deal with a bunch of senators all the time.
But she's a wonderful, wonderful lady, and I'm glad we could recognize her today, but
And I'll recognize the actual person who brought the resolution senator from the six.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It does give me a great honor to honor our friend and I'll call her family member Denise
Samson.
And there's one part of the resolution I do want to highlight and it says Denise is significant
organizational and leadership talents, remarkable patients,
and diplomacy, keen sense of vision,
and sensitivity to the needs of the citizens of this state.
And I just finished up my freshman session.
This was back in 2017, and my admin was leaving.
She had actually gone, got a great job,
and with a great company, and was leaving.
And I say that to say she wasn't leaving
because I served me for a year,
but at least that's what I tell myself.
But I got a call from our lieutenant governor
who was losing his suite mate over there at CLOB
and he asked me to come join him.
And I was a little hesitant at first
because I was thinking, all right, here I've known this guy
since college, you know, I don't know if being up here being with a friend, we might get
in a little trouble. This may not be a good idea, but then when I looked and I knew his
admin was the best of the best. And really Denise was the real reason that I joined
no offense there, Mr. President, but she was the real reason that I wanted to be a part
that office and and I was right my instincts were right we did go on and and get in a little trouble
together but but Denise stood by our side through thick and thin she always had we truly became a
family in that office even got to play chess with her her grandson I think he beat me in less than a
minute and a half and it would have been shorter had a not delayed some of my moves but she's just
been a dear friend and just someone that really I look up to I know the the
President of the Senate looks up to her as well because she's she just truly
cares about people she cares about helping citizens of Georgia she cares about
helping us and I think about like Nick Sabin and his his coaching tree and you
see that you see the people that that were under his tutelage and they've gone
on to do great things, and you look at the interns that Denise has trained, and you look
at her tree, and you look at where they are in this state, and there's just great people
doing great things that learned under such a great person in Denise.
So, without further ado, Denise, thank you so much for all you've done for us as individuals.
you for all you've done for the citizens of this great state over three decades of service.
So Denise, I know you're very short of words, but I'd love for you to address the Senate.
all right thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you all so much thank
Thank you, Tina Gov. Oh, I was so young when I started here. Thank you all so, so very
much for this recognition. I should not be nervous, but I am quite nervous, but this
is my family. Lieutenant Gov. I have, we did have a fun office. We stayed in the office
for 10, four years in the office.
So thank you, Lieutenant Governor, for this great recognition.
Thank you for this amazing team that we have.
I feel like I have team members, colleagues that are not just colleagues,
but they are real friends.
And we have a great synergy together.
But I appreciate it so much.
I feel like it is a blessing and it is an honor for me
to call the Senate, my family.
This is my home.
I guess that's why I stayed for 30 years.
But it's been a magnificent ride as it continues
to be a magnificent ride.
So thank you all so very much.
It means a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
just to make it clear that wasn't a retirement speech because she I told her she's got four more years with me so just at least.

It is always nice to have our doctors of the day and recognize them for their hard work
and their time that they volunteer for us.
And once again, I'll recognize Senator from the 6th and introduce our doctor of the day.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It gives me great honor to introduce Dr. Tess Faye Talila.
He's a U.S.-based interventional cardiologist.
He's actually based right in Noon in Georgia at Piedmont, Noon in serving with my sister
and my wife.
He comes from Ethiopia.
He was born and raised in humble circumstances on the outskirts of Ethiopia.
Dr. Talila developed an early commitment to service
and a clear calling to medicine.
Guided by this purpose, he pursued medical education
at the University of Ethiopia graduating in 2008
as class valedictorian.
He's been an assistant professor of medicine
at Addis Adaba, Ababa University,
before relocating to the United States in 2010
to pursue advanced training in cardiology.
Over 14 years of medical training,
Dr. T'Lila earned multiple honors,
including best resident teacher of the year,
and excellence in teaching award.
Dr. T'Lila holds board certifications
in internal medicine, cardiovascular disease,
interventional cardiology, nuclear cardiology,
and adult echocardiography.
He's committed to service beyond traditional practice.
He has volunteered for the past five years
at the Healing Bridge Clinic in Georgia,
providing free cardiovascular care
to uninsured and underserved populations.
And despite his professional success
in the United States, Dr. Tileva
has profoundly affected by the disparity
in the cardiovascular outcomes
between high and low resource settings
And where led him and his wife to found the heart attack
Ethiopia, which is a, together they lead this mission
to build sustainable and comprehensive
cardiovascular care in Ethiopia, which
I've had the pleasure of working with him a little bit
on helping get his supplies and people over to Ethiopia.
To date, these efforts have resulted in over 400 life-saving
cardiac procedures, transforming access to care, and strengthening local capacity.
He's a devoted husband and father of four young children, and he balances family, clinical
excellence, and global service with a deep sense of purpose.
With that, I give our doctor of the day to you, Dr. Tallila.
A great man.
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Senate.
Thank you for welcoming me today.
It's truly an honor to be invited, to be the doctor of the day for the 2026 Georgia legislative sessions.
I stand before you today not only as a successful
interventional cardiologist in Georgia,
who has over hundreds of meaningful encounters
with patients when they have heart attacks,
including one from this morning at 2 a.m.
But also someone who is deeply dedicated
to improving access to cardiovascular services
for the people of Ethiopia and bigger Africa.
What we do in medicine with service,
access and compassion has an impact
that transcends far beyond any local community
or any country.
I stand before you as someone who is born and raised
in Ethiopia, in rural Ethiopia, with poor access to electricity and running water.
And after I moved here, I successfully managed to train as an interventional cardiologist.
And this dream was made possible because of the service that you provide.
Thank you so much on behalf of the people of Georgia, the physicians in Georgia, and
community that we support in Ethiopia. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your service
and I wish you a productive legislative session. Thank you.
We recognize the minority leader for
much.
And let's consent to remove my name as primary author of SB 204 and
pursuant to a prior agreement, Senator from the 53rd will become the primary author.

Senate bill 204 by Senator Jones of the 22nd
Senator more of the 53rd
A bill to be entitled an act to amend code section 1777 of the official code of Georgia annotated
We're laying to trial upon accusations in certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea of guilty or no low contenderay.
And for other purposes.
Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate No 2.
Mr. President, the House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 204.
A bill to be entitled to amend Title 16 and 17 of official code of Georgia annotated.
We're laying to crimes and offenses and criminal procedure respectively.
Thanks to us to provide certain criminal provisions relating to the authorization of certain public officers and public entities to provide standards for bringing an action against the government for an unauthorized act relating to regulation of weapons to provide for definitions to allow for offenses that are not serious violent felonies sexual felonies or there's certain offenses and for other purposes and that please you are Mr. President.
Senator from the 53rd, speak to the motion.
Presentatives that there are a lot of deceivers over there.
And they have deceived a great piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that this Senate passed out,
Senate Bill 163, which was the most pro-gun piece of legislation that I've
seen passed out since I've been a member of the Senate. And I'll remind you of
that piece of legislation. It makes all Georgians, regardless of whether you're
from a rural area like my home county of Dave County or whether you're from
DeCab County, you can travel the state freely knowing that you're not going to
be a victim of a crime and then be made a criminal as we've seen in Savannah,
Georgia. So what did the House do? They took a great piece of legislation from the Senate
and they gutted it and then they gutted a Democrats bill and they put my legislation
in with Senate Bill 204. But luckily the minority leader and I have agreed to switch over
who is the primary author so the Democrats don't have to take responsibility for this great
piece of program legislation that is now Senate Bill 204.
Now let me remind you again what this piece of legislation does.
Right now there are 41 Georgians in Savannah who are victims of a crime who are now been
made criminals because some municipality like Savannah has passed gun legislation that
It is more stringent than what this General Assembly has already passed.
You see, we are the Supreme Law-Making Authority in this state, not some liberal municipality.
We already understand that we have preemptive powers as a legislature, and what this legislation
does is it gives those preemptive powers to the citizenry.
So any citizen can sue a place like Savannah for violating their gun rights at a tune
of $25,000 per occurrence.
That puts teeth into it and they don't have to depend on some bureaucracy like our attorney
general to take care of their rights.
We're putting freedom back into the hands of the citizenry.
I ask for your favorable consideration on this legislation and it will be the most pro-gun
a piece of legislation that this Senate has passed since I've been here.
Thank you, Mr. President, I'll yield the well.
Senator Hesild, Senator from 14th for Purpose E-Ryze, Parliamentary Agreement Mr. President,
stage your inquiry.
I don't know, this just seems like kind of an exhausting conversation.
I know we have a lot of afternoon plans.
Is there any reason that the chair is aware of why we couldn't do this tomorrow?
Senator is very inquisitive and we appreciate all your feedback to your senator.
Bring it on, Senator, from the second.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
I didn't intend to be in the well this early
in this legislative session.
But I want to be clear about a couple of things.
The City of Savannah supports the Second Amendment.
I support the Second Amendment as a gun order.
I want to be clear about what the ordinance does
what it does not do. This ordinance that the City of Savannah has passed regulates the car
and not the gun, and this has reduced gun thefts of over 30% in one year in the City of Savannah
alone. The City of Awhelmingly supports the Second Amendment, but they also believe that
public safety is at risk when guns are stolen from unlocked cars. And if someone is going to
carry their firearm with them and they're going to use it for protection, a gun in your car
cannot protect you from someone breaking into your house and so if they're
breaking into your home and you got to then get out of your house to get to your
car to then get said firearm to protect yourself then you've already lost and
so it is important that we understand the impact of this ordinance again it
is not regulating the gun is not regulating the gun owner is regulating the
car saying that you cannot leave an unlock loaded firearm in a vehicle the
same way, you would not want a police officer to leave their police unit,
unlock with firearms in the car.
The same way we would like gun orders to be responsible,
to not leave them in their vehicles unlocked as well,
so that they could fall into the wrong hands very easy.
And you don't know when someone is going to become a criminal,
not until they become a criminal, until they cross that line.
There is no predetermination of who's going to do what.
So with that, I would ask for my colleagues to vote known this legislation.
And let's take it about the right way and do it in the right way.
With that, Mr. President, I yield the well.
