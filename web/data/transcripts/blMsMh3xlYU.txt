TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well, good morning everybody. Thank you for being here. What a great day it is to be at the Capitol beautiful weather and an opportunity for us to honor some hard-working Georgians that take care of us in our most sincere times of need.
First Lieutenant Governor, thank you for being here, sir. Appreciate you.
Mr. Commissioner.
Prime Minister, thank you for being here.
I was trying to remember your title,
the multiple you've had with all your service.
So thank you for that and the senators
and our legislators that are here.
Friends, today we're coming together to not just acknowledge
but deeply honor the quiet heroes among us,
the ones who work tirelessly,
often at great personal risk to ensure
that our way of life remains uninterrupted.
Georgia's linemen are the backbone of our energy infrastructure,
their braving storms, flooding, dangerous temperatures,
and long nights to ensure that our homes are lit
and that we stay safe and warm,
and that our businesses stay open here in Georgia
and our families remain safe.
They really are the steady hands
that bring light in our darkest hours.
Too often, their work goes unnoticed.
We ride down the road and see them coming down the interstate,
going to make sure that we are taking care of in a storm and we're so glad they're coming
but quite frankly after the storm passes sometimes our recognition of them does as well.
And today is a day for us to say thank you even during the calm.
You know we drive past the power poles every day rarely stopping to think about what they
do for us but when disaster strikes and lights go out we sure do want them on our side
in coming to our homes quickly don't we?
Recently, we saw that in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
You know, we had winds that topped 125 miles an hour,
the storm ripped through Southeast Southwest,
and so many parts of Georgia tearing down trees,
destroying the infrastructure,
and the damage was devastating.
And who were the folks that were the first ones
to try to come take care of us?
It's the people that you see behind me.
You know, within hours, the linemen were on the ground,
making sure that they were working alongside hundreds of utility workers and operators from
12 other states just from this past hurricane that we had to make sure that our infrastructure
was put back into place.
Some of these guys and ladies were at grueling 16 hour shifts going days without seeing
their own families to make sure that us and our communities were being taken care of.
You know, for them it's not just a job, it is a selfless commitment to something that
is far greater than just a job.
I witnessed this firsthand not only going to see my little
hometown, Adrian George of the day after the storm,
but also in Turing, Clinch County,
in serving the devastation that Helene had caused.
Quite frankly, what we also don't think of
is this is one of the most dangerous professions in America.
Nationwide, Lyneman have one of the highest fatality rates
ranking among the top 10 most hazardous jobs in our country.
That's why, to use a March 11, 2025, we officially recognize as lineman's day here at the state
capital.
A small but meaningful way to honor their unparalleled sacrifices.
These workers don't seek recognition while they're doing it or even afterwards, but they
absolutely deserve it and that's why we're here today.
So let's let today serve as a reminder for the critical role that they play in powering
our state and our homes and the sacrifices they make to keep things normal for us.
But let's do more than just acknowledge the work that they're doing.
Let's commit to supporting them, not just today, but tomorrow and in the days ahead.
George's utility providers are already working to strengthen infrastructure in order to mitigate
damages for future storms that we know are coming, but we don't know when or how severe
they're going to be.
So right now, I'm going to ask you to join me with some deep appreciation and gratitude
to the men and women behind me who continue to put their lives on the line for us every
day but especially in the most difficult times at our state faces so let's
give them a great appreciation let me ask our lieutenant governor if you'd
like to share any words with us thank you thank you thank you senator
Kennedy and I'll I just want to say thank you to the men and women here today
day. For everything you do, we always reminded during the tough time how much this profession
means to us and I just appreciate Senator Kennedy for taking this opportunity to recognize
these fine people here behind us and the hard work that they do. For all the various
companies that they represent here today all across the state of Georgia and just appreciate
you making the opportunity and taking the opportunity and doing this senator and and if we can
ever do anything for all of you guys here today please feel free to call on us at any time.
So thank you senator Kennedy and thank y'all for being here today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
