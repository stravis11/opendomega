----------
Thank you so much for being here today. I am State Senator Nabila Islam parks and
I'm here today with Rachel Kent and her son Sterling. They rely on food
assistance from SNAP benefits. We're also here with Alicia Rivera who is with
Georgia feeding families, a food bank in Georgia, and also my former colleague
State Senator Jason Estevez. In just a matter of days, nearly 1.4 million
Georgians, including over 640,000 children, could lose access to the food they
depend on through SNAP. This is not some distant policy debate. This is a
a humanitarian crisis unfolding in real time and on our watch. Let me be clear. Food is not optional.
This is not about politics. This is about children eating dinner. This is about seniors being
able to take their medicine with food. This is about parents not having to choose between groceries
or gas to get to work. Georgia is blessed, blessed to have 14.6 billion dollars in a surplus.
What we have is what we need and we have it to protect these families. We just need the
will to do it. And that's why we're calling on Governor Camp to declare a state of emergency.
Let's get Georgia families the food assistance they need, governor.
You often say we are the number one state to do business, but we must also be the number
one state for families, for children, for seniors.
Let's show that economic strength is not something we brag about.
It is something we use to take care of our own.
We are here to extend a hand and come up with solutions, and it is time for all of us
to step up and do what Georgians always do in a crisis.
We roll up our sleeves, we pull together, and we get the job done.
If other Republican states can step up, then the number one state for business can step
up to.
is the strongest workforce in America.
Can't work if their kids are hungry.
Governor, you are one of the most powerful governors
in this country, and I know if you want this fixed,
you will find a way.
And we are ready, we stand ready to help you.
Democrats are here, legislators are here,
community partners like feeding Georgia families are here.
We are ready today, not tomorrow, today.
Let's do what Georgia deserves.
Let's protect our kids.
Let's honor our seniors, and let's fight for every family
who simply wants to put food on the table.
Governor Kim, call for a state of emergency.
Let's do this together, because Georgia families
are worth fighting for.
Thank you, and let's get to work.
Next, I'm gonna have Rachel Kent speak about her story,
and she will also be standing with her son Sterling.
Hi, everybody, good morning.
Thank you all for being here today.
It's an honor to speak alongside Senator Jason Asseves,
Senator Nabila Islam Parks, and Miss Alithia Rivera.
My name is Rachel Kent.
I'm a proud single mom of my son Sterling, who's with me today.
He's a freshman in high school, a straight-age student,
and a percussions in the marching band.
I'm so proud of him.
But looking at us, you may not know the struggles our family faces.
But I'm here today because I'm one of the nearly 1.4 million Georgians
who rely on Snap to put food on the table.
And come Saturday, this critical food assistance program will end for us, for millions who need it, with no relief in sight.
We don't know how long this suspension will last.
And I want to be very clear about who is at fault here, President Donald J. Trump and the Republicans, who shut down the federal government.
And now, our governor, Brian Kemp, has an opportunity to fill in the gap and make sure
families like mine don't go hungry, but you know what, he's refusing.
Georgia has a rainy day fund, but for many of us it's already raining.
Families are doing everything right, applying for jobs, caring for children, recovering
from illnesses or disabilities, and still, it's not enough.
is a choice for my son and I. It's survival. Brian Kemp and May politicians need to use
Georgia surplus to fund to help snap families now. Too many of our leaders don't know what
it's like to check the pantry before payday to stretch $10 across the week or to send
Many child to bed after another long day of trying were tired.
Many of the politicians were born with silver spoons in their mouths, and now they tell
the rest of us how to survive with plastic forks?
Ain't right.
But we're not asking for pity.
No, we're asking for perspective.
We're not asking for handouts.
We're asking for a hand up.
It's a lifeline. It's how working families survive between paychecks. It's how
single parents like me feed their kids when the world tells them to do the
impossible. Our governor, Brian Kemp, is supposed to support hardworking
Georgians. But I said, sorry, not just a powerful, not just a comfortable, but all
of us. The parents trying to feed their families, the laid-off workers looking
for one chance to start again, and the people who still believe in hard work, even when
the jobs have vanished.
Georgia leaders need to remember who they serve, because we the people of United States
of America, the ones who struggle, who keep trying, who never give up, we're still here,
and we the people deserve to be heard.
So Governor Kemp, please take action now to protect families and fund SNAP on November
1st.
This isn't about politics.
This is about the people.
That's hunger, doesn't care about party lines, thank you.
We're aware that starting this Saturday, one in eight Jordan's will lose snap benefits.
That's millions of working families who rely on this aid to put food on the table.
We have even more families impacted by the shutdown that are in need this year.
Since last evening, I've received four phone calls from nonprofits, food pantries that
are requesting additional food.
They've seen an increase of 25 to 50 percent of families requesting additional help for
Thanksgiving.
And we're stretching ourselves then trying to meet those needs.
We're working diligently to reach these families and offer the support that they need.
This is a crisis that we must face together.
Our team and partners, as well as fellow nonprofits, are doing all that we can by adding additional
food distributions throughout the state, bringing feeding Georgia families, mobile pantries
directly to communities, and serving seniors and families without transportation.
We are hopeful that we can unite as food banks, resource centers, and the government to provide
urgent action.
The use of emergency funds as well as providing immediate additional support to our existing
systems can ensure that no Georgian goes hungry and that is our mission at
feeding Georgia families from our family to yours is to ensure that whoever's
in need the most are cared for and provided for in this time.
Good morning everyone and good morning Midtown International School. I want to
Let's start by thanking Senator Nabila Islam for her leadership during this critical time.
And I want to thank Ms. Alicia Rivera and feeding Georgia families for the work that you
all are doing in the community every day.
And I want to pay particular homage and respect to Rachel Kent and her son for being here
and speaking up and speaking out in the face of silence from Governor Kemp and Republican
state leaders as millions of Georgians are on track to lose critical snap benefits on
Saturday. My name is Jason Estevez and I'm running to be the next governor of the state
of Georgia because Georgians deserve better than the leadership that they are getting at
this critical moment. I'm a former educator, school board member and Atlanta Public Schools
and a state senator. And every day in each of these roles, I've seen how our kids are
being left behind, mainly because of where they live. Kids would come to school hungry
or sick, and that meant that they couldn't focus on the one thing that they were supposed
to be focused on, which is learning. Snap helps millions of kids and their families put
food on the table, and I've seen it firsthand. It's an essential program, and without it,
children across this state will go hungry. I think about counties like Hancock County
where one and two children are food insecure.
Snap expiring on Saturday will be terrible for those children
who are already in crisis.
But I also want to point out that there's a misconception
about who is on Snap benefits.
It's Georgians like Rachel.
It's Georgians who are working in our kitchens,
in our restaurants, in our ag industry,
one in four cooks around the state are on snap,
one in four nursing aids, cashiers, dishwashers,
one in five agriculture workers, and hairdressers are on snap.
This is another way for these hardworking Georgians
to make ends meet.
So I want to be clear,
Donald Trump and Republicans are at fault here.
They shut down the federal government
because they did not want to address the health care
for Georgians across this state.
And they did it without no regard for Georgia's children
or their families.
And now with SNAP benefits on track to run out on Saturday,
Republicans in the federal and state governments
are refusing to address this problem.
As has already been stated, 1.4 million Georgians rely on SNAP.
So why won't Donald Trump and Brian Kemp act to ensure
that one in eight Georgians don't go hungry?
These are reckless political games.
It's lawless, it's outrageous, and above all, it's cruel.
After previously saying that they would continue SNAP
through federal government funding, Donald Trump
is reversing course, and they're refusing
to use critical contingency funds to provide a lifeline
for hard-working people across this state.
But let me be clear, it's not just the Trump administration.
Our own governor, Brian Kemp, is sitting on his hands
while his own constituents are in crisis.
And there's so much that he can do.
For starters, over 22 states have joined together
to sue the Trump administration's horrific snap freeze.
Brian Kemp and Chris Carr refused to join that lawsuit.
I think about our hard-working men and women in the National Guard who could very easily
be mobilized to help pantries across this state to meet the needs of Georgians, but instead
right now they're in Washington, D.C., doing landscaping and picking up trash.
And look, y'all, as Senator Islam said, our state has $4.6 billion sitting in a bank
account that can be used for dire times such as these. This is exactly what this money
should be used for, helping Georgians when they are most in need. When Kemp says that
there is no mechanism to fill in the funding gaps, he's just refusing his responsibility.
In fact, Governor Kemp has released state funds before in times of crisis. He can do it
again, but he's choosing not to, and I can tell you that when I'm governor, I won't
hesitate to use funds when Georgians are in need of urgent relief.
Republicans like Brian Kemp, Bert Jones, and Chris Carr didn't flinch when it came to
handing out billions of dollars to a big out-of-state corporations.
But now when it comes to urgent relief for hardworking people in this state, they are
nowhere to be found.
And unlike state Republican leaders, we are standing here to take action.
And I will do so when I'm governor.
And times of crisis, I don't stay silent.
I take the challenge head on.
And when I'm governor, if the Trump administration makes any move that hurts Georgians, you can
count on me to stand tall and to fight back.
Y'all, there is no excuse.
It is time for action, and I call on Brian Kemp to protect families and ensure that
Georgians can keep food on their table.
So to the struggling Georgians all across this state, to folks like Rachel, in the face
of these cuts and uncertainty, I tell you that I am standing with you, we are standing
with you.
And here's what y'all can do right now.
First keep using any funds that you have on your card, because existing EVT balances will
continue to work.
out to your local food bank, to feeding Georgia families, to churches, to school districts,
to community organizations that providing resources at this time.
You can go to feedingamerica.org and put in your zip code and it will provide food banks
in your area that are providing critical resources.
And Ms. Alicia Rivera, thank you so much for being here on behalf of feeding Georgia.
Through the Georgians who have the resources to spare, I encourage you to support organizations
like feeding Georgia that are doing the work on the ground.
Y'all, here's my commitment to you.
I will always put Georgians' health, wealth, and opportunity first as governor.
It's what I've done throughout my whole career, and no matter what attacks, Trump, and Republicans
throw our way, I'll continue to fight for you.
Thank you so much, and with that, we'll entertain any questions.
Well, what other states like Virginia and Louisiana have done use, you know, their
state surplus is to do direct cash assistance to snap recipients.
And I know that he's saying, well, there's, you know, technical difficulties, but he's
the governor of Georgia.
I'm asking him to figure it out and get the billions and billions of dollars that we
have in a surplus and to get that we can take that and actually help Georgians. We are
not a state that's in a deficit. We have a surplus. We can use it and it's up to the
governor to do so.
Can you repeat that question, please?
So basically when I became a single mother, so kind of give back, sorry, I have a college
degree, but when you're a parent married, you become the homemaker.
So when I got divorced and became a single parent,
a gig and job has been extremely difficult,
my greatest political science.
And so I had to make do, there'd be a survival
and get on the food stamps.
How long have been on it for about six months?
It's still hard getting a job.
And my experience has been great.
I mean, you don't get a ton.
This is the thing what the misconception people have.
Just for my son and I get $300 a month on it.
It's like, no, I'm thankful for everything
get on it but the way groceries are you can't get a lot and I like to cook
from scratch too. I think that it's the most beneficial thing there's a lot
people on food stamps a neighbor could be on food stamps and it could be living
in a million-dollar house you would never know but we judge way too much I think
that's my main thing is we got to quit judging people and help me people more
So I'm preparing what my grandmother had taught me a long time ago.
She used to say to me, you have money one day, gone next, always prepared, have your pantry
full of canned goods, flowers, so I stocked up on that, because again I grouped that
blockchain culture so I learned a lot from how to cook we don't have a lot of
money and I prepared for a month so that I got meat in the freezer and meals
prepared and cook way my grandma taught me.
If there are no more questions thank you so much for being here and again I just
I just want to emphasize that other states have called for a state of emergency.
The governor can also do so.
We are sitting on a $14.6 billion surplus and we have 1.4 million people there about
to run out of food.
We can do something and the governor should do something now.
Thank you.
