----------
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 218-218?
Senate Bill 218, by Senator Robertson, the 29th and others to be titled.
And act to amend title 15 of the Fish Code of Georgia Annotated Relay in the Courts.
So it's verified that the prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission shall be assigned for
administrative purposes only to the administrative offices of the court.
This bill ever referred to the committee on judiciary non-simile that committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules,
committee substitute.
Representative Gullet, Representative Gullet,
has recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I'm sorry for those of you who got bombarded by your sheriffs.
But just for full transparency in the rules committee this afternoon,
we removed the entire section that was problematic.
I think that was a bunch of caution.
But just if you share for a set of tea with concerns,
that entire section is no longer in the bill.
What this bill does is it moves the PAQC
prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission
from the PAC, which is prosecuting attorney's council
to the AOC to solve some conflict of interest issues.
It allows PAQC to issue subpoenas
and it creates penalties for the misuse of subpoena issuing.
It clarifies the appeal process and lays out
that the PAQC is the first step,
Superior Court, second step, appeals court, third step,
Supreme Court, and fourth step.
And it also modifies a confidentiality related to DAs
and solicitor generals at their request.
So they can find out about complaints made against them
but have been dismissed before reaching the public stage.
Additionally, it'll address specifically addresses
their concern that if a complainant publicizes
that they've filed a complaint, the PAQC can tell the DA
or solicitor what's going on so they can respond
appropriately, and publicly.
Mr. Speaker, this is a cleanup bill,
and I appreciate your favorable consideration.

15, 16, 10.

What's that section do?
Maybe give you a better idea for that.
Well, what that section actually does is require that there is a deputy, a sheriff deputy,
care of the every courthouse and every superior court judge.
In this particular version of the bill, it takes out every sheriff deputy and gives a
gun to the attorneys.
No, ma'am.
That section was stripped.
