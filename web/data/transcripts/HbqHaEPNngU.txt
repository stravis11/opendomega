TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well good morning, you all ready? Good morning, thank you so much for joining us
here today and I'll start by looking back a little bit at some of the history
before we get into this bill that we're about to announce. When I first started as
a member of the General Assembly back in the state house, I remember this house
bill, I actually think it was a Senate bill at the time, that kept stalling out.
They talked about this condition named Autism Spectrum Disorder.
They like most members, I didn't really understand.
And how insurance companies weren't paying for services to help with early intervention
any of the therapies. We have come so far since that time. And I can't imagine today, even debating
whether or not insurance companies should be required to provide the necessary services
to help young people navigate a condition that makes them see the world through a different lens.
We have finally moved as a society, as an estate, and as a state, from raising awareness
about this condition to learn to accept those that think differently.
My wife, Lindsay and I are blessed to have an eight-year-old son with autism.
It's something we don't call a disability or disorder, but a gift.
Kids like our son are fortunate to be grown up in a community that now has services to
to help him learn how to manage his unique way
of seeing our world.
And his parents, Lindsay and I are blessed
to be able to grow with him
and learn how we can help people
like our son thrive in this world.
Say I'm joined by a several special guests
that I'll recognize in a minute
and also members from our law enforcement community
and first responders,
as we announce the filing of Senate Bill 433,
also known as Rio's Law.
It continues our work to help Georgia families who are living with autism and developmental
disabilities by creating a specialty license plate that families can choose to have on
their vehicles.
These places will not only continue our efforts to create more acceptance for those living
with autism and developmental disabilities, but they'll provide a resource for our law
enforcement, an entire first responder community, to be more equipped when they encounter these
individuals with conditions that aren't immediately identifiable on our roads.
This is important because as Lindsay and I have learned first hand, with proper training,
there are things that we may see as small that can make all the difference in the world
when interacting with folks that see our world in a different way or manage life with
the disability.
Senate Bill 433 also makes certain that it's part of the basic training that's required
for peace officers in our state, training on how to best interact with individuals with
autism or developmental disability is included.
As folks in law enforcement have repeatedly said to me, the more an officer or first responder
knows when approaching a vehicle, the better.
I'm proud to be joined by folks representing these first responders and families like mine
as we all come together to make certain that we get this legislation right and that we
So we get this legislation passed this year.
Now I'm going to turn it over first to Layla Luna,
whose founder and CEO of the organization, Jess B.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm Layla Luna and I am the founder and CEO of Jess B.
And I'm Rios Mom.
I want to thank you all for being here today
and especially thank Senator Strickland
for championing Rio's Law and also for Conor
for being Rio's Voice.
Rio's Law will help protect law enforcement,
safeguard individuals with autism.
My son, Rio, is nonverbal.
And like him and others, we got pulled over
in a routine traffic stop.
but Rio went into a complete sensory overload meltdown.
He was so terrified that he attacked me
and tried to jump out of the car
and run out into the street.
The only way I could stop him
is by letting him bite me,
which I have a giant scar on my wrist to prove it.
After that night, after being so terrified,
I thought we have to do something.
There must be a way to let law enforcement
and our first responders know more
about the education and awareness of autism.
I knew that something could be done
And that's why we started Rio's Law.
Rio's Law is an identifier license plate
that if you're ever pulled over or on the side of the road,
immediately our law enforcement knows
that someone in the vehicle is on the spectrum.
And if safe, turn off the sirens and the flashing lights.
And then they know what they're walking into.
Because autism has no facial recognition, there's no look.
And we know with our first responders
that time saves lives.
The B, the bumblebee logo.
My father is a pilot and was a captain in the army.
And he told me that bumblebees mystified scientists
for hundreds of years.
Aerodynamically, a bumblebee should not be able to fly,
but it does the impossible.
And just be his mission is it's not about the disabilities,
it's about the possibilities.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Layla.
And I'm gonna call up Connor Tomlinson
And Connor, as many you all know, is one of the stars of the show on Netflix, Love on
the Spectrum.
I believe your star of seasons two and three if I'm correct.
And he's incumbent say a few words.
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Connor Tomlinson and I have autism.
Some of you here may know me from Netflix's TV show Love on the Spectrum, but I am here
today as an advocate for the autism community.
While I do not drive, I am often a passenger in a vehicle.
And as an autistic man, I understand first hand what sensory overload and dysregulation
feel like.
In moments of dysregulation, I may avoid eye contact, make sudden movements, or struggle
to communicate effectively.
In the event of a routine traffic stop or an emergency situation, the likelihood of me
becoming dysregulated is extremely high.
It's important to understand that these responses
are not signs of defiance or threat.
These are neurological responses to overwhelming sensory
input.
Rio's law ensures safer encounters, better outcomes,
and stronger trust between the autism community
and professionals sworn to protect them.
As a proud Georgian,
I am encouraged by the tremendous bipartisan support
from our state legislators and law enforcement
to help people with autism and their families
feel safer and seen.
Thank you, Senator Strickland,
for being a champion for Rio's Law.
Now let's pass this bill.
Thank you Connor and I know with champions like you and Layla we're going to get this bill
passed but one of the secrets to passing any bill is to make sure it goes through both
chambers of course and I'm proud to have an ally with Chairman Lumpston from the house
who's been a big champion of course of law enforcement his entire career is former
law enforcement officer himself and I'll now turn it over to Chairman Lumpston.
Thank you, Brian.
Last year we had the, I had the privilege of carrying House Bill 238, which is a bill
similar to what we're trying to accomplish here that dealt with dementia in Alzheimer's
patients.
So, having worked through that and been able to get that passed, we're also looking
to do this for those folks that are on the spectrum.
We want to make sure our law enforcement officers understand how they react and what the
responses might be.
So this training I think is very important.
Having been a law enforcement officer myself for 30 years, I understand that you encounter
all types of things and you cannot always interpret what's going on.
So I think this type of training is very instrumental for our folks in the law enforcement community
first responders.
So I'm very honored and privileged to be able to carry this on the house side for Senator
Strickland.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anybody else?
All right, with that now we'll take it up, take any questions anybody wants to ask us.
Me.
Told you y'all to get the questions, they see me all the time.
That's a bad hearing.
I'm sorry, good.
All the training.
Gypsies.
So, we are still working, the current draft
the bill has is under post training,
but that's one of the things we're working with our law
enforcement friends on as to how the training
is actually gonna work.
What type of training would someone need to encounter?
Well, with the training, the first,
well, we always say with the training,
the first takeaway is that there's no look to autism.
So if you remember anything,
that there's no facial recognition.
And individuals with autism, like my son,
he looks absolutely typical,
but his pupils may be dilated or he's a runner
and they might be attracted to shiny objects like the badge.
So these are the things that our officers have seconds
before this goes into fight or flight.
Another thing is also understanding the allotment.
You know, children that are autistic,
they gravitate towards bodies of water.
So those are the two biggest takeaways,
but mainly understanding that the spectrum
is an invisible diagnosis and that these individuals
may not even feel sobriety test.
Any other questions for us?
All right, well thank y'all so much.
Thank y'all for being here today.
Look forward to passing this legislation.
Thank you.
