Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 152nd House District
Representative Bill Yerda, representative Yerda.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
It's a real pleasure for me to have Pastor Mike Davis with us.
Mike serves as a senior pastor at Hayhara United Methodist Church
and he's been there since 2015.
Previously, Mike was at my home church,
Penson Memorial Methodist Church, and Sylvester.
Mike's actually a third career pastor
having previously worked in law enforcement,
serving as a chief deputy in Sumter County.
He did that for about 11 years.
He also was in the insurance profession
at working for Georgia Farm Bureau Insurance
for about 18 years.
Mike grew up in Sumter County of the Lesley area and America's area, so he's actually
was in close to my district, if not in my district, or Mr. Chocus's district.
But Mike is a graduate of Lagrange College and the counselor school of theology at Emory
University with a master's degree in theology.
Not only could Mike deliver an inspirational message on Sunday, but Mike was always involved
in the community.
He served as Chaplin for the Worth County Sheriff's Department, and he also does that for
the Lounge County Sheriff's Department right now.
He also serves on the Board of Directors for the Georgia Sheriff's Boys Ranch, which
is important to us in Georgia and in South Georgia.
Mike made a real difference since the last of Georgia, and I know he's making a real
difference in Hey Hire in Lounge County, Georgia.
He always joined my family in our joyous times and he got us through some pretty difficult
times also.
To sum it up, I would just categorize Mike as just a great guy and a great guy to be around
and it's just a pleasure for me to have him today.
welcome my pastor and my friend, Mike Davis.
I tried to lose about five pounds before I got here knowing that I was going to pass
closely with Bill.
Good morning, Mr. Speaker, House of Representatives, staff members and
Yes, greetings from Hayhara and the wonderful people of Lowns County.
A few weeks ago, one of my friends called and asked if I could meet with her daughter who was a senior nursing student.
The daughter had recently experienced her first death while doing clinicals in the intensive care unit.
She was having a difficult time.
We met for breakfast, and she described her recent experience.
She was part of a team attending a patient when the man went unresponsive.
At the instructions of her attending position, she and others performed CPR, and the man
was revived.
Even though his prognosis was not so good within minutes afterwards he succumbed, the young
woman later discovered that this man, her patient, was a father of one of her friends.
However, the death of the patient was not the point of her concern.
It's not what brought on our conversation that morning.
The problems that she had were dealing with the behavior of some of the staff who were
in the room during the man's dying moments.
For most it was just another day at the office with the normal chit-chat and carrying on.
All the while little attention was paid to the patient outside of checking lines and
pump settings and vitals and monitors and among that chip chat going on comments were made
about the patient and his general condition including the fact that he would probably code
or die no matter what they did. Since she had been taught that the sense of hearing was the last
of the senses to go before death, it stung her conscience that experienced nurses and technicians
would carry on such a conversation in the presence of a dying man, acknowledging that perhaps
their behavior could be a defense mechanism to protect one from the toil of dealing with death
on such a regular basis, it still grieved her that her mentors were not kind or considerate
to one in such need.
I shared this story to point out a general observation of the day.
Our world seems to be becoming more and more contentious and less caring with each passing
day. The lessons of kindness and compassion most of us learned from our parents and elders
seem to be slipping from the norms of our culture. We turn on the news and experience vitriol
and ugliness from every angle of society. We see it in our media, we see it in our leaders,
we see it in our culture. I want a better world, ladies and gentlemen. I want a world where I can
respectfully disagree with my neighbor, yet share a meal or maybe a church pew with her. I want
a world where my grandchildren learned to respect others despite any differences. I want a world
where civility and kindness and compassion are indeed the norm.
In Galatians chapter 5 verses 22 and 23, the Apostle Paul writes, but the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
self-control against such things there is no law. In a country where approximately 65% of
the population identifies as Christian, it's a shame that we are seeing less and less
of these virtues being lived out. The very trademarks of Christian identity are becoming
last and last visible in the ways that we treat each other.
The Christian Bible expounds on the themes of kindness and compassion and love over and
over.
I'm pretty sure that most other major world religions follow similar teachings.
What would the world look like with more kindness, with more compassion?
I would like to encourage each of you in these ways.
Love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
You cannot go wrong with these behavior traits.
Besides, my mother always said, make sure the fool you're arguing with it and arguing
with one too.
I hope that you all will set the example, you.
I hope that you all will set the example for our state and perhaps even for our country
improving that there is a better way for us and it follows the footsteps of Jesus. Some
of you might be thinking, well, now wait a minute preacher, there was a time when Jesus
went into the marketplace with a whip and he took some names and kicked some flowers
around. And I will respectfully remind you that you aren't Jesus. To the follow-up of
my young nurse, I asked her what she did that day in the intensive care unit. And with
tears in her eyes, she looked at me and she said, Pastor May, with everything that was
going on. I didn't know what to do. In one of the most profound moments of humanity, our
system failed this young nurse. There was no role model, no mentor, no example of even
a common courtesy. Much less kindness and compassion is a fellow man lay dying in a state of the
art hospital. Please don't misunderstand me. If I'm in an intensive care unit, I want
a nurse that's sharp as a tack. I want technicians that know what they're doing. But you know what
want more than that. I want somebody that cares about me. I want somebody that cares about
others. I want to know that they care. So it is with you. Some of you will win battles
this legislative session and some will lose. Either way, I pray that you will do it with
civility, with kindness and care for one another and for the people of Georgia. Each of you
all have the opportunity to set the example. And when you do, you will be a better person
for it. There's a line from the song, let there be peace on earth. It says, let there be peace
on earth and let it begin with me. I pray that as you go about your business, this legislative
session, the kindness, compassion, and goodness will prevail. Let it begin with you.
Mr. Speaker, thank you so much for the wonderful opportunity of being with you all this
house of representatives. Thank you all so much for serving, for giving
of yourself in the service of our state. Thank you. Last you to stand and pray with me now.
Dear God, I thank you for this day and all the blessings that it brings.
I thank you God for these who come to serve our state, giving of themselves tirelessly and
sacrificially. I pray that you will guide their hearts and their minds from the enemy
who comes to kill and destroy. Feel them instead with your Holy Spirit and lead them in your
ways of kindness, compassion, and goodness. As they govern, pour out your favor upon them,
give them the peace of Christ that which surpasses all
understanding. Watch over this house, our governor, and all who
represent and serve our great state of Georgia, and we will
always give you the praise and the glory. In the name of Jesus
Christ, I pray. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Chair recognizes representative Henderson for a morning order.
Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning to the House of Representatives.
I rise this morning to thank all of my colleagues
that contacted me during my family emergency.
Thank you for the enormous amount of love that you've given.
Thank you, Chairman Billy Mitchell, for contacting me
and everyone that came under that umbrella.
I just thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.
There's a scripture that says,
do I speak with tongues of men and angels?
Do I have to get for prophecy and understand all mysteries?
If I don't have love, I am nothing.
And thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for the enormous amount
of love that you've shown.
Thank you and thank you, Jesus, for all that he's done.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield back.
To your recognizes, Chairman Ballinger, for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As you know, we're honoring women this month.
So today, I would like to bring your attention
to two extremely awesome women in fellow Americans.
Condi Rice was born in November.
She is an American diplomat, political science,
test civil servant, and professor, who
is the current director of the Hoover Institute
at Stanford University.
She served as a 66th United States Secretary of State
from 2005 to 2009.
and the 20th United States National Security Advisor
from 2001 to 2005,
she was the first woman to serve
as the National Security Advisor.
The second woman that I would like to bring your attention to
as a homegrown Georgian, Nancy Hart,
was probably the most acclaimed female participant
during the Revolutionary War.
She was a devout patriot.
She gained notoriety during the Revolution
for her determined efforts to rid the area of Tories,
English soldiers and British sympathizers.
She was born in North Carolina in 1735 and made her way into Georgia eventually settling in the
fertile broad river valley with her family. She was a tall gangly woman who towered six feet in height.
Her physical appearance was matched with a feisty personal demeanor characterized by a hot headed
temper, a fearless spirit, and a pinchant for exacting vengeance upon those who offended her
or harmed her family and friends. She was an expert herbalist, a skilled hunter, and an excellent
shot. The most famous story of Hart's escapades as a frontier
patriot was when she shot two toys and had four more strung up
and they were later hanged. In 1912, workmen grating a railroad
near the side of the Old Hart cabin on Earth, a neat row of six
skeletons that bear witness to this truth.
Georgians have memorialized Nancy Hart in a number of ways.
Hart County is named after her. Albert County's neighbor to
the north was named for her as well as its county seat,
heart well and the general area Lake in the general area the Nancy Hart Highway
Georgia Route 77 commemorates the legendary woman and in 1977 Nancy Hart
was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement. Mr. Speaker I yield
the well chair recognizes for a morning order chairman hatchet representative
to approve it, Representative Mathis,
Representative Camp, and Representative Mack Jackson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Glad to have my colleagues at Represent Lawrence County,
Representative Mack Jackson, our neighbor,
and Representative Beth Camp, a former alumni
of Dublin High School.
Thank you for standing as I under the lives of Dr.
Jerole Stucky, his wife, Alicia, their two-year-old son,
AJ, and their unborn daughter.
Jerole was a 32-year-old principal of Dubman High School
to his alma mater.
He stood right over there almost a year ago when we
we honored the 2019 AA State Champion football team and Ms. Pearl Whitlock for her 50 years
of service to Dublin High School. They sat there quiet and smiled the whole time.
Alicia was a nurse at the Carl Vincent VA Hospital. They were the model family.
Jeroly touched so many lives, young and old,
with his quiet demeanor, his kindness, and his humbleness.
He was a leader.
The staff of Bevin High School and the students
looked up to him.
Our communities in shock was this family
perished in a multi-vehicle, multi-tracked
or trailer accident on I-16 in Billy County yesterday.
We can only imagine the many lives
that would have continued to be touched and molded
by him and his family over the coming years.
May we please take a moment of silence
for the Dublin community, Dublin City Schools,
the staff and students of Dublin High School,
their parents, Mrs. Anita and Larry Foreman,
and the Reverend Mrs. Isaiah L. Stevens.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I know we all celebrated the speaker's birthday that was yesterday,
but today I rise because I wanted to wish a happy 79th birthday to my grandmother, Maddie
make Hendrick. She is currently a constituent of representative Shannon's
district, but she was born right here in the state of Georgia and mom to two
kids, one of which is my dad. And she spent over 40 years cleaning the homes of
wealthy people and she wasn't able to get her high school diploma. The first
time that she could walk through the front door of her white clients I was
around three or four years old, but because she walked through those back doors
I'm able to walk through their front door of the chamber.
And so I just wanted to wish her a happy birthday.
But since we're talking about birthdays, Mr. Speaker,
let me take this time to do my annual rent,
because my birthday is outside of the legislative session
on August the 28th.
And I don't get to hear the speaker say my name,
and I don't get an round of applause from my colleagues.
So right now, if your birthday is outside
of the legislative session, please stand up.
So that your colleagues can give you a round of applause
because your birthday is outside of the legislative decision.
Thank you, Mrs. Chair.
Chair recognizes Chairman Darling Taylor
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
Today, in honor of Women's History Month,
I bring you the history of a young woman
that took her desire to make a difference
anchored it firmly in a hometown of Cairo, Georgia.
As a young girl, Wessie Cannell, took her doctor's advice
and became a librarian so she would work in a quiet environment.
The quiet didn't last long, as she quickly
embarked on a personal ambassadorship
to all the schoolchildren of Grady County
to expose them to the wonders of books.
In 1939, Wessie became the Cairo's first librarian,
starting off in a room above the fire department.
This petite young woman had a fiery determination
to reach the young people with the joy of reading
and sought to be the figured, figure out ways to reach them.
When the library ran out of books,
Westie would tell the children's stories
to keep them interested while she waited
for the books to be returned.
She had innovative ways to reach.
Westie used her innovative mind to fill the needs,
probably not realizing she was making history
with her unique ideas.
Those ideas included story time, branch libraries, book
mobiles, and other outreach programs.
Her award was numerous, including a top flight woman
from the Business and Professional Club of Georgia.
Ms. Westie may not have lived in exotic places,
but her dedicated work made a huge difference in Cairo
and all across the country.
She was a visionary who brought the world
to the children adults of her hometown.
for her dedication to bring the joy of reading,
to just all the people of her area,
she became an honored Georgia woman of achievement.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Time for morning orders has expired for today
and we did not get to everyone.
If you signed up today and want to sign up
for tomorrow, please let the messenger know that,
What purpose has represented Duna who rise?
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make sure
of a clarification here.
Is it not true that Georgia Tech
is a parliamentary inquiry?
Yes, sir, it is.
State your inquiry.
I was going to make sure that everybody understood
Georgia Tech won on default
because all the other teams had COVID.
That's an accurate statement.
We're going on now to the rules calendar.
Going on to the rules calendar.
The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 5.

Senate bill five by center cake her Patrick
Very good bill as always center her Patrick has done a lot of good work in this area
this bill actually ensures patient protection by addressing sedation in patient
settings and offices and particularly Medispires. Medispires sort of a new thing
that's happening where people can go in and have liposuction, have some wrinkles
removed, maybe have some implants done and all in one day and be home at
launch. Quickly, Section 1, one is existing code. It's in the dental section, right now
presently, Dennis, that due, conscious sedation, have to have a conscious sedation permit,
requires not only testing, but in office visits to verify that everything's being done correctly
to examine the equipment and to make sure they have pulled sawmeters, that type of thing.
Section 2 of the bill actually addresses this is a new code section and addresses dental
assistance and dental hygienist doing phlebotomy and binopuncture.
This is something they've been doing and oral surgeons often typically observed when
the dental board comes in to do the observations.
This puts it in code and describes their education.
Section three is a new section in the medical practice
code, which establishes and puts in the terminology
metispies as it does in the earlier section
of the dental section.
Really, this is pretty much what the bill is doing.
I don't know that there's anything much more to be
said about this, and if there are no questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the
will. You have a question if you care to yield. Do I get to know who it is first?
Sorry. I mean, if it's Carpenter, I would prefer to yield the will. You can't tell me
