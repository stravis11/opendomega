Right now, Senator from the twenty-night, speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Fellow Senators, Senate Bill 268 is a very simple piece of legislation.
In many states it's called the Halo Act.
The purpose of this is to place a 25-foot safety zone around any first responder conducting
their job, doing their job, if you will.
And first responders, as we know, are EMTs, firefighters, and law enforcement officers.
What it does is it set up a 25 foot radius circle around the situation while the individual
does their job and carries out their duty.
Should any individual intentionally try to interfere with the first responder while they're
doing their job, they will be arrested, can be arrested.
a simple piece of legislation, I'll stand for any questions, or if not, I'll yield the
well, Mr. President.
You do have one question, recognize the Senate from the 47th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
With the center of yield.
Yes, I will yield to my friend from Athens.
For clarification, going down the highway, you know, you're supposed to slide over a lane
if you can, lanes are typically 12 feet wide, officers over there.
than 25 feet away from you.
That is an exemption in this Halo Act, is it not?
Yes, sir.
The Halo Act is not necessarily involved individuals driving in motor vehicles.
What you're describing is the move-over law.
And so as long as the individuals properly operate in their vehicle and they move over
in order to avoid hitting the officer, hitting somebody that he may be helping, would be
the move-over law.
This does right here is if the officer is out engaged in something, if the EMT is out engaged in something,
if the firefighter is out engaged in something, and they ask an individual to step back 25 feet,
that individual would step back.
They can still continue to have a conversation, they can continue to film.
Just as long as they don't interfere with the responsibilities and duties of that first responder at the time,
as long as they don't do that, they will not be in violation of this law.
What I want to make sure if you further clarifies that we're not creating a two lane move over in this case.
I was for me with the move over law.
I just want to make sure that we can still do that safely and pass and not, you know,
because you'd be within 25 feet a lot of times.
Absolutely. No, sir.
This, this is just for individuals outside the vehicles.
It has nothing to do with the move over law.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, no, no further questions.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the well.
Does any other Senator Wish speak for against the measure?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objections to the previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
Previous questions are ordered.
Is there objections to agreeing to the Board of Committee,
which is favor to the passes of the bill?
Chair, here's none.
Before the committee is agreed to,
is there objections to the main question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
The main question is ordered.
Questions on the passes of the bill?
All those in favor of vote?
Yay, all opposed, nay.
Secretary, I'm not in the machine.
You
I don't know what you're going to do, but I don't know what you're going to do, but I don't
know what you're going to do.
