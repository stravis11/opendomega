Representative Carson can lead draft you into closing the door over there. We'll add that onto your bio. Well, good morning. Welcome to the legislative day 32. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 123rd House District, the chairman Martin Newton, the chair of the special committee on access to quality health care, chairman Newton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm really pleased to have Pastor Joseph Humphrey, the lead pastor of Warren Baptist Church, Grove Town Campus in Columbia County with us today. Chairman Fleming, floor leader, lot, and I have the honor of serving as representing parts of Columbia County. It's one of the fastest growing counties in Georgia. And a large part of Pastor Joseph's ministry is to the diverse community there, in particular, a tremendous military presence. Growing even faster as the US Army moves the headquarters for cyber command from Fort Gordon area just outside, just past where Pastor Joseph's church is. The entire ministry team there have a heart to minister to all those, and especially those members of the military and their family with all those unique challenges of deployments, frequent moves, and in particular with intelligence and cyber, the 24-hour day nature of that defense and cyber protection. Like many of us, Joseph's journey had something of a zigzag course. He's amazingly musically gifted, and actually for a time, wrote music in national Tennessee. He did get a UGA Business School degree that he put to use over at the Savannah Riversite nuclear project, nuclear defense facility there before he found his true calling. Because now for over a decade, he's found that true calling as a minister of the gospel of Christ with a true heart for others. He's here today with his wife Sarah, who's a music teacher in one of our elementary schools. He's been out there like many of you know your teachers out there doing a Zoom, trying to teach music and learn an appreciation of music for elementary students through Zoom. So I'm glad she's here with us today. Together they're the proud parents of Solomon 13, Lily Grace 11, and Samuel 9. Joseph, thank you for being here today. We look forward to hearing from you as we get started on our 32nd legislative day. Pastor. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful for the honor of standing in this historic house today and having the great privilege of addressing this esteemed body. I further want to express my appreciation for the confidence of the gentleman from Georgia District 1, 23, Dr. Mark Newton, who extended this invitation so graciously to me today. Dr. Newton is not only a member and dear friend of a Warren Baptist Church of which I serve, but he is also a vital part of our local community in the CSRA. And so Mark, I want to say publicly that I'm grateful for your friendship and your contribution to the people that we love and serve in our community. If you were to meet me on the street, it would not take you long to discern that I am a Georgia boy and a native of Augusta, an alumni of the University of Georgia. It is where I was born, it is where I was raised, and it is where the people who are nearest and dearest to me reside. And while I have laid my head in many other places and countries in the world, there is nothing like crossing that state line and witnessing the foliage change and realizing that I am indeed home again. I love this state like you do. As I was thinking about my upbringing in this moment with you, I was asking the Lord what he would have a simple Georgia boy like me bring to a distinguished house like this. And in that moment, I was reminded that you and I have much more in common than some might think. You see, pastor or legislator, all of us here today have answered a similar call. The call to stand and lead in the cities and in the communities that we love and cherish and call home. And on top of that, we have answered this call in unprecedented times. As we face disease and death, this unity, oppression and social upheaval on every turn. In this environment, leadership can be tough. And I don't know about you, but often in these days, I have had people looking to me for answers when if I am honest, I have had more questions than I have had solutions. We all share this weight. We all share this deep responsibility. And I know that you are feeling it with me in this place and in this season. So in this context, I want to bring you a word of encouragement and comfort today. I want to encourage you in the same spirit and manner that Paul comforted the church in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4. Like us, the Thessalonians were facing difficult days. Death and justice, persecution, social unrest. And in that moment, Paul encourages them with two truths, truths that I believe are for you and for me today. And that I pray will be a source of strength for you as we take up the task of leading together in the days ahead. Number one, as we look around at the pain and the suffering that surrounds us. And as we witness the hurt and the fear of so many of our fellow Americans, I want you to know today that this is not the way that it's supposed to be. The Bible is absolutely clear on this point. The injustice, the division, the disease and turmoil present all around us. This is not part of God's heart or design for mankind. And I believe that every human being on the earth has a sense of this in their soul. There's something in every one of us that cries out against such things, that realizes that something is off, something is twisted, something is wrong. And I want you to know from the counsel of God's word today that you are right. The thing in you that aches for justice that longs for peace and thirsts for harmony in the world, it was put there by your Creator. And this is not the way that it's supposed to be. But number two, I want you to be of great courage. Because the Bible also teaches that while these things are now present, they will not be permanent. Paul speaks of a day when Jesus will return and he will redeem and restore the earth. His return will not be merely symbolic nor will it take place in some alternative ethereal existence out there. But the Bible says that his return to this place and his rule and his reign will bring about the fulfillment of every desire of the heart for peace and equity and tranquility. And so today I want to encourage you to take heart in a world in which the odds can sometimes fill insurmountable on those days in which it seems that you have taken one step forward only to take three steps back. I want you to be steadfast. The Bible says that where you fight for justice, truth and goodness, these things will not be overcome. Your striving is not in vain. These things will stand. They will prevail and they will be established for all time. But ask for every injustice, every oppression, every sorrow, every wickedness. Ask for the death and the disease that plagues us, those things that breed disunity and dissension. All of this will be eradicated from the face of the earth once and for all time at the coming of Christ. This is the great hope and promise of Scripture. I want you to see it in Revelation 21. It says, and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eye and death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former things have passed away. And so I say with Paul today, take heart, be of good courage, be strengthened and resolved, fight for the things that will last and when you do your victory is assured. Please stand with me and join me in prayer. Father, my heart leaps at this truth. My soul longs for its consummation in Christ. Thank you, that in the midst of darkness we have a great hope and a bright future in Jesus. I pray for the men and women in this room, the members of this house, may you give them the strength to stand for justice and righteousness, the wisdom to lead with equity, the strength to persevere and difficulty, and the grace to establish unity and brotherly affection in this state and in our communities. I ask all of these things in the matchless name of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I want more of the Lord and the New Yorker. I appreciate that very much. Thank you for the opportunity. That was really, really good. Thank you. We need this message. The Chair recognizes Chairman Don Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits. Thank you, Mr. Faker.

We are now going on to morning orders. Going on to morning orders. Chair recognizes Representative Bennett for a morning order and I would remind all of you Total time of 10 minutes, not each Thank you, Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues good morning Around 9.05 p.m. on Wednesday, June 17th, 2015 The Charleston Police Department began receiving calls of a shooting at Emmanuel A.M.E. Church. A man described as white with sanded blonde hair around 21 years old and five feet nine inches in height Wearing a gray sweatshirt with jeans later identified as Dylan Roof had opened fire With a glock on a group of people inside of a church doing a Bible study. During the hour preceding the attack, 13 people including the shooter participated in the Bible study. According to the accounts of people who talked to survivors when the shooter walked into the historic African American church, He immediately asked for a pack to pick me and sat down next to him initially listening to others doing the study. After the participants began praying, he stood up, shot and aimed the gun and he pulled. And pulled the gun out of a fanny pack at 87 years old Suzy Jackson. Jackson's nephew 26 years old, twines of sand, just tried to talk him down and asked why he was attacking the church goals And the shooter said, I have to do it. You rape our women, you're taking over our country and you have to go. The shooter fired a victim shouting racial epitats. He reportedly said, you all want something to pray about. I'll give you something to pray about. And he loaded his gun five times. The victims, six women and three men were all African American members. A mother, a manual, a.m.y. church. They were killed by multiple gunshots fired at close range. The past is wife and two daughters were inside the building during the shooting but were somewhere else. This is an African belief that as long as your name is called, you shall never die. And so the victims were, Clemente picked me, the pastor, Cynthia Marie Graham, heard Suzy Jackson. Ethel Lee Lance, def. Middleton, twines of sanders. Daniel L. Simmons, Shuranda Coleman, Simmons Singleton, Myra Thompson. These victims were later collectively referred to as the Chalston 9 and the Emanuel 9. Today we honor and remember the Emanuel 9 victims of a hate crime massacre in South Carolina. One of four remaining states without hate crime legislation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, one moment of silence. Amen. Chair recognizes representative Roger Bruce, who the clock ran out on yesterday. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the General Assembly. All of you on your way in this morning, I presume, and I've been trying to get up here for three days to point this out. But when you came in, you saw a bunch of people that were living on the streets over there at the highway. And you know, they've been out there so long that we've probably grown immune to it. And you know, I'm just riding by and don't think about it. But I stopped and I talked to a few of the folks and contrary to proper belief, a lot of those people are not mentally ill. A number of them just lost their mortgages, they've lost their homes, they've lost their ability to pay their bills, and they're just trying to have place to survive. You know, there's no place to use the bathroom there, there's the trash is everywhere. And, you know, I wanted to come up here to suggest why we're going through this budget process that we consider finding some way to send resources to do what they did down in Tampa, Florida, where they've set up a similar to a military style village, where some of the tents are for where they could eat, some of where they can use the restroom, some have medical facilities in it. And it basically sets a contemporary city with all of the needed things for people who are homeless so that they can also shelter in place. They can stay in these tents, they can get their services, and they're not spreading this deadly virus in the course of their day. So as we go through this process, let's see how we can help people who really need help. And that's why I wanted to come up here and talk to you today. Thank you very much. Chair recognizes representative Bayes Moore for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning.

colleagues. And I rise because I want to inform you of some statistics. Initially we were told that the COVID-19 would really only affect older people. However, we discovered that this virus has many variables and changes its characteristics. We know our children, the most vulnerable among us, have contracted COVID-19. Several days ago, the CDC has reported 87,800 and six cases across the nation. Among those cases, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported on Monday, June 15, there were 2,637 cases. And on Tuesday, June 16, there were 2,693 cases, which represents an increase of 56 new cases in one day. The breakdown of those cases is as follows. Those under the age of 1 year old, 136. Those 1 to 4 years old, 377. Those 5 to 9 year olds, 538. Those 10 to 17 years old, 1,648. Also, we found out that Long County has canceled all sports, conditioning and interaction for children due to a child contracting COVID-19. In addition, I want to give you some more facts about the breakdown. They talk about older people, but let's look at this. Ages 18 to 29 confirmed cases, 10,189. Hospitalized 456, deaths 10. They have surpassed all the other ages that we were told that would contract this disease. I am totally confused that we are not having this discussion. I don't hear anyone talking about this. These are our children that we need to protect. Please take that in consideration when we continue to open. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Gamble for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I rise today on a sad occasion for my hometown Carter'sville, Georgia, because we are mourning the loss of Miss Linda Perris Benton. Miss Benton is most notable in our community for having served as the president of the Carter'sville City School Board for 20 years. She was a champion for all students, particularly those who were at risk and frequently paid for clothing, tuition, materials, and supplies. Her condominer played a major role in assuring that disagreements among the school board were always professional. She was extremely detailed and was notorious for carrying a note pad in her purse that she would politely reference to make sure things were recalled correctly. She's a native of Carter'sville born in 1943 and she was also the director of Church of Angelism and growth at Sam Jones United Methodist Church where often she would be the first person to greet visitors and make them feel welcome there at the church. She leaves behind her husband Jerry and her three children deemed Aaron and Amy and a host of grandchildren that she was very proud of. And so I would ask that we please have a moment of silence in honor of Miss Linda Benton at this time. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Abel Mabel Thomas for a morning order. Representative, I will point out to you that you have 30 seconds left. If you want to wait till tomorrow, we can do that. Okay. She'll be first on the list tomorrow. Okay, we're going on to the rules calendar. We are going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 362. Senate Bill 362 by Senator Wilkeson, the 50th Anderson, the 24th Harper, the 7th Berkeley, 11th and others to be in town on the act to amend chapter 3 to title 4 of the physical to Georgia and TITRA relating livestock running at large or strain so as to change the fees for impounding an animal and disposing of impound animals. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Chris Irwin to present the bill. Great. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring before you, Senate Bill 362. The bill changes the fees associated with impounding, serving notice, caring and feeding, and advertising and disposing of impounded animals. The bill is meant to allow for counties to recover what is spent and managed when they managed and impounded these animals. We worked with the Ag Commissioner on this bill. I think you will find it interesting to know that it became apparent to our us that this bill needed to be brought before you as water buffalo were wandering free in my district. And my sheriff was called and had to impound the water buffalo, had to keep the water buffalo for an extended period in time. That includes a lot of water and a lot of food because they eat quite a bit every single day and then had to sail the water buffalo at the sail barn. When he found out after looking back that he couldn't charge but about $10 a day feed not only for capturing but impounding the animals and then carrying them to be sold. He then collected the money realized he could not pay the people what the actual cost was. So we had discussion, we had discussions with Commissioner Black and this bill before you is the bill that we brought out. Find it very interesting that water buffalo were roaming free in district 28 up there but that they were. So Mr. Speaker we would at this time then yield for any questions about Senate Bill 362. Get bare with me just a moment let's see if we have any questions. We have a question. Do you yield? I do. Chair recognizes representative Wolenski to your ride up in the gallery. Thank you, Speaker. It seems like a great bill. I was just curious when I see actual costs I'm always concerned that there's no limit clearly in this prior bill there was a very low cost that needs to be updated. Why do we choose to go with actual instead of having a set amount. Sorry it would it would depend here on the type of animal I'm sure but it is actual cost and it does say for feed and care of impounded animals not to exceed $25 a day. Do you further you? I do. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark up in the gallery to your right. Yes, ma'am. Does the chairman yield? I do. So I'm not very familiar with how much it costs to impound a water buffalo. So I am actually curious what is the estimated cost of impounding a water buffalo? It well I can't tell you I was given the exact numbers at the time the sheriff did tell me that when they took them to the sale barn they sold them for $1500 a piece and that would easily cover the cost that it was for the impounding of the days that they had. They had to put that money from at the sale barn just into the general budget and were not able to give the money to the individual that not only captured them but then fed them and watered them and carried them to the sale barn. Does the gentleman further yield? I do. I'm just trying to get a gauge of the difference between the $10 that were striking from the code to the amount that someone or the amount that we are now actually asking someone to pay. Well it would be the actual cost it would be the bills that they turned in that they could prove that this is what their expenses were for that animal. So does the gentleman further yield? I do. So just ballpark are we talking $20? Are we talking $200? I'm just trying to get a ballpark estimation because as the gentleman who spoke before we stated actual cost is very vague and I just wanted to make sure that we're not having on a large cost. I would say that again would vary depending on the animal if it was a cow an animal that is much easier to handle. That cost would be much lower. A water buffalo would be much greater because of the danger for a water buffalo. But what I would assume would we wouldn't have too many more water buffaloes in my district that we'd have to be paying for. But I do know the cost for capturing and either putting back onto the farm or putting taken to the sale barn is more towards the bottom line number you just gave of that $20. Thank you. Yes ma'am. Chair recognizes representative Al Williams to your left for a question. I do. Thank you all the gentleman yield. Yes I will. 25 won't cover for your information. The eating cost of a water buffalo is 3%. They eat 3% of their body weight a day. In $25 won't cover that. That's exactly right. Additionally in the interest of fairness as brother as I have that was not I didn't find that that was given to me by the illustrious chairman of the rules committee. But in the question was asked earlier but I am concerned about what you personally doing to get rid of water buffalo in your district. What we personally do to get rid of. What I do. Well I thought first of all it was a joke for my sheriff but then I went and witnessed it it was true that there were water buffalo wandering free multiple times they got out of the fence one time the people walked off after he put them back in and he collected them back. So sir I stay far away from water buffalo as I can. Do you yield for one more question? I will. Chair recognizes the chair of the agriculture and consumer affairs committee chairman McCall for a question. Thank you miss speaker German yield. I do. It is not true and this is a serious question the first one. There is a law on the move now by livestock running its laws and that includes everything from a goat to a water buffalo. There is. And the way you have the word written in here about the cost is if it cost five dollars a day to feed a goat and keep it up then it's five dollars a day. At the max of 25 is that right for the water buffalo. That is correct. And also in that law it requires the law enforcement people to try to find and get a hold and get the people who are the suspected owner of these animals to take them back and do something with them. At that point in time when they don't that's one to share if that's the take over is this not true. That is correct. The other question I had is the legacy that you perceive yourself to have in the general assembly been your first meal. I was worried about that and was hoping that wouldn't come up. So Mr. Speaker I yield the well and I ask for your favorable consideration of this bill. Gentlemen as yielded the well your legacy may be representative that the only question remaining to be asked was from the majority leader of the house. You did I think you'll forgive you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines and call the roll.

He's not going to present his bill in the any room House bill 1029 my represent math is 144 to be entitled next to provide future elections for the office of probate judge of twigs county She'll be nonpartisan elections to bill. I'm referring to the committee on governmental affairs that committee recommends a disbuell do pass You in a big hurry representative you got you got somewhere you need to be You hurry up and wait Chair recognizes representative mathis to present the bill Thank you mr. Speaker. I'm sorry. I'm new it this I'm old but I'm new I just would like to introduce today House bill 1029 It's a bill to make nonpartisan for the probate judge And also House bill 1030 for the nonpartisan Just one at the time 1029 and I'd ask for your favorable vote for this You do not appear to have oh you do have a question Do you yield for a question? Yes, sir Chair recognizes representative McLauren In the gallery to your left Thank you mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield. Yes, sir Would gentleman agree that in the latest primary election in twigs county the democratic nominees collectively or candidates for both US Senate and president received at least twice as many if not close to three times as many votes As the Republican nominees If you say so with the gentleman yield for one final question. Yes Would gentleman agree that this bill is one in a series of bills by which the Republican majority takes away Democratic voting power in counties that are strongly blue or turning blue Although not doing it throughout the state on the false premise that somehow nonpartisan elections are better for only one county at a time If you show sight it's all got thank you You have a question Do you yield for a further question? Yes, sir chair recognizes chairman house to your right for a question Is it not true that all people should be treated the same and by having a nonpartisan judge all people are treated the same? Yes, ma'am in my opinion Okay Oh Chair do you further yield? Yes, sir. I do chair recognizes chairman effustration to your left for a question Thank mr Your gentleman yield I do sir is it not true that the canons of judicial ethics the rules that judges have to follow Require that they do not act in a partisan manner and having a partisan affiliation require For the judicial position is in direct conflict with the canons of judicial professionals How believe that to be true? Is it not true that because of that your bill your two bills are consistent with the rules that all judges are required to follow Yes, sirs I understand it. Thank you, sir Didn't Newton Okay Got another question up in the gallery to your to left do you further you I will for one more chair recognizes representative Wilkerson For a question and the gallery to your left thank you mr Speaker does the gentleman yield are you? Is it not true that last year or might have been the early this year we had to build that would have turned all Magistrate court judges and probate court judges to not

partisan and that this body decided they did not want to proceed down that path. So to my colleagues point, this seems to be a direct play on whatever a county is turning democratic that we want to change it. And that we can solve this by passing one bill that makes all magistrate court judges nonpartisan and all probate court judges nonpartisan. We truly believe that all people were equal. Thank you. That was kind of a question. Thank you. How you all well? Gentlemen is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none.

To break a tie and did exercise that in this case, which gave the bill 91 votes. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1030. What purpose does representative cannon rise to make a motion? You're not recognized for a motion. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1030.

I'm Republican, but I'm their representative. This is what they want. Their commissioners voted unanimously on it. So I felt it my duty to do is ask me.

On the passage of House Bill 1030, the eyes recorded are 90, the days are 65, the chair votes I, the bill having received 91 votes and 65 votes in opposition. The bill has received the requisite constitutional majority and is therefore passed. Yes, sir. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. What purpose is the minority leader of the House rise? Thank you, your Chair. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Rule 143, I would serve notice of intention to this House to move for reconsideration of the House's action on both House Bill 1029 and House Bill 1030 on the following legislative day. Gentlemen, has that right? The minority leader has served notice of his intention to seek reconsideration of this House's action on House Bill 1029 and House Bill 1030 and that will be taken up on the next legislative day. Clark will read the caption to Senate Bill 176. Senate Bill 176 by Senator Black. On the eighth House, that will be the 52nd. Robertson 29th Hill, the 4th and others. We turn on the act to amend Chapter 2, Title 37, the fiscal to George Antietta, relating the administration of mental health, developmental disabilities, addictive diseases, and other disability services, so as to remove across reference, this bill haven't referred to the committee on retirement. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Kirby to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Kind of feel like when you get moved up to the big table, thanksgiving coming in here now, so it's pretty cool. House Senate Bill 176 is really pretty simple. We're talking about ERS, the Employee Retirement System. It's not LRSTRS or any of our other alphabet soup. It's just employee retirement system only. And what we're really doing here is we've got a lot of quality people that spend a long time working for the state of Georgia. And they've got a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience and a lot taking bring to the table. And they get to retirement age, and we want them to go out and enjoy the retirement. But sometimes we like them to come back and help it's out a little bit. And what this does is put a mechanism in place for those people to come back in into service as part time employees. And the employer and employee would pay both portions of any retirement that go into the ERS system. If they work less than a thousand, 40 hours, which is 26 weeks, then they're not going to get any other retirement benefits. And then it's not going to add to their time, not going to add to their service. If they're going to become back to as a full-time student, then they'll just go back out of the retirement system and go back in to regular service. So it's pretty simple. There's no costs to the state. It's all funded by the employer and employees paying into the system. And it gives us an opportunity to bring back quality people in a part-time role to help us with some knowledge and experience that they have that one we can use the best. And if there's any questions, I'll take a few. I think it's pretty self-explanatory, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield for questions? I will yield for a few, yes, sir. Chair recognizes Chairman Martin to your left for a question. Do you want to yield for a question? Yes, I will. I appreciate the gentleman. I just want to make sure that we're on the same page here. You said there was no cost to the state. These are state employees and the employers paying the benefit for the...

and we're the employer, so I believe in fact, you may have mis-spoken. There's no cost to the employee, but it does in fact cost the state. Is that not true? You are correct. I didn't just to say that incorrectly. I'm sorry about that. If gentlemen, you'll find another question. Is it not true that I understand the bill will put more money in the retirement system, but my fear is it will make it harder and more expensive to hire experienced people that wanna come back and work with the 49% because is that not true? That it will add an artificial cost with that money going in the retirement system when the employee is not getting any credible service for that, is that not also true? That's the gentleman's thought. I'd say it will make it harder, but I don't believe it. I think it gives a better access for people to come in and help out when they bring their experience back being able to utilize this. So we're gonna disagree on what effect it has on him. It's generally, just for this. My reason I'm saying it would be harder is if the benefit cost 14% and that has to go into retirement and neither benefit in the employee, they don't get it, but it's cost in the state money. If it is money that could have been paid to that employee and make it more likely that they would come back, that was the point that I was making that they could be higher either cheaper to the state or make more for the employee if we were not putting that money inside of the retirement system, is that not true? Your math would be accurate, yes. But we can hire him for a lesser amount also as a part time employee than what they were making before. And so all that could be worked out in the employment process and it could all be a move point. I understand, and it is not true. I also understand we have to honor our commandments to our retirees and we'll do that as a state, whether we hire these folks or not, I would just like to be able to get the money to the employees. Thank you, gentleman, for the question. Thank you, question. Do you yield for another question? Yes, sir, I'll take one more. We have a question coming from room 341. Chair recognizes representative Stonewall for a question. All who are a question? That's a gentleman yield. Yes, I will. Yes, I will. Is this bill similar to one that had come before the Education Committee for teachers that want to come back who have a previously retired? Well, I guess we've seen those similar bills in the retirement committees. Well, I guess it all depends on what you're calling similar and how similar it is. We do have a process now where retired teachers do come back into service. And in that line, this would be similar because we can do that as a part time less, less than a half time employee and keep them in the retirement system. What this does is actually, during this time of service, if they're working more than that 1,040, it takes them out of the retirement system if they stay part time. Or if they're in that retirement age, if somebody's 72 years old, they could stay in there. So there would be some similarities, but without a bill comparison side by side, I couldn't tell you what the Education Committee saw. That's a gentleman further yield. Yes or no? Yes or no? So with this particular bill, an educator who has retired and meets these qualifications can come back into the classroom to teach. No, this bill has nothing to do with the TRS, which is the teacher's retirement system. This is strictly an ERS bill. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill 176. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.
