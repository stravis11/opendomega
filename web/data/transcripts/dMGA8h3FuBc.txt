This is day three of a nice 40 day legislative session.
We're here for one short order.
My name is Frank Giena, chair of the committee.
I want to introduce everybody to Miss Karina Edwards, who is my new administrative assistant
this year.

There's a date that they thought was the appropriate date for us to move towards.
So Mr. Chairman, what I'm doing in acting on this, in the timeline we're acting under,
is A, the direct order of a federal judge, Eleanor Ross from the Northern District of Georgia,
to act on this by the 10th, which is today.
been in agreement by the plaintiffs and the Board of Elections the 22nd is the
appropriate day so we are moving this forward without rushing with great
deliberation and thoughtfulness this map is a product that's been worked on
really since the order came down on the 14th of December to a to comply with all
the provisions of her order and put something before this legislature and the
County that we can be proud of that meets our voting rights act obligations and
other provisions that were specified by the judge. They're the comments that
were made about it. But this map accomplishes that and if it pleases the chair
glad to walk through some provisions some specific things we looked at and
addressing the judge's concerns that are captured in this map I can give
to this is quickly or slowly is like Mr. Chairman but that's kind of the
framing of the issue before I move forward I just want to see if there's an
and it was the chair wanted to add.
Thank you, Mr. Senator.
Senator said, if I can, I want to see how many people
are signed up on that sign-up sheet, you know, young man?
You go right ahead.
And then just pass the sheet up here to me.
I want to see how many people we got interested in talking.
I will tell you that I know that some of our members
have obligations that they had committed to before.
We rushed to have the committee meeting this afternoon.
And because five o'clock was our only opportunity,
I want to be respectful of their time.
So our goal was to get in and out of here by 5.45.
So if I can get that coming towards me,
just carry it up here, please.
Thank you very much, sir.
Mr. Chairman, as we're proceeding,
I've got four people that are signed up to speak.
So if you can limit your comments to the next,
say five or 10 minutes at the most, said to me.
You got Mr. Chairman?
We are, as we know, the Senate's a separate co-equal body
from the House, the House.
Members from Cobb County have rules that apply to their process.
That's been raised before.
Our process is one in which if there's four of the six senators from Cobb County,
if there's four or more on a map, it goes through the uncontested bills and resolutions process,
before filing the bill, sought the signatures.
Not to say that I won't get support from those senators, but it wasn't immediately forthcoming.
So having worked on this, having shared this information
with our Cobb legislators early Saturday morning,
we had a hearing Monday morning,
or had a meeting of the Cobb legislators,
discussed the map in great detail,
took 45 minutes of questions and discussed those back and forth.
Had another public meeting yesterday,
also called by our delegation chair,
we spent more than an hour and a half,
about two-thirds of which was focused on this map
and this plan to specifically discuss among our members,
those issues. And what I bring before you today is something that's been
discussed extensively. Obviously there will be some that think we had to, you
know, follow some other process in presenting this. But what's before it?
Members today, again, as a plan for the Cobb County Board of Education, what
you see in the middle of this plan, if you can see the map to my left, you're
right, you see Cobb County's boundaries, the white area in the center is the
City of Marietta, you may or may not know the Marietta City has its own city school system.
So the area that's represented in the center of the county is represented by Marietta City
schools.
The colored areas around the county, there's seven colored districts are the proposed districts,
the seven districts for our Cobb County Board of Education.
Our Board of Education has seven members, four year terms, and the seven members elect
a chairman from amongst them to serve as chair for a two-year period. That's how that
process works. Consistent with the judge's order, what you see is you see a plan that
complies with the Voting Rights Act. I'm going to see, I've got a pointer. Of our seven
districts, what you see, but again, the color district was proposed. These dark lines
show, and at this for purposes of context, Mr. Chairman, these dark lines show the lines
of the existing districts from 2012, sort of the baseline from which this map is being
presented. Again, those are the districts that were in place before 2022. The 2022 map
is in rural and litigation. So this 2024 map is what you see in these colored masses here,
but it's relative to these lines. So you can see, you know, this district three line complies
very closely to the existing lines. And I'll start there, Mr. Chairman, of these seven
district from 2012 and again in this plan there is one district that is a
majority black district under the Voting Rights Act. District 3 in 2012 was a
majority black district. It's a contingency being a majority black district
and the lines of that district are very close. We had to make a couple changes
to maintain population balances but district 3 is largely maintained here
and that's the only majority black district that's that's required by Voting
Alright, it's active cross-cov.
Overall, the population equalization is strong
across this plan.
Historically, decades ago, these districts needed to be
plus or minus 10%, that was narrowed to 5%.
And in recent years, we've tried to get these plans
under 1.5% to 2%.
This plan is a total deviation, district to district to district.
The total deviation of this plan is 0.84%.
So the spread is very, very narrow from district to district.
So from the perspective of a proportional representation,
this plan is very, very tight, very, very close.
Working through other mandatory requirements in the plan,
there's a list of mandatory criteria,
and there's a list of what we call preferred criteria.
Best practices, they're not strictly mandatory,
but that we follow.
So criteria one, complying with the Voting Rights Act,
it does that in district three.
Criteria two, equalizing population, it's less than 1%,
net deviation across the map.
All geography within the Cobb County School Board
is included here.
We have contiguous districts.
The only non-continuity you see here
is islands they're created by the annexation
of Marietta over the years.
So those are sort of mandatory islands,
but there's no other islands anywhere in these maps
because continent being contiguous is a requirement.
Also, there's no incumbent pairings.
All of the incumbent sitting members of our school board
or have their own districts, there's no pairings
made of incumbents.
And then lastly, as we talked about,
the requirement to initially pass this into law
by January 10th, not possible.
And agreements have been put in place
among the plaintiff on our Board of Elections
for January 22nd.
I don't believe that's realistically possible either.
That wasn't ordered by the judge.
Those were the members, so the judges
is probably acted and approved on that.
So the mandatory criteria, the preferred criteria
Mr. Chairman, splits of precincts, of the 160 or so precincts in Cobb County, the 2012
baseline plan that you see in these dark lines have 22 split precincts.
We actually reduce that to nine.
There's about 165 precincts here with all these jagged lines.
There's only nine split precincts in this current map moving in a very strong direction
in terms of reinforcement principles.
Since it's defined places, cities, 2012 baseline
has four senses defined places that are split.
This has five, close to the same.
The only difference is the city of Kennesau
has an almost non-contiguous area to the east of I-75 here
that's not contiguous, but it's a real strange connection
to the city, so this is essentially,
substantially the same as the previous map.
Last two things, Mr. Chairman, the preservation of the core,
one of the reapportionment principles
is preserving the core of the districts.
The 2022 map that's in the courts
moved 36% of the citizenry of Cobb County
into different districts.
That was one of the things the judge raised
was that that was a large number that was of concern.
And drawing this plan, even though we have population shifts
across our county, we lowered
the 36% relocation of folks from district to district down to 23.
So there's a significant drop in that, again,
consistent with the reapportionment principles.
And then lastly, the compactness standard.
If you look at these black jagged lines,
this is what the compactness looked like of districts before.
You can see district five before was this.
Now district five is a very simple core.
District three was stretched.
I'm sorry, district six was stretched.
all along Cobb County literally from way down here in the south of the
Kent and almost so the southern edge of Smyrna all the way up to this other
corner of the county what we could do is we can sell it at District 3 District 6
here District 2 same so the compactness of this is available to you I'll just
leave this there's a little worksheet the top is the 2012 benchmark plan you
can see these standards of compactness there's four different industry standards
that are recognized. The 2022 plan, you can see this under litigation, you can see.
The standards are better than both the 2012 plan and significantly better than the 2022 plan.
So by every measure of compactness that courts look at, and there are four separate
industry recognized measures. Every single measure is improved in this map over
the 2012 baseline map that we started from. So that, Mr. Chairman, a lot of
work's been put into this map to meet the standards of the courts. I've got
spreadsheets that could drive you nuts if that's what you want to say. I don't
think you do, but glad to take questions if there are any. Thank you, Senator
Sessler. It looks like you worked pretty hard to get concise map. Are there any
Any questions from the committee members?
Seeing no, wait a minute.
Senator S. Wells, do you have a question?
I do, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry.
What's your number?
It doesn't have a number.
You have it.
I think that's your own.
All right.
For Georgia fans, Nick Saban is retiring.
I see it.
There you go.
just got that on my own, just got that on my watch, breaking news, more in line with this
hearing. Senator, thank you for bringing your presentation. I, Mr. Chairman, I emailed
the order that the judge issued and you know I didn't read it.
No, it's okay. And just hope that the committee will receive that.
For those of you I know it's hearing only today.
But Senator, I wanted to read one piece of one sentence and
ask you a question related to it.
It says the parties do not dispute that the enacted map,
which is the 2022 map. Move both black and Latino voters out of districts 1, 4, 5, and 7,
and simultaneously increase the percentage of right voters in those same districts.
The court finds that this is evidence, this evidence supports that race was the predominant
motivating factor behind the enacted map. How does your proposed map differ from that of the 22,
2022 map, which moved both Black and Latino voters out of districts, 1, 4, 5, and 7, which
is the north side of Crabic County.
Sure.
Fair question.
The map in 2022 created much more jagged lines here.
The 2022 map has this district 3, instead of following this little trace here, kind of
that jets down and back out, there's a whole lot more happening in the 2022 map that
is the court's sights in accomplishing what you're talking about.
What this seeks to do is rather than making massive shifts, where 36% of the county has
moved, this reduces that to 23%.
And it also focuses on compactness.
There's obviously not a big focus on compactness in the 2022 maps because those are in the courts
and we're sort of setting that aside with respect to consideration.
I didn't want to get folks confused with three sets of maps.
Those maps are not a basis of comparison for us.
Those are things that we, well, they were useful for us to understand what not to do.
That's why you see what you see here.
What you see is you see a very, you see much more subtle changes here in three.
In fact, when you talk about moving people out of District 3,
the total shift of citizens out of in and out of District 3 is around 3,000 people.
It's a very, very tight move.
You can even see in District 2 here, relatively modest shift.
shift. This is Dobbins Air Force Base. This is a lot of land, but this is not a lot of people
in this area. It's heavily populated in this edge. This is Dobbins. So this shift, you
see much more subtle shifts in this map, specific for that reason.
I appreciate that, Senator, but the judge specifically said that districts 1457, which you
did not mention in your answer right now, were the districts where both Black and Latino
the voters were moved out.
So I'm just asking, if she threw out that map,
how does this map comply?
And we were both in special session just a few weeks ago.
And one of the things that the sponsor of the previous maps
pointed out were the black districts that were drawn
and where they were drawn.
I'm just asking, the judge pointed out district.
Where minimal changes were made, I'm asking where were changes made?
Yeah. Well, I'm going to show you an example. I don't, I want to be respectful of the chair's time. Let me show you some statistics.
What, what you see here is on your screen to your left, this is a matrix of total changes across districts.
Okay. It's summarized and then it is, we see the, the breakout, exact amounts and then percentages.
So what you see here is in the 2022 maps that were frowned upon by the courts for this
statistic here, this is any part black, so this is black.
This is black who also identifies as Hispanic.
You see a retention of 71% of the African American population in Copenhagen stayed in place
which means 29 percent shifted. That's what she's talking about when she makes her order.
What you see now is the retention in this map goes from 71 percent to 84 percent. So you
see a significant, if 29 percent of African Americans were being moved in the 2022 map,
you see in this map just over 16 percent. So a significant drop in African Americans
being moved around the map. And this is broken down by precinct. And that was a very important
part of this. You can, in fact, if you look at the, in this, it's, it's much richer here.
Look, any part black. Any part black was 71% and in what was, I mean, that means 29% of people
percent of people in the 2022 map that was struck down in court were moved around.
In this case, in contrast to 29 percent of any part black moving, again, it's just under
84, so it's 16 percent.
So we moved from moving 29 percent of African Americans in the county in 2022 in the map
that was passed, that was struck down by the courts.
We reduced that to 16 percent.
We were laser focused on that issue to be compliant in every way possible good.
It can't be zero, but we've reduced it from 29 to 16.
One last question, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, Senator, I won't pick through that answer.
I'll move to the last point, which is that the judge raised concerns that the map was
not brought through the local legislative process.
This is a general bill, which is your prerogative.
There were concerns that were voiced by both Republicans and Democrats yesterday, about
three key points.
One was McEachron High School being split from Powder Springs, the splitting of Smirner,
and how Smirner was split in your map.
And then how we were in Walton, feeder patterns were drawn in your map.
Again, those were concerns that were voiced by Democrats and Republicans.
How have you worked to address those concerns, particularly because that's how the local legislative
process typically works.
You get whoever is part of that delegation together to work through issues and everyone
generally agrees.
Given that feedback from bipartisan colleagues, what have you done to change your map?
Let me answer the rootier question, which is the use of school attendant zones as a central
feature for drawing maps.
If we were drawing a map from scratch that wasn't subject to a court order that says we have
to maintain certain priorities of not moving things around, we might have drawn a map that
was more tied to school attendant zones.
One could say that the 2022 map was even more attentive to those kinds of things, maybe
not in one area, but certainly in others.
Because we're in a place where the judge was very prescriptive about the things we had
to address, to address the very serious charge of moving black people around and other
minorities around in ways that was seen as unacceptable by the judge, we had to address
those issues front and center.
We couldn't take secondary and tertiary criteria, which are meaningful, but not essential.
We focused on the essentials in this map.
That's why I was sharing that with you.
example of that when you look right here, this map shows spray berry high school, okay?
Spray berry high school located right here across the street from spray berry high school
and other district starts.
So the spray berry attendant zone, which is right here where my cursor is showing, is split
in half by this map, okay?
If you go here, Kennesaw Mountain High School, where my son went to school.
Kennesaw Mountain High School is right on the scene between District 7 and District 1.
This Kennesaw Attendant Zone is split and carved up by this map.
I mean, Kennesaw Mountain High School students will have two school board members.
They won't have four, but it's split right along that line.
Likewise, as you go to the south, you raise the question of McEachron High School.
McEachron High School is not right on the line.
McEachron High School is in this Attendant Zone.
McEachron High School, much like many of the other high schools, has their school Attendant
Zone split among two districts.
It was raised yesterday in the discussion, but if you look across this plan, you have
Campbell High School right here, right on the line.
You've got Osborne High School, yeah, you have Osborne's right here.
Pretty central within the new tube, but in the old line it was split.
So Wheeler High School, just north of this line, our goal was to make sure that high schools
hadn't where we could have no more than two school board members we didn't want
for your four but the idea that we we can contain an entire school attendance
entrance is not realistic given the order of the judge
thank you senator sessler in the interest of time i'm going to ask you to
recede and i'm going to call on a couple of these folks that have signed up to
speak i'm going to try to limit them to two or three minutes the uh
first person that looks looks like his uh
send the battles, send the battles in the room.
If you would miss battles, come in,
tell us who you represent.
What do we do?
Mr. Chairman, let me just shrink this down
so we can have it visible and that will yield.
Good afternoon, members of the committee, my name is Cindy Battles, and I am the policy
director for the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today.
I want to talk a little bit.
First of all about the process, because Senator Settler keeps saying that the deadlines
don't work, but the deadlines work if we go through the regular process, the way that
this is supposed to go through.
If it went through the local process, the way that many of the local bills went through
when they were redistricting during the special session last year, these deadlines would
in fact work.
Senator Settler was asked yesterday by Republicans and Democrats if he and Representative
Inuloids could work together to create a map that was agreeable to everyone and Senator
Settler made it really clear that he was going to continue this process.
What that means for our members that live in Cobb County is that they are not being given
equal access to the democratic process.
they have elected representatives and senators who will come together and work for them and
with them to create school board districts and local districts and that type of thing.
I have not had a chance to analyze the bill the way I wish I had, but this is the map
that the judge disagrees with and when I look at that and I look at this, my question is
what analysis has been done or who did that analysis to guarantee that this map actually
does meet Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because a judge, regardless of what anyone
in this room thinks about the process or the organizations who brought this forward
for the voters of Cobb County, the judge said that this violates the constitutional rights
of the people of Cobb County.
And if you haven't made significant changes to that, then there's a problem.
Given that the fact that the senators is here, I'd love to use the process to ask,
What functional analysis has been done?
Do we have an analysis that his proposal does meet?
Because what's going to end up happening
if we get whatever process we go through,
if it doesn't meet second to the voting rights act,
we're going to be here for another special session.
And my other question would be who drew this map?
Because he keeps saying we worked really hard.
But I know on Monday, we didn't even have an LC for this bill.
The LCRO, when we went and asked for the information
in the shapefile for Senator Settler's map, didn't have it.
So I have significant questions about the way this is done.
I have real concerns about the fact that,
and I appreciate Senator S. DeVez bringing this up,
Republicans and Democrats of the Cobb County Delegation
have raised objections to the way that this is going.
So I'm going to ask this committee to not move this forward
and let it go through the local resolution
in the way that it should go,
so that the voters of Cobb County
are represented by the folks that they sent up here
to represent them.
Thank you for your comments, Ms. Battles.
Next is, it looks like Michael Garza, is that correct?
Yes, that's correct, thank you.
Who do you represent, Michael?
Okay, my name is Michael Garza.
I'm a, I don't represent an organization,
I'm just here, I'm a resident of Cobb County
for over 20 years.
I have a daughter who's the first grader
that goes to Copcany Schools.
This is my daughter.
She's going to be governed by this map
until she's in high school.
I'm also here as a member of the Latino community,
community whose constitutional rights were violated
with the 2022 map.
And who is looking to have those rights restored
with this new map.
Now, I don't want to get into talking
about too much about Senator's map.
But I did notice that he mentioned
that the movement of black and Latino voters,
but even with this map, I noticed the figure 74%,
which means 26% of Hispanic voters were moved in this map.
Now, our school district has, it's a complex district.
We have a lot of challenges.
We have great educators.
My daughter goes to a great school,
but we do have some challenges.
We have partisan leadership.
We have leadership that silences the voices of students,
particularly students of color.
We've even had an issue of officials
who have spied on students,
who have come to speak at public comment.
And so I'm not here to ask you all to solve these issues
because you're not really equipped to do so.
They talked about the Wheeler feeder patterns.
I don't know if I asked any of you to tell me
about the Wheeler Magnet program that any of you could tell me about that because most
of you live hundreds of miles away from Cobb County.
But I am asking you to allow us to have a voice in being able to solve these issues by
being able to fairly elect leaders at the local level.
And in this particular bill, there are three senators attached to it and they all represent
that northern half of the county, that half of the county,
which was specified in the judge's order
as being where they bleached the voters
in making those districts wider and wider.
So yesterday I was in the county delegation meeting.
Members of the both parties talked about coming together
to support a bipartisan map.
They asked point blank the senator if he would support that
by by partisan measure and he declined.
So I'm asking for this body to just hold the process
to allow for the delegation to come together
and to hash out these issues.
And because I think that to have three senators
decide our map from a very small part of the county
is not how it should work.
Those voters in South Cobb need to have a voice.
those voters in West Cobb, in East Cobb, in Smirna,
I need to have a voice, and they're not gonna have a voice
if this map proceeds through this process.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Garza.
Our next up is Jennifer Susco.
If you would, please tell how you represent.
My name is Jennifer Susco, and I am a post six resident,
I'm not representing anybody, but myself.
I went to all Cobb County schools.
So I said I am in Cobb County School Board Post 6.
I think that's where I live.
I'd really like to know for sure though.
But some are drawing out this process even longer
so that voters in Cobb County remain uninformed
and Black and Brown voters continue
to be denied constitutional voting rights.
So I'm here to ask you to oppose the bill
because of the incorrect process it's following again
and instead allow local legislators to work together
how they should have the first time around.
It's incredibly frustrating that we seem to be back
where we started rushing a bill through this way
even after a federal judge has made a clear order
about the problems with this process.
Our white school board chair excluded and lied
to the black board members to collaborate with some
to create maps that have now been proven
by a federal court to be racist,
by which I mean white people limiting the voting rights
of black and brown voters.
And somehow, though there's an order from a judge
to move through local delegation,
it seems the author of the bill is intent
on going down the exact same path forcing this process.
He doesn't consider the judges ruling to be official,
case law, et cetera.
My understanding is that he's wrong on the law
and the map will be thrown out again.
I'm sure Judge Ross will not be pleased
that colleagues and others have said,
Hey there, you're doing it wrong again,
especially when her order makes the remedy clear
and this bill seems to intentionally go against it.
The Cobb County community deserves to know
who represents us and who is qualified to run for office.
We had to sit through the Earhart's first failed attempt
at this and we shouldn't have to go through it again
now with yet another problematic map.
I know that what I'm saying will not likely stop
the stonewalling by the author of this bill
when colleagues offer fair ways to collaborate,
but I would like to have it on the record
that there have been warnings about knowingly going
against Judge Ross's order and that the Cobb County
community is exhausted by the political games
played by those terrified of losing power.
Thank you to those of you trying to offer our community
the leadership we deserve and who understand
that this is an urgent matter for Cobb County voters.
I'm particularly grateful to those of you who understand
the depth of meaning behind these decisions
you're in charge of when Black and Brown voters
are disenfranchised.
So thank you for allowing the judges order
to encourage local collaboration
and to repair harm from disenfranchisement
by opposing this bill.
Thank you.
Yeah, excuse me.
Ms. Susco, would you answer a question
for one of the committee members?
Oh, I didn't know that was part of it.
Yeah.
They don't do this on the school board.
They don't interact with us.
Yeah, we interact here.
Okay.
the chair allows it.
You have to chair now.
In this case, we're going to let our whip do that.
I'm curious, you used the word that always
perks up my ears.
Is it racist?
Yeah, the judge said this in the order.
No, no, I said that.
And then I said by which I mean white people limiting the voting
rights of black and brown voters.
OK, well, that's just a word that gets overused a lot.
That's why I said what I wanted.
If you let me finish, please.
If you let me finish.
So it's a word that gets overused in here.
the word has an actual meaning.
I'm well aware of it.
As am I.
And so when you said it and we're talking about
the judge's order and this kind of thing,
I was wanting to know, I was going to ask
for a reference into the judge's order.
But the judge did not use the term racist.
Is that correct?
I don't know.
Okay, you answered my question.
Thank you.
Sure.
Last on our list is Gabriel Sanchez, I believe.
And who do you represent, Mr. Sanchez?
Who's myself?
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Gabriel Sanchez.
I am a candidate, I'm a Democratic candidate
for Say House 42 in Sumerna,
I'm Ariadne in Cumberland,
and I'm here today as a cobb resident,
someone who's born and raised in cobb
and an alumni of cobb schools,
as well as a lot of younger cousins
who currently go to cobb schools.
You know, I really am concerned about these maps
and I'm actually, before I ran for office,
I've actually worked in redistricting advocacy work
since 2021.
So I've been pretty involved in the process
of the last three years.
And I just want to say, here we are again.
Two years later, almost every single district in Cobb County
except for the municipal districts
are ruled on constitutional and have to be changed.
Nearly all of those maps were drawn
by the Republicans in this body.
So this is a problem of your own making.
We are here because of the maps that you all drew two years

You were warned over and over again that these maps
not good, yet steam rolled ahead by passing the typical process always done for local legislation
by not following the majority of the cop delegation and steam rolling your bill ahead.
So why should we trust the people who made the maps that led us here to draw the new maps again?
This is the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and thinking we're
going to have a different result. Because once again we're bypassing the cop delegation to steam
rolled this map through because it benefits the Republicans.
I would love to give more numbers and analysis on this, but unfortunately due to the secrecy
of this process, I'm not able to give you that information.
But based on the track record, I don't have a lot of trust that this is actually going
in a good way.
To me, if there wasn't really a problem with this map, I'm not sure why it's the author
now willing to work with others to compromise.
If there was no problems with the map, I feel like they would be more open to compromising
and working together to make a map, but instead you seem really intent on pushing this map
for some reason.
This is why I believe we need independent redistricting commissions because clearly this
body is not able to draw their own maps without having to go to litigation every single year
and waste taxpayer money and waste all of our time because we're in 2024 and we're still
dealing with redistricting.
This is a shame, this show is just how ridiculous this body is and how unable you are to actually
draw fair maps for the people of Georgia.
So I plead with you, plead with you.
Let's do the process right this time and put Cobb County residents first.
Not y'all's party, not your own power.
The people of Cobb County first to make fair maps that align with the court order.
I would appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
At this time, I'll ask the senator to come back up because he's asked for a hearing
on this bill and trying to comply with the judge's orders and as much as we could, what's
your desire Senator?
Mr. Chairman, if it please the committee, I'd love to have a motion do pass an act on
this today.
I'm glad to address some of the questions that were raised by the people that testified
or how we just leave it to the chair.
In a quick blitz through that, it's very quick blitz, Mr. Chairman.
The judge set the timeline.
We did not.
We're not rushing this process.
were simply trying to comply with the court order that said January 10th and now it's January
22nd.
We don't ignore that.
It was a substantive court part of the judge's order and we're operating on that timeline.
Myself, Senator Cropatric and Senator Albers all support acting on this.
Member of the Cobb delegation yesterday that raised the question was a House member who
declared herself that the adult in the room and to said their needs to, in her opinion,
needs to be more dialogue.
After two and a half hours of meetings,
myself, Senator Krupatrick and Senator Albers
are both resolute.
We've put an extraordinary amount of homework into this.
I consider all night and walk through analysis
and data and numbers, how we forensically peace by peace
by peace complied with the judges
order in developing this map.
And just lastly, the falsehood that we're somehow
going around the process. Our process in the Senate is very clear. It's very clear. If
you have a majority of, for example, if you have four legislators that sign the map,
it goes to the uncontested bills and resolutions calendar. If you don't have four, it goes to
this committee process we're facing today. The premise, the recite stepping this process
is falsehood.
It's being flamboyantly shared here by people
in this committee hearing.
Perhaps, I don't want to speculate, perhaps.
There was some clarity about our internal process
within the legislature for how bills are moved,
but with respect to the Senate,
we are following the process.
And I appreciate the chairman's scheduling hearing,
and I think, again, on behalf of myself,
Senator Kropactrick and Senator Albers,
who are resolutely in support of the homework
that's gone into this bill.
I would ask for your favorable considerations, Chair.
I appreciate your request.
One of the things that your request is a little bit late
in the fact that we advertise this as a hearing for this bill
said we didn't advertise it as the bill
that we were going to have a vote on the bill.
I don't like to confuse the public
and because we're not going to make the order of the judge
to meet that timeline, the hope that you can allow us
to hold us and we'll bring it up to our next committee meeting.
You know, I'll be glad to schedule that as quickly as you and I can get together on
timing on that.
I know that Senator Mallow, you have a question.
Chairman, thank you, but I would be happy to yield to the majority whip, it seems that
he was eager to go.
Well, he's always eager to go and it is getting closer to our time to go.
it's the glasses. Senator, I'm concerned and it was brought up on a couple of occasions
about the analysis that was used to come up with these maps. So is there an explanation
or a roadmap that you can provide to us prior to a committee where we may vote on this
or not vote on it so that all committee members could understand exactly what process
was used to determine population and to all of the factors that we normally use when
maps are created in this building using the resources that we have.
Happy to, Mr. Whip, love to do it in an open process like this.
There's been a suggestion by other members that we peel off and sort of huddle in a room
and discuss map options.
I don't want to do, I don't want X part A meetings where we're meeting and I want to
do it out in the open.
We had two open meetings about this.
It was raised by members of our delegation.
Why aren't we getting together in meeting on this?
We met for more than an hour on Monday.
We met for more than an hour and a half yesterday.
Discussed this map in great detail.
I'll stay as late tonight as anyone wants to stay
and walk through these numbers.
You won't see me being here with you.
So I'm sitting there.
And again, but very briefly, we have the compactness numbers
here, four criteria.
We applied four criteria compactness.
We've got the voting blocks we maintain,
we've got the core retention numbers
that I've got in this matrix.
Well, and my point is, there's a science to this.
And I think everything should be on the table.
And so not saying that you did not follow the science,
but I do think the science has to be a part of the discussion
so that we ensure that it is transparent
and that nobody on this committee is confused
as to what science was.
You betcha.
Well, it seems that after yielding he wants to come back again, so Senator Mallow, if you
want to address the question, I'll be glad to take it, but let's be quick.
Well, listen, coming up by 16 is not as fast, but I yielded to the majority of the world
because I knew where he was going to go, and I wanted to close with these comments,
Mr. Chairman, in Chatham County we have a evenly split delegation and we had the same
issue with maps but we didn't have to go through a general bill process and the reason
is as we did go into a room and Derek Mallow and Representative Jesse Petri could find
some commonalities and some common grind and I think that could happen but that requires
the political courage and the fortitude to set aside what you come in a meeting with
so that we can find a way to find that common ground.
And it requires hearing both sides.
And if you both are angry when you leave a meeting,
then that means the job is done.
But to be a member of a delegation,
and you come and hand someone a map without taking their feedback,
that doesn't quite always work so well.
And I think this body has the opportunity
to set an example that we can do that.
And we should try to do that as often as we can,
Mr. Chairman.
And so with that, I would hope by this time
and our next committee meeting that the other three senators that represent Cobb could
have some agreement and consensus on this situation and it could be on the consent calendar.
Senator Mallow, your wisdom is so appreciated and thank you for your comments.
At this time, we're not going to take a vote on the bill, we'll be glad to work with
you on scheduling the vote on the bill, I do agree that it is one of those things that
I think our committee members would like to see a little bit more information and be
glad to work with your own passage of your bill.
With no further other business, we stand adjourned.
Thank you very much for your attendance.
You
