thank you all. All right Well good morning, all members, if you'll come to the chamber, all members come to the chamber. Now we're convening having arrived, all members will please come to the chamber and take your seats. Mr. Clark will you ring the bell. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clark will you unlock the machines? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clark, will you lock the machine? Doorkeepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning is brought to us by the lady from the 92nd House District, Representative Ronda Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I am here to introduce to you the Prelude of the 60 Piscopal District for the African Methodist Piscopal Church. Bishop Mitchell is a lifelong member of the African Methodist Piscopal Church and he was raised in Jacksonville, Florida and answered his call to the ministry at the age of 17. He graduated from Wilberforce University in 1982 and he received a Master of Divinity degree right here from Turner to theological seminary and he as a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was September 1992. Bishop Mitchell was chosen to succeed. Bishop Robert Webster as Pastor of St. Sevens, A.M. Church in Jacksonville, Florida, where he served faithfully for 24 years. Before being elected as a 134th consecrated bishop of the African Methodist Piscopal Church. Bishop Mitchell is married to Supervisor Cordelia Mitchell and they have two daughters, Courtney and Channing. I am not going to read all of this because it will be intense. But I do want to share that on August 28, 2004, at the 52nd Quadrino session of the African Methodist Piscopal Church General Conference, Bishop Mitchell was assigned by the Episcopal Community to the 6 Episcopal District. Bishop Mitchell and Supervisor Mitchell believed that they have been called to serve this present age. Their ministry is based on the words of Jesus who declared, I have not come to be served but rather to serve. Before I introduce, I would like to recognize our Supervisor Cordelia Mitchell and I want to let you know that she is a lifetime member also of the A.M. Church and she is a graduate of Spelman College and she is a member of Alpha Alpha. So without further delay, Supervisor just stand and be recognized. Without further delay, I present to you Bishop Michael Mitchell. Thank you so very much Representative Taylor and certainly to our speaker of the House of Representative Burns and to all of the House Committed Chairs and all who comprise this chamber of the Georgia House of Representative. It is with great joy that I am able to greet you on this day, the day that the good Lord has made. Bless again to be able to have my part in ministry marriage, Cordelia Mitchell with me along with the entire or some of the entire constituency of the 60 Piscopal District of the African Methodist Piscopal Church. From this cross the state of Georgia representing over 480 churches, I am grateful for all of the clergy who have joined us today. As a speaker and members of this chamber, as we gather today, have you ever wondered why you are here? Have you ever wondered why your constituency elected you to represent them? Have you ever wondered if you were just elected to be a part of the crowd or if you were elected to make a positive difference by the decisions that you make? Can I tell you in the short time that I have, I believe that you were chosen, that you were elected in order to be able to make a positive difference in this world and in the lives of people. There is a familiar story found in Luke 10.

Many of us, if not all of us, have read it or heard about it. It's the story of the good Samaritan. In short, order, the story talks about a lawyer who approached Jesus and wanted to know what he needed to do in order that he might be able to inherit eternal life. But Jesus saying that this lawyer was intentionally trying to cause conflict responded, you are a Pharisee. You know what the law says. What does the law say about inheritance of eternal life? The lawyer responded, thou shalt love the Lord that God with all that heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Jesus said, good, you are right. Do that and thou shalt live. But to keep himself from being overshadowed or outdone by this classical answer of Jesus, the lawyer backtracking said, now Jesus, will you pause long enough to tell me who is my neighbor? What God line or criteria should I go by or use in order to find out who my neighbor really is? Jesus began by saying a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. And can I tell you today that the role to Jericho reaches throughout the state of Georgia? The story says that as he went, he fell among thieves. Look at what they did to him. They robbed him. Took all of his money. Beat him up, stripped him of all of his clothes and left him in the ditch for dead. Listen to what the story says. As he lay there, there came a member of the Georgia House of Representatives and heard the brother groaning in the ditch. And he passed by on the other side. Then the story says there came by another member of the Georgia House of Representatives and he also heard the man groaning in the ditch. And he too passed by on the other side. Can I tell you today that the other side does a side that you don't have to worry about being lonely on? That's the side that you can always find somebody. That's the side that's the side of no obligation. That's the side of no responsibility. That's the side of no accountability. That's the side that really requires no service. But I'm glad today that the story does not end there. But the story says there came along another member of the Georgia House of Representatives who also saw the man in the ditch. He wasn't concerned about his party affiliation. But this member of the house realized that he was elected to do and went out of his way to help this man who had been robbed. This man who had been stripped. This man who had been wounded by thieves and left for dead on the side of the road. He didn't report it to the speaker of the house or any other special committee of the house. But rather he helped himself. I mean, he recognized that he was elected and chosen to make a difference. So members of the house, will you make a positive difference in the decisions that you make in this chamber? In all situations regardless of political ideology, personal preference or influences from the voices and high places, the plan of humanity set forth by our sovereign God prevails. And we must all seek His guidance in submission. Great leaders throughout history have struggled to remain steadfast and resolve that those called to serve do not exist to be served by those over which they have been charged. Remember my sisters and my brothers that you have been chosen to make a difference. Can we still? Can we stand and pray? Gracious and kind God. We thank you for this day. We thank you for the privilege of being able to call upon thy name. Thank you for these representatives who have been elected to make a difference in their lives of people and to be able to serve well. God, I pray that you will cause all of us to never lose sight of who you are in the plan which you have for our lives. I pray that you will bless this house in their endeavors and everything that they do. Those who have asked us to remember them in prayer, touch right now. Pray, God, that you will lift up those who are sick, those who are afflicted today. But most of all, we pray that you will move not just here in the state of Georgia, but throughout this world and allow your will to be done. Here I pray, O Lord, and grant us your peace. The name of Jesus, we pray, amen. Now let us do a pledge of allegiance. A pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation in the liberty, liberty and justice for all. Thank you. We appreciate that. You got to come back. All right. Thank you, Bishop Mitchell. Thank you for that message. Thank you. Thank you for your service to our state as well and all the churches you've ever seen. Thank you so much. Doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors. Members, you can join Bishop Mitchell in this south any room and thank you here for his service and being with us today. And also have a photo with him. Thank you. Thank you, Bishop Mitchell.

It gives me great pleasure this morning to introduce members of Georgia Farm Bureau here at Georgia Farm Bureau Day. A wonderful organization in each of your districts throughout our state and they represent agriculture and agribusiness all over the state in such a great way. And they are led as the Speaker said by a former longtime member of this chamber, Tom McCall, as President of Georgia Farm Bureau. And I'm going to turn this mic over to Tom. Thank you, Chairman Dickie and thank you, Speaker, for letting us have me and come back and talk to you all. But mostly thank you to each and every one of y'all for what you do for the largest industry in this state and protecting agriculture the way y'all do. Today, my first Vice President, Mr. Daniel Johnson is also a South Georgia Vice President and Ralph Carwell is your middle Georgia Vice President from Overland Hurd County. We have about 230,000,000 member families statewide that rolls into, if y'all counting votes, probably half a million, 600,000 votes. We're about agriculture, so we appreciate y'all recognizing that fact. And we have an office in 158 counties. So if you ever need anything, that's somebody you can talk to about agriculture. And I said when I left, when it comes to ag, remember WWTD, that's what would Tom do. Now I kind of do a WWRD when it comes to ag stuff for Chairman Dickie. But thank y'all very much. A lot of folks ask me do I miss this place. I say I miss my friends after walking through all of that out y'all in the hole. Again, I miss my friends. Thank y'all very much. At the depot, if y'all break, we wish you would come and eat because y'all have constituents down there. We appreciate everything y'all do. And personally, we appreciate it. Thank you, boss. Great job. Hey, those people, good to meet you. Tom McCall and all the members of Farm Bureau all across this state, when rural Georgia, cities and small communities and farms and families were at the lowest point of the devastation from the storms that we've experienced this year, a lot of people have stood up. But I know of no other group who's been there for their neighbors, whether their members are not, then the members and the people of Farm Bureau. And we're so proud to have Georgia Farm Bureau day here today. And Mr. Chairman Dickie, thank you for bringing this invite and members. Thank you for embracing all these folks that makes such a difference in our state and our quality of life, our agricultural community, but especially great advocates like Farm Bureau. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. President, we appreciate you and all of our South Georgia and North Georgia Presidents. Thank you for what y'all are doing. Thank you, members. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Representative Parrish's district is home to the home office of Georgia Farm Bureau. So we appreciate you're welcoming all of them there. So another group is a so important our state and our well-being in so many different ways are the tree farmers in Georgia. And they've been through some tough days as well. And I want to thank Chairman Hatchett, Governor Kamp in the Senate, and this House for supporting some relief and some help for our tree farmers, our forestry industry in our state. So so important to us. So with that, I'm going to let Chairman Parrish come speak. But first we're going to ask the clerk of your read the caption to House Resolution 21.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's great to be here when we honor our Ag community all across the State Farm Bureau and what a tough act to follow with Tom McCollop here. But we want to now recognize the tree farmer of the year. Russ Yomans is here. His family, the HG Yomans family, has been in the timber business for many many years. And down in our area there's a lot of pine trees around but there's not nearly as many as they were several weeks ago because of the storm that we had. It's been for a minute. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. But it's quite appropriate that we honor our tree farmers today because that's agriculture in our area and it's a big part of this state. And I want to thank this House for the speedy way that we have handled the budget. Mr. Chairman, on this side, to try to send it over to the other side so we can get some relief for these folks back home who need it. We have, as our guest today, Russ Yomans representing the Yomans family trust. It was tree farmer of the year. It's great to have Russ up here and so Russ, come over and say a word. I too am grateful to the House for getting the bill through. We are so thankful to you all for what you do and just glad to be a part of Georgia Forestry, number one forestry state in the nation. Russ, thank you personally to you and your family and your dad what a fine man Mr. H. She was and to your mom for carrying on that tradition. But you know, we all work hard here. It's about our future. These guys are putting investments in the ground for all of our benefit, not just from timber harvesting but from environmental purposes. It requires 15 to 20, 30, 40 years of investment and care. It's about our future. It's about the future of Georgia as we sustain that future. So thank you members for supporting forestry and supporting and being embraced. Our tree farmers enjoy Georgia. Thank you members. I appreciate your attention. Thanks members. I appreciate your attention. Guess what? You'll notice on your desk we have a rules calendar today. Wow. Boy chairman Parrish is hit the ground running hazard. Mr. Whip.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, you know as educators I'm used to having a captive audience, so hello everyone. All right so today I have the honor of highlighting the legacy of a trail blazing actress dancer and advocate who challenged racial stereotypes in Hollywood and beyond. Someone who, as a child, was the first person I learned shared my last name but wasn't a relative and six-year-old me was confused as this stranger danger is his auntie. Born in 1911 in Tampa, Florida, Thelma Butterfly McQueen was raised in Augusta, Georgia where she attended public school before graduating from high school in Long Island, New York. She initially pursued dance studying under legendary figures like Catherine Dunham, Jeff Free Holder and Janet Collins. She performed with the Venezuelan Jones Negro Youth Group and her signature butterfly nickname came not from her graceful arm movements but from her role in the Butterfly Ballet in a 1935 production of a Mitt Summers night stream. McQueen made her stage debut in Brown Sugar directed by George Abbott and soon transitioned into film. In 1939 she played Lulu, a shopgirl's assistant in the women before landing her most famous role as Pricy and Gone with the Wind. Despite the film success, she grew frustrated with the industry's limited and often demeaning roles once saying, I didn't mind being funny but I didn't like being stupid. Over the years she continued acting in films such as Flame of Barbary Coast and Mildred Pierce and was a regular on the radio and TV versions of Bula from 1947 to 1952. Beyond Hollywood McQueen lived a life of resilience and independence. She pursued education, earning a degree in political science from City College of New York in her 60s. She was also inducted into the Black filmmakers Hall of Fame and won an Emmy for her contributions to the arts. In 1980 she made headlines again when she successfully sued Greyhound Bus Lines after a security guard mistakenly assaulted her winning a $60,000 settlement. Choosing a modest life she retired to a small town outside of Gusto Georgia where she lived quietly. McQueen's legacy is one of talent, intellect and unwavering self-determination. She refused to be confined by the role society tried to place on her using her voice and career to challenge expectations and open doors for those who came after her. Her story reminds us all to stand firm in who we are to embrace our own journeys and to make sure our names are spoken with pride. So my name is Mikaia like the car McQueen like butterfly. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield the will. Thank you Representative. Representative Scofield is recognized for an afternoon order. Well good afternoon colleagues I was hoping that the members from the page desks would step in and that is Rita Laurie, Carolyn Marcy and I wanted everyone to know that it's sometimes just a little things that make a huge difference. So on your page sheet I had asked them at the beginning of the session if they would just add a slot in here for email. Most of the time we have the calling numbers but it's really more helpful if we were to have an email address for those that come in and page us. So I want to publicly thank them for acknowledging and putting that slot of email on this side and the Senate side to make our lives so much easier. Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker I yield the will. Thank you Representative. Representative Chaz Cannon. Representative DeKanna. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just want to let you all know that today is far three day at the Capitol. On your desk you'll see a new custom wooden name badge worked on a model eight all eight last night and also an invite for our legislative reception this afternoon at the depot. I would encourage you to bring someone with you to the depot this afternoon. A few quick facts about forestry in our state. Georgia is the number one forestry in the state and the nation. We have 22 million acres of commercially available private timber land more than any other state. With two out of every three rain drops falling on Georgia landing in our forest lands are forest are one of the most significant factors affecting our water quality and quantity. An estimated 47 Georgia counties are ranked as critically dependent very dependent or moderately dependent on the forest products industry in terms of employment. The forestry industry provides over 41 billion in overall annual economic impact to our state. The forestry industry provides over 143,000 jobs and indirect and direct employment in Georgia. The forest land in our state suffered near catastrophic losses during Hurricane Helene. Many forest families lost thousands of acres of 30 year old trees and many will have to start completely over with very little to show for the past 30 to 40 years of investment. You will see some legislation pertaining to some of our farm and forestry industry this session. I urge you to support it. These folks the backbone of our of rural Georgia and our agricultural industry. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the whale. For our yesterday you got a few pine trees yourself I think. Good stuff appreciate your afternoon order. Representative Martinez and friend. Representative Donna Tucci recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Mr. Speaker as you always say it's a great day to be a Georgia. But it's also a good day to be an American. Mr. Speaker last week our great president Donna Trump signed no men and women's sports executive order into law. You were there Mr. Speaker to witness this historic event surrounded by girls and women athletes from all walks of life. President Trump said the war on women's sports is over. Any school receiving taxpayer dollars and letting men take over women's teams or dressing in their locker rooms will be investigated for title nine and lose federal funds. Two days after that Mr. Speaker the NCAA announces new policy prohibiting male athletes from participating in women's sports competition reversing a prior policy under the previous administration. For that reason Mr. Speaker it's a great day to be a Georgia thank you.
