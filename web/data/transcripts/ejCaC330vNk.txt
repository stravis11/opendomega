And the public on best practices to implement when interacting with law enforcement officers. This bill ever referred to committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Mom to hand to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I rise today to start a conversation to offer a solution and to take a first step to resolve this issue of law enforcement and ranch to recognize the initial steps to a real resolution to these issues. Starts with a proper education and law enforcement interaction. That's right. It starts with education as do many things in our communities and our society. It's understanding the underlying motives, in fact, and things that affect us every single day. I rise today because on March 9th of 2018, at 1 a.m. in the morning, a young lady was driving home after a night out in Cobb County. She was pulled over. Now, this young lady, she was panicked as many of us who were sitting right here in this chamber. She looks around. She sees the blue lights flashing in the rear view mirror. As a man approaches her vehicle and asks her for her information, it becomes more and more evident. That this was not a law enforcement officer. But instead a sexual predator and a police impersonator. This young lady was sexually assaulted and the perpetrator left the scene in a hurry. Four short hours later, he then went on to sexually assault another female driver, yet again impersonating a law enforcement officer. Let me tell you, I think there's been a lot of time come what this bill does and what it doesn't do. Let me start by saying this. The bill 115 on line 14 requests that the Department of Public Safety work in collaboration with our friends at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center to develop a curriculum to educate drivers on the best practices to implement one interacting with law enforcement and to roll this curriculum into all driver education programs that already exist under the law today. It dictates that it should teach new drivers to understand what they should do if they start to be pulled over by a police officer. It would teach our young women and men to pull over in a well lit and populated area. A nice, rightly lit gas station where it's safe. But they can identify folks. And if they are not certain to con name one one, to ensure that the person that's pulling them over is a real law enforcement officer and not a potential predator, it will teach our drivers common sense principles. Like when you get pulled over, turn on your own light, roll down your window, put your hands on the wheel and lower the temperature when officer comes up to your car. Senate bill 115 will educate our drivers on why officers ask the question they ask. And we have to remember that these are children. These are children.

They don't understand how to park or what a yellow line means in a roadway. They're looking for simple explanations on what they need to do. It's going to express the danger and the challenges that our friends and the law enforcement community take every single day when they interact with our communities. And we'll reinforce the fact that every traffic stop is different. It's been about 115 years further. And I think this is the balancing point. This is what we have to remember when we educate our young people. It recognizes this bill recognizes the fact that we have to develop expectations for after conduct. That's right. But these students have to know, hey, what do you need to expect from this? That officer pulls up to you window and times to you. And it's going to empower Georgeans with a knowledge to protect their constitutional rights during a traffic stop. That includes the freedom of speech, searches and seizures, and self-incrimination as well as a clear understanding of how to report unprofessional unsafe behaviors exhibited by those law enforcement professionals. Since it has been 115 years forward to also help our friends and law enforcement in our counties to protect our school zones. And that was a measure that overwhelmingly passed this house earlier this year. But make no mistake. The sole purpose of Senate Bill 115 is to protect our families, our citizens, and our officers through education to teach them what those expectations should be. As a father or three children and two daughters, I would simply ask if you pass this step forward in the right direction to put our families, our communities, and their safety first. Will that Mr. Speaker idea the way out if there's no questions? You do have a lot of questions. I'll take a couple, Mr. Speaker. I give for a couple. I recognize as representative Wolenski in room 341 for a question. Thank you, Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that Section 2 of this bill was originally filed by me? The answer is yes. The answer is yes, sir. That's a half bill 240 out of it. Does the gentleman yield again? I do. Is it not true that every relationship is a two-way relationship? And we got to make sure that when one side is trained in communications, that both sides are trained in acting properly, and that benefits and makes it safe for everybody in Georgia. That's right. Education is the key to this cooperation. I appreciate the question. Do you further you? I'll take one more, Mr. Speaker. I recognize as chairman Knight to your right for a question. The gentleman yield in the well that you yield. Yes, sir. How do you yield? Is there anything special about the day other than sunny day? Well, if you have to ask today, yes, my birthday. All right. Happy birthday. Thank you, sir. Well, that, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. We've got a number of members that have signed up to speak. Chair recognizes representative Alexander to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The death of George Floyd. I'm going to ask you to give me a second. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The death of George Floyd at the hands of police last year was a wake-up call. For many Americans about the multitude of problems inherited in our modern day police and system. But it was day jivou for black Americans. Mr. Floyd's murder was also a reminder that past efforts to address problems with police and have failed repeatedly. It is against the backdrop of these realities, including the backdrop of the start of the trial of the police officer who murdered Mr. Floyd. That I am deeply troubled by the provisions in Senate Bill 115. If public safety is the goal, then this body must not pass Senate Bill 115. Senate Bill 115 may seem innocuous on this space. But when you really dig deep down into the bill, it is the real world implementation. The problems with Senate Bill 115 are glaring. It creates a new instruction of course designed to educate drivers on how to behave when interacting with law enforcement officers. The bill emphasizes on the behavior of drivers and the owners in places on ordinary civilians of Georgia to protect their own safety. Ships responsibility away from where it should lie, which is with the police. Another incredibly troubling provision of this bill is the fact that the remaining training course would be designed by and possibly given by law enforcement officers. There is a longstanding, ever-serial relationship between police and the communities they serve, especially communities of color. In a training course for civilians being designed and potentially administered by the very people who have contributed to the brokenness of the police system, we do nothing to address the lack of trust between police and people of color. Senate Bill 115 will do nothing to fix our nation's broken system of policing and stay in. Senate Bill 115 will likely contribute to the problems in our current system of policing. One thing this bill fails to address is the importance of ensuring that drivers and civilians are aware of their rights when they are stopped by police. Yes, I did try to get that amended when I was in the committee, and it failed. The training course established in Senate Bill 115 requires civilians to learn about the rights of officers, but it does not require civilians to know their own rights and interactions with police. This is horribly one-sided out of touch with reality and incredibly dangerous. When civilians do not know their own rights, it is more likely that their rights will be violated as we as a legislative body should be strongly against such a thing. Instead, us as a legislative body should support measures that assure civilians are fully abreast of their rights, especially when they are interacting with police. One of the most important rights of civilians when they are interacting with police to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is supposed to protect civilians from these encroachments, but law enforcement officers frequently disregard the protection of others. For example, once an individual exercises their rights to remain silent, officers were often in northeres and continued pepper in them with questions. Officers were conduct searches of cars and violation of people rights. Eventually, evidence occurred this way might be thrown out in court, but the damage to the civilian are at the outset the victim of police overreach remains. The expectation should not be that civilians take courses on the rights of police officers, it should be exactly the opposite. Because when civilians do not know their rights, they cannot protect themselves. They cannot easily advocate for themselves, and thus, it is more likely that their rights will be violated. Finally, a diverse coalition of over 35 social justice organizations have all voiced their opposition to Senate Bill 115. Because of the very reasons I have stated, in our urge this body to heed the concerns of these organizations, these organizations are subject matter experts on police civilian interactions, and the best practices for ensuring these interactions do not result in harm done to either the police officer or the civilian. We must fully take into account the concerns of these organizations over the individuals who may stand to benefit financially from the passage of this bill that creates an additional training course for drivers. Along with these organizations, I urge you all to vote no to Senate Bill 115 as currently written, because the government should always be in favor of teaching people their rights and ensuring that those rights are protected. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask that you vote no on this bill. Chair recognizes representative Erica Thomas to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Police need accountability, not absolution. We know that the policing system in this country is absolutely broken. And this bill is coming up on the week that Derek Chauvin, the man who killed George Floyd after putting his knee on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, starts his trial this week. How is this going to help fix the dish trust that divides and exists between communities of color and law enforcement? SB 115 provides instruction for drivers on the best practices for interacting with police. Essentially suggests that someone like Rayshard Brooks was responsible for his own death, not the officer who chased him down and murdered him. This bill fails to inform Georgians of their rights under the Georgia law and the U.S. Constitution when interacting with police. Rather than empower these drivers, this bill simply seeks to absolve law enforcement of their own responsibility. Recently, a Clayton County Sheriff Deputy pinned down and beat Rodrick Walker, a black man after a routine traffic stop. This bill makes it seem like the treatment of Rodrick received was somehow warranted. Dittating solutions and assigning blame to motorists is not a productive way to engage with our communities that have been on the receiving end of state-sponsored violence for generations. Senate Bill 115 ignores the root of this dangerous law enforcement and civilian interactions. This legislation wrongly places an on and is on the civilians to protect themselves from harm when interacting with law enforcement. This legislation wrongly suggests that police violence against the people of color, especially black men, result primary from bad behavior on the part of the detained and murdered. Instead, the focus should be on addressing racial profiling. I'm going to say that again. The focus should be on addressing racial profiling, the use of excessive force and other systemic issues that poison the interactions between law enforcement and the civilians. This is an unproductive way to connect with our communities that have a strained relationship with the police. It's dictating rather than finding common solutions to the public safety concerns, especially from communities of color. And today, I urge you to stand against this type of rhetoric and vote no on SB 115. I'm going to say that I'm not going to be a criminal. Chair, recognize his representative, when to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think all of us in this body, either as a child or as a parent, know that families are tasked with having the talk at some point in our lives. That talk, the birds and the bees, probably looks a little bit different for all of us. Maybe it's about consent or emotional readiness. Maybe it's about abstinence or disease and pregnancy prevention. But whatever it is, it's a pretty normal part of American family life. But there's another talk that not all of us have to give or hear. That other talk is reserved for black and brown families, and especially for black and brown families who have little boys who will soon be teenagers. My friends have shared with me the pain and grief they feel when they have to give that talk. Because what parent wants to tell their child, don't wear a hoodie. Don't put your hands inside your pocket. Don't run and put your hands up. And still, still, that might not save you. The reality is, even if citizens do all the right things, it doesn't guarantee that their lives won't be unjustly taken by the hands of law enforcement, especially if you are a black American. Police violence is the leading cause of death for black men. And if you are a black boy or man between the ages in 15 and 34, you are 10 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than anyone else. But if you are not black or brown, you can walk into a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and kill nine church members and be taken to Burger King on the way to jail. You can target three Asian businesses and kill eight people. And law enforcement will say, he had a bad day. You can storm the US Capitol with zip ties and Confederate flags. And law enforcement will take your hand and help you walk down the steps of the Capitol. But if you are black and brown, you can be a 26 year old emergency room tech, sleeping in your bed when you are in a black and white house. And if you are in a black and white house, you can be a 24 year old emergency room tech, sleeping in your bed when law enforcement botches the raid, shoots and kills you in your sleep and you are still playing like Breonna Taylor. You can be a 12 year old boy playing outside of the sandbox with a toy gun when you are shot in the torso and killed by law enforcement like Tamir Rice. You can be a 20 year old 120 pound Asian boy holding a pin and shot in the back three times by law enforcement. You can be a sitting state representative and knock on the door of the governor's office and get dragged away by law enforcement officers. Instead of passing legislation that requires more training on deescalation, cultural competency, accountability and transparency for law enforcement, we are passing legislation that puts the onus on the individual for staying alive. This legislation does not include the basic fundamental rights of citizens, especially when it comes to search and seizure. This bill sends the wrong message. It perpetuates the myth that civilians are the ones responsible for the way that law enforcement treats them. And it does nothing to address the longstanding distrust between law enforcement and communities of color. Right now the world is watching the trial of Derek Chauvin, the law enforcement officer who put his knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes in 29 seconds. And during those nine minutes in 29 seconds, George Floyd begged for his life. 27 times. Please, I can't, I can't breathe. Help. He cries out for his mom 27 times. And yesterday, a nine year old little girl had to take the stand and she testified about the officer. The ambulance had to push him off. They asked him nicely to get off him. And he still stayed on him. He was already dead. There's a saying that we use when we go to protest. Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot. Those are the pleas of black and brown Americans across this country. And SB 115 doesn't address any of that. We live in two Americas. And that is why I'm voting no against this bill. And I do ask you all we need to seriously reflect on this. Because if you have children and you don't have to give them the talk, you think about telling your 10 year old little boy next year when you look like a man, you might get shot and killed for going on a run. That is wrong. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered chair here's none the previous question is ordered. We have a minority report under the rules of the House 20 minutes for the minority report and then 20 minutes for the chairman's time chair recognizes representative Derek Jackson to speak to the minority report. Mr. Speaker, I stand here strongly opposing Senate bill 115. You heard the presenter of the bill. He said, quote, teach common sense. Let me just share a few minutes, Mr. Speaker, about common sense. I come from a family. Nothing but uniforms, military, law enforcement, firefighters. In my family, we did not need someone out of our household to teach us common sense. What to do when you encounter authority. No one. In fact, no Georgian right now is asking for Senate bill 115. No one is asking us this body to teach them common sense, especially when this body continue to use words simply as a bumper sticker. For those who say they are patriotic, spare me because you watch January 6th, the assault on this country that I served and you said nothing. So let me just share three words with you today. Honor, courage and commitment. It takes honor, ladies and gentlemen, to do what's right regardless if it's the day or night. Honor, honor to make sure that when you see wrong, it is still wrong. It is still wrong. You cannot take a lie and make it the truth. Courage always to do the right thing, even when your constituent is not looking, then commitment. Who you committed to. Who you committed to. You're definitely not committed to the word of God that we preach each and every day when we're in this body to pass a bill that you can't even be a good Samaritan. You're going to charge me in a felony if I give a homeless person within 150 feet of a precinct. I cannot be a good neighbor. So we're going to talk about common sense. We have rules, we have guidelines. For those who say they are about the Constitution, you attack the Constitution every time we pass up that's unconstitutional. Every time how you're going to pass a bill that goes against protesters, it is their Constitution to peacefully assemble. So Senate Bill 115 is talking about teaching citizens about the expectation when they encounter law enforcement, but your demonstration, your behavior is contrair. I've watched and I appreciate the speaker put me in the gallery because I watched this body, this machinery, how you twist arms, how you twist arms of your own party, how you talk about taking the rights of a constitutional officer, taking their rights because they did not do your will to do the wrong perpetuated by a lie. You talk about cheating in fraud where there's no evidence. You didn't even stand in the court, Republican and Democrat federal judges kicked it out of court, no evidence. Zero. You come before this well and this body and talk about how you talk about patriotism in the Constitution and you treat it like a bumper sticker. I say to all strongly opposed Senate Bill 115, honor, courage and commitment, honor, courage and commitment because one day, one day you all will have to answer your actions on this earth. Mr. Speaker, you the well. Chair recognizes representative Kenner to speak to the minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise in opposition to SB 115. I draw a lot of inspiration as I'm sure you do from our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln. One of the things I really admire about President Lincoln is his ability to evolve his thinking and his positions over time. He was until late in his presidency that he actually arrived to the position of being an abolitionist and abolishing slavery. Earlier in his presidency and in his life, he was actually very comfortable with keeping the institution of slavery in the South to preserve the union. He started listening, he started being influenced by other voices, other abolitionist voices, namely Frederick Douglass. Over many conversations and with time, he actually convinced President Lincoln that abolishment of chattel slavery was the route that this country needed to take. And then Abraham Lincoln, of course, passed the 13th of the Mimuth, which did in chattel slavery in our country. I too have evolved my thinking across the course of my life. At one time, I used to bulk at the idea of white privilege. I didn't think it was a thing. I completely dismissed it. I was like, come on, man, this is America, the land of equal opportunity. And if anyone, anyone had enough gumption, grit, self-determination, wanted to do the right thing and work hard enough, you could be, do anything that you wanted to be in this country because this is America. Of course, I conceded that there had been some dark days in our national past, the slavery, Jim Crow, and the disenfranchisement based on gender, ethnicity, etc. But I also believe that those days were well into our rearview mirror. We had fought a civil war. We had the ruling of Brown versus the Board of Education. We had passed the 13th, 14th, 15th of Mimits. We had marched on Washington. We had passed civil rights legislation. We brought women to the table with women's suffrage. We passed the American with Disabilities Act. We elected the black president. And now it's all fixed. We are all on equal footing. And after all, everybody has a struggle. Everybody's had challenges. Even Greg Kinnerd has felt the sting of discrimination being raised in an affluent area. But my family did not have a lot of means. And I was raised every day of my childhood in a trailer park. But I fought and clawed my way out of the trailer park with self-determination. And if I did it, anyone can do it. This is America. White privilege is a farce. I look back at that time and my thinking, then with embarrassment, shame, and my ignorance, my arrogance, I was deep within my own bubble. I actually have many bubbles. Being white is just the first layer of privilege that I possess. Being white, that's currency. But being white and male, that's double the currency. And then when you add to that being heterosexual, being Christian and...

this Bible-belt culture being able-bodied. I am swimming in privilege. I can navigate my life very easy with no obstruction because of my identities. But as advantage as a person born like me is, there are certainly liabilities, largely blindness. Privilege creates significant blind spots as to the experiences of others. As the dominant group, there's really no reason to look beyond your own personal experience. And life is fine for me. And you assume, and privilege assumes, that life is just fine for everybody else. I'll assume I credit, as ignorant and as visually impaired as I was, I did begin to listen better. I began to read books on this subject. I did a lot of reading, a lot of listening. Not just books that reinforced my own personal paradigm, my own bubble. And after a period of listening, reading more, reading more, listening, I began to eventually break out of my bubbles. A greater empathy began to emerge with my heart. And I took steps attempting to walk in somebody else's shoes and look through others lenses. I began to recognize that everyone does not share my lived experience. Bill Bollard says, opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another's world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self-kind of understanding. One of the conversations I began to have that expanded my understanding to other experiences was around the conversation of law enforcement, how people engage with the police. For someone like me, for someone like my parents, my grandparents, my wife, my children, all police engagement has been friendly and positive. And our take is the police are the good guys. Our friends, they are here to serve and protect. Whenever I've seen blue lights flashing my rear view mirror, I've never had any anxiety about that. I just said, oh shoot, how fast was I going? Or maybe I had a tag expired, or maybe there was a break life. But there's never been a sense of worry. And when the police pulled me over, I just simply rolled down my window and say, obviously how fast was I going? And I always get a smile. And the worst thing that could ever happen to me is to get a violation of ticket. But most of the time what happens to me is I get a smile and a friendly Mr. Kinner just slow down, be on your way, get your tag updated, and we go from there. But other conversations I began to have with friends of color shed light on a much different experience, a different dynamic with law enforcement. And this has been confirmed hundreds of times now. If I've talked to many people of color about their experience, and it began to hit me, that people of color have a very different story to tell. And then this story hit me personally, when three years ago, my daughter married an African-American man, and we became close friends with his family. They've been married three years, and my son-in-law is a straight arrow. He's straight, flies right, follows the law, is a rule, was a model student. They had my daughter, Chris, met in high school, and he was a model student, a model citizen. He went to the US Coast Guard Academy, and now he's an executive officer, protecting our coasts. But to hear them talk about the talk that's has been mentioned today, was just a very foreign experience to me, where there's a lot of worry, a lot of anxiety, especially when a young milk of color is pulled over. Now when Chris has his uniform on, he's reasonably safe. But when he puts on some civilian clothes and his behind the wheel, there's a whole different phenomenon, a potentially lethal phenomenon called driving while black. SB 115 lacks empathy. It lacks empathy. This is legislation created inside the identity bubble. If you look at all the sponsors and co-sponsors, they're all white, heterosexual, Christian, able-bodied men. When this bill came to motor vehicles, the committee on which I sit, members of color, and community advocates of color tried to talk to the group about the different perspectives, tried to make amendments to be inclusive of other citizen experiences. But they were shut down. Their voices were shut down. They were actually met with condensation, condescension. They were met with snarky comments, and that smacked a privilege. And I recognized that because I used to be there. I do believe that resources should be poured into training to improve better police engagement with citizens. But such training resources should be directed towards the paid professionals, law enforcement, training on community and race relations, mental health, de-escalation. SB 115 puts the onus on citizens, training citizens to interact with the police. This is a deflection and a misplacement of responsibility. Now I've been asked before, Greg, you seem to have some animus against white people and acts to grind against the white community. Do you even like white people, Greg? And I want to set the record straight today. I love white people. My wife is white. My children are white. I love me some white people. But what I don't like is unchecked white privilege and white superiority, the kind that is exclusive and doesn't include other voices and other perspectives. I think in our deliberations and in our decision-making, we have to be more open to other voices. SB 115 is one dimensional. And I'm asking you to vote along with me and vote no. One last thing, there's a spiritual teacher that's important to many of us in this room who said, you can't put new wine into an old wine skin because it will burst. It's too inflexible. It's too brittle. You have to put new wine into a new wine skin, which is soft, flexible, and has the ability to expand. Going forward, I think Georgia needs legislators that operate from a new wine skin. We're going to be better served with new wine skins, new ideas, new paradigms. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett for the Chairman's time, 20 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I rarely come to this well. But today I rise in support of Senate Bill 115. We passed this bill out of the Motor Vehicles Committee last week. When I call this meeting, and some of the members had other meetings go to, I said, come on, we should be finished. It shouldn't take long. Well, I was wrong. Once a good common sense piece of legislation got turned into a political issue, a political football. I've got an email telling me how this SB 115 discriminates against people of color. I sure hope the primary author of this bill, who we just mentioned earlier, his wife and kid didn't find out about this because they are people of color, the author of this bill. It was brought up. We had the wanted amendment put on this bill in committee. It got voted down. They wanted to teach the Constitution. But it was mentioned in the committee. If they want to bring a bill, if somebody wants to bring a bill to teach the Constitution better yet, a better idea. Let's make Georgia a constant Constitution state, where we protect all of the Constitution. I'm sure we can get a lot of support for that. I was in the third grade when our school integrated. Every day at recess, the white kids and black kids, we would fight at recess. You didn't know why, but we would fight. But after a few weeks, we became friends. And one of my best friends all the way through school were graduated with Eddie Richardson. We've had him here as a doctor of the day. My best friend, when we graduated high school, he was one of the ones we used to fight with every day. We quit concentrating on what divided us, we started looking at what we had in common, stuff that united us, and we become best friends. We had a preacher here earlier this year. I think Representative Meeks, up in the gallery, I think it was his pastor. His sermon basically said, if you get up every morning looking for something that offends you, guess what? You're going to find it. You will find something offends you if you get up looking for that. But if you get up looking for stuff that you have in common, look for the good in people, guess what? You're going to find that too. We got to start concentrating. Look for what you, Nights, is quick looking for stuff to make a political issue about. I urge you for favor, consideration for this bill. And I'll yield the rest of my time to Chairman Powell and Representative Mottahan. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell for the Chairman's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. And I sat back and I've listened to this. And I went to the Motor Vehicles Meeting last week. And I was never as shocked and surprised as I was. I'm pretty well used to after 30 something years are going to committee meetings. And I've seen certain issues that you could justify when it became hot butt niches. But I sat there in the meeting and I went there to amend that bill to put this piece on school safety. It's the second part of this bill on here. But as we got into the meeting, this turned into a full blown debate over race and over a lot of issues. And I understand that these are some very tedious times to say the very least in where we're living at today. You know, a lot of the cases that have been made and all of this. And I truly can understand some, but I understand other things when it comes to the process of this house and the legislative process. You need to pick your fights on things. And if it's not a fight in a bill that don't make something into a bill that doesn't need it. In this bill that you're looking at, the call of this bill, this says that the Department of Public Safety Training got at Gipstake that they would develop a plan and a program of teaching young adults under the driver training programs in this state. Certain criteria that could help these young people as they're developing in their sales did no how to react if they're stopped. And if you look at the language in here, I mean, it's wide open that it could be anything. They can talk about what law enforcement does when they stop somebody, but they could also teach the young adults how to react, which also would include their rights. They could also include their rights. And I have no doubt that's exactly what it will be done when they develop this plan. You know, at the committee meeting, we kept hearing about we demand that they talk about constitutional rights. Well, constitutional rights is something that I think everybody knows today. You know, unfortunately, in a lot of cases that some things don't go as well as could be prepared. And I understand I said this for years that law enforcement is a mixed bag a lot of times because of the stress and strain and the concern that they're under for their lives and for their safety. And I don't always agree that certain law enforcement, some law enforcement do things that are questionable. And generally in this day and time, they'll pay the price for that if that's so. But I heard a dialogue and the dialogue that I've heard up here has been a rehashing of several subject matters this year. I heard an impassioned speech, one of our members that was a baiting type of a speech, but I understand that. I understand politics, folks. But I gave a talk from this well a couple of weeks ago. It was something that I felt very concerned about. And that's about where we are as a state and as a nation and where we're going. And these things are being cured and people know what their constitutional rights are. But they also need to understand that as a young driver, when they get a driver's license, what to expect if they're pulled over. And if you look at the language in this, it goes into a lot of things about, you know, it goes into issues such as, you know, continuous citations of Mitchell violations, understanding and officers' discretion. You know, I remember once upon a time in this nation that when officers stopped you, you automatically had your driver's license in your hand. That was what all of us in my age group was taught. Plus, hopefully you could ask them to give you a warning instead of a citation. But then over the period of years as the safety of officers became more and more questionable than those that criteria, you know, a lot of times got out of hand. But one of the things that they do in law enforcement training today is they train dispute resolution. They try to train these officers about how to do things the right in the wrong way. And these are the things that we're moving to. But ladies and gentlemen, well, I know that I'm not changing the first vote out there. But this bill is not the vehicle to use to talk about your issues unless you're going to continue to make every issue in the legislature, something that needs to be drug into this effect. You know, we saw the bill last week. And you know, I set up front that on the issue of the working on the election system. And I said it in 2018, the buzz word was suppression in 2020. It was fraud. So if that didn't tell you anything, there was a problem that we needed to revamp the election system into fix it so that no matter what county you are from, whether you're from Bolton or Hart or to cab or Franklin, no matter where you are, was it the system was the same, no matter where you go. But this became an issue, became a terrible issue. And to this day, depending on who you are, we don't know who's telling the truth. We don't know who's read the bill. We don't know the interpretation. Well, that's just like this bill. This bill doesn't say anything that's discriminated or it only says that the Department of Training Safety, United Gypsies, that they will develop a problem to be implemented into the driver training programs to help young adults. And it doesn't say black adults, doesn't say white adults, it doesn't say Asian adults. It says for all of those who take a driver training course. So this should be a benefit to everybody across all racial lines, all genders. This is a good bill. I understand that this is created a certain amount of anxiety. And this is not the bill that anxiety should have been on. I would encourage everyone in here to vote in favor of this bill. There's two parts to it. One is that it tells the folks that are teaching driver education. This is some other criteria that you need to teach these young adults that are taking these courses. The other deals with school safety of slowing traffic down in schools zones. That's what it does, ladies and gentlemen. And I would certainly encourage you to take a good look at this bill. And then if there's other fights to be to pick the fights on the bill that it really matters to you, then with that I'll yield the will. Chair recognizes representative Mom to hand. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today we've heard a lot about a lot of topics that have nothing to do with this bill. And that's the facts of the matter folks. We've heard about voting. We've heard about topic after topic after topic. When I was in the committee, the discussion, I might want to include, as the chairman said, I'll constitute the rights as part of a driver's education class. I think we were saying the tag words of this year were suppression and pride. I think the phrase for this week may end up being, did you read the bill? Did you read the bill? All cops do for rights as part of a driver's education class. Had us not allowing soldiers use of one home or birthright citizenship, have anything to do with making sure that our partners in law enforcement and our citizens are on the same page when they interact. So drastically, what do any of these other topics matter in the context of a driver's education class, a class curriculum? What does it have to do with any other? The answer to that question, as the chairman made in his remarks, is that these are political traits that have nothing to do with the fact that there are real issues, real ones, that are daughters and sons, regardless of whether they are white or white or whether they're Persia, like me. That's right. You know, we talk about these things. The person who stands in the world in front of you today is a person of color. My father went to George State University. He got his PhD at Clark at Atlanta University. And for over 20 years, he worked on the street at Gravy Memorial Hospital. For he taught more high students, social work. Did you read the bill? The answer, I believe, is not. When I was in committee, I asked just simply, hey, what is the bill number that you put forward? Were the underlying language that would expand civic education in the state of Georgia? And there were silenets in the room. You know, we had many comments. We had one that said that this course would be taught by law enforcement. No. That's false. And did you read the bill? That this would create an additional driving force? No. Did you read the bill? This just recognizes the fact that we as a community have a responsibility to each other. People are mutual safety when it comes to traffic stops and law enforcement interaction. At the end of the day, think about this. Don't oppose a bill that simply allows for educating citizens on how to interact with law enforcement during a traffic stop. Do it for your daughters who don't know that they need to pull into a well-lit area. So that the same events that happened on March 9th to those two women that were sexually assaulted don't happen again. That's all this bill does. And with that, I ask for your favorable consideration. Mr. Speaker, I give the way. Any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote aye. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Jasmine Clark rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Parliamentary Inkry. Stayed your inquiry. Isn't it not true that this bill does not require law enforcement to teach civilians their constitutional rights and all the attempts to add that specific language were voted down by Republican committee members? I think the bill speaks for itself and every member can read the bill. What purpose does representative Prince rise? Mr. Speaker, in court, is with House Rule 133. I'll speak exempt from this. Parliament has that right and the journal will so reflect what purpose does representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary Inkry. Stayed your inquiry. Isn't it true that some of the Republican members of this House need to walk a mile in a black person's shoes? What purpose does representative Cannon rise? Parliamentary Inkry. Stayed your inquiry. Is it not true that this bill does not mandate that there be African Americans or people of color on this actual council so that people can hear from the experiences of people who know how it feels to be discriminated against, to be racially profiled and to be continuously assaulted by law enforcement? And that is a shame. I'm sure the lady feels that to be true. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of Senate Bill 115. The eyes are 98. The knees are 72. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes representative Gunter for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Chair recognizes representative Gunter to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the bill that we passed for the Judicial Legal Defense Fund. This bill creates a commission that's appointed by the Supreme Court Justice, Chief Justice, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker, and the Council of Spirit Court Judges. The amendments that the Senate made was that they put in language by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This commission does not spend any money. All it does is make recommendation to the Governor's office. The Governor's office completely controls the expenditure of money to, you know, the recommendation is to represent a judge. That's all the expenditure is. And for that, I'm asking that we go back to the amendment. House, and that's what this amendment will do. That was the only change that was made in the Senate.

If it should go to George Anteddin, relating to court, so is the required for an increase to minimum compensation for chief magistrates. Chair recognizes representative Skoggins to explain the Senate amendment and the House Amendment. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this would restore the bill back to its original version. House Bill 488 is a bill that leveled the play and fill with the magistrate judges and the other constitutional officers. This bill passed out of the House 154 to 7 and the amendment were just removing an unrelated issue to the magistrate judges. Is there any objection to the adoption of the House amendment? Is there objection, Chair, here's none, and the amendment has been adopted on the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate amendment to House Bill 488 as amended by this House.

They were all in agreement when we sent that bill over to the Senate amended and put an item on that bill that we actually have in a study committee that Chairman Parsons has appointed that 16 members agreed to study this issue but yet they put it in the bill.

Chair recognizes representative Ken Trail to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Speaker. While this is a bill that we passed out unanimously about three weeks ago and as much as I hate to admit it, the Senate actually made a couple of very minor improvements to this bill. They narrowed, they actually expanded the definition of the driver of the vehicle so that it wouldn't just be the person applying for the license plate but it would be anyone who expected to drive, was expected to drive the car. If you remember this bill allows a person at their option if they're going to have some communication challenges to put that information on their vehicle registration so that a law enforcement officer would be aware of that. In addition, it requires the applicant to sign an affidavit about the condition that they're claiming that an expected driver might have. Those are the only changes to the bill. Actually makes the bill quite a bit stronger and I ask for your favorable consideration. You have no questions. You're out of your well. On the gentleman's motion at the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 43, all those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines.

Chair recognizes or chairman Heath Clark for a motion. I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute to HB68. The gentleman Clark has moved that this House agree to the Senate substitute to HB68. Clerk will read the caption. House will 68, but if the gentleman Clark with 147 others to be entitled to amend code section 43, 14, 15, the official code of Georgia and attend to relating to certain military certifications that entitle persons to obtain certain professional licenses. Chair recognizes chairman Clark to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, House bill 68 went over to the Senate and came back as Senate bill 45 with some amendments. And so what Senate bill or House bill 68 now does is very similar to what we did last year with military spouses and professional license reciprocity. That's just establishes it for anybody that moves to our state and establishes residency within our state and their illegal resident that the boards will do a licensure by endorsement for them as well if they meet the provisions of being in good standing in the home state. They don't have any kind of, they're not under any kind of examination process if all the requirements in that state are significantly similar. And if there's any portion of the state exam that requires or the license that requires a specific state exam, they would have to take that portion of the exam as well. It does carve out denists and make sure that the medical professions which are not part of this bill, but it just has some language to reiterate that since they're part of interstate compacts. They did add another section to the bill back in 2018, the legislature, we passed some laws for the Georgia nursing board to collect some data to understand where the nurses are in the state. They added a provision for the relicencing to make sure that they get that data so that we can know where the workforce needs are specifically for rural Georgia to try to help make sure that there's enough nurses in rural Georgia to respond to pandemic situations. So that was a needed for workforce need. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker, and I will yield for any questions. Chair recognizes Chairman Hawkins, do you arrive for a question? Does Chairman Eale? I do, yes, sir. Is it not true that this bill House Bill 147, Senate Bill 45, we're not hurting subcommittee or committee in this house? Well they were hurt in subcommittee. We didn't take a vote in subcommittee and during that subcommittee, you specifically had some concerns with Dennis and gave me and stated in that subcommittee that you would support it if we could remove Dennis, make sure that Dennis were not part of the bill and they're not part of the bill. Does the gentleman yield again? I will. No, sir, I did not agree to that. I still have a problem with this bill. 45, Senate Bill 45 was not hurting committee. In online 41 testing are substantially similar. I don't know anybody that can divide substantially similar. Well we did that for military spouses last year that hasn't been a problem with that. I think that you could look through the requirements of a state I know specifically with you and some of your concerns with Dennis' board, even though they're not part of that, that they have some provisions for in their state that you could get a license without passing a state exam. In our state, you have to pass a state exam so that would not be substantially similar and the board would not recognize a state in those kind of situations and other professions because Dennis were specifically carved out. Does the gentleman yield again? Yes, sir. I just want to say that I'm still against the spell. I think it opens the door to people coming in this state for many other states that are not bringing jobs, they're bringing their own job. This is not a work building job for Georgia. This is just a move job from other moving bill for other folks from other states coming in this state. Well, we will just disagree. Like we've had those conversations before, but we just disagree. There are 250,000 people who moved to the state of Georgia annually and about 25% of those families that moved to the state of Georgia. One of the spouses have some kind of professional license so in order for them to get to this state and get to work and be able to become providers in this state and not need handouts from the government but be tax paying citizens. I think it's very important that we help them be able to hit the ground running and get to work immediately. But Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any more questions if they're not any. That's highly up here. I'll let you yield as long as you want to. I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman in the well. I'm trying to understand what your bill does and I apologize for not speaking with you before you got there. Sure. Because I would have asked you about this. But as I understand it, we sent a bill over to the Senate that as we have done before, which allowed certain military personnel that come to our state to have certain privileges that helped them maybe cut down on the time to get a license to practice professionally of some of that. Is that what we sent over there? No, sir. That's what we did last year and it passed and it was signed into law for military spouses. Well, then tell me, educate me, I'm sorry. What did we send to the Senate? The same bill we passed earlier today that was Senate Bill 27. 68 was the same exact bill as 27 that dealt with that 180 days moving it to two years for using training and certification in the military to apply towards professional license once each. Start to transition out. So then what we have back from the Senate is nothing like what we sent to them helping out military personnel. Is that correct? Well, that's correct, but it's still part of the same code section, same code. So what we have now is not specifically helping the military, but anybody who moves from another state that's going to come into this state and they no longer have to go through the same application process they did to apply and meet the standards in the state of Georgia. They would know, sir, they would be given a licensure by endorsement if they meet the criteria that's laid out as far as they've established residency in this state. They're a legal resident of the United States that they, the exam that they've already obtained the license in the other state as long as those requirements are substantially similar and they're in good standing, not under any kind of investigation in that home state. But if there is a portion of their exam to get the license in Georgia that is a state-specific exam dealing with the states and dealing with our laws that they would have to take that part of the exam to. But these are people who have already obtained a license in another state that are substantially similar in scope and practice to get that license. They move to our state to allow them to get to work when they get here. Would the gentleman feel more comfortable with a committee of this house debated this and looked into this before we passed a bill like this on the floor? I would. We did have some meetings in committee, specifically with House Bill 147 that I was the sponsor for. We did have some debate in subcommittee there, yes, sir. Thanks, sir. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the City of Substitute to House Bill 68, all those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. First speaker, is it not true that this bill was signed to my subcommittee? We did not hear the bill and actually some of the signers on the bill were going to vote against their own bill. Is that not true, sir? I wish I had known that. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion. The eyes are 31. The nays are 129. This has disagreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 68. Okay. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 94. Chairman Rich has moved that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 94 of the clerk will read the caption. House Bill 94 of our reps in a rich and 97th and others to be entitled to amend Article I want to chapter 8 of Title 16 that this goes to George Annotated relating to theft. It says we provide for the crime of theft by possession of stolen mail. Chair recognizes Chairman Rich to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the mail theft and porch piracy bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee made some amendments that are very good and I think addressed some of the concerns that some of the members of our body had. They added clarifying language that it will be within the discretion of the trial judge in order to charge a felony or a misdemeanor. And in addition for the porch piracy, they added a requirement that there be three or more packages having been taken from three or more addresses, thus better ensuring that we are actually targeting true crime rings and porch pirates. I will yield for any questions. Do you have a couple of questions if you care to yield? Yes, I will yield. Chair recognizes Representative Wolenski in room 341 for a question. Thank you, Speaker. Does the gentle lady yield? I do. What else is the number has that last part you just said about the three? Number 13169S and it appears on lines 39 through 42. I apologize. I got out of our folder LC289958 with that LCB. No, I think if you look back one more, there will be the substitute behind it. Okay, tell me the line one more time, please, sir. On lines 39 through 42. Thank you so much, Chairman. Do you further yield? I do. Chair recognizes Representative McLaren in the gallery to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentle lady yield? Yes. Appreciate your explanation of the changes. Is it not true that the porch piracy crime, which as you explain, could be a felony or a misdemeanor? It still does not have any sort of provision that is sensitive to the value of the items. Is that correct? No, absolutely not. There is actually no need for that. If that were in here, then there would be no change to the current law. Okay, just wanted to make sure that I could turn it. Okay, thanks so much. Yes. No further questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration. On the ladies' motion, that the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 94. All those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no.

I said this the Senate substitute this is actually We made an amendment to this bill in the Senate which the Senate Received and what we do is we tacked onto the very end of this a measure a defects measure that had gotten lost before cross every day that simply allows Six months before a child who is in the custody of defects six months before their 18th birthday It allows defects to petition for that that child who have a guardian if need be I've run across this in my private patents practice before especially with with children who are disabled um In order the way the law currently is is that you have to wait until their 18th birthday To petition for that guardianship and it creates a gap While that's pending and by allowing this six month for defects for foster children it will Allow the same rise for them so that a guardian can be in place the day that they turn 18 It becomes effective and they don't have that gap.

There's a question the chair recognizes representative In the gallery for a question Thank you, madam speaker does a gentleman yield I do I am behind the podium so you cannot see me okay, but look at me here Um, my question is how long does this process normally take you said this would give it six months Generally speaking how long does it take? Right now it certainly doesn't take six months It really depends on there are some timelines in the at the private court is held to once petition is filed But there are a lot of things that have to happen Guardian ad litems are appointed they have to get reports back to the court and the court has you know has to there's it's a very rigorous decision deciding to give an adult a guardian It's typically in the situation where there's a disability or or incapacitation of the person who is about to be of the adult age and so um, but I I do these routinely in my law practice and I certainly don't foresee that It that if a judge knows that a minor is turning 18 then they will prioritize it Will certainly be done in six months Thank you.

So it's revised certain arrest powers Chair recognizes representative Reeves to explain the motion Thank you, madam speaker. This is the citizens arrest repeal bill and the bill was I've guarded the words of this bill like I've perhaps never guarded anything in my career here And the Senate Judiciary Committee did not amend the bill the bill was amended as it went to the Senate floor And I want to make clear and I know I've spoken with Amendment what the bill does is it creates As we've created a similar category for restaurant restaurant owners and retailers a right of detention that has parameters around it It creates a third category that would apply to businesses that own that have property That are doing business on their property or somebody else's property For example, if you're a lawn maintenance company and you have a bunch of equipment on a trailer that's parked in a cul-de-sac And someone were to steal a lawnmower you would have the same ability to detain someone That you would if you were a lost prevention officer at Target or Walmart Etc. I think this is good because it creates clarity arguably that right exists under 16-3-24 But this is actually an improvement on it because it takes we have created structure around What this detention looks like there are rules yet to have probable cause you have to That has to be reasonable you have to call the police at a reasonable time or release that person And the continuum of force is discussed in that in this new law we've created so this actually Put certainty around this additional concept and doesn't leave it to chance or to guess And so I would ask everybody I think that this is an improvement to this bill And I hope that everybody will join me again in in supporting Of this bill and I'm Adam speaker. I will yield for any questions. You have a question the chair recognizes representative cannon for question Thank you. Do you I do can you speak a little bit more about this provision on the continuum of force that you just spoke about? Yes, well the the continuum of force is Something that is defined in our self-defense statutes with the type of force that Is allowed to be a presented in certain situations and the force that you are defending yourself the force that you If you're legally defending yourself the force that you give is oftentimes proportionate to the threat of the force that you are receiving and so um in House bill 479 as it relates to the um the Detention rights that have been created for these categories. It makes clear that deadly force is not uh force that can be used in these matters of defending property deadly force is only permissible to be used If you are defending yourself or somebody else against a forceable felony or the threat of substantial bodily injury or death There Recognizes representative gillioid for a question in the gallery Does the gentleman yield I do Isn't it true that in 1863 when this law Outdated and antiquated was created it was created also in the backs of Thomas R. Cobb who was an avid racist Who wrote the doctrine on how to form the Ku Kuz clan and legally lynched black folk? uh That is true. Does the gentleman further you I do True that Georgia would be the first state in the nation To repeal this law and that senator Michael genericus in New York and represent the window gill yard in South Carolina Have taken the leads to follow us That is absolutely true and it makes me very proud. Does the gentleman further you I do If we pass this law today Georgia must hold the truth to be self evident On paper and on law to truly be the state that's too busy to hate is that true? It's true Thank you for this great bill. I supported and hope that we'll move forward. Thank you for your support representative gillioid and your friendship and your help on this The chair recognizes representative Jackson for a question in the gallery Does the gentleman you I deal can you show me in house bill 479 the provision That will make sure that citizens understand When they go to apply common sense That when they see someone that looks like me That's jogging in the neighborhood That they will not take it upon themselves To exercise citizens arrest that may end up being a fatality Representative Jackson the bill repeals the concept of citizens' arrest it would no longer be legal for anyone to engage in a citizens' arrest and if they Engaged in an illegal detention a detention that is not otherwise authorized by other areas of law which is always Bounded limited to the concepts of reasonableness if they were to engage in such behavior without having the justification of doing so Then they would be arguably committing a crime or they would be committing something where you would have a a private Cause of action to pursue against them Does the gentleman further you I do because of the climate that we are in in Georgia Will a citizen confused citizens' arrest versus Daniel ground law St. Andrew ground law and citizens arrest are two very different things there oftentimes conflated Citizens arrest is the action of placing somebody under arrest because you have seen them You claim to have seen them do something that was against the law and you have Under the current law since 1863 you have the right to affirmatively make an arrest of that person Stand your ground 16-destreet as 23.1 is a matter of self-defense is derived from Our ability to defend ourselves and the duty to retreat so they're very different concepts are oftentimes conflated I think that Everything that we can do as a culture and society as a general assembly and in our communities back home to educate Our residents our constituents and our citizens on what proper self-defense is and what it is not Makes all of make all of our communities better places and makes Georgia a better place and I hope that the attention that What Georgia's gone through in the last year what every single one of our residents Have experienced and the effort in doing what we're doing here I hope that this is a step in creating that education and awareness about defending oneself And the the appropriateness of that depending on the circumstances. There's a gentleman yield for one further question I'm gonna now I'm gonna yield for one more question. Thank you.
