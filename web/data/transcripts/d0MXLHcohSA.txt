TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to look closely at a Senate study recommendation
to eliminate income taxes.
With me, our Republican senator,
Blake Tillerie of Vidalia,
he has served in the state Senate since 2016
and is the Senate Chair of the Powerful Appropriations Committee.
And Democratic Senator Nan Orok of Atlanta,
she was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2006
after spending 10 terms in the House.
Welcome to you both to lawmakers.
I appreciate having you here.
So both of you has spent months on the Georgia Senate Special
Committee for the elimination of Georgia's income tax.
So, German tillery, I want to start with, who did you have
talk to you?
Well, who testified?
Well, hopefully saying the title is more than it takes
to pass through.
So, I think it makes a lot of sense for folks.
We had, every day, Georgians come in and talk.
We had a police chief.
We had people who owned businesses.
We had a mom who was talking about child care expenses.
And it turns out that it didn't take, you didn't have to go very far to find out that
everyday Georgians are filling the affordability crunch in their pocketbooks daily.
And they're screaming for help.
And I'm listening.
You heard a lot too, Senator.
I did.
And actually I'd love to see some more experts than the ones that were brought in who have
been beating the drum against income tax for longer than some
of us been alive, the devil's in the details.
OK.
And we'll see.
We're going to get into some of those.
OK.
So we're going to go through some of the highlights.
We show the flyer in the committee's executive summary
and have you both comment briefly on each one of them.
So let's start with we recommend making the first $50,000
for individuals in $100,000 for joint
filers, completely tax-free beginning in 2027.
We also recommend reducing the state income tax rate
for all other families and businesses.
Germantillery?
Yeah, I mean, it speaks for itself.
What we have noticed is that the folks at the bottom end
are filling that affordability across us the most.
If you're making $1 million a year,
you may be filling a crunch.
But you're making $100, $125,000 as a married couple,
making $50,000 individually.
You're trying to figure out how you're paying for gas,
groceries, child care, your power bill. If we can eliminate the income tax on that first
50,000, that's $2,500 a year in a person making $50,000 pocket every year.
You like it, Senator?
Well, the other side of that story is that that cuts $16 billion out of our state budget.
long-term I don't see how we can afford that when we have high needs in every
sector of funding child care, funding our prison system. Every agency in the
state is down. We're not fully staffing our agencies and we've got our
vulnerable children in the foster system right now. $80 million in the
So we're, I'll let you a lot to talk about.
Okay, I'm going to let you talk about it.
I want to get through some more, though.
Sure.
First.
Another highlight.
These proposals completely eliminate the state income tax on
two-thirds of all working Georgians while drastically
reducing the tax burden on everyone else.
Right. Under our plan, if you're making 50,000 or less,
your income tax liability is eliminated in Georgia.
If you're married filing jointly.
In 2020.
In 2027, it's gone.
Your married filing is only your first $100,000, as it's
meant.
If you're making more than $100,000, it's $5,190 in your
pocket every single year from now into eternity.
It's not just $250 a year, $500 a year.
It's forever.
What do you think?
Well, I think the proposal actually would dramatically
challenge us as a state to find the funding that we need
for so many underfunded responsibilities that the state
has tortured citizens.
Okay.
Next, two thirds of individual taxpayers
would have no state income tax liability
under this proposal beginning in 2027.
No income tax, two thirds.
Correct.
So in this plan, as we were going through debating
and hearing from our colleagues on the other side,
one of the things they said is that all the benefits
go to the rich.
We wanted to make sure that this benefit
was applied equally to all Georgians.
And so what we did is said,
let's exempt the first 50,000
if you're seeing along all Georgians.
100,000 if you're married.
all Georgians regardless of your income and apply it across what that ends up
doing though is if you're making less than a hundred thousand dollars it
eliminates your income tax liability entirely that's two-thirds of Georgians
there's no way you can say that this only benefits the rich when every family
making less than one hundred thousand dollars now has zero state income tax
liability. Senator Orrah? Well the devil's in the detail seventy seventy seventy
34% of the benefit would go to people earning six figures
or more per year, $11.8 billion,
I think is what it would come in at.
Okay, let's get to the next one.
This proposal does not increase the sales tax
nor creates property tax,
nor does it cut government services for Georgians.
Cervant Delory.
The folks who are talking about affordability
but not willing to do anything about it
will always throw an excuse.
And the excuse that was thrown out this time
is what the state's going to do is instead of taking it out of your left pocket, they're
going to grab it out of your right pocket instead.
And we said, no, we're not.
We're not going to charge a new sales tax.
We're not going to add a property tax, the state charges no property tax now.
Why would we add that on?
And we developed a plan that literally answered those concerns, didn't raise a sales tax,
didn't put a tax on groceries, didn't charge a property tax, didn't majorly benefit the
wealthy if you'll find out in the first two years, it's a $6 billion plan.
for $4 billion goes to those making $100,000 a less.
We answer all those questions yet we still hear
that affordability is an issue yet,
we're not willing to do anything about it.
So where is the money coming from?
How are you replacing that money?
Glad you asked me.
So you know I've shared the budget now for seven,
this will be my seventh term chair in the budget.
So I guess I'm uniquely qualified to talk about it.
Last year we brought in about $2 billion more
and it senses than revenue.
So there's $2 billion, the first year you need three.
If you move back from a cash standpoint
where we've done bonds in the past, back to bonds,
You create about 700 million more.
The total cost is actually $5.87 billion.
That's about 2.9 a year.
There's your 2.9 to cover year one in year two.
What we're suggesting is that all we should do
is prioritize people over companies.
I heard Chris Clark say $3 billion a year on tax credits.
He's playing funny math.
He's not talking about the sales tax exemptions.
Let's add all those in.
We give away and corporate giveaways
over $30 billion a year.
Take 10% of those.
You can eliminate Georgia's income tax
I'll take that bet, throw me in that brow patch.
So cutting back on some of these tax breaks,
but also the money that usually goes into that pot
at the end of the year that has the surplus,
you're saying that that is some of the money
you're talking about.
You're saying we brought in more revenue last year
than we had in its census?
We're going to apply it somewhere.
Let's apply it and give it back to the people
who sent it to begin with.
Okay. Well, you know,
a person who has a lot of money
You know, a person getting a tax refund cannot go out and build the services they need
for their disabled child.
We need to put money together as Georgians to have a state budget that's robust enough
to deal with.
We've got 7,000 families on the waiting list now with disabled children that cannot get
services.
And what we keep hearing from the Republicans is, well, there's not, well, we can't afford
it.
There's not enough money for that.
enough money for us to have financial aid for needy students to go to college. There's
not enough money for this. There's not enough money for that. And that's what the
word is that comes down, but yet you're going to really threaten half of the state budget
by doing away with income tax.
You're response?
We spent over $2 billion on mental health and developmental disabilities each year. We
We spend 54% over $13 billion on education.
There is no way you can say by looking at what we fund.
With health care making up 23% of our budget and education making up 54% of our budgets,
the Georgia does not prioritize those areas.
What we need to prioritize now, though, is those families making less than $100,000 who
I don't consider wealthy.
That's your firefighters, your nurses, your police officers, your teachers, that we have
an opportunity to completely eliminate their income tax liability.
Why would we not do it?
You're the budget guy, so not getting rid of things that people are used to right now,
and they're what you're...
We've shown a way to do it in the current budget space.
What we have to get rid of is the corporate welfare and subsidies that we've been plotting
out for years.
I heard someone say earlier that the data tax credit is $470, no it's $740.
They transpose their numbers.
It was only $17 million years ago, so now it's $740 million.
We know we have a film tax break of 1.2 billion.
You start adding these up.
You only need 3 billion a year to eliminate Georgia's income tax.
It's there.
You just have to put people over companies.
So you would agree with the data centers, cutting the breaks to tax breaks to data centers?
That absolutely needs to be tackled, yes, because they got a tax break that they didn't
need.
They would be here anyway without it.
Sure, that's their place is to look for tax expenditures in the budget.
But we are one, the 48 states do financial aid for needy students to go to college.
In Georgia, we spend 1% of our financial aid on needy students to go to college.
So there are needs that should be funded that are not in our current budget, that should
be there.
And that's one example.
Our foster child system is very, very challenged.
Mental health, we're not beginning to scratch the surface of funding the needs for mental
health for both adults and for children.
So we hear this every year that the state doesn't have the money to pay for children and
families facing hunger.
it just or to run humane state prisons where staff and inmates don't have their lives threatened
and taken in that setting. And we do a bit, but with the commitment, it needs to be much
greater instead of blowing a hole in our state budget because $20 billion is what we gather
in sales tax. A few seconds to respond.
You've heard Senator Oroch tell you about all the things that government does poorly.
Why would we want to throw more money into a whole of things that we've done poorly?
We're incredibly inefficient at programs.
Allow people to keep their own money.
They can afford their own power bill, their own gas bill, their own grocery bill.
I'm going to bet on them.
Okay.
Well, people all over the state turned out some public service commissioners that because
of high electricity costs, we're going to have to leave it like that.
I appreciate both of you being here.
