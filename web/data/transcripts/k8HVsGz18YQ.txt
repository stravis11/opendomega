Well, good morning and happy Friday.
Most of the, I guess this is our first week is over,
even though we weren't here all five days,
but it's always good to be here on Friday.
We'll talk a little bit more about next week near the end,
but we're going to begin our day-to-day
with scripture reading in prayer by the Chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
This is not the first time that Chairman Randy Knicks has been called out of the bullpen in
relief or sent to bat when things were looking bad to pinch it and he always does an amazing job.
As all of you know, Randy's been here now for a number of years. He chairs our House Ethics Committee.
which is not a job that wins you many friends, but I don't know of anyone who has integrity
that brings credit to all of us more so than Randy Knicks.
has become a friend of mine, someone that I lean on and go to and respect and admire just
because he's such an honorable member.
And I'm going to talk about his political future, but I'm going to say today, if you haven't
heard Randy get be our chaplain you are in for a real treat so without any
further ado I'm going to introduce to you our chaplain of the day to day the
chairman of the Health House Ethics Committee chairman Randy Nick's chairman
Nick's
thank you mr. Speaker this is a little bit of a of a pinch yet I was just getting
ready to get in the car this morning to drive in when I got the call.
And it wasn't, it was a pretty short walk from the bullpen.
I want to read, you're supposed to finish with the poem, but I want to start with the poem
if I made a day.
This always spoke to me as a pastor.
The title of the poem is The Preacher's Mistake.
The Preacher's Mistake.
it's by William Croswell Don. It says, the parish priest of austerity climbed up in a high
church steeple to be nearer God so that he might hand his word down to his people. When the
sun was high, when the sun was low, the good man said, unheeding, sublinary things from
transcendency was he forever reading. And now, and again, when he heard the
Creek of the Weathervane attorney, he closed his eyes and said of a truth from
God I now am learning. And in Sermon's script, he daily wrote what he thought
was sent from heaven. And he dropped this down on his people's heads two times
one day and seven. In his age, God said, come down and die, and he cried out from
the steeple. Where art thou Lord and the Lord replied down here among my
people. So I am here among my people today. I have not had a tremendous amount of
time to prepare, but it's always good. And I just prayed that the Lord would
give me a word to say that might be meaningful to you and might help you. I thought immediately
Mr. Speaker of a passage of scripture here and maybe some of it fits and maybe some of
it doesn't, but I want to go to the 10th chapter of Matthew. And the 10th chapter of Matthew
Jesus is calling the 12. He's calling his disciples and he's sending them out and telling
them what he wants to do and he's also preparing them for some very tough times for difficulties.
In verse 7 though it says, and this is probably the most important thing, it says, as you
go, preach this message, the kingdom of heaven is near.
And then he goes on down in verse 17 and I read this a little bit with tongue and cheek,
but hopefully I can make a point.
He said, be on your guard against men.
They will hand you over to the local councils
and flag you in their synagogues.
I haven't been flagged yet.
On my account, you will be brought before governors
and kings and state representatives.
I'm adding that in as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what
to say or how to say it, at that time you will be given what to say for it is not you speaking
but the spirit of your father speaking through you.
So I hope I don't get flogged.
I hope I don't get arrested.
If I get flogged, then we're going to do it on the biblical method, the one that has
never made a mistake gets to hit me first.
So, Brother Al, we'll talk that over if we get to that point.
When I don't have a lot of time to prepare, I usually try to find something that's meaningful
and share it with you.
I want to share just a brief devotional.
This came out of the upper room on Wednesday, December the 15th of this year.
I think there's a great message in it for us as representatives and for us as people
who may profess Jesus Christ or just us as citizens in general.
The title of the little devotion is trapped in the airport and it's the scripture that's
given one verse that says, the Lord says, seek the welfare of the city where I have sent
you.
Now, this person writes, and it always tells you at the end who it is, it's a gentleman
by the name of Leland P. Gamson from Indiana.
And here's what he writes.
He said, we're calling because we need your prayers, Pastor.
We are trapped between flights in Chicago because of the snowstorm.
Our pastor asks, are you inside where it is dry and climate controlled?
Yes, I reply.
Do you have access to water and food?
Again, I said yes.
Then he asked, are you sick?
I answered no.
He said to me, then you aren't really trapped, are you?
I'll pray for you to be of service to the Lord
where you are.
We prayed together in my attitude changed almost immediately.
I bought children's books at an airport store
and offered them to families with children.
My wife struck up a conversation with an older man wearing a Korean war veteran's head.
Later we offered to wait in the food line for others.
It became easy for us to approach others knowing we were all in the same situation.
Additionally, several worried-looking stranded passengers accepted our offer to pray with
them.
The 16 hours in the terminal went rather quickly when we made ourselves available to others.
We were not trapped.
We were in the right place at the right time to reflect the love of God, and I hope you
will just dwell on that last thought for a moment.
I do believe that we're put in the places that we're put in for a reason.
Some of them may seem difficult, some of them may be challenging, but I believe if we'll
look at them right, we come to the Lord, I think like this man some time, and we pray
is if we've got some kind of major problem,
some kind of catastrophe on us,
when we're just not looking at the situation right.
And I think if we'll get that attitude
that says we are where we are to reflect the love of God
and do that, then I think that all of these other things
seem to work themselves out very easily.
So I challenge you today in this place,
in your district wherever you are.
The scripture says, seek the welfare of the city
where I have sent you.
It's the Lord sends you today.
Please do your best to reflect the love of God
wherever you go.
Let's pray.
Father of grace and mercy, we thank you for this beautiful day.
Lord, we thank you for the privilege
to be observant of service to others.
Lord, I pray that you would bless each person here today,
bless each person in this house,
that their goal would be to serve you, Lord,
and to share your love with all of those
that they come in contact with.
Lord, I pray for our speaker, is he ledges?
Lord, I pray for all of our leadership.
I pray for our governor, our lieutenant governor.
We pray for those at the head of our federal government,
Lord, that you would give them your vision,
that you would give them the vision
that would bring this nation back to you.
For it's in Christ's name I pray.
Amen.
Please join me in the pledge of allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands.
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Good morning, colleagues. As many of you know, the President and Vice President came to Georgia
on Tuesday of this week.
They were to supposedly promote voting rights legislation,
but in fact, the president spent much of his time
at the podium making wild misstatements
about Georgia Republicans and our most recent election
integrity act.
His comments, lines that can last for hours, he said,
illegal to bring food or water to someone, he said,
we were eliminating drop boxes and taking away
your options, he said, what in the hell, heck, are we talking about? Think about it, he
said. Yes, Mr. President, and everyone that heard this speech and the many others that
have mischaracterized or blatantly lied about Georgia's Election Integrity Act, do think
about it. Use your own minds to gain a better understanding of the truth. Lines that can
last for hours, you say. Now, that actually is a form of voter suppression. And in Georgia,
it was often occurring in our Democrat-led communities. And so, we, Georgia Republicans,
addressed it by now requiring poll officials to make corrections if aligned as longer
than one hour at any point in the day. More machines, staff, or precincts. Illegal to
bring food and water. Think about it, you say. Ah, that seems strange because it is absolutely
truly untrue. Anyone can provide food or water beyond 150 feet from the polling place.
Georgia Republicans were responding to the cries of those that were feeling uncomfortable
or intimidated by groups approaching them while in the line close to the precinct doors.
Groups that oftentimes had a clear partisan agenda and were politically aligned. Georgia
took the necessary steps to remove the potential intimidation and discomfort by allowing those
same groups and any other to provide the water directly to the poll workers so that they
may provide water stations within 150 feet of the precincts.
And Mr. President, as far as removing drop boxes to eliminate options, we have the United
States Postal Service that can be used by any.
Like our great Governor Brian Kemp always says in Georgia, we have made it easy to vote,
but hard to cheat.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well.
recognizes representative Mitchell for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yesterday I saw a news citation that a person in the USA dies every 46 seconds from COVID.
Even being immersed in COVID data, that number really surprised me.
And we're also incredibly, incredibly tired of what is happening all around us that does
not change our reality, that high cases lead to more hospitalizations and unfortunately
more deaths.
If you pull up statistics from this week at the Georgia Department of Public Health website,
you can see a couple of important facts.
Every county in Georgia has high COVID rates.
The lowest two-week average is in Eccles County at 252 cases per 100,000 residents, and
It is an exception.
Cases are continuing to rise for our school-aged children,
with the highest numbers reported in the entire epidemic
among our 10 to 17-year-olds as of yesterday.
In the last day, outside the window of incomplete data,
there are around 550 health care workers
reported with a confirmed case on a single day.
That is 1.5 times higher than the maximum number
reported in previous peaks.
While each person's individual risk for COVID
is just that individual, our collective actions,
determine whether our schools are staffed
and our hospitals are able to keep up with demand.
That is our reality.
We have to work together to protect
our societal infrastructure.
That means better masks.
That means decreasing our individual risks.
That means helping people find the information
they need to get vaccinated or boosted.
We don't have to be in this space
and we can work together to get out of it.
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker,
and I yield the well.
Okay, that completes our morning orders.
The clerk will read the caption
to a group of privilege resolutions.
Hattering the life and memory of Miss Karima Reed.
Commending a wane leneer, recognizing commanding Matthew DeWitt, Thomston, Jr., recognizing
January 15, 2022 as Alpha-Capa Alpha Sorority Inc. Founders Day at State Capital, commending
Taiwan for its relationship with the United States and State of Georgia, congratulating
honoring the stakeholders involved in creating open doors to recovery, commemorating Martin
Luther King, Jr. Day, recognized in January 19th as Dr. Nazera, Daywood, Reaffirmation
of Diversity in Patriotism Day, and for other purposes that completes the reading with
privilege resolutions.
Is there any objection to adopting the privilege resolutions?
The chair here is done and the resolutions are adopted.
We are about to go on to announcements before we do and please listen up to this one.
I don't think it's any great secret that there is currently a winter storm watch out
for a large portion of Georgia for Saturday evening and Sunday and I think it even extends
into Monday, and that affects just about all of Georgia north of I-20. That will obviously
have the potential for impacting our operating hours on Tuesday, January 18, which is next
week and I think that's the day Chairman England would have started the budget hearings.
Let me leave you with one or two things. One, if necessary, if there are changes in the
schedule, you will be notified by email late Monday afternoon, Monday evening. Updates
and advisories to house operations will also be posted on the house website and social
media.
So as always, monitor the weather reports and take necessary precautions to be safe.
The latest GEMA weather advisory that came out a little bit before we came in this morning
seems to indicate that the impact here in the metropolitan Atlanta area may be less than
was first thought but will still be very significant in what we know as God's country in the North
Georgia and particularly Northeast Georgia. It's still going to be a significant weather
event up there. So I may not be seeing you again for two or three weeks if it
gets bad but but but keep up with that and we'll we'll keep you advised of that.
The the final thing I want to mention I met yesterday afternoon with both
Commissioner McMurray with the DOT and Governor Camp and I can tell you that
DOT is deploying all of the state assets they have that they're disposal. I think that
Georgia will not repeat the events that happened in Virginia two or three weeks ago when I don't
know what happened up there. They just completely ignored all the warnings and the watches and it
was a terrible event, but we're preparing and we're going to be ready. The governor reiterated
the same thing and I think he's going to have maybe a briefing, public briefing later today,
sometime to sort of bring everybody up to date on things. So that's kind of where the weather
understands God's speed to all lobby through the the weather. Hopefully it won't be as bad
as we think and it'll just be a beautiful snow that come Monday afternoon. It'll all
be melted away and life will go on as normal or not.
All right, we have a couple of announcements. If you signed up for an announcement, make
your way to the front of the chamber, the chair recognizes representative
Jasmine Clark for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Everyone, when you get
back to your offices today, you will have a flyer on your desk that will tell you
about the blood drive that we are having on Monday the 24th. That is the
Monday, we return after budget week. Right now, the supplies for blood are really, really
low. Blood banks usually want to have about a three-day supply, and most of them right
now only have less than a day's worth of blood. So, someone needs a transfusion. They
are at risk of not having that life-saving blood available to them. The blood mobile will
be parked on the street between the capital and the CLOB, so very readily accessible.
You could make an appointment using the information that's on that flyer.
We really hope to get a good participation and thank you very much, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative or Chairman Todd Jones for an announcement.
A good morning, Representative Cunard and I wanted to let you know we'll be co-hosting
our co-chairing the House Mental Health Caucus.
The verse meeting is going to be Tuesday, the 25th at adjournment.
We will get you the room number on the 24th, but please mark that in your calendars.
Thank you so much.
Mental health is health.
Okay, we have some birthday, so I want you to listen up, and obviously we've got a number
of them between now and when we return here to the chamber on Monday, the 24th.
The first one is on Monday, January 17th,
Representative Josh McLaren, Representative McLaren.
On Thursday, January the 20th, Chairman Gerald Green.
Green. On Saturday, January 22, Representative John LeHood.
On Sunday, January 23, Representative Noel Williams.
Is it true that your chairman Hogan's giving you a party that day with balloons and things to blow in and all that?
I saved though the best one for last.
I did.
Sometimes we forget who the really important people are here.
and next Tuesday January 18th will be the birthday of Scotty Long in the Clarks
office. Happy birthday Scotty.
