TRANSCRIPT
----------
Okay, we're running a little early. I
hope I've got all my committee members
here, but uh I'd like to call the order
of the public safety subcommittee on
appropriations. And we're going to start
off with uh Department of Community
Supervision.
Uh 18.2.3,
we're going to reduce funds for personal
services. And you'll see this time and
time again in this uh in in uh this
presentation. And all this is is last
year we had some new positions. When
they're not filled on July 1st, very
obviously we're not going to have a
salary for the whole year. So whatever
months it takes for them to get hired,
we take that money back. So we're going
to recover
uh $100,000
in in that item. Moving on to the
Department of Corrections
under food and farm operations. The
Department of Corrections runs their own
farm down in Reedsville. They they
provide almost exclusively all the food
for 50,000 inmates in our penal system.
Under 19.3.4 provide funds for food
services across state facilities
contracted with Georgia Correctional
Industries due to rising food costs. Uh
there was nothing budgeted. We put in
2,445,000.
That's one half of the request. They
lost 4.8 8 million in fiscal year 25.
19.3.5
provide funds for the purchase of meat
during processing equipment upgrades.
Their meat processor quit last year.
They had to buy uh meat patties outside
while it was under renovation. That was
a million79,000.
19.3.6
provide funds for food and farm
equipment and software upgrades. they
can't grow the they can't grow the food
to raise the livestock without the
equipment. And for about the last four
years, we tried to upgrade and and uh we
haven't been able to fund it. So we put
in a million $15,000 this year by a
potato planter, two road planters, uh
some hog traps, combine, nitrogen
applicator so that they can they can do
the job and and feed our inmates. Under
19.4.3 4.3
increase funds for the physical health
contract for a PDM increase of
10,946,000
108.
We would we we're going to be able to
take back 16,72
because we're paying them to from March
when it was appropriated through July.
19.4.7
increase funds for residential substance
abuse treatment centers effective April
1st. Uh there was nothing funded. We put
$312,000
500.
That's one quarter of the request.
Counselor salaries are 20% lower than
the state average and and they have
difficulty hiring people. This a
recommendation for Gateway which is is a
consulting company that Department of
Corrections hired to assist them uh in
some of their endeavors.
Moving down to offender management 19.5
provide funds for rural local county
jail reimbursement where more than 20%
of jail capacity utilization is occupied
by detainees unable to make bail on
contraband or drone related charges.
They now have the capability to track
these drones when they come in. So they
track them and they call the local
sheriff's department. They run them
down, arrest them, and they put them in
their local jails. And some of them sit
there for a while and they don't have in
in some of these small counties, they
don't have the ability to provide the
the food and substance that's required
to maintain them. So uh we're going to
put in a,500,000
to fund them for 30 the first 30 days
that they're in in the jail.
Moving on to
19.7.3
increase funds for additional correction
officer positions, approved staff to
offender ratios.
Uh they put in $4 million. We upped it
to 9 million. The projection between
hiring promotion. There's a six-mon step
and overtime cost. The actual need is 7
19.7 to fully fund.
19.7.5
provide funds for a pilot program at
Altry State Prison to provide peer-led
programming. This is came out of a a
group that went to Texas and observed
it, but uh we've got a lot of new
programs and we didn't get enough
information, so we we didn't fund that.
19.7.12
increase funds for operations at Lee
Arendale State Prison. They're shutting
down the prison. They were going to
leave uh 200 inmates there uh because
they've got a uh packaging program
warehouse there for the GCI kitchen and
maintenance. So, what we're going to do
is leave 200 more there so we don't have
to pay for maintenance in the facility.
We'll have 200 uh additional inmates to
do the maintenance and upkeep and work
in the kitchen. That's 3,879,000.
19.7.13
increased funds for rent at Arnell North
Basic Correctional Officer Training
Building. Uh it was funded at $14,000
for the rent. That'll cover one month.
We put in $219,236
to carry us through the year.
Moving on to 19.7.14
increased funds for offender call
monitoring contract due to an increase
in usage. We have two court cases that
have affected us this year. One it one
is that u
uh they uh
they can call anybody they want. the uh
the courts have said that they used to
be limited to their visitor list which
is typically family. Now the courts have
said they can call anybody they want. So
we we believe there's going to be a lot
more calls. And the other thing is the
courts have said that we can't charge
them. We used to charge them a little
bit of money for their phone calls and
deduct it from their accounts. They said
we can't do that anymore. So we have to
pick up that. It's total comes to
$764,000.
9.7.15
increase funds or excuse me I was wrong
one 19.7.16
increase fund for contracted food
services due to rising food and labor
costs
it wasn't anything budgeted we put
284,000 in there funds one quarter
request by error mark for the increase
as for the last four years cost for
labor and foods up 8.4% 4%
19.7.17
increase fund for central repair funds
for capital projects. There wasn't
anything in the budget. We put $725,992
in there. This uh replaces funds for the
emergency repairs. They made the meat
facility repairs. They had to use money
out of the central pair to do that. So,
we're going to replace that money.
Defense Department. We had no changes.
Governor's office. uh the Georgia
emergency management uh
uh organization comes on under the
governor's office and uh
we uh we're going to give them a half
million dollars for one-time funds for
local emergency management agencies for
what they had to utilize during
Hurricane Ken that uh they're not
getting any federal or state money for.
Georgia Bureau of Investigation
uh regional investigative offices 30.4
4.4 reduce funds for personal services
be best on actual start dates. U this is
another true up we're going to take back
203,000
uh 30.4.5 eliminate funds for onetime
connectivity to the statewide gain
database management system. The budget
said we were going to take back
$800,000.
They say they really have to have that.
So we zeroed it out and going to give
them that million dollars they asked
for.
Under Criminal Justice Coordinating
Council 30.5.4
utilize existing funds. Uh we had a
savings of $133,000 on rent and we're
going to add 301,000 to it so that uh we
make we'll be able to fund their grant
system and make it compatible with
Georgia at work.
Uh 30.5.6 provide funds for eight child
advocacy centers and 19 satellites
office locations that meet minimum
standards. Provides specialized services
not currently state funded. Nothing in
the budget. We added 185,000.
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council
Family Violence Center 30.7.2 two
provide onetime funds to domestic
violence shelters and sexual assault
centers for operational and facility
needs.
These things have been funded for many
years through federal grants and the
federal grants have pretty much been cut
off. So we put 424,525,000
there. That funds 47 domestic violence
shelters, 34 sexual assault centers at
$50,000 each and 19 sexual satellite
sexual assault centers at $25,000 each.
Juvenile Justice Department of Juvenile
Justice has no changes. The law
department 33.1.3 reduced funds for
personal services based on the actual
start date of new positions. This is a
true up uh meant to recover 93,000. We
only recovered 43,000 because we had to
give them $50,000 for they didn't think
they needed to represent the JQC in a
case and they it was determined that
they did and it was $50,000 so we
reimbured that.
Pardons of we have none. Department of
Public Safety uh the actual department
of public safety we don't have anything.
Some of the satellite
admin that are attached to them for
administrative purposes. the Georgia
Firefighters Standards of Training
Council.
Uh
39.8.3
increase fund for startup cost for one
safety and compliance specialist. This
is just the startup cost. We put in
$60,000.
Uh they're going to they're going to add
one person in Atlanta, which means this
is the last we've been doing this for a
couple years. This is the last one
that'll give us statewide coverage now
when we hire him next year to uh to
drive the car. Uh
But uh this means that uh they'll be
able to inspect every fire station in
the state every year, which is something
relatively
