The lady from the 87th House District representing Viola Davis, representing Davis and a veteran
of the armed forces of these United States.
Come please do the job today.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I take great honor in introducing the chaplain of the day as a veteran to have a chaplain
such as this great man, I'll tell you to read his bio,
I had to take a second, you know how they tell you
to be brief.
But sometimes what people do in life outweigh
what their bio says.
To work in recruitment and retention
and work with recruiters and their families,
especially doing COVID, imagine that.
Chaplain, Leland Jones is our chaplain of the day.
He is the one that has worked with veterans such as myself and work with recruiters.
Since 2003, he is the senior pastor of Greater New Life Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.
He is a chaplain that works often in community service.
service. He's also did entertainment. I am here to say to you that he currently serves
on the National Advisory Board of the NIH, that's the National Institutes of Health. He's
also on the Community Advisory Board of the Morehouse College School of Medicine. Now,
I ask you to welcome me.
Well, help me welcome Chaplin, Leland Jones.
The morning, sir, pleasure's mind, sir.
Thank you for the introduction.
Thank you for allowing me to feel welcome in this space.
And now for a moment that matters more importantly
than anything else.
Who I am is very minor, but what I have to say, we pray, makes a major difference.
If there is a scripture that reads to this particular moment, it simply would be 1 Samuel,
chapter number 30, verse 6, where it says, and David was greatly distressed for the people
speak of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons
and for his daughters.
But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.
Master, give me guidance.
So if there were words for consideration,
it would simply be encourage yourself.
Looking at this particular story,
we find where David is now being hunted by Saul.
Saul has gotten to the point where his spirit has changed.
And David, who was a Psalmist, for Saul is now turned.
David was raised with Saul's son Jonathan.
They're like brothers, you know.
But when someone's heart turns against you,
sometimes you've simply got to go.
Here we find where Saul and his troops
are not only dealing with trying to hunt down David,
but they are also battling of the forces.
David knowing this.
Has now had the reality of his life knowing
that I'm the one who beheaded Goliath and the Philistines
respect him, but guess what?
In this particular text, David to protect himself
has aligned himself with the Philistines.
Man by the name of Akish is the king,
and they join with other Philistines
to get ready to go to battle against the Israelites.
The other Philistines said, he might work with you,
but he's not going to work with us.
And so David and those few warriors that were with him
had to go back home and when they went back home
they found that where they lived was the land of Ziglaq.
The problem was in the south that the Amalakites had come
and had burned their camp, burned their small city,
took their children and their wives.
At that moment when they returned they were crestfallen,
they were hurting and here we find
where David has men who he served with
who are ready to stone him
because they've lost everything.
My friends, there would be moments in your place
where you might have to stand alone.
And David in our text did one thing.
He encouraged himself in the Lord.
That being said, let's look at just three points
and then yes, I am through.
The first thing is, in difficult times,
you might have to align yourself with strange partners
that when the common ground has been found,
invest in working together.
Oh my goodness, I hope you can see the power
and the wealth that comes when you get on common ground.
But ultimately, David worked with those
who actually feared him with the Philistines.
Oh, please align yourself, but whatever you do,
do not abandon your purpose.
So my first point is partnership.
Partnership does matter.
The second thing that matters is also perseverance,
because even when we find ourselves in difficult situations,
don't allow temporary challenges
to become permanent impediments.
Yes, distress will come.
Yes, the storms will blow.
Yes, frustrations will occur.
But whatever you do, do not give up.
Because we as a state need you to stay focused on your path.
You've been elected for that particular understanding,
perseverance.
The last thing is, also with perseverance to dovetail is press on.
Guess what?
We need each of you to lead.
We need each of you to not only reach the point to where you're serving your constituents,
but we need you to make a difference for those of us who serve in different capacities.
We all have our challenges.
And so I simply say, every once in a while, like David,
you're going to feel like no one cares.
going to feel like no one understands, but you're going to have to encourage yourself.
The suicide rates show us that people are sometimes disaffected by life.
And that's a reality we have to face.
I'm saying encourage yourself.
Sometimes when people get an argument over little things, it might be just little.
You don't have to get to the point to where you go to blows.
Why do we bring out guns whenever someone steps on my blue suede shoes?
Encourage yourself.
I want you to know, my friends, very simply this.
our state needs you. Encourage yourself. Our cities need you. Encourage yourself. Every citizen
of Georgia is depending upon you here today and throughout the session to make job producing,
food providing, relationships, strengthening, and forward-thinking choices. And even the rest
of the globe is saying, what is Georgia going to do today? Your constituents are seeking your
support. Your counterparts are seeking your collaboration. And even if I tell you nothing else,
Encourage yourself, but you don't have much time.
Benjamin Elijah Mays made it clear.
I have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it.
Forced upon me, can't refuse it, didn't sick he didn't choose it,
but it's up to me to use it.
I must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it.
Just a tiny little minute, but it turn it tears in it.
I am a soldier.
I need to you to encourage yourself.
I need you to work the difference.
I need you to walk the aisles.
I need you to kiss the babies.
I need you to make the difference, encourage yourself, and lead us in the right direction.
And while you are standing, let us pray.
We ask God that you simply take these kind moments and these opportunities to be able
to share, to be able to say to these who have an authorized power of office, to look around
and to know that we are counting upon them, we support the decisions they make.
And for many of us in uniform, the fact needs to constantly be with us every time we put
on the uniform that we might have to shed the blood because of decisions made in this place.
We are looking to them to make the right choices and at the same time, I'm asking that you
protect them, but also, oh God, bless and protect our military, our families, those of us
who are here, sworn to support and to defend.
We leave ourselves with you, oh God, let it be for the better, amen.
pledge of allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands.
One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, also.
Okay, y'all, the paperwork is ready in any room.
If you haven't been a member of the military, you can join now.
If you've been a member, you can re-up now, that's what I'm going to do.
Doorkypers, please unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the whip.
Well, thank you, Representative Cardin.
Welcome, Newton County.
Good to have you.
We have a special resolution this morning.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the resolution?
House resolution six by Representative Bonner,
the 73rd Hitches, on the 61st, Williams on the 68th,
Prince on the 132nd, and McCollum on the 30th.
a resolution recognizing January 26, 2023
as National Guard Day at the State Capitol,
and for other purposes.
Chairman Bonner?
We're last the Vice Chair and the Committee Secretary
to join us along with the guest,
Representative Bonner.
Chairman Bonner.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yes.
Good morning, colleagues. It is a great day in Georgia. Today is Georgia National Guard
Day here at the Capitol, and we are so appreciative of having them here. The first thing I would
like to do is recognize all of our guardsmen that are in the galleries. If you all can stand
up and be recognized please.
Thank you.
So we're very honored today to be joined by Brigadier General John Gentry, Colonel Roger Brooks,
General Chris Powell, Commander Sergeant Major Robert Bain, and Deputy Attorney General,
Agent General Joe Ferraro, along with Lieutenant Colonel Chaplin, David Burris, and we've already
heard from Chaplin Jones, and I will say Chaplin Jones delivered his sermon exactly the way
we practiced it last night, so really appreciate that Chaplin.
So the motto of the guard is always ready, always there, and I cannot think of any organization
in the state of Georgia that has displayed that motto more
over the last several years than our National Guard.
Everything from working at food banks
to running COVID centers, to covering down
on hospital administrative staff,
to protecting our cities during civil unrest,
to protecting our border.
We currently have sold National Guardsman
out on the southern border in Texas.
We've had them there for over a year,
supplementing that mission.
So all across the board, our National Guard is leading out.
And I don't think there's any organization in the state of Georgia
that has given more and done more for the state of Georgia
over the last few years.
So if you would, please let's recognize our National Guard.
And I'd like to introduce Brigadier General John Gentry.
Well, thank you, Representative Bonner.
First of all, all of our representatives here.
Imagine when Brother Jones was speaking earlier,
You had to check yourself or pinch yourself to make sure you showed up in the right house.
General Cardin, on behalf of Major General Cardin, he normally says after a good opportunity
or a good speaker or a good national anthem, he says, if that doesn't light a fire under,
you got wet Kenlan.
So on behalf of Major General Cardin, the entire 15,000 Georgia Army National Guard, Air
National Guard and our state defense force.
an honor to speak before you here today and just to say thank you for your
support of your National Guard. It's a tremendous National Guard, our
leadership works hard to serve you and our Guard is proud to serve you as our
representatives. We are glad to have you as our representatives in the House.
We want to thank you for your support, your continued support, especially a lot
of the armory renovations that are ongoing throughout the state of Georgia.
We have representatives from our Army National Guard in every single community within the
state, and you are representing 100 percent of us, I can honestly say that.
So thank you for that, thank you for your continued support, and one last thing I do want
to say is we're hiring.
We've got vacancies, and we're looking forward to you helping us recruit.
And by the way, we need to go over to the leadership group that's over here and pass
out some R&R signs, because that's another thing we can thank you for, because you support
all of our students who come into the guard with a student loan repayment program, and
That is a tremendous opportunity for young people in every community within every inch of
our state to go and get a higher education and graduate debt-free.
And because of your support, our youth have that opportunity.
So again, thank you, thank you, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Bonner, Mr. Representative Bonner,
in the entire house.
Thank you.
So, General Gentry, on behalf of the entire House of Representatives, we'd like to present
you with this resolution, establishing January 6th, as George and National Guard day here
at the Capitol.
Thank you, General.
I know all of us know how important the National Guard has been in the history of the United
States of America.
And there work here in Georgia and around this world is your service to protect our lives
here, is most appreciated, and certainly we're so very humbled and pleased to work with
the National Guard, and that will continue.
Thank you all so much for being here today.
Members, thank you for your attention to these folks
who are dedicated to our safety and our protection.
So thank you all for that.
We're ready to go move on to afternoon orders.
We'll start with Representative Bentley for an afternoon order, Representative Patty Bentley.
With the later yield for just for a minute, members, let me have your attention just for
a moment. I know that we all are respectful and want to be respectful. And I know that
we're all have need, there's a need to have conversations about a lot of important issues.
But if you need to have conversation and not pay attention to what the speaker in the
well is talking about, they're important, there are sensitive issues in many cases. It's
not a good object for the House. You'd be having a lot of conversations that certain
Subjects are breached and talked about here in the well.
So I would ask you if you need to have an important conversation,
please take it to the any room.
Because we need to pay attention to the member,
they would not be here if it were not imported.
So I would appreciate your cooperation on that.
That's important for all of us.
It's important for the integrity of this house.
So let's remember that as we do our afternoon orders today
and in the future.
Thank you so much.
Representative Bentley.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, if you would please stay in.
I come to you this afternoon, I ask that you focus your attention to the screens.
I come this afternoon to offer our condolences to the families of Martavian time man of
Macon County, Georgia and Jacob Jake Pounds of Taylor County, Georgia.

afternoon.

Jacob Jake Pounds passed away last week at the age of 23.
