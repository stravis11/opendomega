TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. Where do you go ahead and begin? Thank you all for joining us this morning. This is the second meeting of the Senate Study Committee on Truck Driver Shorages. We anticipate probably having one more meeting. We'll have information on that hopefully in the days to come. Before we get started, I know Senator Islam will be here. We have Senator Doza on the Zoom and also Senator Gouge. Senator Jones here also will let them maybe give some brief comments. Before we begin, we'll open a word of prayer and then we'll get this party started. Dear Heavenly Father, thanks for bringing us together this morning to talk about issues in Georgia. Talk about the families and businesses that are impacted in the trucking industry that move product and freight and keep all of our lives together in some ways big and some way small. So we pray for the truckers on the road. We pray for everybody in this room and the leaders of our state to make decisions that are best for the citizens of Georgia. And all of our communities when we go back home to make sure we honor and glorify you. With that, amen. So we're going to begin. I do want to recognize my esteemed colleague from Henry County for joining us today. Senator Manuel Jones, may I know if you have any brief comments, just kind of open us up and say hello. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As mentioned, I'm State Senator Manuel Jones. I represent Henry and the Cab County. And when I'm not serving in the legislature like I have for the past 19 years, I'm also trying to run my car business. So I am in literally the transportation business and looking forward to some concrete steps that we can take and improving the answer. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. I know Senator Dozal is on the line. It might be a little hard right now to get him here on the Zoom. Kind of feels where he's like here in the computer screen. Along with the Senator Gitch, who's calling in from North Georgia. But they both say hello. And as they have questions, I'll share those with the group. So first I want to thank Kevin Perry, word Kevin go. Just say thank you for hosting us here with your entire team with Coca-Cola bottling. I do want to turn it over to Crawford Jones, who's the president of the East Region for Coca-Cola. And Hafiz Shanda Wala, the EVP and Chief Administrative Officer for Coca-Cola bottling. And just say thank you again. You all have engaged us in the legislature on these issues in the past. Whether it's with this, other issues that I know impact the industry and business. And we don't take lightly, I think, just the Coca-Cola brand history name as relates to the history of Georgia going back many, many, many, many decades. You know, centuries in some cases. So I think it's fitting that we're having this meeting here today to hear your story and the impacts you're having on the trucking industry and vice versa. So I'm going to turn it over to you Crawford. Great. Thank you. First of all, Senator. And, Chair, but thank you for being here. We appreciate your time and what you guys are doing on behalf of the state. My name is Crawford Jones. I'm the vice president of most of the state of Georgia for Coca-Cola united. And let me start logistics first of all. So I think most of you have found restrooms are out the door and back this way. We've got drinks both in coolers here and around out this door. And we'll have some lunch served later on today. We will also have a tour available. It'll be a bit of a modified tour given the size of this group and the, you know, the safety requirements. But that'll be available at the end of this meeting for anybody that's able to stick around. So we really look forward to that. Let me just give a few comments on Coca-Cola united so you understand who we are. And then our footprint in the state of Georgia and our CDL needs. But we are a company founded in 1902. We're a private company out of Birmingham, Alabama. I have about 10,000 associates. And we're a fifth generation of ownership in the business. We operate in six states. We'll get a map up here in a little bit. You guys can see. But we're in six states from Louisiana over to Georgia. Panhandle of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, a little bit of Tennessee. Oh. Is this you guys? That's it. I'm sorry. I had to format correctly. Yeah. Very easy. Well, I'll have to go with that. One of the, one of the main questions I get is what's the difference between the Coca-Cola company and the Coca-Cola bottle? And first of all, this is the simplified version. But a Coca-Cola bottle, or if you're out in stores, or if you see Coca-Cola branded trucks or anything, that's the Coca-Cola bottle. Or so people putting drinks on shelves, ordering in the stores, all of that. The Coca-Cola company is a global company that owns the brands. And really their revenue is selling concentrate to us. So nobody in this room is really ever interacted or transacted or bought anything directly from the Coca-Cola company. That's generally the Coca-Cola bottleers. And quite frankly, if we weren't in the state of Georgia, you wouldn't interact with the Coca-Cola company much at all. You would just know the bottleer in your local state and the other 49 states. And one of the interesting things I'll talk about is the history of the Coca-Cola, what a franchise is, and what a bottleer is. I think it's a really interesting connection point from how it started to what it is today with our CDL discussion. But 100 years ago, in 1902, 120 years ago, a Coke franchise was quite literally how far you could load a wagon, a mule pulled wagon, and go out and return safely in daylight. So think about that. And if there were creeks without bridges, you couldn't cross those. So that was somebody else's franchise on the other side. So that's how this thing started. There were thousands of Coke franchises in the US and consolidation happened. But so we started with mule-drawn wagons. We grew up, and now here we are in Georgia talking about the issue of not having enough CDL drivers. So it's a really interesting history when you think about what the Coke business is and what it means to the state of Georgia. So specifically in Georgia, this map is accurate. This is our footprint in Georgia. These are our facilities. You can see it bleeds over into Chattanooga because that's where some of the Dalton distribution comes out of. But this is what we look like in the state of Georgia. In Georgia, we have about 3,500 associates. We have 23 facilities and a substantial number of CDL drivers, which Hafizl cover shortly. But we cover, you see, we're up from Jasper, all of Atlanta, down to Brunswick. We are the first bottleer. It's the first time in history that one bottleer has had the whole state of Georgia. So we have it all. And the challenges are very different in South Georgia, in Metro Atlanta, Savannah, the port, all of that. So we have different strategies around CDL and everything that we do around recruitment. And it's different in the state, as I said. But we do acknowledge it's a problem we have to solve in Georgia or else it'll be a longer term problem. It's a real issue we face every day. So look again, I want to thank you guys for being here. We appreciate the time and look forward to the discussion. And anyway, we can help now and the future. Please don't hesitate to ask. Hafizl, come up with a little more information for you. Thank you, Crawford. Senator Chairman, thank you for being here today and those online. Thank you for attending and for those in the audience. Thank you for being here to help us solve or address this issue of CDL and the shortage that we see in our industry throughout the state of Georgia. So my name is Hafiz, John DeWalla. I work as a Chief Administrative Officer for Coca-Cola United. I've been with the company for 22 years and I'm in Birmingham often in Atlanta though, as I am today and just about every week. I really enjoy visiting here and actually a high school graduate of Evans High School in Augusta, Georgia. So I have roots here. My dad actually worked on the global plant that's now live in Augusta, Georgia. So have ties back to the state. You know, as we talk about this issue, this driver shortage issue, it's a, I know we're all here because it's a real problem we want to try to find solutions. And I want to talk a little bit about what we as a company are doing and then what the broader technical college schools are doing to help us support resolving this issue and then how we might be able to work together to do more. So we acutely felt this struggle when the pandemic hit in 2020 and 2021. The, the, we all felt the shortfall wages increasing with the government intervention on compensation for individuals. We just really felt a shortfall really couldn't source enough drivers at all during that period of time and there was a significant shortfall then it's gotten better, but it's still not an issue that has solved and we we have more work to do. So we're taking a multifaceted approach to address our needs and one of them is a significant training investment within cococo United. We have spent $4 million in resources and individuals and training for developing our associates in Georgia and by year end we will have spent $5 million in 2023 just at cococo United in the state of Georgia. We've also implemented what we call culture of learning and what we're doing with that is we're hiring associates to train our team members to be successful members of our team and ultimately develop their careers into further opportunities. And one of the areas where we're developing careers is in the ability for folks to upskill their capabilities to become CDL drivers. So we actually have a program where we will and Crawford touched on this where we will pay an associate salary during six week time period to go through our internal CDL school, which we have invested in in many locations. And when they finish the CDL school, they have the opportunity to take the test with the state and they then have their CDL license and they can then drive for us and certainly go on to other employment opportunities within our company. So it's a significant investment on our part. In addition, we worked with the technical college system and the cococo company to make a million dollar gift to the technical college system last year and those efforts are underway to add trainers to pave parking lots for training facilities for drivers. So all of that is ongoing as well within the cococo system additional in addition to the million dollar grant by the cococo company, we coco united granted $200,000 to the technical college that's near our tifton campus. And that is the Southern regional technical college in order to increase their efforts on CDL training as well as some other school programs. Another item that we're doing is we're making an effort to connect with high school students to show them that there's a career opportunity at cococo united during their senior year and bring them in and have them work or have an opportunity to work in different departments. Now what they can do is get started at 18 when they graduate high school and then certainly work their way into a CDL license in a few years and then certainly drive for us and have a very meaningful opportunity and career with cococo united. Lastly I'd say that with respect to that that what we find is the ability for us to have these schools and make this investment within coco united has given us the opportunity to really train the cococole away that's what that's the way I'd call it. And we are able to retain those associates in a much higher rate because they've come through our training internally. So working together to develop a curriculum that works hand in hand with what's happening in the technical schools and develop our own training internally. We have associates that go to the technical schools we have those associates that stay within our schools internally and ultimately take the state testing has been a really a good win and a good symbiotic relationship across the state. So really that's what I wanted to make sure I conveyed to you that we are making investments both internally and with the technical college system throughout the state we want to work together to help solve the issues. And lastly I will say that Chairman that on the committee that we want to thank you all for looking at tort reform in the last meeting. I know that's not what this meeting is about but certainly that's an area that with a judicial climate in Georgia is important to us and we look forward to what's coming there in 2024. So thank you all for being with us today. Look forward to taking you on a tour looking at our facility looking at our CDL school here and look forward to breaking bread over lunch. So thank you. We're happy to answer any questions. Well thank you. I'll first see if any of my colleagues have any questions and want to recognize Senator Islam for joining us. If anything you want to share with us crowd. No you're good. The air has been learned. Okay. Cool. Senator Jones you're good. You have a question. I guess the only question I would have is you talked about your CDL school. What is the difference between your school and those at the technical colleges? Obviously the CDL curriculum is very similar. We also blended some of the work specific stuff at Coca-Cola as part of our training. And we're in some discussion and I know we've got to have a tifton discussion I think with you folks about how to incorporate the TCSG schools with some of the work we're doing. So we're certainly interested in that. Right now many of our campuses are not quite close enough to make it work but we're certainly interested in integrating as best we can and just a discussion about how TCSG and our internal program could work better. Can you all use any independent contractor that all employees? They're all employees right now. Right internal schools and then we certainly have candidates that have CDLs that they've gotten externally and they come in. So certainly we go that route as well. That's that answer the question. One thing I would add to the question of the difference in our school versus the technical college. Many of our drivers, CDL drivers also deliver and merchandise the product in stores. Our merchandising standards are taught in this school as well. So that's something obviously a third party school would not be able to teach because they're teaching CDL. So we incorporate that into our school. That's the primary, I would say difference. And just one other question. I know you mentioned you operate in multiple states. Are there any differences in your logistics in somebody other states versus do you operate here in Georgia? We've got a thing called cross doc which will make sense as you see out there but not. Generally not. They're all pretty similar and we're all we're doing CDL training in I think in every state. Not some of the tiny state footprints we have but in most every major state. I would say the issue in Georgia seems a bit more acute maybe with the population, Metro Atlanta and the growth of the port. But operationally it's very similar. Thank you. Let me ask one question. I don't know if I'll ask this the right way but outside of I think the typical driver who's maybe picking up at the warehouse and going to I'll say public's dropping off a load of items or kind of what you describe. Is there any other supply chain mechanisms within your model outside of just warehouse the store where a CDL driver is needed in terms of kind of your statewide supply chain footprint and that may be even just you know is that the shipping of the actual product to get it here to create you know this and I know that's happening in other parts of your supply chain but just to understand that a little bit deeper. Yeah we got a few so there's the warehouse to store in a grocery store model or a small store model it's a bit different but warehouse to store we've got our manufacturing centers to our sales centers or our distribution centers so that's we call that more over the road where they don't merchandise product they don't stop by a customer it's all internal. We have raw materials inbound and outbound and then we have longer haul stuff that would be from our manufacturing or from distant manufacturing where we purchase and that's but that's often third party carry or the other stuff is is more. You drive during the day you stay within our footprint sleep in your own bed every night and then third party piece is when you start to leave our footprint and go into the Midwest or mid Atlantic and that's not really what we do with our internal drivers. Is there any product because I know this always comes up in various conversations is there any products that come up where it's not coming on a truck but it's coming on a train or intersects with trucks on the raw material side yes we would bring in bulk real car for instance to college park here we have manufacturing or Marietta sweet or mostly but outside of that almost everything else is truck carrier. Awesome. To our senators on the screen any questions senator goots or dozo you're good okay. I've got one question can you hear me yes speak up. So your voices got a muffled chairman I think it's called your closer to the mic the gentleman talking I can hear him better it comes across better but they may have covered this earlier but out of their their truckers that are working here in Georgia what percent drive out of the state versus what percent of those CDO required drivers are basically in state day to day. They're a rule of thumb for their picture coming. I'm not sure about a rule of thumb I mean I could I could estimate yeah that's right yeah it's off these said since much of our trucking is for manufacturing to DC's which we have a lot in Georgia or from distribution centers to store. 90 or 95 percent stays in state the exception largely would be where we have manufacturing in Atlanta that goes into Tennessee South Carolina Alabama or we've got what's called cross stock out of tifton in particular that goes down into Florida and southeast Alabama but yeah large majority of it stays in state. Well thank you I don't think we have any other further questions and thanks for again having us and giving us an overview of your model next we're going to hear from commissioner Spencer more from the Georgia Department of driver services. Good morning Mr. Chair. Perfect. Good morning and again thank you for allowing the DDS come down and give some remarks relative to our efforts and CDL capacity. I've had the opportunity to speak with leader Guch on these topics and others in many settings in the first part of what I like to do this morning just say thank you to the general assembly because over last several years there have been considerable investment in DDS in order to increase the number of not only staff but centers that we have available for CDL testing our role is testing. We have a lot of work to do as well as regulation as it as it pertains to driver training schools so during the slide presentation I'll certainly give some remarks relative to what we're doing in this space where we have been over the last several years and where we intend for us to continue to move forward. First off I like to just give a little update about the agency and what we're doing today we have served right at 1.635 million people face to face during the calendar year 23 January through August at an average wait time of six minutes and 45 seconds. We're doing a very good job from a day to day perspective of DDS we're doing pretty good as far as getting people through our centers which is a very busy place. 99.85% of our customers across the state of Georgia are real ID compliant which leads the country. We look at this slide or when I present this slide typically what I'm trying to show is we have 67 locations around the state so it's pretty complex. Part of our business of roughly 900 employees that are currently staffed and most of them work out of those 67 locations and then the others are in our Congress headquarters. We have 10 CDL test sites around the state they are not they encompass the entire state I would say areas of the state where we have the least is in South Georgia and I'll talk a little bit about what we're doing in order to improve that and the investments again in general assembly as assisted us in trying to improve that certainly thank Governor Kent and his support. The OPP for again an investment that exceeds probably $10 million over the last three budget cycles in order to improve the number of locations where we test as well as the staff who are available to do the testing. We do have six of those 10 sites that operate five days a week that is Tuesday through Saturday, half day on Saturday. Those locations are gains field Dalton coming between Albany and Brunswick three open on four days a week. Roam Thompson and Millageville in one that's open only two days in Jackson but we hope to change that very soon with the increase or transition of that location from Jackson down to Forsyth. I should say the reasons why these locations operate on different days with different schedules is based on the amount of staff that's available for those the allocated staff that's been provided to those centers so that's why they operate on those specific days in Forsyth we will replace that location we're currently co located at a TST campus and down in Jackson they have been great as far as a partner we were at a private site that was needed in order to expand a local private business so we had to move from that campus where we operated a four day a week center over to TCSG and we've been operating sharing a pad they used a pad for training we use it for testing those two days again in in November and we're going to be able to do that. In November we will become fully operational in Forsyth that will then become a five day operating center versus a two day in that particular area we are also happy to announce and and certainly this is something that again has support through the general assembly the opening of Douglasville in June of 2024 Hazel Hurst of August of 2024 not sure why El Coney is listed is not a single day. We are expanding our site in Rome which would be an increase in the number of of number of test slots that will have available those investments just so that you guys are aware Forsyth that was a three it's an amortized lease of 3.357 million Douglasville is an investment of 4.825. The $1,000 Hazel Hurst of investment of 2,400,000 and the enhancements in Rome is an investment of 3,650,000 dollars. Certainly also one of the one of the goals of DDS has been over the last many years is to increase the number of CDL holders in the state. I happen to be first vice chair of the AMVA International Board this is something that is being that that's a part of the entire country. I don't think what's happening in Georgia is it's different than what's happening around the country and in my role as AMVA is first vice chair. I had an opportunity just last week to be out of state and speak with some of the industry leaders about the situations as it relates to the driver obviously. One of the things that we look at at DDS is how many drivers do we have in many cases how long they continue to be drivers because we know in this industry. If they don't have a situation like the gentleman from Coca-Cola described where they are at home and running over the day and then coming back at home at night that becomes a very strenuous and stressful work situation in many of those folks lead the industry. But today and this is an increase of roughly 10,000 over last or excuse me at the height of the pandemic where I'll discuss in just a few minutes a supply chain study and meeting that was held by governor Kim and what's been done by the department especially since that time. We have roughly 400,000 CDL holders in the state of Georgia. 13,000 of those are CLPs so those are permits and it will if these folks complete the portions of their test can transition over to becoming full license drivers. We have skills tested by DDS roughly 20,000 remember this is a two hour test has three components vehicle inspection basic control as well.

as the actual on the road test. So we work in cooperation with third party testers or providers. Those are the private folks who work in the industry in order to help a number of these folks also get test. I'll speak to the numbers and you see them there actually on this slide. The average age of the CDL, TriFranjorgas 50, 2.6 years of age, that's something that as we were looking at the data found to be very interesting. At our location currently we have 71 licensed testers. These are examiners who are able to give the test. Third party providers have roughly 96. And the third party testers is 96. The third party examiners is 186 and the CDL training schools regulated. This shows 20 but we had a new one added just in January, excuse me, in July of this year. So we now have 21 training schools that are regulated by the department. Back in 2000, excuse me, 2021, Governor Deel called together a group of government officials as well as private sector folks to look at this very issue that we're talking about. CDL driver shortage is obviously in the height of the pandemic from that executive order. He asked the DDS to help put together task force as well as a group, excuse me, a report to talk about how we can do more in order to combat the driver shortage. Since that time, we have established a CDL task force. Within our agency, we've worked with and contracted epidemiologists who was able to pinpoint and help to look at some of the data issues and specifically where we could pinpoint and work toward improvement. And of course, we've collaborated with a number of state partners as well as private sector partners that are not listed here. And I'll talk about some of the things that have come out of that task force. We did put together a response to the executive order that I believe has been provided to the committee in reference to areas in which DDS specifically could work in order to try and improve the number of drivers in the state. So there are roughly four things that the agency has been focused primarily on. First is increased efficiency in the ministering CDL knowledge and role seals tests by reducing applicant wait times. We've been forced what we call a hotbed. This is very interesting term from the standpoint of each test takes around two hours. But we know the last 30 minutes, 45 minutes of that test is on the road. So rather than waiting for a four to two hours slot before we bring a new driver onto the range in order to be tested, we bring that driver out at roughly an hour and a half, 45 minutes, 30 minutes to 45 minutes before the other test. Or as soon as that other driver leaves that carousel, this is increased capacity for us. This is also contingent upon staff members as well though. And as you know different than any other location in that work for shorters, this is certainly something that the agency has seen. We threw this effort though. This was during the pandemic specifically and coming out of the pandemic reduced the appointment wait times from eight weeks to less than two weeks. So that's an individual being able to go and get a slot in order to be tested when that within roughly a two week period. Again, we have to date 71, 71 CDL examiners across those 10 sites. If we were a fully staffed, it would be roughly 108. So we're down the difference between those two. When we bring on Douglasville as well as Hazelhurst, that number will increase to 127, I believe, 120, 127 examiners, license examiners, in order to affect the number of tests that we give. So that would be a tremendous increase when those two sites are up and running. We've also had a concerted effort in order to increase the use of the third party testers for the CDL road test. In other words, through a private public partnership, we are encouraging the number of third party testers to take on the responsibility and be a part of the solution as far as testing these drivers. We've reduced the fleet size for qualification for the third party testing for 25. In other words, prior to the implementation of the executive order response, you had to have a fleet of 25 vehicles in order to qualify to be a third party tester. We've since reduced that down to only having to have two trucks in order to qualify to be a tester. We've reviewed CDL schools eligible to apply to become third party testers. And we're certainly targeting support for low performing third party test sites, meaning that those sites that are only testing just a few drivers, we're trying to do everything that we can to enhance the number of drivers that they test. Our expansion, this is what we project. And of course, this is not a brand to account. A very good portion of what we've done over the last several years as well. So from 2022, monthly, roughly a thousand test slots, we've seen that increase to roughly 1,500 this year. And when we bring on those new sites next year, we expect that to increase to roughly 23, 2,384 test slots. Also, not shown in this is the fact that we have David Barrett here. David is the leader of our CDL travel team. They are sort of an off the books program. And they don't fit into this slot. So they can do roughly 200 slots test for month. This is a four person team that has been that go to locations where there might be back logs in a particular area. And they're able to work directly with the schools and enhance the number of test slots. And actually test them at their location versus having to come to one of our locations. So this is, again, a new strategy that we put in over the last two to three years. Certainly happy with David and that team and what they do in order to provide these services to the state. We've also modified our program used to reinstate lifetime CDL's squalifications. In the past, a lifetime CDL's squalification was just that, a lifetime. So a person who potentially had committed a felony in their 20s was then prevented from being able to at 40 plus perhaps get an opportunity to be a CDL driver. We've reduced that that wait time from lifetime to 10 years. So in order for us to enhance the number of people that could potentially come into this industry, we've given considerable opportunity to a new group of drivers who perhaps thought they didn't qualify in prior years. And certainly our last strategy, one of our last strategies. And we've done a few more things than this slide that actually portrays. But these are the bigger things that the department has been working on. Improving applicants access to credible resources, resources, to help them prepare. Typically, during late summers, I often get a call from a superintendents office. Many times the superintendent themselves about the ability for them to get bus drivers. And that's certainly something we have been trying to work with those schools in order to enhance along with many other types of drivers. But one of the things that was asked for is, one of the toughest part of the test is vehicle inspection. This is going around that vehicle and being able to identify things that ultimately might go wrong with that vehicle in order to keep it safe. As you know, CDL crashes now have become really, really a highly looked at from the media standpoint occurrence. There was a crash that occurred up in the Northeast where a CDL driver happened to be involved in a crash that killed seven motorcyclists. As a result of that, I had to, on behalf of Georgia, respond to the NTSB about what we are doing in the area of safety as it relates to the commercial driver. So there is a lot of regulation from the federal side as it relates to this program. But again, one of the things that was requested of us is, what can we provide better in order to give those drivers who are hoping to get in industry resource materials, learning materials, and help them to be better. And one of the things that we did was we had, we've had two town hall meetings November 14th of 2022, July 17th of 2023. We held both of those down in Central Georgia Technical College in Macon. We've had 262 combined attendees from the federal government, from those third party testers and examiners, CDL schools around state boards of education, technical colleges, city governments, as well as large companies. What have we done since that? We've created a commercial, we've enhanced our study guy for these drivers, as well as we have also created two videos. One is called Meet the Truck. The other is called Meet the Bus. And they're a very good hands on curriculum that allows for those persons who are hoping to become CDL drivers to essentially look at the video and become more familiarized with parts of the truck. Again, the vehicle inspection is a tough part of the test that we see many of those drivers failing at. And as those occur, what we have seen is, in your level of driver training, has also enhanced the number of people who are passing those tests from the first, from the, from since it's been fully incorporated. So again, the department is very focused on this area. We continue to hope to be focused on it. And certainly welcome partnership with the local technical colleges, as well as with private industry in order to enhance the number of drivers that we have in our state. Mr. Chairman, that's the end of the slide deck, but certainly here to answer any questions that you or the committee might have. Say we can do this without feedback. This mic has a little bit of feedback. I'm going to turn it over to Senator Islam. I think she had a couple of questions and then Senator Jans and we'll check the computer. Joe, yes sir. Commissioner, thank you for your comments today. I just had a couple of questions. So I heard you say that the DDS regulate the training schools, correct? Yes, that's correct. So if someone wanted to create a training school, they would have to come to your department. If they wanted to create a training school for CDL, yes, they would have to come through our agency. OK, what is roughly the timeline of how long it takes for that application to be processed for training school to be established? And of course, I did get comments from the last or previous meeting. And in fairness to the person that was here and expressed their concern about the time that it took, that one took way too long. We added two new schools in 20th, fiscal year 22. We added four, I believe, or five in 2022. And then we added four more in 2023. The average time, typically, for that individual to go through the process of submitting all their paperwork, getting one of our folks to go out and do the inspection. Again, this is done by CDL analyst. We were recently awarded two more of these folks in this past legislative session. That's a team of roughly eight people for the entire state. And we recently have them all hired, except for one. But it will take roughly six months if you had all of those people who were available. OK. And these work shortages that are affecting everyone, are they affecting your department's ability to process these applications? They are. They are. The starting salary of the CDL analyst is right at $39,000. The starting salary of an entry level driver examiner who does not have to test trucks is right at $32,000. So we're asking these folks as analysts not just to be fully aware of how to issue that particular license, but do the vehicle, excuse me, do the inspections that are required in order to become a third part of provider, which often is a more complex job. So that's what the average salary is. OK. Sounds like there's a domino effect, right? So if you guys don't have the workforce in order to process applications, and there's going to be a holdup on establishing these training schools, and then it just keeps going. So what do you think would solve? How do you think it would? What I'm trying to ask is what's the solution or solutions that you think would enhance your department's ability to hire more workers? Salary. OK. Salary would certainly assist more of those CDL analysts. Again, we were awarded two additional ones this past legislative session. But when you think about it, and we just hired one of those two additional ones, but roughly, if we have six, and we've had six, for since I've been at DDS, and that's since 2012, you're going to have at least two that's going to be missing at the proportion of the year. And they have to cover the entire state. OK. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. And, Commissioner Spencer, thank you for the presentation. Yes, sir. Just wanted to one thing that I noticed, you said the average age of a driver's about 52 years old? When we looked through the database, we thought it would be a little bit older, quite frankly, based on just our meetings, our CDL town halls, the folks there were coming out. But yeah, it's 52 years age of age. So why aren't younger people being attracted to the industry? I think a part of what's been expressed already today is we probably don't do enough education about how great of a workforce this can be for a young person. So with more marketing to those groups, perhaps this is an area that we can improve. Everyone is concerned about drivers as we don't erode for a extended period of time. Yes, sir. I know you all have truck stops. But how do you deal with continuing education and other issues that drivers may have and making sure that the roads are safe? Well, beyond the required medical certificate that's provided to us every two years, is that correct, David? There really isn't a remedial training for the CDL driver community. The only thing, once your license is a CDL holder, at that point, you just need to ensure that you have the medical ability to maintain that license. There's no additional testing beyond the initial testing. You think that was there? The only one that required that testing has that. Sorry. With the exception of the Hasmat, the Hasdr's material driver, those persons, they require additional testing. That's probably federal, correct? Is that a federal? I believe the federal is once every five years for us. Federal requirement wants every five years. Do you think having additional remedial training would save some of the fears that the public may have about drivers being on the road? I would consider myself a highway safety professional considering I've been 15 years with the governor's office for highway safety before coming over to driver services. We just don't see these drivers being overrepresented in the number of serious crashes. Obviously, the fatality rate could go up because of the size and weight of the vehicle itself, but they just aren't overrepresented. So do we provide any additional training if you will for those who may have been in some other field? I just don't see it bear out right now, the center in the data that these folks are overrepresented. Certainly, again, the impact of a crash they may cause could be more serious, but they're involved probably in fewer crashes than the regular non-commercial vehicle. And since you're talking to a bunch of legislators, what reforms do you think we need to make in the General Assembly to help this particular industry? We're from, again, the testing and training and regulation side. One of the things that we've done within our agency, again, to look at rule, which is how we were able to get from the lifetime's qualification down to the 10-year period. We are listening to every single individual who comes to us and makes a request as far as a rule change. We have, one of the things I advocated at the very first supply chain meeting with Governor Kemp is the fact that you have interest state drivers who can make a delivery, say, a flooring delivery in Dalton down the Bronx, but they can't drive right across the border up into Chalanooga, but that's a federal law change. Versus a state one. So many of these changes are probably not just at the state level. There will have to be some federal changes as well. And I know this is an area in which, again, Governor Kemp and his team have been advocating up in Washington. Thank you. You're welcome. Senator, does already have any questions? Thanks to you, Senator Jim, essentially just asked the same questions all the way. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I do have a couple questions, and I'm trying to be mindful of time. So I do think, I mean, it sounds like as we kind of produce a report, there probably are recommendations we should include in terms of the impact we do need to have on federal policy because I think we heard in our last meeting a lot of concerns from the industry just in terms of, I think, new federal regs that are just kind of being shoved down some of these companies' throats that are just creating greater work force challenges, and then they're trickling down to your agency to have to manage through those. Secondly, can you talk a little bit more just in terms of the short term and long term vision of your agency commissioner with, you know, the partnership with TCSG, I know historically in the past, you know, at least my thought or vision just based on experience out in our neck of the woods, you know, I know we have our CDL sites in our colleges, but how do we maximize the opportunity to where, you know, if I'm one of these companies that's two to 25 or whatever the number is, and I need to get a driver, get their CDL done, is there an efficiency to resources to where that company can basically go to the technical college and maximize the opportunity. I was, this is before your time, so this is not an issue I have with anything your agency has done now, but many years ago, where I mean in Dallas, we have a technical college, and then literally like a hundred yards away, there's a DDS office, and honestly, just in terms of efficiencies, it just seems a little silly. But I'm just thinking like, you know, long term in terms of maximizing the spider web network across the state to fill either gaps or, you know, help companies thrive, what's kind of the strategies or visions to kind of blend funds to maximize opportunity. First of all, you know, we've enjoyed a really great relationship with the technical colleges, and we work literally, Brent is working with their counterpart, Brent Bennett, is the head of the regulatory compliance at DDS, and Shabonda Leslie, of course, has had a governmental affairs and communications. And, you know, Commissioner Dozier, obviously, who is a former Commissioner of Driver Services, he and I started state government nearly the same time and the same agency 27 or so years ago. So, the cooperation is there. We're working very hard. This is the way that I look at the question that you ask is, there is a distinct difference in what we do and what the technical colleges do. We test, they train. So, they are really good at getting the training right for these drivers to come in and then be tested, and they are able to take the site to ensure that they are safely able to operate on the roads. But those are two different things they do take. You know, one of the great benefits of what's coming is a modernized CDL carousel, which would reduce the size and footprints of what it takes us a million dollars just to put pad down for them to test home, and of course for them to train on. But that footprint has been reduced, so that's one of the things that has come out of it. Shortage is over the last several years that I know FMCSA is working with states in order to incorporate the fair first modernized test site that DDS will have will be down in foresight this fall. So, again, we were able to put that one down with a little bit less cost. But again, we're testing their training. We will continue to collaborate. The private sector providers who are providing some of the training, again, that's an area that has to be regulated for safety reasons. The last thing that we ever wanted, and this is something that unfortunately we had we have had to do over the years, is selling a CDL or being compensated for a CDL is something that we want to prevent. And that's the other reason why salary is so important, because literally I am challenged daily with the fact that our examiners are often looked at, hey, can you sure I missed that one? Can I give you some compensation in order to get this license? That's a real issue that we all face. But again, we're on that testing side. They're on the training side. We think that there is a difference we know that the cost may be a little bit higher based on us both having to put paths down. But again, the great partnership that we have just down in Jackson shows they're testing, they're training two days a week on the same pad. We're testing two days a week on that pad. Yeah, I mean, the only comment I'll have, I think, I'll play a little contraryer and I may have work in health care. But if I have an individual who walks into the emergency room and you want to get them to a better place, but the person walks in and says, hey, I don't have a car and I don't have child care. And I can't figure out how, you know, that next step, it kind of goes to what I think Senator Jen is mentioning, is that if you co-late locate facilities number one, you know, when you come to appropriators and you say, hey, you know, I want to do, you know, A through Z, well, if you're co-locating just from a capital perspective, I would think those are, we're raising the amount of money also, we can do more, I think, across the state. So all I'm saying is, I think, from a co-location perspective, there's, I think there's greater efficiencies than having, you know, I hate to use the Dallas example, but I'm going to use the Dallas example because I think it's, it was, you know, a little silly. But I also think, from a continuing ad perspective, as we're seeing the changes, I think, right now in the industry, where we have a number of, you know, truck drivers that are wanting to go drive Amazon vans, or they want to do other things because of the quality of life. If they are going to make that change, then I think that's an enrollment opportunity, I think, for the technical college system, for them to do, you know, maybe something else. So I hear you, and I agree that they're separate, but I also think, too, there's ways that if we can integrate some of these programs with more efficiency and state government, I think it's going to create a bigger, you know, I'm not saying go take here and go spend over here, but I think relooking at the entire model in terms of, you know, impacting, especially when we talk about inner city needs, in a rural needs, and in my last comics, I know, we're way over time, and I want to get to the other two centers have one more follow-up question.

I know you did some public meetings in middle Georgia to get community feedback and from stakeholders. Is there an opportunity down the road to maybe do that in Atlanta or do it in Fullton or Decap County? Certainly, we can. Just because I know between the logistics hub of what I think Senator Jones is probably experiencing in his own district in particular I think is. We are glad to do it in those communities. We do it in central Georgia Tech because it's central to the state. We do have a lot of individuals that come down from Atlanta to be a part of those discussions. But we are certainly willing to do them here. Yes, sir. Thank you, Miss. Just one follow up. A question came up about technology and the use of technology in these automobiles and being these big rigs, if you will. And I asked a question because in the state 75 was my backyard and there was a horrific accident about four years ago and this driver was accused of watching television while he was driving. How do you incorporate those kind of measures into your training facilities? It's something that we've incorporated from the non-commercial side as well. As vehicles become more enhanced, the question becomes, can the driver is the driver efficiently knowledgeable to navigate it? And one of the things that we have, we try to work through this and this is a part of a national study with ANVA as well, where we're trying to ensure that we don't, you know, at one point, and this is to make my point really quickly, is at one point, we had our examiners tape a piece of paper on the navigation so that a person couldn't see that backup steering right. And they could turn over their shoulder and actually do it themselves. But as an industry, we started to recognize that, OK, these cars are going to get more sophisticated. So we don't allow the self parallel parking opportunity that many of the cars have. And I'm saying this from the non-commercial side because I think we're experiencing that now, which will happen with the commercial trucks as well. But we have to figure out how to integrate good testing within that increased technology space and ensure that these drivers, again, are educated and trained in order to be safe drivers. That's, we just have to figure out how to integrate the two. It's tough. I have a quick question. We'll let you go. My question was, you mentioned earlier, what was the average age of a commercial driver license? 52 in our state. 52. OK. And demographics, so like male versus women versus male. If I remember the statistics, it was more than 80% male. OK. So it sounds like we have a potential untapped labor market because 50% of the workforce are women. And we'll get the specific. We do have that demographic. I don't have it here with me. But I'll get that specific breakout of male versus female back to the committee. OK. No, that's good to know. Thank you so much. Thank you. So Commissioner, I'm just going to say, I know we're way over time to my fault. But I do want to thank you, your team, for all the information and this presentation was great, just the transparency, the data. Like we appreciate you. So we appreciate, you know, you're just kind of sitting on the hot seat for a minute. But, you know, the collaboration is important. Yes, sir. Thank you for helping solve the problems between what you've done and also the governor. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We're not perfect by an insurrection. But certainly, I think general assembly should know if there is an issue at DDS. I'm the first person that wants to resolve it. Thank you. Yeah, your response. Thanks, ma'am. I'm going to get us back on time. We'll make it up in the end. Justina Brown, B.Pro, B.Pro, Georgia. You're up next. And then we will shoot to have our next panel up at 1125. Welcome. Perfect. Next, we're going to make sure you talk to them. Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you, Chairwoman. Good morning, Senators. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you. Thank you. Good morning, Senators. I appreciate the opportunity to speak this morning. My name is Justina Brown. I'm with B.Pro, B.Pro, Georgia. I'm going to disinfect this. I can. There we go. All right. When Anna invited me to speak and she told me the topic, I told her, we could speak about this for a couple of hours. But I don't have that time anymore. I will take about 10 minutes and just focus on our program. I believe it's safe to assume that every single person in this room is interested in workforce. And that is our passion as B.Pro, B.Pro. One question that we may ask as workforce advocates is where would we be without our skilled workforce, our technicians, our healthcare workers, our truck-truckers, our truck drivers, and that's who we believe are the unsung heroes of our community. But unfortunately, that is not the perception of everyone. And so, B.Pro, B.Pro, our goal is to change the perception and to make sure that emphasis is given to those unsung heroes who we call our truck drivers, all of our skilled professions. And so, we take a mobile workshop across the state of Georgia. Here's a picture of it. And it's a 40-foot trailer. Inside of the trailer, we have gamified stations. We have simulators. And students get to have hands-on experience to various skilled professions. And commercial truck driving is one of the stations that we have inside of this mobile workshop and the students love it. There are many students who come aboard and they say, wow, I didn't know that various skills were needed or different things that you had to look out for in order to clear something while you're driving a truck. And so, we're excited that we can get them interested in truck driving as a career. B.Pro, B.Pro is a movement that started in Arkansas. And in 2020, Mr. Martin, with Cherokee Office of Economic Development, brought this program to Georgia. And our mission is simple, but it's powerful. And then we're trying to connect job seekers, specifically young students, to career opportunities and training opportunities within skilled trades. And so, all of that is because we understand that there is a stigma attached to skilled professions. We understand that there is a shortage in the labor. And we also understand that there is a skills gap. So we're extremely focused on building the workforce of tomorrow. And that's what we do with our mobile workshop. Now once the students come aboard our mobile workshop, what we do is we talk to them about the 15 professions that you'll see here. We let them know that these 15 professions are high growth, high demand. They're expected to have 10% or more growth potential in income. And so we tell them what those numbers are. And you'd be surprised how quickly you can grab a child's attention when you start talking dollars. All of a sudden, everyone's a math whiz. And so we tell them what they can make, how much money they can make. The professions that you see with red stars, I know it's... slightly small, but the ones with red stars are the ones where we do have simulators inside of our mobile workshop. And so after they go through our website, figure out how much money they can possibly make in all of these skilled trades, commercial truck driving, yes, being one of them, then we turn the loose at those stations. All right. The core of B-Pro B-Prowed lies our dedication to transforming the way that professions are viewed. Our focus encompasses parents, it encompasses industry leaders like yourselves, it encompasses community stakeholders, but our focus is on the middle and high school students. Those are the ones who we recognize are our future workforce. They're our future truck drivers. And this is information that we have from our impact during the last school year. We were able to get in front of nearly 19,000 students and that's across the state of Georgia. One of the things that you'll see on this slide is something called join the movement. So over half of those students signed up to take a survey and let us know what their careers of interests were and their plans after graduation were. And so we use that information in order to provide them with resources, give them information about local training opportunities either at a technical college near them or an employment opportunity in their area depending on the information that they give us during their join the movement survey. And so on the right side of this slide you'll see from last year surveys with join the movement the top professions of interest for students. Commercial truck driving did not make the list, but that's a number that we are trying to change. And everyone in this room is working on that effort. I know. From the bottom you see what we found during the last school year to be student plans after graduation. And I'm sure none of these numbers are surprising. We hear all the time that students immediately say after high school I'm going to a four-year university. And so 50% of the students did in the join the movement survey. That's what they told us. There was a 27% who said that they weren't sure. Those are the students who we send information about all of the opportunities that are available for them. And then their 12% that they were interested in technical college and 11% said they want to go straight to work. So with those students we send them all the opportunities within their region as well as apprenticeships that are available for them. Something else that we have on our website is a feature called find training and find jobs because we want those students who join the movement or others to be able to come on the website and so there's a code figure out where they can get trained in commercial truck driving or where they can find employment in commercial truck driving or other skilled trades. So I didn't add the QR code and I wish I had. But I invite anyone who has a training program to add your training programs to our website and anyone who has a job opportunity to do that as well. Something that we have coming up with our program is a new mobile workshop because of all of the booking requests that we've received. We're not able to get to all of the schools and students that we'd like to across the state of Georgia. And so with this mobile workshop it'll be bigger. We'll have space for more simulators, more stations and that's going to be coming out in the spring. So it's being manufactured right now. We're getting with partners right now and we're trying to fill up all of the stations that we want to represent skilled trades on that unit. And as you'll see in this picture commercial truck driving will be represented. We will have an L3 Harris simulator and we've decided that was one of the first ones because we've heard from other states that have the 18-wheeler because we didn't have it yet. But that's the one that students love. And so this gives them a realistic hands-on experience of what it's like to sit inside of an 18-wheeler and to have those three screens around them to be able to actually get more of a real life experience. There are other stations represented on this screen. I promise to breathe. I was. If you have any questions I can take them. Thank you and Miss D's awesome. Yes she's awesome. So that's pretty cool. Questions, thoughts? So thank you for educating our youth about different opportunities of where they can work. What do you know how many other programs such as yours there are operating in Georgia? With in Georgia we hold the license for B-ProBie Proud. So there's only one B-ProBie Proud within Georgia and we'll have the two mobile workshops. Across states there's one in Arkansas, one in South Carolina, one in Tennessee, launching next week. Okay. Great. And then another question I had was the commissioner earlier mentioned how the average age of someone that has a CDL is 52 and so we have an opportunity to get more younger people wanting to get into commercial truck driving. So I noticed it was number 11 on the list. Do you know why that it isn't higher? Okay. A lot of the skilled trades that we present to them they're not opportunities that they think of. They may know someone their family who is driving but it's a much older person. It's not someone who started out right up high school. Okay. Who went straight into that profession and so we're letting them know you can go right down the street, go to your technical college, get your CDL and start driving right after high school and this is how much money you can make. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Awesome. Senator Dizzle, do you have any questions? I know Mr. Woodman. Awesome. Just need to thank you so much and I'm sure we'll be talking soon. Stephen Ferguson, you're up next. CIO of TCSG. Good morning. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Senator Chairman for having us and letting us present. Good to see and see all the activity ahead of us here. Lots of things are collaborative and it would be evident as we talk through here I think is evident as a DDS spoke as well. The collaborative work that Georgia is doing to solve this problem because it's not a TCSG problem, it's not a DDS problem, it's not a Coke problem, it's all of our challenge right and we're working hard to solve that. We'll take some time to talk to you a little bit about what we're doing to build Georgia's CDL or force pipeline. It is a pipeline that's needed. There's just as many that are retiring as there are coming into the job. There's more in some cases that are exiting that are coming in and that's why we're here today. Let's get started. We want to talk to you a little bit about demand and let's talk talking about what is the quantity of jobs or the quantity of jobs here in Georgia, what is the demand overall and then how are we working to address that. In 2023 today there's almost 92,000 jobs for CDL drivers at Georgia based companies. Because I mean there's not more jobs here. There's a lot of companies that are not based in Georgia that are also hiring some of that 401,000 licensed drivers. But there's 92,000 according to Burning Glass MC now lightcast if you follow this data analytics. There's 92,000 jobs there. That is outpacing the national average by roughly 20% for any state region of this size. What does that look like and where higher the national average, 20 to give you some numbers there just kind of on a graph to see what that growth has done. Because that bottom line, that blue line, that dash line there that is looking at a projection and projected growth. But as you see not only is Georgia a much larger employer of or companies in Georgia, much larger employer of CDL drivers or projected to widen that gap in the years to come. That's because of the ports, the inland ports, the business and industry that's here. There's a much higher demand for moving products and goods across this state than any other state our size. Again going back to the posting demand. We talked about there's 91, 92,000 jobs. But every month there's 2,200 jobs hitting the boards. Hitting indeed, hitting monster, hitting whatever job board you look at. There's 2,200 new jobs and those are all unique and that's outpacing any of those states as well of our size. What that means is there is some turnover. There's a lot of growth and expansion. As you can tell from the previous graph, we're projected to hit well over 100,000 jobs within just two years and it's going to keep growing from there. Getting back at some of the data, there's 17,000, almost 18,000 unique job postings just this year. But what's really telling here is there's 1,670 different Georgia employers competing for those CDL drivers. What that tells us as an educator is we are working to serve almost one company per graduate we have coming out of a technical system. We've got to keep ramping that up. If we're going to meet the needs of every single one of these, the average job duration for a posting is up to over 33 days. If you're trying to move products and services, I know our friends at Coke talked earlier, our friends from DDS spoke earlier. If you're posting jobs and you need somebody right now and you got to think about getting them a month later and then on board and go through the process, that's a long time to wait. So how are we working together to do that? Right now we have 37 different training sites out across Georgia through the help of legislature through Coke, bottling their donation. We've been able to expand that. We've been able to retrofit many of these sites. We've also got more sites on the way. There's seven planter in progress. And all those plan sites, that does not mean they've been funded, but they're planned. They've got documents, they've got drawings, they are ready. They're shovel ready type projects. But several of those are also in progress and being built in communities right now. We spoke just a little bit ago, Senator Jones, about the one that broke ground two, two, three weeks ago. I mean, very recent two, three weeks ago, just in his district. We've got one out in Waco that's nearing completion now. And I say nearing, I don't know what that distance looks like. We'll just do this and count it good, but it's coming along. But there's more and more of them that are popping up all over because there's demand all over the state. So at 1600, 90 different employers, they're everywhere. It's not an orch order problem, a south order problem. They are everywhere and there's demand. We pride ourselves. We're 22 colleges with 88 campuses. If you look at that number out there, roughly half of those campuses are going to have a CDL training site on them. More than 30 miles out of the state. We can get the workforce out there. We've got to get them in the door, get them enrolled, and then get them on the road. What does the enrollment look like? Since 2021, CDL, demand has grown. We saw that through the numbers for job postings. The enrollment has also followed. There's two different types of enrollment within TCSG. There's credit enrollment. That's the tech ed program, if you think about those where you sign up, you're going to college. You're getting a technical shift of credit. What else have non-credit enrollment? What else are customized contract training? Working with business and industry employers like Coca-Cola, bottling to customized programs. Sometimes these are retraining programs. Some of them have been out of the market for years and needs a refresher course. In other cases, not in this number because this is actually trained CDL drivers, we're doing a lot of testing as well. We're helping out meeting that testing need. Overall, if you look from 22 to 23, we grew by 24. We grew by 24% on the credit side, roughly on the non-credit side. We had over 2900 graduates, CDL drivers, turned out and put into the workforce pipeline just this year, just as past year, just in the summer. We're working hard to expand that. The way we're getting there, this program is Hope Career Gun eligible. It is a high demand career. If you want to be a CDL driver in Georgia and you qualify for Hope Grant, there's different types of qualifications. If you qualify for Hope Grant, there's a few things you got to meet there. High school graduate, almost 100% of the tuition and fees is paid for. In part because Hope Career Grant for CDL drivers has an additional add-on to it. As of this last letter-slave session, TCSG and GSMC, or approved to award $1100 on top of Hope Grant to CDL program in release. That extra $1100 covers all but just a tiny little fraction of a few dollars. The average student pays around $2,000 to $2,100 within TCSG for a credit-based enrollment. With Hope and Hope Career Grant, there's $2,000. There's a little bit of it going to cover some drug testing or something maybe an exam that's going to be out of pocket for that student. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the $1 million from Coca-Cola to expand the program. That was critical last year when they came to us and asked, how do we get more capacity? It's faculty. You heard earlier. You look at the salaries needed to cover those that are doing exams and analyzing those third-party test providers. Same thing on TCSG style. One of the hardest things to do is get people to the job and secure that funding to make sure you can grow a program, especially when you're starting up something at a new facility. You've got a brand new pad, so getting that faculty on board, and that's what we used a lot of those dollars for in that donation from Coca-Cola was to expand our capacity through some equipment purchases, but funding that first year of faculty. I believe, and presidents are here, and they'll be up next. I believe every single one of those faculty members that was funded is still on board with us. There might have been some turnover, but I hope they're still on board with us and continue to put their training and skill set in the fight in creating and expanding this pipeline. We also had years funds last year. The Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund. Those funds came to us at a critical time when we were looking to expand CDL, but we're looking to expand the footprint. We're able to use and leverage those Gears funds to resurface facilities to actually build training pads. In some cases, we had training happening, and that wasn't a parking lot of one of our technical colleges, so that actually get a full-scale pad and facility there. That helps you grow and expand the number of seats you have available to those students. But we also used it to buy and modernize some of our fleet of trucks. During this time, we've also expanded into an automatic transmission training program. So it's a shorter-term program, and it's a different licensure for that. But those trucks, obviously they're a little bit different than the manuals. Those trucks are some of what we were able to pick up in an effort that came out of the Gears funding. A couple of the things we talked about, 24% and roll-up growth from 22 to 23%. But another big component here is the placement and job placement. Students, parents, influencers, whether that be a counselor or a wife or someone else, a mentor in someone's life, they want to know that if you go invest some time, CDL, that can be an eight-week training program. If you go invest some time, but there's a job waiting on their end of it, we all do. Right, if you can go do a training class, you can do something. There has to be something in it for you. I'm proud to say that this past year, we just finalized the data yesterday, that 95 is actually 95.4% of all of our CDL graduates are working in field. Now, some of them are probably working in some related fields too. They may be working in logistics and other things, but 95% that is roughly 5, 6 percentage points more than the average for all of our students. 99.4% of all of those CDL graduates are working, or at least working in a capacity where we can track them and see that that's UI data, that's surveys from the colleges. There are sometimes you got a few students who fall off the radar or may have graduated, went into the military, that can be a lot of things that take them off the radar. But of those that we can track, 99.4% are working in 95.4% working in field. And proud of those numbers because that means the work we're doing is directly feeding into the workforce. One thing that came up earlier when you're speaking with EDS, and we talked about a little bit of those challenges of getting people, and I'll take questions here to say, but those challenges of getting people to do this job. And one of the biggest challenges we have here within the state is going to be keeping up with that salary demand. We've got truck drivers and truck driving instructors who are being picked up by business in industry because if you can go drive a truck from his entry and be home overnight, you can go drive the Amazon trucks. There's a lot more jobs than just that over the road, long haul trucker. And so not only are we helping supply the pipeline, we're competing with the pipeline for this truck, for these instructors and faculty and staff. So that's one of the things that is still a challenge, and why things like gear grant, things like the Coca-Cola donation, make a big difference. And the funding that came in last year for the legislature through the House, the Senate, the governor's office that recognized the additional cost of these high demand programs and high cost programs that we have. There was an additional $8 million that went into the TCST line item specifically for high demand high cost programs that helps ensure that we do have the funding to pay the instructors to expand capacity to grow these programs. And I think I'm going to go back this one there because I just love seeing those numbers. I think those numbers tell that story that that investment is paying off or growing exponentially. You should have a handout there at your desk. Thanks for handing those out. If you didn't get one, you want a digital copy, a senator's on the line, I'll make sure I send a digital copy and I'll send you the updated version of that. We can make sure you get a copy of it. But that gives you some brief overview of not only what we're doing, but where we are. And if you look on the back, it has a nice map there of the sites that are current. That's changing about every month of there's plans going in, there's things that are completing for those sites. You can take a look there and on the front side you can see a little bit of what we're doing, what the current trends are. And happy to take and answer any questions. Thank you for your comments today. Questions that I have is, so I did not know that this is a hope, you could get a hope scholarship or a grant, hope grant towards you.

So if he wanted to be a truck driver, so I think that's new information for me to know. And then I was wondering how long has that been available? So CDL was one of the original 50. I think it started out with 15. It's been to 17 and now 18 areas. It was one of the original 15. It's been around for a long time. I'm going to take a wild guess and say eight plus years. That might be, you could fact check me and I'll be totally wrong. But I'll look that up and make sure I get you exact time frame. But it is an amazing opportunity. No, I think so too. I was asking because I mean, I graduate high school in 2008, which I'm aging myself. But I didn't know about that then. So I was wondering what the timeline was on that. And the other question I had was, I think you kind of answered it. But the 24% increase of graduates from 2022 to 2023, is that directly correlated with the investment that the state has made with $8 million or anything that you might want to make. 2022 to 23 is directly correlated to the gear funds, the Coca-Cola investment, and those state funds. Now those state funds, $8 million came in to this fiscal year budget for 24. And so we were working on, and presidents are here in the room, working on a focused effort in enrollment in the high demand areas. So Commissioner Dozer and team met across the entire state with everything more presidents and their staff and addressing these high demand areas. We saw it from legislature. There was some specific funds in the last year's budget, two into 23 budget, and aviation in other areas that were specifically there to help reinforce the need for a workforce in those areas. And so the investments from the state, absolutely. The funds from the governor's office through the gear grant were critical to expanding that capacity, modernizing equipment, getting additional equipment. And this $8 million that came in this last year into this fiscal year's budget is going to help reinforce that. And there's still a gap there. There is still a gap between what actually cost that student and what it costs us to deliver that training. But we are working to bridge that gap and those investments are critical to do that. That's great. I don't think I have any other questions here. Oh, and the last more, I guess this is more common in observation, but it sounds like from DDS to you that there is a worker shortage in terms of folks wanting to stay in those jobs because they're competing with other high paying jobs as well. Oh, absolutely. We have to work on salaries as a state. I mean, it's every job position. It's everything we're constantly competing with private sector. That's not new. That happened. It exacerbated by the pandemic and the inflation and the things that kind of came along with that. But certainly, that's one of the things that we are working diligently on is how do we drive salaries that meet market demands and how do we retain that talent? Because sometimes retain the talent is not always monetary. There's great benefits of working with the state. There's retirement systems. A lot of things you don't get in private sector. But for a lot of these folks that are getting into it, that allure of a big paycheck is one of those pieces. A big part of that, though, is, as I said earlier, and that $8 billion is a part of that. It's bridging that gap between what it cost us to deliver the training and then what we can bring in and revenue. And so that's a big help there. OK, thank you. I did want to answer. I was hoping you were going to ask. I know you asked earlier. I talked with a commissioner there. The A, or not the age range, the percent of females in the market here in Georgia is around 7%. 7% female drivers. What you might be surprised of is we're about 1 and 1 half percent higher than the national average of female drivers. That's not reassuring. But it's 7%. That does mean there's a huge opportunity to attract and train folks at area. And it's just one of those things that we have an outreach and effort to bring in folks from all demographics, one of these high demand careers. But that's one of the things that awareness can certainly help. Yes. Lack of education about this job is what I've been learning. And especially towards the female demographic, I think there's huge potential there. Yeah, we talk about manufacturing. I think it happens here too. Manufacturers start dirty, dangerous. And sometimes dull gets that on. The four Ds is what the perception is. And it's really none of those today, right? But I do think that truck driving gets some of the same things as you get. There's dirty, dangerous. And if it's in the dirt, but also that dull piece is, people have a misconception of what the jobs actually are. And so it only is educating the public. But it's also educating those that are influencing these students in youth today that is getting the moms and dads and the counselors of the high school teachers involved. Be probably proud. It's a great opportunity for that. It shows people what modern day manufacturing, what modern day CDL, what modern day tech jobs are. Right. That's what Justina mentioned earlier. Most 18 adults don't have someone to talk to you about truck drive. They don't. They don't. Maybe it's an uncle. They don't like or something. We don't see him. He's driving. I think he's going to get some more. So let me ask a couple of questions. I want to go a little bit further on Senator Islam's question. So do we know are there any female owned trucking companies in Georgia? And it's so how many? I don't know the answer to that. That's a great question. I will invoke the power of our research team to do some research there. I would be interested in Senator Jen just mentioned one. So I mean, I would be interested to hear from maybe those owners just from that personal experience. And our team will see if we can research that. But I think to Nebula's question, I think that's something we should investigate further. One other question in terms of the job posting slide, employers competing. So I think big picture we've been talking about, in some cases, large companies have job postings or recruiting or whatever. In all this data, where do owner operators fit in? So literally, me, the trucking company, owner, and my four member crew or five member crew, and I think we heard from one the other day when we were in high-room. Where do they fall into this ecosystem of job postings and recruitment that basically are honestly kind of the backbone of many cases, the supply chain. When we're thinking about rural communities, urban communities, the companies that are basically kind of on the verge of being extinct, because they've either priced insurance price pressures, inflation pressures, fuel pressures, all these things that maybe we don't have the opportunity like if I'm a Coca-Cola or someone. But how do they fit into this whole supply chain piece when we talk about needing drivers and in some of them? I know some of it's, they're more impacted in some ways because of federal regulations. And there's some things that we need to, again, change. But from your perspective of maybe folks that are leaving the technical college, and maybe they're going and working for that mom and pop trucking company in South Georgia right out of when they graduate. Yeah, so I'll comment a little bit on that. I know my colleagues from the technical college system here will have some comments as well up on the next panel. But just a couple of the biggest challenges there. One is insurance. If you're going to a small mom and pop or owner operator type scenario, and you're right out of school, so to speak, just got your CDL. Insurance is going to be a big barrier for you. If you are under the age of 21, the federal motor carrier legislation and your ability to transport interstate product is going to be a barrier for you. In Georgia and anywhere in the state, you can pick up a load of anything from the port in Savannah. You can drive it all up the four-oval four. But you cannot cross that state line and go over into Tennessee. It's just not possible, right? It's just the federal motor carrier legislation until you're 21 years old. If you are a brand new graduate out of one of our programs, and you get offered a job on the mom and pop type environments, may not be able to get insured. Until you have a year, you're going to have two years of driving experience. That's a barrier. Our team at System Office and within the colleges have met with the yes, met with insurance commission. Those are all things that are being explored and what does that look like and what does a solution look like. I don't think there is one right now. But those are challenges because you do got away the safety aspect of that for a brand new driver. There are some of the larger carriers that have training programs internally where they ride along and ways self-insured where they can get experience for those drivers. That is certainly a challenge. And they are that mom and pop that owner operator is disproportionately disadvantaged at the very beginning of that. However, our workforce pipeline piece and I can go back and pull more of the data, we have graduates working for, I can't say every one of those 16 or 9 employers, but graduates working for hundreds of different employers across the state. So we're filling the need for those owner operator and those small type operators. But we're also working diligently to fill that need of the larger providers. Do you know what the average age of a student enrolled in a CDL program in TCSG is currently? We know 52 is the average age of who commissioners, Spencer, Cies and his licensing. What's the average age of the program or the student in Georgia? So I'll have to pull that specifically to CDL program for all students, roughly 26 years old. That may vary within the CDL program. Our colleagues here with the Techno College system. So we're not talking in 18 or 22 year old necessarily. We're talking somebody who could be in that 46, 52 age range coming back to school. Okay. Yeah, more than half of it, if you look at the MC data again, that lightcast data, more than half of the CDL jobholders, not necessarily the CDL license holder, CDL jobholders, are over 45 in Georgia. Roughly 25% of them are over 55 in the nearing retirement. So that average age of 52 holds, but there's a lot of them that are on that leeward side of retirement. And that's gonna cause just the same struggle. You know, we saw during the pandemic, those that could retire dead, those that could change and move into the careers dead. That kind of wave of change is going to be systemic for some amount of time. That's why it's important to keep growing the pipeline and growing those numbers because the need to backfill these jobs is much higher every year. So let me ask two more questions. I'm sensitive at the time. So on one of the slides, you have seven planned or in progress sites. And I know y'all work around the clock on these. So as one becomes shovel ready, or gets to the place where the one in DeCab County opened, what is the average to basically from planning? And I know, fundings evolve and I'm gonna get to YMS in this question. But once you plan it and you say we need it, I mean on average, like how long is it taking? Because if we're sitting in this room today and we say there's a work, and I've had this conversation with Commissioner Dozer, we're saying there's an issue. All the chambers of commerce is there saying there's an issue. Coca-Cola says there's an issue. I go back to the Russell McMurray example of, when a bridge collapses, we can turn around on a dime and build, reconstruct a bridge. So my question goes to, if you have seven or seven plus facilities that are identified, designed, or ready to go, why are we not accelerating, or can we accelerate opening those facilities if we know there's a workforce shortage to close these gaps? Because it seems like government and bureaucracy, not Yols fault, but it's just kind of like getting in the way because that's inherently how we operate as a state, but how do we make that more efficient? If really we're saying hey, there's a need, and everybody's screaming, saying we need workers, but we're literally taking our time and opening these because oh, there's a budget issue. Like well, can we reprioritize the budget? I'm gonna try to answer some of that question. And I like my job in here almost 23 years, but maybe some of it I can't answer. But I answered as much as I can. I mean, we can cut things and make things happen. We'll do that in different conversations. So a couple of questions there. A couple of questions within that one. The first one is four of the sites that are on this seven plan are actually currently under construction. The one in Columbus is right on the verge of wrapping up. West Georgia I think is breaking ground. Okay, I was thinking Columbus, and I said that breaking ground, the one in Georgia Peatmont has broken ground. The timeline on actually turning that up, though, it can take a close to a year, six months to a year of getting everything graded and poured and building on site, all the other things like that. It takes time. I'll tell you one of the biggest challenges of actually starting a brand new program is getting trucks. We every single month are buying trucks or approving them through the state board process. And sometimes we're waiting or running out to get a used model because it just came available. If we don't act now, it will not be there tomorrow. And if you want to buy brand new ones, I think it's 12, 18 months out at a minimum. And in many cases, I think freight liner and some of the big ones, they sold out of like the next year's model already. So you can't even get in line until they open that ordering section up again. So those are barriers. But how do we accelerate these? We go through the process, similar to every other agency of there's projects that come up, every college submits a project. It goes before the legislature, the ones that there's priority projects based on the number we get. And then every project goes forward. I'd say CDL is a part of many of those, as well as manufacturing and all the other, high demand industries here. But it does go through the legislative process. Things like the gear grant were really kind of a one time infusion that allowed us to do a lot of projects all at once because those were specific and pitched to fund very in demand areas. And that let us get a lot of them started. However, when you're out there and you're bid in contracts, everything else, and you're in the middle of a work for shortage across the board. I'm talking about pandemic time period there of getting those, those took some time to get started. So you're sharpening the fruits of the mail as they're coming online. I think Columbus is the last one that'll come online from that funding. But yeah, we're working to follow the process. Sounds like the process could be upgraded, but we'll talk about that later. Commissioner, that was your own available. I want these people to succeed. And I mean, I won't y'all to succeed too. But I mean, I think to what Senator Jones even just alluded to, I mean, like, the cost of raw products is going up. I mean, I've seen projects delayed and just transparency. I chair Dr. Newcombe's Foundation Board. So I live through his projects and did some pretty awesome projects. But I also think too, just when we think about big picture, like if there's a way to accelerate projects, even if you've got to incentivize or do whatever, I mean, in this world we're in now, I mean, I think, if there's this huge need, I mean, there's a way to do it. I mean, just speaking from somebody in the private sector, I think there's probably a way to do it. And then last question, and then I'm going, y'all don't need to hear me talking anymore. I said this at the last meeting, and this is more commentary, you don't have to respond to this, because I don't want to put you or commissioner on the spot. But when it comes to, there is a funding gap for high demand. I know there's a gap. There has been a gap. I honestly think an applaud y'all for being very good. Physical stewards of your budget. But if we go back over a few years, I mean, the agency overall has experienced the net cut. And so from my standpoint, and I'm not going to speak for the other senators, but from my standpoint, is that if we're going to be serious about high demand, and we're going to be serious about putting more drivers on the street to drive trucks, I would think at some point, this gap that exists is going to get fully funded. Like we do most things in education, whether it's QBE or Hope or whatever. But I think there needs to be a movement in that direction. And again, it goes back to, what are our priorities, and how does that tie to the economy? And I know y'all have done a great job. I mean, this is not a negative to the commissioner, and I love him the death. But I think at the end of the day, the legislature, the governor's office, everyone, I think we need to make it more of a priority and make sure that there are new gaps. So next time you make this presentation, or when you come to appropriators with y'all's budget in January, on the screen, we know that when you say, would you say additional 8 million? This really isn't an additional 8 million. It looks like on paper, but it's really not. I mean, I'm just going to say it out loud, the obvious. But I'm hopeful in the future we can fix that. Because I think between this agency, and I again appreciate Commissioner Spencer coming, I think in terms of state government, these are the two nexus of this crisis in terms of workforce that's feeding back to the private sector. And my concern is that, and I think even I've heard Senator Doe's all say this in the past, how we're using those private examiners and those private trainers and all that, how it kind of wraps into this ecosystem. I think we've got to be sensitive to and make sure there's good and bad actors. But also too, every time we have a large company come to Georgia, there's a trucking demand, there's a workforce demand. But if on paper, we're not funding it at that same level, we're going to have a bigger crisis on our hands because the companies are going to stop coming. And so anyway, I usually, the one who says the things people don't want to say. But Stephen, thank you for coming. I appreciate everything. And we're going to move to the next panel. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. We're going to take a quick two minute break and then we'll get started. Thank you. All right, we're going to start back up about 30 seconds. We're going to get started. Senator is alums experiencing a real life supply chain issue with her wedding dress. She's going to get me later. I'm going to be in so much trouble. We'll talk about that later. We're going to hear from our college president in leaders on this discussion furthering the conversation from Mr. Ferguson. I'm going to turn it over to my esteemed friend, mentor, Dr. Ron Newkin, the president of chatty tech. No offense to the other college presidents, but this is the greatest technical college in Georgia. I'm very biased. Your senators can yell at me later. I also like Senator president post too because I once got to represent them. I also love Northwestern, but chatty tech is my backyard. Dr. Newkin, I'll clean up my mess later. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think. I prefer to say that we're in the company of four great technical colleges. The fifth one in the audience about to come up after us. And there's 17 other peers around the state. Right? Yes. And I want to thank you first, Mr. Chair, members of the committee for having this study committee. I think you put in a spotlight on something that is critical. Georgia is the number one place to do business, the legislative branch, the executive branch, the technical college, the technical college, the technical college, the technical colleges are doing everything they can to help make sure that remains the same, continues to grow and be a bragging point forever and ever. In the first hearing, and you heard a little bit of it alluded to today, you talked about things that are rang a bell with us in this sense. Our enrollment, our first job is, as it is with any organization that has customers, is to say, how do you keep what you already have, and then how do you increase it? Well, I think that first hearing focused more on the issues of how do you keep what you have, and this second committee has transitioned more to, what are the things we can do to increase that supply? And the first one you talked very clearly about issues of legal and insurance issues, government regulation, things within the industry that maybe could be tweaked to, you know, as mentioned several times, and again, today, to have folks be perhaps a little closer to home a little, a little more often. And how do you do that? How do you drive a truck halfway, and then have somebody from the west coast come meet it? Those kinds of innovations, how long does it take to my words, not in the vernacular? Attach a detach, a trailer to a truck. How much waiting time is there? How much time is there to pick up your load? How much time is there to get it unloaded? But I saw all those kinds of things being considered, and today we're talking more about how do we increase the supply? You've got, in my humble opinion, a great panel of folks here from Technical Colleges, and again another one after us to talk about some of the issues. It's, as we go down this table, we're going to self-introduce. I am Ron Newcomb, the president of the J.A.D.H.E. Technical College. I have with me Jason Tanner, the executive vice president of Instruction. And you see, I'm smart enough to bring somebody that knows more about the details, Senator, about how the, and I think you find the others do as well. First, we want to go down this table, they're self-introduced, but we want to talk a little bit about the ranges that we have. Where do we offer this? At Chattahuechitaq, we've got the one location at the North Metro Campus. We've got nine campuses, including the Bean-Built Aviation Training Academy at the airport at Paulie. We've got the one location at the North Metro Campus. It's central to all the counties that we serve. We do poll students in from a variety of locations. And our enrollment at that site is going up now. We were impaired by, it was, that campus was built on an old poultry farm. And sometimes new drive trucks relentlessly over certain parts of the parking lot and the driving range. You begin to see some, some things from the past. We had to redo the, the driving range. And so it's been done now. We're pleased, pleased to say. And of course, we all had the COVID error. And at a time where we were trying to be so very careful, how do you, how many, how many students can you put inside the cab over truck for how long for instruction on the, on the range actually driving range? Actually driving the vehicle. But we're, we're covered now. We're, we're moving forward. A second range has been requested at the, at the Pauling Campus, with, with which you're very familiar, but at, at, at that Pauling Campus. And we're excited about that moving to forward through the process as it may. And that'll increase the accessibility. And you say, what a successability matter. Because, because I think at each stage of this.

The committee has been asking the 64-dollar question is, how does what we're talking about this particular minute affect the supply of truck drivers? That's what it's about. And we think accessibility does affect the supply, so we're eager to get a second location, so some of our peers have more. And we'll talk a little bit about, we're very quickly what we do in terms of credit, non-credit, training. I'm going to turn that over to Jason and to speak to you very quickly and then we're going to pass it on down and they're going to tell you how many ranges they have and what they do. Thank you, good morning. I'm Jason Tanner, the Executive Vice President for Instruction at Chattachitech. We do have that one location, like a lot of our sister institutions, we have the capacity to test our own students after our program's credit and non-credit, so that does release some of the pressure and schedule time with DDS. It does add to some inefficiencies that they experience as well, having to have faculty who test and therefore not teaching those students. It's been mentioned several times, this isn't something you can train 100 students at a time. So when we commit to full-time instructor position at the college, this is not an instructor who's going to have, think classroom full of students, that kind of capacity. We run six week long daytime courses, we run eight week long night time sessions during semester so that students can have the opportunity to do both. However, either way that's a very long commitment for a student. It's four or ten hour days during that week, across those six weeks, which obviously would add a burden to the student of time. Regardless of cost, that's a significant time away from potential employment, family and other commitments. It's a nine credit hour program, so that is a reality that all of us would face. It's not something that the students, good for the students, they're not taking core classes. So the colleges are paid for nine credit hours, not a equivalent of an associate's degree. It's the one program in our system that does have non-standard tuition, so we charge a little more for commercial truck driving per hour than we do in other places. And then in the non-credit world, we based on what that customer would need, so that can be a testing, it can be recertification or entire training course. So all of us would have that capacity to do it, and I think all of us will speak to similar inefficiencies and then struggles we have with staffing and then finding students. Right, I think I'm on. Great. Good morning, everyone. Are we still morning? Good afternoon, everyone. You're Landa Buford, Vice President of Economic Development at Atlanta Technical College, here on behalf of Dr. Victoria Seals, our president. Atlanta Technical College actually had some challenges as it relates to the CDL program. We are one of the sites that was on that list of planned CDL driving range and testing sites. In the Metro Atlanta region, we are the only technical college that does not have a driving range, dedicated driving range, or testing site location. You heard the comment made, I think, by Stephen about using parking lots and anywhere and everywhere that you could find a facility to do your CDL driving, and that's what we've been doing, unfortunately, for many years. We've provided great training services, but have not had that dedicated location. Thanks to the state, we received $3.2 million within the past couple of years for a dedicated CDL lot, and our Fulton County Board of Commissioners has granted us 25 acres of land for us to build that. We're hopeful that this fall, we will be breaking ground on our Center for Transportation and Logistics for that. We currently train, as Jason mentioned, on the credit and non-credit side of the college, roughly about 100 graduates in our CDL program annually, so we know once we have that testing site available, that we can double that number, and probably even quadruple that based on getting the trucks, of course, that we're going to need to add to the fleet, as well as being able to do our testing on the sites ourselves. We currently now go to two of the DDS locations, and as was mentioned before, the backlog is tremendous, and we're looking forward to the change of that time. It usually takes our students at the start of the training class, we have to schedule those testing at that point immediately, so that by the time they're completed within the six to eight-week period, they're able to have that testing. Then having for bids, if they have to retest, then that is another backlog situation that we face as well with the students. We're excited about the opportunity for our Center for Transparency and the Little Logistics, because not only will it be CDL, but it will be supply chain warehouse, as well as diesel mechanics, so it will be a full service facility that we'll be using. Thank you. I'm going to pick on that data point, and not to point at my DDS friends, but isn't that an opportunity in terms of integration to where, if you had a way to manage that yourself, because if somebody's flunking out of the course or doing something else, I assume you lose that space in line. That is correct. If you want you to schedule, if... You just put another student in the... We've been trying to work closely with DDS to be able to do that, so for some reason someone drops out, we try to put somebody else in the slot, so they've worked with us to be able to do that, but it's that retesting component that's also a big challenge. Okay, opportunity. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Heidi Pomp, I'm president of Georgia Northwestern Technical College. We serve the nine counties of Northwest Georgia, and we have six campuses. Finally we have one range at our Walker County Campus, which is in Rock Spring, and we have a range that we transitioned our parking lot in our Polk County Campus into a DDS approved site as well for training. That currently is working with our line worker program and restricted CDL that they receive, but we're expanding the opportunity there through our non-credit side, which is internship partnerships with corporate partners that sponsor employees that they have to come. They do online classroom theory. They also have a mentor assigned to them. They get the road training through their employers. That is one way. We do the pre-check, the one-on-one pre-check list on our Polk County Campus, and then we also go over any kind of specific skills and do the testing on our Polk County Campus. Those that are Walker County Campus and Polk County Campus are testing sites. We're also expanding our non-credit, a little bit quicker option to do the online two-week portion, and then the employee will bring the employer vehicles. That's kind of getting around the way of having to purchase all new trucks for our Polk County Campus. These are corporate sponsors, so they're using their vehicles that they have to help train. These are individuals that are probably with a company already that want to advance to get their CDL, and so they're working with us on that, and again, they'll test at our Polk County Campus. Through both of those programs we're offering, we're working to offer those in Spanish as well, so they'll do the instruction and the training. Of course, they will have to test in English, but that helps get over the hurdle there of the language barrier, so we're expanding that opportunity to possibly pick up some additional students. So this semester, on our credit side, we are up 12% in our CDL program, which is that one as at our rock spring campus. So just looking at different opportunities to be able to meet that workforce need. And I'll take, these folks are tired of me talking, but I do want to take a point of personal privilege and just say, since I do represent Polk County, I know Representative Kelly and I, we have talked about just the growing Latino population in Cedar Town and the workforce opportunities as we've been doing local industry sites and do want to just say thank you for being innovative and inside of the box, but also being nimble and flexible in terms of meeting that need that's right there in the community on a regional basis. So thank you. Thank you. I feel to say that we are expanding our driving range, we're adding a permanent driving range, so we can get out of our parking lot at our Polk County Campus, and so we're working with that engineer now and hope to start construction on that within the next several months. Excited about the additional range in Polk County. Thank you. Does this, yeah, this one's working. Good afternoon, I'm Elizabeth Anderson, the Vice President of Academic Affairs at Georgia Northwestern, and I just want to briefly go over the credit side of CDL. Like Jason at CTC, our, the program is nine credit hours, three courses. We have eight cohorts per academic year. In the fall and the spring, we have three cohorts. We run two day eight week cohorts and one evening, ten week cohort. And in the summer, we have two cohorts, one day and one evening. So what does a student have to do before he or she can start this CDL program on the credit side? Of course, Stephen touched on the age, 21 and over, no issues going outside of Georgia, but 18 to 20 year olds can come and go through the program, but they have to, they could would only be able to drive in the state of Georgia. They have to complete a valid DOT physical, which is at the cost of a student, it ranges anywhere from 60 to $80. They have to secure a CDL learners permit from the, from DDS, which at the cost of the student for $10. They have to obtain a seven year NBR or a motor vehicle report for $8 and pass a DOT drug screen. Now the drug screen and the NBR has to be done within 30 days of that program start date. So at GNTC, our program director always, any potential student for CDL comes in and says, I want to be in the CDL program, we put them in direct contact with the program director so he can ensure that he is monitoring them and keeping up with when is that 30 day mark so he can reach back out to make sure those students are staying on top of things. A couple of challenges, which is very consistent with our peers right now, being able to accommodate the number of students that we have interested in CDL. We are currently using a wait list, our spring courses, which start in January are already full. We are putting them on a wait list for summer. Hiring part time faculty to teach in this program is very difficult and it's a little twofold because the pay, they're, if they're credentialed to teaching the program, they're going to make more driving on the road. The second part of that is the Affordable Care Act, ours or workload units if you will, they can't, it limits how much they can teach per week. And I'm just going to be honest, another challenge that we have are students passing the initial drug screen and the random drug screen. Just this semester this fall, we've lost several students for failing the initial drug screen. However, even though there are challenges, we have increased our enrollment in that program, our graduates by 8% from academic year 22 to 23. You got no questions? Yes! Okay. Well, good afternoon. My name is Julie Post and I am president of West Georgia Technical College and I'm here to tell you that with CDL, it is thriving on the west side of the state for sure, right? I mean, you got all of us in a row here. We serve seven counties and have five full service campuses but we only offer CDL on two of them. We have one more coming, as I said, but you can't just, we need asphalt, okay, but you can't just pick a parking lot and displace your students from parking in order to do this. So we have one that's getting ready to break ground but I can tell you it's been a year in the design of the CDL range and the building that goes along with it has taken us more than a year to make it to where we're getting to within the state's budget allowance and so forth. But we're excited that it's coming. I bet you that design change in itself probably was added costs in terms of the... Oh, two million. Yeah, so inefficiencies. Um, every one of our campuses would love are always coming to me. Can we offer CDL? Can we offer CDL? And I'm going to tell you, for instance, on our Douglas campus, which I know is Senator Antivatar's area as well, we could do it. We have the land, but you have to clear it and the infrastructure around it is not there. So the roads to and from our campus could never handle that kind of traffic. So there are lots of barriers to trying to do that, but I can tell you every single one of them would love for us to be offering CDL and every one of our campuses. In addition, we have at least four high school systems that would love for us to be figuring out ways to do dual enrollment in CDL. And so I'm kind of trying to figure out how can we do that in a way that gets a student to a point where they can test as soon as they turn 18. And maybe we can snag in some seniors, but there are also challenges and barriers with federal and state regulations that we need to find some ways around to work to go ahead and make that happen. And in many of our rural counties, that's a real option that we would love to be able to explore. But last year, we had 197 students in our CDL programs, which was up 11% from the year before, but we only awarded 114 certificates. And she spoke exactly as to why it's the drug test passing. Now, I'm not saying I want people on drugs, driving trucks, but I do want to make it clear that that's some of the challenges we face with getting them all the way through the program. This current fall, though, right now enrolled in our programs are 130 students. So we're on par to be at about 250 enrolled by the end of this year. Right now that 130 that we have is 44% more than we had last fall. And I'll tell you that we last year offered eight sessions, two on each campus each day and two at night. And this year, we added an additional cohort, so we're at 10 that go five days a week for a shorter period of time. So now we're offering 10 sessions. So that's been one way that we have worked to expand our enrollments. We also have begun last year the apprentice program. She called it internship. It's the same thing. We're working with companies that have employees that need their employees trained to get the CDL, but they're fully capable of assisting and partnering with us in that training process. So they take two courses online and we do the driving and all of that and we test them. Both of our CDL pads are also set up to be testing sites too. So when we add this third one, we know that we'll then be able to add a whole nother layer of students because we have about 150 on a wait list all the time. 150 people wanted to get into our program. And we also offer the line worker program like GNTC, which is super huge need and they have to have CDL before that. So it has impacted our line worker program because our students cannot get that prior to enrolling in the line worker program. So it just creates a whole nother layer of opportunities for us to figure out new ways to do things. I'm going to turn it over to Kristen Buie who is the vice president of academic affairs at West Shore Tech to talk a little bit more personally about the challenges and the opportunities we have to find ways to get around things. Thank you. I'm Kristen Buie, vice president of academic affairs at West Shore Tech. And really as far as things to add, I'm not sure I can add a whole lot to what's already been said here. We are continuing to look at ways to expand our enrollment. Primarily, as Dr. Post shared already, we run things on the credit side. We are looking at how we can partner with our economic development on credit side and potentially share some resources. We've been fortunate enough to get a special project, for example, from the Department of Forestry. So we're looking at how can we fund a position that we'll share on the credit side and also on the non-credit side for some of those special projects to get around or to work with some of our challenges with ACA and limiting part-time instructors. So enrollment continues to be a barrier for some of our students simply from a capacity standpoint. We're also looking at how we can expand in other ways for restricted CDL licensures for things like the Lyman program and bring it to the credit side. Retention also a challenge for exactly the same reasons whether they can get through for the drug or testing and or the abilities to get through. So we are working on strategies for retention so that we can get them out into the workforce. Other challenges we have are specific to supply chain. Mr. Ferguson mentioned it earlier with the purchasing of the challenges with the purchasing of trucks specifically. We have two in the pipeline right now and we're worried that we're not going to be able to get them delivered in time for the funding. So that is a tremendous barrier, increasing of costs with fuel or some of those. And then of course we have faculty challenges. Again Mr. Ferguson mentioned that there's 1,670 competing jobs and when we're in that job market as well trying to obtain additional instructors so that we can increase capacity so that we can get additional students in the classroom which translates to drivers on the road. So if you and Elizabeth had unlimited resources and could design whatever program you wanted to eliminate weightless what would you do? Government wasn't in the way or anything else. I think the first I'm sorry to have more ranges, more tracks, more instructors and we would make it happen. That's basically it. But also we can't pay in some cases even 75% of what a truck driver makes. So to balance out the costs that we have for our programs as was alluded to when you can only have a certain number to meet regulations per instructor you're just adding and increasing that gap between the funding that we have to continue to operate these programs versus what it costs us. Yeah I mean I would be interested if we could do this later but going through a financial like exercise kind of mean like we're doing on other whether it's tax credits or other things in the state. I mean if you have a 95% placement rate you have a high graduation rate obviously there's an ROI there but I'd like to see how does that translate into basically your bottom line investments into salary, staff, equipment and I know this isn't the time replacement I know like we've talked about I mean you have labs and some of y'all's colleges may you know be experiencing this that have equipment from the 1980s and this is 2023 which is pretty insane. So I think just kind of go through that exercise because I know there's folks on the computer and you know other my colleagues who would ask the question like what is the ROI just to find the dollars and again just going back to pure efficiencies because you know if we're building a range you know is there a way to do it on a you know where two colleges are coming together and sharing resources and then sensitive to parts of the state like myself and Senator Gooch and folks in South Georgia where we know as we talk to businesses in Alabama recruiting them to Georgia the number one thing they're asking about is workforce but if you have a waiting list and I need truck drivers and I have 150 people on a waiting list they're basically going to tell you well I'm just going to deal with Alabama I'm not coming and I think we've seen a little bit of that in the background in Heraldson County maybe Carroll County a little bit in terms of we talked to these presidents and CEOs coming across the line so I think that's an opportunity I didn't want to take over Dr. Newgo I apologize Senator if you're going to talk like that you can take over anytime you want to sir it uh for four decades the technical college system of Georgia under whatever name it's been titled has put its emphasis on workforce development I think everybody in here would agree we've got a proud proud track record of accomplishing that you see from this panel that everyone is hungry to do that to do more of it I think that trend towards getting theirs has been accelerated to the good in the last few years I think we see more resources through strategic industry emphasis from the from the legislature the executive branch the technical college system you you see that we're hungry if we they said it all we if we get more faculty in a competitive market where everybody wants those folks I mean you got to want to not go drive a truck to want to be a teacher and one advantage of course working addition you going to be closer to home you have some you work with work with students you might not be working and other things in the industry that you'd rather not be working with you're working with students you're you're you're seeing the graduates and so forth the operational cost yes there's a gap we're not here to to to to speak directly to what that gap is it was said at the last one of these study committees gosh somebody expressed that there's reluctance to crack to crank up so to speak another truck driving no we'll crank up truck driving as often as we can everywhere you can you know day or night if we can get more students who want to come that's an issue too is is I don't know if the world's noticed but students want to come a particular time of the day and if Jason I have talked about we're going to run 24-7 our truck driving our range until the neighbors complain well the drawback from that is students not want to come and you know the times where we could be offering it if we could find the faculty and and and and make it happen so that's a speech but it's a speech or a good cause I'm very proud to be part of the take everybody up here is proud to be part of the technical call assistant majority you said yourself and we're anxious to do everything we can to help increase the supply of the truck drivers questions from you either or they're or they well just make one comment then I'll get a see if senator does all has a question but I mean I do want to recognize that I think we we have heard him like your entire group I mean there there is private sector investment you're receiving one way or another either directly or through you know the state foundation local foundations the offset costs so I just want to make sure the audience is listening or listening to this later they seek meeting notes that it's clear that's that we're not advocating for I think a greater start off the co-le government but I think the level of private sector investment has been significant I think the question is is how how sustainable is that is we we look at just the pure population growth businesses coming to Georgia what does this model need to be and I think we need to you know even have conversation you know what is the you know how does that blend in with the private sector so senator does all do you have any questions comments on this topic it's a very helpful information thank you to those on the panel for presenting to the thank you I can't tell senator Gouche back no he's not back he's up there in the mountains breathing mountain here senator Jones you have any questions comments well of course there's a model that was used we we broke ground a couple of weeks ago on this 12 million out of facility and the cap I was proud to see that it was state funds it was federal funds it was county funds it was even a city the local city in stonecrest participated and there was some outside foundation dollars do you all see that kind of support in your respective areas as well yes senator Jones I'll address that excuse me again we've mentioned the state funding we also receive funding from the city of Atlanta Fulton County funding as well as the acreage land and then some of our our private corporate partners so in order for us to move forward with the Center for Transpression Logistics we had to have a variety of funding streams to be able to do that in a perfect world when is that going to open perfect world I'm hoping within a year so I'm I'm going to put that out in the universe that that that will happen okay because that sounds like it's a very important project so you know we opened a new campus a year ago which had significant support from Carroll County and the city of Carrollton and the community itself and the legislators from that area our range that we're getting ready to open we have utilized a good bit of our federal money that we drew down for lost wages that was the best way for us to really meet workforce demands in Harrelson County and said that building that will go on there will also have 40 welding booths in it because it has no and we need to get some more industrial out in that area and host our line worker program and our CDL program we have had Carroll EMC Georgia Power all of our power companies have helped us with various aspects of things that support the CDL and the line worker because the two go so hand in hand but right now we are using we have a major campaign going for all the private funding to put all the equipment inside this building so it will be you know funded in multiple ways we've utilized state funding for our Walker County campus we just had it resurfaced but in Polk County we had a we have a large partnership with Georgia Power that helped us with our line worker program which also includes our CDL so and then working with some other EMCs that have assisted this as well so great community partners to offset the cost of some of that federal funds I will say all of us have likely used our federal Perkins funds we get them every single year we use them to purchase equipment for all of our academic programs the lion's share of each of our I would think you guys would agree with me but that that is like right now we ordered two trucks for our new range and Perkins funding has to be not just allocated by the end of that fiscal year but spent and paid for and so we're on pins and needles praying and begging that it's going to make its way through and we're going to get those otherwise we're going to have to find other funding for that but I know all of us utilize Perkins funding for for situations like this even in some cases to start a program by funding a faculty member for the first year when it becomes so challenging to afford it and get your enrollment going so every one of us has had faculty at one point or another on federal funding from the Perkins grant too. Senator Jones we've done the same we have put out a request we are still awaiting hopefully that we will get that but we have reached out to our local federal delegation for support. I had a question I wanted to ask if any of you may be off the top of your head had any data about the retention rates of these graduates like what what I'm trying to understand is like I know you know we get these graduates they get a trucking job but like what is the yeah what is a retention rate like because I know truck driving has a high turnover rate. This is an indirect answer but it's it's good we feel that we hear that anecdotally and and fill it intuitively I will say that we have been from time to time can we shorten the program by a week or two and our response to that is we we've determined that the data points tell us that people that stay that extra week or two and get some more do better so we we've not we've not pursued that.

I also had that at Chattahoochi we took our data for the last six years. The youngest average truck driving student for that year has been 37 at our institution where we've had years or the other outside of truck driving the average student is about 24. So we've had students who have done quite well when they make it through the program on licensure and retention because realistically this is probably third career for some of the students. Truck driving years where the average truck driving student is 44 when they've started Chattahoochi tech. So it's potential that they do well compared to some of our other programs for that retention or staying with their initial hire because they are a much more seasoned student. They clearly had planned out being a commercial truck driver because they look often very different from the rest of our student body and I would imagine their data looks very similar to the average student versus commercial truck driving student are often two different people coming to the college. Thank you. I would add just briefly that oftentimes once a graduate from any of our programs enters the workforce oftentimes we lose track of them so official data on that is difficult but where we do have touch points to get that and oftentimes anecdotally is through our program advisory committees and that's really where those partnerships exist and that's why they continue to stay partners with the college and those capacities as advisors and it's because we are a workforce pipeline for them and if we were losing a lot of them through some of those partners I think a lot of us would hear about it in that capacity as well and for the most part we're not seeing that any more than some of our other program areas. It is a selling point when someone wants to name a CDL classroom because they want their sign up inside there because they want the students to walk into that building and see I can go to work for in this case Wayne Davis concrete so just put it out there for anybody here who wants to name a room we all hear willing to help you but I'm always asking for money. That being said we have companies that want to come in and talk to our students and we will I know everybody here would welcome that industry is coming in just to spend 15 or 20 minutes of a class at the beginning of a class to say hey we're hiring here's what our job market looks like here's what our needs are because typically by the time they're done they most all have jobs. It's probably not a secret I'm a big Richard Davis fan so that doesn't shock me at all that they do that. So Dutch and Eukam thank you for bringing this steam crowd together and coordinating with Commissioner Dozer and Yolz office so thanks for being here. We're delighted I want to call the last closing thought is I want to give a shout out to our faculty. Diane Geis is here an associate dean who works with those faculty as well and we got to say it for our faculty we love everyone stay with us forever wherever you're a faculty in the state of Georgia think about coming to chat to you tech just kidding guys. Thank you for the faculty. That's a great segue to our very last presentation. Yeah I think in all seriousness the faculty is what makes it happen we just work here. So Kerry Wilson who chairs a commercial truck driving program at Southern Regional Tech. So you've noticed today we've had almost every region of the state represented sorry East Georgia we left you out this time. But I think just kind of here firsthand as we wrap up just what our faculty and all these schools and colleges are experiencing and just to share some thoughts on that and I do want to recognize Amy Carter who works in the president's office and I know is no secret to the legislature and what you've done Amy and South Georgia and fighting for the folks in your backyard so thank you for being here today and making it all the way up here. So Kerry it's over to you to close out I don't have any comments once Kerry's done we will send around notes we will announce the next meeting in the next few days. If you can stay for the tour please stay for the tour. I do want to thank Senator Dozall for joining us. We'll get on Senator Goode's for partially being here. I have to give him a hard time because he gives me a hard time every single day. And taking this conversation seriously and Kevin Perry once again thank you for opening your doors and hosting us. So Kerry closes out please. Okay. Hey everybody my name is Kerry Wilson and I work at Southern Regional Technical College down in my office is in Auditif in Georgia Southern Regional covers 11 counties in Southwest Georgia. I have 30 years of truck driving experience. I started working for Southern Regional as an instructor in 2010 and then worked my way into the program chair position. Just to on a side note to address the wage let me give you a comparison my husband is a truck driver. In 2015 when I became the program chair our annual salary was within $5,000 of each other. Today he makes twice a little over twice what I make. So when you're talking about wages not keeping up with the industry that's what I'm talking about. Okay. And I think you'll find that everywhere. So a lot of our instructors come because they want to instruct not for the money. Okay. There's a couple of things I want to share with you and some of those are the innovations we've made with our truck driving in Southern Regional. Our program is run a little differently than a traditional program where you 12 to 18 students come on campus through there all day every day for you know five seven and a half eight weeks. Our program is actually 10 weeks. It's two five week sessions. The first five weeks is 100% online campus the students do not come to campus. The second five weeks is in the behind the wheel training and students only come in two days a week. So they have to come in two days a week for the second five weeks. They are on campus a total of 10 days. And we're able to do this by embracing technology. So before COVID hit I had been studying ways to make our program more efficient. We seem like you have 18 students and you have four or five trucks. There are students standing around waiting for their turn in the truck. That's inefficient. So when COVID hit we were tasked with the reducing the truck or the student ratio in the truck. So what we did is we took the data we had collected prior to COVID on the actual behind the wheel time that a student spends actually operating a truck while they're there. And we put everything else online in interactive assignments. All the observation time of how do I operate a truck? How do I release the brakes? How do I do this kind of stuff? Is now all interactive assignments online? So that's one way we've made our program more efficient. So we register at a four to one ratio with our instructors. We split the class in half, two students to one instructor Monday and Wednesday, two students to one instructor Tuesday and Thursday. So literally the entire time they are there they are doing something with a truck. There is no more standing around at all. It's very efficient and our program's overlapped. So we have a new program that begins every five weeks. So you don't have to wait 10 weeks. It starts every five weeks within the term. That way as soon as one class ends and another class begins you don't have one instructor teaching the classroom while the others are doing this waiting for their students to be ready to get in a truck. We roll on. Those trucks never stop anymore. And so it's become a very efficient program. One of the things that was mentioned earlier was the internship program through nine credit as a partnership with an employer. But TCSG also has a credit side internship that qualifies for the Georgia Hope and Hope career grants. And it utilizes the employers vehicles and on the job it trainer with the employer. Now they do have to bring their truck in for a final exam with us. But the benefit of that is that it's covered under the Hope career grant. So it's no cost to the employee. We can add it to our credit programs when they're already full because they're not requiring a seat in our trucks. We can add them to an already full cohort. All we have to do is monitor that they're complying with ELDT regulations and then perform a two hour exam at the end of the program. And all of this is under the Hope grant side. And the panel that was up here from TCSG colleges, they covered a lot of the nine credit sides. So I'm not going to touch on that. But I want to give you an example of how the credit internship could work. Last month at the Senate Committee meeting on expanding Georgia's workforce, Clint Bueller spoke on behalf of the Association of County Commissioners. And he said they are having a truck driver shortage because they can no longer provide in-house CDL training to their employees. Which is true. Under ELDT regulations, you have to be a certified registered trainer. But they could partner with us. We could provide the compliance part. And they could roll on training in their in-house truck driver training program. It seems like a win-win situation for everyone. They don't lose a valuable employee. We don't have to make them wait until January to come in our classes. And we don't have to buy the equipment. So we're using the employer's equipment. It might be an EMC. It could be a hot shot. You know, those duly pickups with the goose neck trailer. They require a CDL. It could be a class B driver, Holland adump truck for the county. If they only come through our traditional programs, then we have to own all that equipment in order to train them. And this is an avenue for us to be able to provide them our expertise in training and compliance. And they can still keep training on the job with a partnership with the college. So this is a credited program through TCSG. And it's available at all the technical colleges, along with our traditional training. There are a couple of challenges that our programs face. You heard a lot of budget issues and things like that. But we have a really strong partnership with DDS. And DDS has made a lot of changes recently over the last few years that are doing great. But I have been a CDL third party examiner since 2016. And I can tell you for first hand where we could strengthen our relationship with DDS. I'll give you two examples. The first one is that DDS provides third party examiner certification to an instructor that wants to be certified to give a CDL exam. So we go through DDS' training. It's a week long training. It's usually held in between Georgia. Everyone from the state has to come to that one location. I believe that Georgia could do what Florida is doing. Florida partners with its vocational schools to allow them to conduct CDL examiner training. And if that could happen with us, then that training could be scheduled outside of our academic calendars. So right now we have no control over the scheduling. And we have an absent instructor for a week. And we have a, and you know, we teach one on one in a truck. So when we have an instructor missing, it is a big deal. So that would really help with that. Now Georgia code prevents it, but the federal regulations does not prevent it. So it is possible. The second one that would strengthen our third party examiners would be when we conduct a CDL exam, whether it be a graduate of our program or a public, someone from the public. Third party examiners only have the ability to verify the driver's license of the applicant. So we can go onto the DDS website. We can verify that their license is valid. We do not have access to verify that their permit is valid. So you can get a CDL disqualifying sort of citation. And it may suspend your regular driver's license. I mean, excuse me, it may not suspend your regular driver's license, but it will disqualify your CDL permit. We have no way of knowing that. So we risk doing an invalid test on an unlicensed driver. Now DDS has allowed us access, as a third party examiner, we do have access to this DDS system called systems where we enter our test results after a CDL test. I believe we should have access to the CDL information system, which would allow us to verify a permit prior to conducting a test. So those are two things with DDS that I think would strengthen our relationship as far as on the ground, doing the work, kind of stuff. Roku, I can't last one. How many states, I mean, if we talk about collaboration between agency, I mean, I mean, what I know is that Florida does with their vocational schools. But the second part of that in terms of the- That I do not know. Okay, just curious. Thanks. Yep. So there was some budget issues brought up. And from a program chair perspective, I want to explain why some of our programs are so expensive to run. It's important to point out that the maintenance and repair needs for our training vehicles are significantly different than a vehicle that is operated in industry. So a commercial vehicle is designed to haul heavy loads for continuous miles. We don't do that. We never haul load or rarely. We stop and start all day long. A student may- a group of students may put a truck through a startup procedure 20 or 30 times a day. So we twist them and we turn them on the back and range. And so we abuse our equipment in order to train these drivers because we don't train them just to hold the steering wheel and drive down the road for 100 miles. That's not what we do. So our trucks, especially the newer model trucks, they do not like being treated that way. And aside from supply chain issues, aside from supply chain issues, the labor costs for a diesel mechanic, a licensed mechanic in the last year has went from $95 an hour to $195 an hour. And some of these after treatment exhaust systems like the DEF systems, you know, with the after treatment systems, our last repair was $17,000 for one item on one truck because of the after treatment systems. So it has gotten so bad that we actually took 2002, 2000 volvos off our surplus list and put them back into service. And for the student shoes and the other one for parts to keep the first one running. That's how bad it has gotten. And we're trying to be as efficient as possible with these, with our funding, but it is getting way out of hand and we just need some help to cover the cost of our program, to actually running our programs. I got one other thing, you know, I've been, I did a little research and some things getting ready to speak today. And I think I may have a solution and I have an idea that I want to share. And that is we graduated our first dual enrollment CDL student this spring. And changes in the HOPE grant has now allowed high schoolers to use the HOPE career grant before using up all of their dual enrollment hours. So it opens the door for truck driving. So my idea is that we could do a recognized dual enrollment pathway that feeds into an internship that allows an inexperienced graduate to get the miles to become an insurable driver. So this is what I'm thinking. We could do, get them ready for their permit, do most of their ELDT theory all before 18. They could spend hour unlimited number hours on a simulator. And let me tell you that the simulators are getting very real. I mean, they're very lifelike. They could do all that before they were 18. When they're 18, they get their CDL permit. They give them some behind the wheel training. They take all their ELDT exams. And then they go to work for a company. It could be a county agency. It could be a private carrier. But they go to an external site where our insurance covers them as a driver. It would be very similar to a nursing student's clinical rotations with an owner, operator, lease agreement thrown in. So if it's a private company, let's say Coca-Cola is an example, they could lease on with us as a college. And our insurance could cover not only the driver, but their vehicle during the internship, while they're gaining miles. And if the internships two years, then they can get 150,000 miles in that time. So then they become insurable. The other part of this aspect is we could partner with the Georgia Ports Authority to offer in-state hauling from the ports to inland staging areas under an internship. So there would be a couple of challenges. There would be some insurance issues that we'd have to work out. The other thing is, is when you pick up interstate freight, you fall under federal interstate rules, which eliminates an 18 to 21-year-old. But there is an exception. And that exception is if your primary business is not transportation. And if it's under an internship with TCSG, our primary business is education. So I think it's doable. It checks all the boxes. It tracks younger drivers. It gets them through the program. It gets them covered on their insurance so they get insurable miles. And then we could supply them to the workforce needs at Georgia. So anyway, that's my thought. Couple of partnerships. Yeah, I mean, this is, I mean, very thoughtful presentation. I think there's some good nuggets here. I do like, I mean, just again, another state is, you know, rethinking how they collaborate and share funds. As we kind of wrap up, I mean, we're kind of wrapped up. But we'll let these senators and Senator Doe's office any quick comments or thoughts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Donald, presenters today. I didn't hear any word in here about tour reform. I guess that's not an issue, huh? But certainly, you know, as this issue comes up repeatedly and in general assembly, I think it would be helpful if the industry leader and the educators could spend some time educating us on the importance of tour reform. Thank you. I had some closing comments. So what we've seen, what I've learned today is traditionally, this industry is dominated by older males and the trucking industry has a significant untapped potential labor force among women and younger individuals. I'd like your idea, you know, work smarter, not harder. And the great thing about the mile pay is that it doesn't care if you're a man or woman, there's no glass ceiling and trucking. By improving working conditions, implementing support for long hauls and addressing wage issues, I think this industry could have a broader appeal. And, you know, also addressing the high turnover rate is very important. We need to keep these people in these jobs. And so I think that, you know, a lot of great solutions were presented today and I look forward at working with my colleagues to solve the truck driver shortages. Yeah, Senator Dezle, he signed off. So, but yeah, thank you to all the speakers who came, me and Thalfa, I can tell a lot of work when it to your thoughts and comments. There are some topics we will cover at the next meeting. I know one of them and I appreciate Commissioner McMurray's office. We'll have updates from the DOT in terms of truck parking and I think other pieces around that, what they're working on. I'm sure we'll have more discussion on tour reform and there could be other conversations as we kind of wrap up. If anybody today has anything specific, you want submitted outside of what's in the presentation or let me say it this way, other extra data to supplement your presentation today, please just give that to myself or Anna so we can make sure that's included in the report as we pull all this information together because it sounds like there's a lot of good ideas, you know, past ideas that we need to enhance or read dust off and renew or new ideas we need to consider. So, but I particularly want to say thank you to TCHG and DDS for sharing how we all are kind of connected and working through all these challenges across the state, positive stuff. My colleagues, thank you for coming over, hanging out and we'll do it again next time. So, until then, thank you.
