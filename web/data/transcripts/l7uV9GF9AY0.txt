----------
You
morning everybody. If you would please come on in and have a seat and we'll we'll
begin our meeting. We're going to ask Chairman Jasper's if he would please
open up with order prayer. Spire heads together please. Heavenly Father thank you
for another wonderful week. We've worked up coming but what a great weekend we
had being with our families and taking care of our health and mental health and
All that good stuff. Please look after us. Keep us wise. Help keep us fair and just. We know what this work in your name. Amen.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Chairman, come on out.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee.
First page six from the top. HR 558.
have a House Study Committee on the State Board of Registration of Use, called Motor Vehicle
Dealers. What we're doing with this is just creating a study committee to determine whether
the regulation of the use motor vehicle industry would be better suited within the same agency
that actually issues the tops and the dealer plates. They've got access to all of the data
Right now it's in the Secretary of State.
They don't have access to the data and it's just a better fit to move it to the Department of Revenue.
Okay, go see any places.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Kevin Dooming.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Committee, top of the third page, under modified structure.
I am not Senator Kennedy, but I am here on his behalf to present Senate Bill 123.
This chairman unfortunately last year our state faced a very troubling statistic that 23%
of our students were chronically absent, that's just not a number, that's 380,000 students
who missed 10% or more of the school year.
This bill is not aimed at fixing that overnight, this is the first step in defining and
code what chronic absenteeism is and taking a number of steps to correct it.
Okay. Go see any questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Robertson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee. On page four down toward the bottom
SB 298, judgment and rulings. What this does is offer a direct appeal for those municipalities
who want to challenge a determination that they do not have immunity in cases. Currently,
they have to wait until the trials over before they can go back and appeal the question
of immunity in this case would give them a single bite at the apple on the front end
of the appeal process and expedite the process protects our counties and city governments.
Oh, get out. Don't see any questions. Thank you. I also have 99 and 100 on there that
appreciate any consideration.
Thanks, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, committee members.
Page two of the modified structure room.
Senate Bill 236 expands the supported military school-aged children
to streamline a better process for a well-in-air
to the military orders to involve the children into school?
I'm sorry.
Phase 36.
Phase 36.
The modified structure room.
I'll do a apologize.
Okay.
No questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee members.
I'm on page two, Senate Bill 93.
As we all know, we have a reading crisis in the state that we began to address with
the early literacy acts.
We have 70% of kids that are not reading on grade level, and so this bill seeks to ensure
that our teacher prep programs are preparing teachers properly and not teaching the 3QM
method, which is now included in House Bill 307, Representative Dollar's Bill.
So this just makes sure that we have an alignment with the PSC and preparing our future teachers
to be in alignment with the science of reading.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
All right, thank you.
Have a good time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The distinguished members of this committee on the first page
in the middle is Senate Resolution 231.
This is to rename the Hulken Bridge
and 400 interchange for Fallen Police Officer Jeremy Obonte.
I would just like to mention that
typically these will fall under an omnibus bill
and I'm going to ask this not be the way
be the way. This is the first and only person we have ever lost in the
line of duty in the city of Roswell and we want to be able to present this
resolution to the family by itself not in a big bill in order to know how much
that we care about them and his sacrifice for us. The next one is just down a
few more on the first sheet. Senate Bill 9, great work led by Representative Brad
Thomas on making sure we keep deep fakes out of elections and other areas to
to keep our ethics straightforward.
Okay.
No questions.
Thank you, sir.
Senator, how are you doing?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On page four, Senate Bill 241, middle of the page.
This is a bill that's going to regulate how human remains
are a method of disposition through human composting.
This is to make sure that Noble Georgia does not take place again.
This is being proactive rather than reactive to make sure that if this is ever done,
that you're licensed, and regulated, and inspected, okay.
Have a question.
There's no Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the author of the bill, just some clarification,
And I know the funeral director's caucus has unanimously
approved this, but there's a room
that's in clarify, please.
Will this include the fertilizing of tomatoes and okra
under your bill using dear beloved departed as a compost?
The compost would be returned to the family member
if they so desire and then it's up to that family member
what they do with it.
They can donate it to a lamb bank.
You can put it in your tomato garden, if you wish, or whatever you wish to do.
I think that's all on that line of questions, there we are.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
I don't see any more questions.
Chairman Brass.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
I bring SB 220.
It could be another use for the compost.
You could grow medical marijuana with it,
with your loved ones.
But this bill simply expands access for those
that are already qualified with one of 17 conditions.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Excuse me, we do have a question.
Probtem has a question.
What question does this allow vaping?
It does.
It does.
found that in some of our patients that need immediate reaction or immediate
relief from the medicine such as seizures or potentially even PTSD having an
immediate episode they would need that immediate relief so that was the purpose
of vaping.
Okay. Don't see any other questions. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dixon.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
Committee members, I've got two bills on both of them on page two. The first one is SB 63.
And it has to do with the home school students and
allowing them to take their advance placement testing, their
college placement testing,
at their residency school if they had chose to go to that school.
The issue arose not from anybody under the gold dome.
It was actually started a couple of years ago with families in my home county in Gwinnett
that were home school parents started reaching out to me saying that they were having issues
with Gwinnett and the school system some years they would allow the testing some years.
They wouldn't, the years that they would, it would be at a designated location in one
area in the county and as many of you know, it's visited when our traffic, you know,
getting across when it can take over an hour depending on what type of day you're traveling.
So parents would have to take off work to do this.
What this bill simply does is in what I believe are these parents are paying their taxes locally
and at the state level just like all of the other parents are that's going into school
system, so it's not a negative on the school system. They would still be a
plus, I believe, but it would allow these students to take that testing at
their residency school. They would have to register with that school, so the
school would know the student is coming. They would be prepared for that
because that testing, as many of you know, the way they set the desk up and
everything, you know, they have to be prepared and other other things for the
test. But that's what it does, Mr. Chairman. Okay. Don't see any questions on
Yes, I do. It's on page two, SB 82. And it has to do with our charter school system in the state.
In the past five years, there's only been one charter school approved locally here in the state of Georgia with over 30 being approved at the state level.
You know, that other states, you know, typically 90% of charter schools are approved at the local level, 10% of the state level.
I believe it's more efficient that way, you know, because they are, you know, going to be, you know, teaching the kids in that local area plus it cuts the burden on the state in half.
You know, it's typically about 4 million for a state charter school, and then if it's approved locally, it's about half of that.
What this bill does is got to carry it in a stick.
If the local school system's approved a charter school within that year, they would receive an additional $250,000 for three years, in second of years.
After approving that school, if the school system denies, two charter schools, if they've got students between 10,000 and 60,000, if they deny two charter schools, and they're approved by the state later that year.
they would lose their flexibility funding.
And if it was a school system that was $60,000 plus,
it would have to take three to nine.
Who at Park has a question for you?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So can you clarify the penalties
that would be imposed on local school districts?
And do you have concerns that this is undermining
local control?
Yeah no I don't believe it is you know I think that you know the movement we've
had in the state with more school options you know I think that our charter
school system is is a unique option for children and it does fit you know
many families and students you know their education options very well there's
about 65,000 students that are rolled in charter schools currently in the
state and I believe it's yeah 21,000 on a waiting list so there is a need a
demand for this and I would say you know that we're able to hold these schools more accountable than
the other school system in the state it's a five year charter and if they don't perform then
they can be shut down and can you speak to the penalties and the potential financial cost this
would impose on local school districts yeah it would it would just if they were denied it would
would do a way with reflectability contracts.
Thank you.
Heagley, you have a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author of the bill.
Just trying to understand, we elect local school boards
to make these decisions based on what's
best for their communities.
And Gwynette is very different from Columbus, Georgia.
And so you're telling me that if my school system
do not find that a charter is in line
with what we need in our area and they go
and the state gives them a charter
that our schools are going to lose their loose funding.
That would you say?
If it was from 10,000 to 60,000,
they would have to deny too that we're later approved.
A pro-TAM has a question.
I just wanted to ask a question to the senator.
Is it not true that they would not lose one dime?
What they would lose is flexibility that the state gives them
in exchange for state priorities.
We have priorities that students achieve,
that they have a good graduation rate,
they have good school climate, all the things that go into
whether or not they get the renewal of that flexibility contract and what you're I think
suggesting we have since 2008 when we first passed state charter schools that it is a state
priority that students in Georgia have more public school options and unfortunately that
has not borne out at the local level to take further the numbers that you cited there
have been three locally approved charter schools in the last 10 years and 56 at the state level.
We're simply trying to encourage local school systems respond to our shared constituents
who are begging for more public school options.
That is correct.
Thank you.
Chairman Newton has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Do you say it's 250,000 a year for three years as the goal of that, if that's the correct
amount.
that to help offset some of the startup expenses
and students begin to decide or parents and students
begin to decide which option is best for their student.
Is that just to help offset some of those expenses
and get these schools started?
That is correct.
That's two, 15 year for three years, is that correct?
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Don't see any other questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee members.
Senator Walker.
Good morning, so I have three bills on the blue sheet on page three toward second from
the top Senate bill 125.
I've already spoken to this one, Miss Chairman, but it would allow engineers in waiting to
take their peak professional engineering exam prior to completing their field work, hopefully
to improve the pass rate. On page top of page 4 Senate Bill 201, we've seen after especially
large natural disasters, large weather events, contractors come in that are trying to take
advantage of our homeowners and rush them into signing contracts for work, especially
after Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Elaine, but others, this would give the consumer an
option to get out of that contract if it happened during, after a state declared
emergency. And then on down on the same page, Senate Bill 284 would give the Secretary
State's office a fourth option when they're dealing with securities fraud. Currently they
can suspend a license or issue a cease and assist order and they can enforce civil fines,
that they do not have in the code,
the ability to require the criminal, basically,
to return invested funds to the defrauded investors.
This would give them that fourth option
and the enforcement of that.
A lot of times that is negotiated out on the front end
where funds are returned,
but it's not in the code.
So the party that was defrauding investors
didn't cooperate or didn't strike a deal.
There's no option to have those funds returned
to the investor.
Okay, you don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Senator, come on up.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
Members of the committee, page number two,
five items down is SB 46.
This entitled government serves the people
and what this is is creating a service matrix
for the departments that are in our state.
This would be used GTA as the administrative arm
and then each department would assign one person
to report to them what we're looking for,
anywhere from a whole time, what's the response?
We're looking at service to our citizens
and what happens is there's not really a measuring stick
and our idea behind it with them is to create
a best practices for what's expected and turn around
and many of the larger departments do a really good job
because they have the resources.
Your smaller departments don't.
The other part that we have had conversations,
I've met with them even after our last meeting
is this we need to be aware that many people
don't have internet, don't have access to the internet
and we need that service level to also be available.
And that's one of the things
that does not get measured really well.
So that's the first one that's there.
I said this is that we need service metrics.
You can't manage what you can't measure,
and we also have a physical note on it from that standpoint.
The second one is that-
Senator, you've already presented it 46 times.
Yes, yes.
You don't have to come, but one time.
One time?
Yes, sir.
I had such a good time, I wanted to-
Well, we're always glad to have you,
but it's not necessary to make another trip,
but you're welcome to come anytime.
And if you have a member who has a question,
maybe I'll get you to get it offline,
you can talk about that. Thank you sir. I appreciate it but it was so much fun. I wanted to come back
again. Glad to have you anytime. Senator, come on up. Morning, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of
the committee. The only reason I came by is because I miss y'all so bad and I noticed Senate Bill 12
has not been picked. It's on the lower end of not the bottom but the lower end of your front page.
it's a it's a good bill and I hope that you can get it on the floor because it
did get modified over here in the house and I need to make sure it comes back
over to the Senate and we can adopt your recommendation and your changes and
I just ask for your consideration on that it's one that's supported by not only
the Georgia Chamber, the Metro Atlanta Chamber, ACCG, GMA and I think it's a good
cleanup on a court case that was settled with the Supreme Court.
No questions. Thanks, sir. Thank you.
Okay. We have any members of the committee with a request.
Have you got one today?
Okay. All right. Nothing's okay.
Now we have set a calendar earlier for four bills on for today.
Let's set a supplemental calendar for today also under modified structured.
Senate Bill 112, move in second. Is there any opposition? It's on. Senate Bill 123, moved
and seconded in any opposition? It's on. Senate Bill 149, moved and seconded in any
opposition it's on Senate bill 193 moved in second any opposition it's on okay
so that'll give us a total of eight for today
call on Chairman Leveritt for an announcement just want to thank you
Mr. Chairman it's one of my everybody that the subcommittee rules on lawsuit
We'll meet today at 3 o'clock. We're going to take up Senate Bill 69 so I hope everybody who is interested in that bill will please attend now be in this room.
Thank you. Also the subcommittee will meet from 3 to 5 and then the full committee will meet upon adjournment are immediately there after to consider that bill.
bill the full rules committee, so we need to see all of you back this afternoon.
And then also on Wednesday tomorrow, we'll have a full rules standing committee meeting
at 2 o'clock to take up Senate Bill 255, which is in the rules committee.

So we've got a lot going on, but there's a lot we need to get done.
Thank you.
