All members of this House will please report to the floor of the House.

You
We're about to have the morning roll call.
All right, we're going to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
I have all members voted.
all members now voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, you may lock the machines.
Well, good morning. Welcome to Friday. Get away day. So, I hope everyone has a great weekend.
Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will begin our day with
Scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the
112th House District, Chairman Dave Belton.
Chairman Belton.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I was raised a Baptist. My father was a career submarine officer and we moved dozens of times to many different nations.
It's been to many different kinds of churches all around the world, but mostly it was Baptist.
But soon I grew up and I realized that no self-respecting Baptist girl would have anything to do with me.
So I married the only Catholic girl that I knew.
She said I was her cross-to-bearer.
We Catholics, we love pain and suffering.
You know, the whole Lent thing.
All y'all get the Mardi Gras and the Fat Tuesday.
Tuesday with Catholics get Ash Wednesday and 40 days of Lent and fasting and
abstinence. So as a man and a family, I immediately submitted to a she who must
be obeyed and I became Catholic. Of course, she didn't tell me about purgatory.
It founds out a thousand years of purgatory to look forward to.
Mr. Speaker, that means that you'll see the pearly gates about a millennium
before I will, if I make it, which is very downfall.
But it is so worth it being married to my gorgeous Catholic bride because I found in
the church a real unity and diversity, this unrivaled on this planet.
I heard the Pope preach once in the Vatican that Mass took three hours.
It took three hours because they did the prayers in all thirty different languages of the
of the 30 different cultures that were present that day.
Like my Catholic Church in Green County,
by the way, they ran me out of all the churches
in Morgan County.
I had to go to church in Chairman Trey Rhodes.
I'm sure appreciate Chairman,
you let me go to church there, thank you.
But my Catholic Church in Green County is half Hispanic.
And it's probably the thing I most admire about Father Michael
is not only his fluent Spanish,
but his ability to shepherd a flock of richly diverse,
yet unified believers.
Ladies and gentlemen, my pastor, Father Michael Silaway.
Thank you, Representative Belton.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the honor of being here
with you all today.
I'd like to begin every sermon I preach with
inviting and invoking the power of the Holy Spirit
to be with me.
It will give me the words to say
the way to say them the right way, and that those who hear them may receive what the
Lord wants them to hear.
So I'll begin with, come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful, and kindle in
them the fire of your love, send forth your Spirit, and they shall be created, and you shall
renew the face of the earth, amen.
distinguished members of the Georgia House of Representatives, it really truly is an honor
for me to be with you this morning. To begin this day of discerning and debating and deciding
with you in a moment of intentional openness to divine things. And since my theme will be
briefly on the virtues of the gospel character of Saint Joseph, the husband of the blessed Virgin Mary
and the foster father of Jesus Christ,
to whom God only spoke through dreams,
if you happen to nod off for even just a moment,
I will take absolutely no offense,
but rather trust that God has invited you
to a deep personal conversation.
My dear friends, the saints are those
who we believe are in heaven.
Our veneration of them is akin to the special reverence
that we have for our civic heroes.
Just as we are rightly moved by the sacrifices
of our servicemen and women who set aside
their own ambitions and life plans
to defend and protect what is most sacred to us
in our state and nation.
So we're invited to be moved by those
with that exceptional balance of conviction and patience.
Set aside to faithfully commit themselves
to the gospel way of life.
Just as we venerate and hold up for emulation,
our state's biggest and brightest and bravest,
the very best in every age.
So to in faith, do we celebrate and seek to mirror
those whose virtue was truly heroic
and whose witness to selfless love
was clearly expressed in the way that they lived.
And among such faith heroes,
St. Joseph is among the greatest and his witnesses
of particular benefit and assistance to us today.
My boss's boss, Pope Francis,
just last month proposed to the whole church
and to the world that we take this new year of 2021
to find hope and renewal in this most august tradesman.
After the challenge and pain of 2020,
a tattered year held together mostly
by the hidden sacrifices of selfless individuals
made for the protection and betterment of others.
Pope Francis said, each of us can discover in Joseph,
the man who goes unnoticed, a daily discreet and hidden
presence, an intercessor, a support and a guide
in times of trouble.
So with this moment I have with you,
invites you to get to know this humble and hardworking foster dad, who the church confidently
proclaims both to be the mirror of patience and even the terror of demons.
While Scripture never shows Joseph ever speaking, as we know the cliche, actions always speak
louder than words, Joseph was a man of such profound integrity, doing the right thing
especially when nobody was looking.
He didn't abandon his betrothed Mary after she was found to be pregnant with someone else's
child.
And he believed the revelation of the angel who presented the true origin of her conception,
forced to flee his native land because of the dictates of an irate potentate.
He bravely faced every danger while protecting his wife and child.
He understands how God works through all things, even those things that seem to be the
most God forsaken.
He's indeed the mirror of patience, because He sees the big picture at all times, knowing
that goodness and beauty and truth will prevail in the end.
He understands shame and disrespect, being silenced, even in the pain caused by family
being indifferent to his plight as he arrived with his pregnant fiance to his hometown
and no one even among his relatives would take him in.
Perhaps though the most significant lesson that this silent servant can teach us through
the witness we have of him in his brief presentation in the gospel is his lesson of vulnerability.
While keenly St. Joseph was probably aware of his weakness, think about it, knowing that
his wife was the sinless chosen handmade of the Lord, and that the child over whom he
pledged his fatherhood was to be a manual, the God with us.
His imperfections were the only ones in the house, but he knew that when he became aware
of his weaknesses and yielded not to them but to the one who heals, that is where
great grace flows.
How holy this made St. Joseph, what a powerful lesson he gives to us, to yield before the
one whose power is made perfect in weakness, says St. Paul.
My dear brothers and sisters in the church built over the supposed home of St. Joseph
in his workshop in Nazareth.
There's a statue of this venerable tradesman as he has one arm protecting the child Jesus
and in his other arm, a scroll that simply says,
Ete Ad Yosef, go to Joseph.
I want to encourage you when you have a moment of your own
to reflect on the gospels, to look at the events
of our Lord's coming through the eyes of His foster dad.
This mirror of patience, this one because of His fidelity
was the terror of demons.
I invite you now to please stand as we close in prayer.
O mighty God, we praise you for another day.
We thank you for surrounding us with so great a cloud of witnesses who show us how to
love as you love these heroes of virtue.
Rain down upon this chamber and these halls your spirit of wisdom in understanding.
Inspire within the hearts of these civil servants an undying devotion to the truth.
with them the graces they need as they pursue the common good on behalf of us all.
May they be faithful representatives of your people.
Consol and strengthen them to make these hidden sacrifices out of love to lead our beloved
state. May the example and witness of St. Joseph spur them on through this legislative day
and indeed through the rest of their lives, amen.
for the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the
Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, Speaker. Doorkeepers will please unlock the doors.

We are going on now to morning orders.
We're going on to morning orders and the chair is going to ask that members please take
your seats. Remember the advice that I've dispensed from up here for a lot of years.
Treat the member in the well as you would want to be treated if you were in the well.
A really complex thing. All right. Chair recognizes for a morning order.
Chairman Matt Dubnik.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I unfortunately
bring side news of a very tragic event
that occurred yesterday morning in my district around 10
o'clock when we were convening.
There were hundreds of hardworking
Georgians that went to work at foundation food groups,
Manufacturing facility in Gainesville and, unfortunately,
a liquid nitrogen line erupted.
It resulted in five deaths on the scene of six
that the hospital.
There are three that are still in the hospital
in critical condition.
Three firefighters treated and released one
that a fourth that is still there at the hospital.
And we hope is going to be released this morning.
But I do want to, in light of the tragedy,
also pause and give such tremendous praise to Hall County Sheriff's Office, Hall County
Fire Department, Gainesville Police Department, and Gainesville Fire Department. As many of
you know, Gainesville and Hall County's been hit so incredibly hard by COVID, and we're
still in the middle of that. But within half an hour, Northeast Georgia Health System
stood up a remote triage facility. It treated over 130 workers from that facility in conjunction
with free chapel worship center there on their campus so a very sad day and in
Gainesville and Hall County and I hope you would join me in a moment of silence
just to remember those lives that were lost. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair
recognizes representative Robus Show for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It said that there's a special
bottom between fathers and daughters, and I know that's true.
My father Walter Guillot, and you only thought the name you had a problem with, was Robus
show, passed away last Friday peacefully at my home, where we were honored to support
him for the last six years of his life. He died at the age of 95. I want to thank everyone
for all of the kind thoughts and words. Daddy was an amazing man. He worked for the
same company for 60 years and then started his own companies at the age of 80. Daddy
He was 16 when he heard about the bombing at Pearl Harbor and his brothers were out in
the sugar cane fields cutting sugar cane.
He and his three brothers, all of them older, daddy was the baby, all went to enlist that
day, the next day, sorry, because it was a Sunday that they heard.
My dad was rejected because he was actually born blind in his left eye.
But he didn't give up.
His three brothers did enlist in various areas of the service and served throughout World
War II and also one of my uncles served his entire career.
But Daddy didn't give up.
He went back to the age of 17 but was rejected again because he was still blind in the eye.
When he turned 18 though he had finally figured out the system and he actually cheated on
his eye exam.
And yes from that I know of this is the only time in his life that he ever cheated
at anything.
He served in the Navy during World War II in the Pacific Theater, where he was the machinist
first class from 1944 to 1946, on the USS LSM 340.
He was part of the Philippine Liberation Force and the Japanese invasion force.
Sixteen million Americans served during World War II, and this week another member of
the greatest generation went to a final resting place.
There are only two percent of these Americans left with us, and I have been blessed to learn
his stories and to be able to pass them on to future generations.
His family and friends were a vital part of his life.
Remember my dad was the youngest of eight children, and he enjoyed gatherings where good
food and great conversations were the main event because we are from Louisiana.
Every summer he would take all of us in the family station wagon, and we would take weeks
long cross-country trips, which were created amazing memories for all of us seven children.
Few things gave him more pleasure than sharing a hamper of boiled crabs with family and
friends at Supermore Point.
Daddy taught me to treat everyone with respect and to always give back to make life better
for those around you.
To stand up not only for yourself, but for others who may not have a voice.
And again, remember, you had to do that when you were one of seven kids.
I will always be daddy's girl and try to live up to his vision.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dempsey for a morning order. I think she's going to be
joined by Chairman Lumsden and Representative Scottkins.
Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last night we spoke to a group in
and we actually tried to explain the feelings
of being in the house right now.
How every morning begins with painful loss and reflection
of life that we each care about
and then have touched each of ours.
I ask you today to help me recognize someone
who we lost in our hometown.
Those lives that we're celebrating have been touched
by the loss of COVID, by natural causes,
By tragic impacts also of the tragic situations
that we face as we all try to journey through COVID
and the isolation that is felt.
Yesterday morning, we lost a great saying in Rome.
Her name is Dorothy Jordan.
I had the privilege of working with her a lot.
She is the wife of former Chief Justice Norman Fletcher.
I said Jordan, it was Jordan Fletcher.
I'm so sorry.
Dorothy Fletcher.
She lost her battle to COVID after weeks in the hospital.
We all know people that are fighting today.
We all know people that our hearts are heavy for.
And I just ask you right now, to be in prayer,
to pause a moment for Chief Justice Fletcher,
for his family, for his children and grandchildren,
and for the saint, another saint that is making her way to heaven.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Carpenter
for a morning order.
Thank you, Speaker.
I come today infuriated by the actions of my local GOP
and one lobbyist with a weird mustache.
It is not an absurd idea to allow a DACA student
to pay a taxpayer rate for college
when in fact they are or will be taxpayers.
The federal government needs to get their act together,
secure the borders, and streamline the immigration process.
Everyone in this room can trace their heritage
to an immigrant.
Praise God until the 1920s, America had a show up
immigration policy, or a huge majority of us in this room
would not be here today.
Furthermore, the immigration policies of ancient Egypt
allowed Joseph and his family to survive a famine.
Jesus Christ, to escape the wrath of Herod, our Republican Party has always been about
fairness and opportunities, and it's high time that we extend these opportunities to
these tax paying individuals who have been in Georgia since 2013 or longer through no
fault of their own.
Move just across the speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Eric Allen for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, everyone.
One of the communities that have been impacted
very heavily during the current pandemic
are those that are suffering from substance use disorders.
Since March of last year, substance use has been up
as much as 30%.
And we cannot turn our eyes away from this situation
or this issue, but there is hope
because of the strong recovery community here in Georgia.
And the support that this body gives
to that recovery community.
Next Tuesday, February 2nd is gonna be
annual recovery in addiction day and although it will be virtual this year, it is more important
than ever that we continue to support Georgians in recovery. So let's remove the stigma and
encourage those that we know who are suffering from or dealing with substance use to seek the
support they need and to inform them that recovery is an option and recovery is real. So thank you
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I oath well.

If you have signed up for an announcement, please make your way to the front of the chamber
now.
We're about to do announcements.
If you have signed up, I want you to help me wish a happy birthday to the Chair of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, Chairman Darling Taylor, happy birthday, Chairman Taylor.
They recognize his representative, Holland, for an announcement.
Do you do you have an announcement you know sometimes there is a reason that I ask you
to pay attention and be orderly and be quiet so that maybe you hear your name
called or something like that. I'm getting too soft and weak in my latter
for 12-year representative Williams.
