Okay. Uh we've got some special guests
here with us today. And if any of you
folks make it down to Georgia Southern,
you might want to know these people that
I'm going to introduce to you today.
It's Chief of Police Day here at the
Capitol, as you all know. And we're glad
to have some of our finest here with us
today. The chief of police at Georgia
Southern University. They're in the
back. Trey Drowy. Raise your hand. Trey,
Charlie Bowen,
David Wright, and Tyrone McBride.
[applause]
Thank you for being here today and thank
you for what you do every day to make
our campuses and uh safe. Appreciate
y'all being here. Thank you. Okay, let's
go ahead and get started. Uh,
well, I was going to take the ladies
first, but Chairman Glet, go ahead since
you're up there.
[laughter]
>> Represent Ball.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've and
members of the committee, I've got House
Bill 1181. That's on page three. It's
about the fifth one down.
This bill uh cuts some red tape that um
is in our code. It it allows a deedent's
car title to come directly from the
state where the estate is doiciled to
the firstdegree relative who is a
Georgia resident. Currently under
Georgia law, if the executive is in a
different state, it has to be titled in
that different state before it can be
titled in Georgia. And so I want to get
rid of that intermediate step
and I'll take any questions the
committee has.
>> Okay. Don't don't see any questions.
Thank you.
>> Okay. Thank you so much.
>> Vice Chair Hong Sue Hong.
>> Thank you chairman and members of the
committee. I have HB 1024 which is on
page two, bottom of page two. This bill
will update the current bankruptcy
homestead exemption, which has not been
updated for over 10 years, and it will
increase it to $50,000 for individual
filing and 100,000 for joint filers.
Thank you. I'll take any questions.
>> Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank
you.
>> Thank you,
>> Chairman.
Thank you, members. um take a little bit
of personal privilege if you don't mind
just to explain this bill a little bit
more in depth than I normally would. Um
this is House Bill 256. It's LC481711s.
Uh it was Chairman Weed's bill prior to
his resignation and I have taken it over
since then. It's a bill that we passed
very similarly in 2024
um but didn't get an agree over in the
Senate. I think we've worked that out.
But what this bill does is it updates
the Georgia's foster parent bill of
rights um to reflect how foster care is
actually delivered today. Since the
original bill was enacted in the early
2000s, placements now now routinely
include defax foster parents, private
agency foster parents, relative
caregivers, and fictive kin. This bill
ensures that all caregivers providing
day-to-day care to to children in the
state are treated consistently and
fairly. The bill focuses exclusively on
the relationship between foster
caregivers and the department of family
and children services. It does not
create new rights in juvenile court.
Does not alter custody or judicial
authority and does not mandate new
services or expenditures. What it does
is it clarifies and updates existing
rights rel uh related to communication,
training, participation in case
planning, normaly for children and
procedural fairness. It reinforces a
reasonable and prudent parent standard.
uh provides explicit protection against
retaliation and creates a clear
administrative grievance process. Uh the
bill also establishes a certified
volunteer advocate program which is
overseen by the office of child advocate
to support foster parents during
administrative interrogations and
disputes. I'm sorry, not interrogation,
investigations or disputes. Uh this
advocate is not legal counsel and does
not interfere with child safety
decisions. Um ultimately this bill is
about stability and retention. As you
all know, 30 to 50% of foster parents
leave the system each year, often citing
a lack of support, clarity, or fairness
in the process. Um, we're just improving
transparency and consistency. And I
think this bill is the is the right way
to go and happy to answer any questions
with it.
>> Okay. I have a question, Secretary
Kelly.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman
Gullet, you talk about the certified
volunteer advocate. I know we have the
CASA advocates for the children.
>> So,
>> is this just like a parallel program for
the actual foster parents?
>> Yeah, basically it's it's approved by
the uh
uh
it's in the section for relative care.
I'm sorry, certified. Yeah, it's it's
approved by the child advocate and
protection of children. So, exactly.
It's basically a CASA for foster parents
when they have disputes with with
defects.
>> Okay. Thank you.
have a question. Chairman Smith.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true
that you yourself are foster parent and
you and your wife have actually adopted
your child? And I commend you for your
patience as you work through that
tedious process and thank you for
bringing this to us.
>> Thank you so much. That's very true.
>> Chair Lady Cooper.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a
question. Is the department in favor of
this bill? Yeah, the department helped
me work through the language of the bill
to clarify it. So, I don't ever want to
speak for a department. Uh, but they uh
they did not they were not against the
bill.
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> Okay.
Don't see any other questions. Thank
you.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Okay. Chim Chassain.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee. I have HB 1086 this morning.
Third page three down. Um, this
legislation will help protect Georgia
firefighters from injury or death by
requiring simple, lowcost signage on
buildings that use the light frame wood
or light frame steel trusses. And we
we've seen this across the country where
many cities or or counties or even
states will pass building codes or
codes, fire codes, um, after something's
happened. And we want to try to be
proactive in Georgia and pass a law
that'll help first responders and
firefighters know that when they're
entering a building that's on fire, uh
that has these type trusses, these these
lighter gauge trusses, uh they will fail
quicker under under fire than a normal
solid truss or or a higher grade steel.
And this would require like a in
Florida, this just passed in Florida uh
a few years ago. they've got an 8 inch
like a Maltese cross on on in a visible
portion of the of the building to let a
first responder know that that building
uh could fail quicker and they would be
aware of those those circumstances. We
have uh the Georgia Fire Chiefs
Association, the Georgia Firefighters
Association, Fire Engineering Service,
Georgia Safety and Fire Division, the
Insurance Commissioner have all endorsed
this bill
and that's pretty much it. It's pretty
much the bill, Mr. Chairman. Okay, we
have a question. Shady Cooper,
>> what did you say they were made of?
>> Light gauge. It would be the light gauge
steel or light gauge wood. So, some of
these eye trusses, they have one they
have a middle section that goes through
there that's pretty thin with the two
eye beams above it. And they're great
trusses. They're they're built they're
engineered. They're they're solid.
They're sound. They don't warp. They
don't bend. But under fire, they'll
they'll fail quicker for danger of
firefighters.
>> Okay. Okay. Because I was just wondering
why we with all our building codes,
we're allowing them.
>> Yeah, they're they're good trusses.
They're there's nothing wrong with the
trusses at all other than they're a
danger when they're under fire.
>> Thank Thank you.
>> Yes.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
>> Thank you.
>> Reeves.
>> Good morning, Chairman Parish and
members of the rules committee. I'm here
to request House Bill 1042, the bottom
of page two. This is the Real Estate
Security and Title Act. Uh Vice Chair
Trey Kelly brought the uh judicial
security cleanup bill last year. Th this
is a followup because there was a
shooting in Indiana of a judge since we
adjourned Sydney die last year. There
was a criminal defendant who tried to
postpone his trial. The judge denied the
postponement. He enlisted four
accompllices to track down where the
judge lived and the judge and his wife
got shot in Indiana. So, the judicial
council uh looked at uh protecting the
tax parcel ID, phone number, spouse's
name, and things like that that could be
used by people like those accompllices
in Indiana to find where a judge lives.
Uh this protects our judges. There was a
second real estate title matter. um
quiet title in many parts of the code
has a special master that must be from a
county or or a judicial circuit.
Yesterday I was with a district attorney
who has eight counties. Some uh circuits
don't have that many counties and there
aren't eligible special masters to help
clear title. What this bill does is it
allows the special masters to come from
a federal judicial circuit which is
about a third of the state. Uh this was
requested by the real property section
of the state bar. Uh third and finally,
uh foreclosure funds. Uh we cleaned up
this language to add credit union funds
in addition to banks and savings and
loans. Uh in addition to cash and
cashiers checks and then credit bids, we
codified the law from several reported
cases about credit bids. Um thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
>> Okay.
Don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Represent Townsen.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
committee. This is uh HB970
LC650051S.
This is a health health bill. This is
for Georgia regarding Georgia High
School sports Georgia High School
association sports physicals. This
basically codifies and strengthens the
current u policies for Georgia High
School. It requires either a doctor, Dr.
Osteopath Medicine, physician assistant
or nurse practitioner to conduct the
physicals. It also requires a
cardiovascular screening
for the um for the participant as well.
U it has been endorsed by the American
College of Cardiology and the American
Heart Association. And this is um a bill
that came through fruition because there
are unfortunately some deaths that
happen especially during fall practice
uh cardiac cardiac related and so we're
trying to cut down on those. You can
never eliminate anything, but if we can
do the screenings and have the qualified
professional conduct it, then it's um
that's what's best for the kid, the
student athlete. And the physicals last
up to a year, 12 months or if it's done
after April 1st for the entire school
year following.
>> Okay, we have a question. Leader Hugley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um to the
gentleman.
>> Yes, ma'am. Will there be any difficulty
in any parts of the state for students
to obtain this additional requirement
for the heart?
>> No, ma'am. It's uh currently in place
now. What this does, we worked with
Georgia High School to solidify what
they're doing and tighten it up a
little. So, most your schools that are
doing the school physicals will still be
doing it on site, but the parent does
have the right to go to a private
practitioner and have their own physical
done by their own doctor or someone like
that.
I have another question. Chairman Martin
represent represent town. Thank you for
the bill. Isn't it true that the heart
screening is only required if it's
indicated? Many schools are doing that
now. We're just putting this in statute.
It's it's a not requirement for
everybody, but it's if it's indicated by
a medical professional.
>> No, you get a hard screening on site of
the physical. This bill will require
that.
>> Well, I understand. I just had some
people to come to talk to me, but I Can
I ask about the the further process if
if it if that screening on site which
many people do today is it not true if
that indicates something further what
you're doing is they then have to go and
and get that that taking care of the
athletes.
>> Yes sir. It is true.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Okay. Any members of the committee?
Chairman Jaspers.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That works. All
right.
Thank you, Chairman Paris. I've got
House Bill 810 that came from the health
committee the other day. It's a great
bill that works with Georgiaies because
they face a crisis driven by the
pharmacy benefit managers underpaying
localarmacies.
They're often reimbursing less than
actual cost of the drugs. House 810
addresses this by establishing a
reimbursement floor ensuring that
pharmacies stay open and pharmacy
deserts are avoided. There have been
200armacies in Georgia closed since 2015
including two in my community.
Essentially what the bill does is
creates a floor price where the PBM must
pay the pharmacy at least the actual
cost of the drug
using day which is national average
price. On top of that drug, the PBMS
must pay a professional dispens
dispensing fee to the pharmacy. There'll
be no hidden deductions like
administrative fees or what's called DIR
fees which are used to claw back money
from the pharmacy
and no averaging out using the effective
rate guarantee doesn't apply to the
Georgia state employee plan or Medicaid
as those are covered by different
regulations. It's really targeted toward
commercial and private insurance plans.
Okay.
Don't see any questions. Thank you
for Tim Jones.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask
um for House Bill 585.
This bill closes a current loophole in
which law enforcement is not provided
with information in specific and narrow
situations in which a vehicle is not
insured. So currently law enforcement
checks uh information provided to the
revenue department by insurance
companies on proof of insurance. The
information though does not include or
show when specific persons are excluded
on a policy from driving a vehicle. This
legislation will facilitate the transfer
of that information from insurance
companies to the revenue department,
which would then make it available to
law enforcement when they make a stop or
if there's an accident. They'll know if
the vehicle is insured uh or not insured
because an excluded driver is driving
the vehicle. I'm happy to answer any
questions.
>> Got a couple of questions.
>> Chairman Williamson, do you have
questions?
>> Yes, sir. uh to to the pro Tim, isn't it
true that this is very important to make
sure that in a at fault traffic accident
that the law enforcement officer
immediately knows that this is an
excluded driver and therefore uh can put
the non-vault party on notice that
they've got a problem.
>> That's right.
>> on their hands. U
very very much appreciate your
leadership on this. It's an important
loophole that needs to be closed. Thank
you.
>> Got another question. Represent
Williams.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh to the lady. Representative, do you
have any figures on what how it would
affect our current premiums if we were
able to eliminate uninsured drivers?
>> Well, yeah, it it's a burden. So, for
example, you you can purchase uh
uninsured motors coverage, which is
relatively inexpensive, but not everyone
chooses to purchase it. If you do not
purchase it and you have an accident
with an uninsured vehicle, it's all on
you. If you do purchase it, which many
of us do, um it is um it has a an effect
on our rates of raising our rates
because more uh often this this
insurance is having to be utilized to
cover the consequences of a vehicle that
is uninsured. It it's a valuable uh
it it is something that you would not
want to interfere with the ability of
people to purchase a policy that
excludes a driver because it can keep
their their rates down. If you have a a
very poor driver in your household, you
might choose to exclude them from your
policy to make your policy more
affordable. What's happening though is
there are some unscrupulous people
throughout the state and I heard
numerous instances of this from traffic
court judges and others that um they'll
exclude them to keep the rate down and
then they'll allow them to drive it. And
so what the bill does is it treats
with regard to penalties and
consequences, it treats it the same, no
differently than we would if a person
drove a under normal circumstances did
not have coverage on their car.
>> Have another question. Leader Hugley.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh thank you to
the gentle lady bringing the bill. I'm
trying to understand is the goal to
shield the person who is allowing
somebody to drive that has been
excluded.
>> No ma'am and I appreciate the question.
So in I think it's the last very last
part of the bill uh
the um
actually the wrong bill here. the so the
two last parts of the bill. The first
one um would allow the officer to cite
the driver for having lack of insurance.
The sec the last part of the bill would
hold the um policy holder who had
excluded uh this particular driver or
person from driving the vehicle if they
knowingly allowed them to. then the
penalties would be the same for that
owner of the policy as it would be if
the owner of the policy had no policy
and drove the car uninsured.
So the the the goal is to hold um one
number one is to to let the um officer
know have the full picture of whether
the car is insured or not and then the
natural co consequences of that if the
car is being util is being driven
uninsured.
Secondary
goal of the bill is um to protect the
rest of us so that if you have an
accident with a vehicle that is
uninsured that well it would have a a
depressive effect because there would be
a penalty and law enforcement would know
what what's happening we think at least
anecdotally from what I've learned is
that people are taking advantage of this
to get a cheaper polic policy and then
uh some are knowingly allowing the car
to be driven uninsured.
>> Chairman Pal,
>> I want to thank the lady for bringing
this bill, but is it not true? is a very
simplified matter that if you own a
policy, whether it be business or
personal, if you have employees or you
have family members or somebody that
might wish to borrow you or consistently
asking you to borrow your car or to use
your vehicle, that you can go to your
insurance company and say you wish them
to be excluded from that policy. And
that gives a very perfect reason that
you can then turn them down to say the
insurance company won't insure you. And
then when they start talking about well
my insurance know that insurance won't
cover it. So this basically is a safety
measure to keep people with questionable
or checkered driving records from being
able to har you borrow your car or your
vehicle and I thank you for that.
>> Okay. Don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
Okay. Little housekeeping here.
Recognize Secretary Kelly for a motion.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that
House Bill 211 be recommended to the
judiciary committee.
>> Have a motion and second it go back. Any
opposition?
It's back in judiciary. Have another
one.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that
House Bill 1024 be returned to
judiciary.
>> Have a motion and second. Any
opposition?
>> 10
>> 1024 1024 211 and 1024 dispatch. Okay.
Thank you. recognize uh vice chairman
lever.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um I have a
rule substitute I would like to proposed
for the committee's consideration today.
It's a substitute to House Bill 998.
That was the uh universal access fund
bill that I presented last week. Um I
believe the substitute is in your books.
It's LC 56570S.
560570S.
So just very briefly, you recall this uh
bill proposed to make some changes to
the universal access fund program which
helps ensure the availability and
affordability of just basic telephone
service in rural areas of our state. The
areas where it may not always be
economical for companies to provide that
service.
under the program, if they agree to
provide service in the areas where it
doesn't always make economic sense um
and to also have their rate subject to
regulation, they're allowed to seek
reimbursement for some of the costs of
providing service in those areas. The
the fund is about to was going to expire
in 2030 and that's starting to to limit
the ability of some of these companies
to get financing and to continue to
provide service. Um so we the initial
bill proposed to um remove what is
effectively a sunset and also allow
companies to opt into the program if
they desire to do so. A number of
concerns and the bill did pass by
overwhelming majority out of energy
utilities and telecommunications but
there were some concerns expressed uh
that we finally were able to to sort of
get specific uh input on. And so we're
doing five things in this substitute.
First, we we had originally removed the
sunset altogether. Now, we're just
backing it up another effectively 10
years to December 31, 2040. Second,
we're limiting the tier 2 providers, and
it already was limited to smaller phone
companies, but we're further limiting it
to in the in the substitute uh limiting
those providers that can opt in by
August one of this year based on certain
criteria. We're also imposing a $50
million annual cap on the dispersements.
We're requiring that audits be
submitted. The PSC already requires it,
but we're making it part of the statute.
And we're requiring PSC to submit a
bianial report on the fund because there
have been a number of questions about
how much money is in the fund, how many
people pay in, how many people get
dispersed. So, we're we're trying to
provide that information and report that
we provided to the governor, lieutenant
governor, and the speaker. Uh, and that,
Mr. Chairman, is the uh is the
substitute, and I would ask the
committee's favorable consideration of
approving that substitute.
>> Okay. You've heard the explanation. Any
questions?
Okay, I don't see any. Do I hear a
motion do pass from the rules committee?
>> Have a motion and a second. Any
opposition? Okay, it it moves forward
with a do pass recommendation.
Okay.
All right. Now let's set the calendar
for Thursday to be day 18
under modified open
be house resolution
999.
>> Have a move and second. Is there any
opposition?
It's on.
Okay. under modified structure
