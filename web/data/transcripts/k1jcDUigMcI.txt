You
You
Good morning everybody. If you would please come on in and take your seats and we'll get
started, we're going to have some lead frustration to open
us up with a word prayer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A few
please, y'all, please pray with me. Dear Heavenly Father,
thank you for this opportunity for us to serve as we begin
the Lenten season, we keep you and your son, our Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ, top of mind. We are on a busy, here on a
busy cross over day today with a lot of stress, anxiety,
hard work that's been put in. Please help us remember to keep
you first to love one another and do all things in service to you. It's in Jesus name
I pray. Amen. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Okay. We can tell our blue sheets picking up. We
got a lot of things to be considered. We're going to try to get everybody in and let you
be heard this morning. For those of you that are presenting, if you would please, before
you start tell us the bill number and where it's located on the blue sheet so that we can find that
and it'll make it go easier and brevity is good. So let's go ahead. Thank you. Come on up.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and good morning to the committee. I'm here to present House Bill 502
which you can find on page five of the blue sheet about a third of the way down.
and what this bill does is it takes the wait time guessing game out of voting for
parents with small children. If you have a child on the age of two and you go to
vote and there's a long line it allows you to go to the front of the line.
It merely removes an obstacle that some people might consider a barrier to voting.
It has been voted out of committee for the last three years unanimously.
Okay, don't see any questions, thank you. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and committee members, I am working on House Bill 146.
It is a very first bill on your blue sheet.
I am here this morning to actually share with you a very simple bill that came before
you last year.
is designating the month of April as Black Women's History Month, but not just Black
Women, but all minority women.
And I am passionate about this because I do a lot of work with young girls and I really
want to be able to encourage them to gain an understanding and an awareness and to embrace
the many achievements that are made and continue to be made in science, engineering, mathematics
and technology.
And by the way, the creator of this celebration is a Native Atlanta.
received a proclamation from the from several cities over the last six years. And she was
also honored by Governor Nathan deal with a commendation. That's the bill. Okay, don't
see any questions. Thank you. Thank you. Let me make clarification. If you have already
asked for your bill one time, you do not have to ask for it again. I think some of you may
have gotten an email saying to ask for it again but that's that's not so if you
have asked for your bill one time you don't need to ask for it again but if you
haven't asked for it you're welcome to get in line and ask thank you come
yes ma'am thank you good morning mr chair members of the committee mr chair
I have two bills that were passed out of committee submitted to rules but haven't
made the sheet yet can I I'm sorry say again no no yes they're on the
Okay, go ahead and ask for them, yes, ma'am.
Okay, so today I present House Bill 10,
and this is a bill that simply strengthens
to protections for individuals who've been arrested,
but never convicted of a crime,
removing their booking arrest photo,
like their mug shot, from the Remove for Pay website.
The media can still post the arrest photos.
It's HP 10.
Okay, thank you, did you say you had another one?
Yes, and the second bill is HP 311
that seeks to amend the state's code
by removing the age cap of 70
for people that are still working beyond the age of 70.
So the code says 70 and we just wanna take that code off.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Let me remind you also a lot of bills came out yesterday.
These bills will not be eligible until the clerk
reads them today and accepts that.
So you may run into this, but if anybody's here
they want to present the bill, we're going to go ahead and do that since we're getting
sorted toward time crunch here.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On page 7, the seventh bill down, House Bill 657, George is a national leader when it
comes to supporting our neighbors that are in recovery of different types.
In fact, we've got the second highest number of RCOs in the country here, second only
behind Texas.
So this bill comes at the request of Georgia Recovery Council and DVHDD that would
certify Certified Peer Specialist the different types, how they would become certified.
It defines what a recovery community organization is and lays out some basic operating requirements
for them so that it protects the integrity of this network so that we make sure when
people are in recovery and they need that support from their peers that we know that they're
getting quality care and that it's consistent across the state.
No, I don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Chairman.
Members of the committee, I have HB217, it's second page on the blue sheet in the middle.
This was recommitted to committee.
There were some concerns by Speaker Pro Tem that we've perfected some language on here.
But this is a dual achievement program with the TCSG basically allowing students who
have withdrawn from high school to go back and earn their high school diploma as well
as some technical certificates.
No questions.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
One question.
This bill has a sunset which makes it timely to pass it and it is an agency slash governor's bill.
That's correct, it is, so it's a pilot program that we enacted four years ago, it's going to end at the end of this year, so we're extending in another five years with this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning and thank you Mr. Chairman my bill is House Bill 88 page one.
It would provide student loan forgiveness for vet technicians where we have a shortage
of veterinarian technicians in the state of $150,000 for five students $30,000 a piece.
Mirra's House Bill 172 that we pass unanimously for veterinarians, but we also have a shortage of pet technicians in the state.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I bring to you this morning House Bill 638.
It's on the top of page seven.
It's the very first bill.
And I'm bringing this bill on behalf of Marta.
I want to especially thank the pro tem for her assistance in perfecting this bill as well as chairman jasper's for hearing this bill late Tuesday night
Especially this bill is going to allow marda to use cameras on their buses
To enforce their bus rapid transit lanes that have been designated by the city of Atlanta to be used specifically for transit
These would restrict the violations of
of the lanes to only parked vehicles,
only parked vehicles would be, if we're issued a citation,
there would be a six month warning period
and education period for the community
before anything would start,
specifies specific signs,
be put up to alert people of this
in addition to the education program.
The fines would be identical to the distracted driving bill
and would be limited to those amounts,
only no additional administrative fees.
There is a sunset of five years on this bill,
if this doesn't work, but this will allow them to hopefully,
like said, enforce their best rapid transit lanes
since we do have a lot of great events coming to Atlanta.
Are there any questions?
No, I've seen any questions, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you to the committee page 47 spaces from the
bottom house bill 442. What this bill does here is it help us take full
advantage of the film industry that we have created here in Georgia by allowing
our young people to participate by giving them a max of 25 days of absence from
school when there's a contractual agreement the discretion of the
administration there allows it and there's a certified teacher on set to make
sure that that child is receiving the work. Right now we're bringing in a lot of
children from California and Texas here to Georgia to do movies as because of the 10
day restriction we currently have and that's to be a Mr. Jim.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'm seeing questions.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Page three, second from the bottom, HB 383.
This is the Georgia High School NIL Protection Act and this bill codifies what's in place
by the Athletic Associations for High School Student Athletes. It puts a sunset on contracts
that high school athletes currently have so that when they finish high school, that contract
ends and then they renegotiate contracts at the next level.
Okay, I don't see any questions. Thank you. Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, on the top of page 8, the very top House Resolution 174, this is a constitutional
amendment that would move our state school board from being appointed by the governor
to being elected in the same manner that we elected the OT board currently, state school
board would then recruit and hire a state school superintendent.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Yes sir, in March.
More in Chairman, page eight, fourth built down, House Resolution 450.
This would authorize putting a question on the 2026 ballot asking Georgians if they wanted
to legalize mobile sports, mobile online sports betting only.
Okay, we do have a question for you, Jim Stevens has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to make sure that I'm clear of what I'm voting on.
Is this, am I voting for hope and pre-K money?
That's correct.
Thank you.
OK.
No other questions.
Thank you.
One other?
Yes, sir.
If you flip the back to page seven, almost two-thirds
the way down, HB 686.
This would be the enabling language.
Should that constitutional amendment pass?
OK.
Thanks, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I bring you House Bill 439 is on page 4 about the middle. House 439 relates to the compensation of dealers and merchants for reporting and paying taxes and the reimbursement deduction. This is your local hardware store or a boutique or a restaurant.
In 2024, there was a study committee that looked at the impacts of sales and excise tax and
Merchant fees on card processing and one of the things they recommended was to
Support small bid this by raising the vendors compensation
Right now the vendors compensation is 3% of the first $3,000
This bill raises to the first 3% of
of $10,000 and it remains one half a 1% over $10,000 so it's just the first 3% of the $10,000.
I asked the revenue department, they had not vendished compensation and not been raised
in at least 20 years.
This bill would help small businesses bottom line and I think it's really good timing
with Hurricane Elaine, a lot of small businesses suffering from that also.
Thank you.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Franklin.
Franklin.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is House Bill 357 on page nine, second down.
And this, basically, gives a tax credit
to Habitat for Humanity, up to $2 million a year
with the sunset and their capital.
They're affiliates for capital $2 million.
I have to go in more details of the bill if you can lie,
but they were out here yesterday
doing their first ever capital build.
and I hope many people were able to see it,
but there's many benefits in this,
but one of them would be in an effort
to address the workforce housing in this day.
So happy to answer any questions, yeah?
Okay, don't say any questions.
Thanks, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Can we come?
House Bill 330, bottom of page eight.
House Bill 330 is sort of a cleanup bill
for some of our state income tax credit programs,
more specifically for the law enforcement tax credit program known as less and also
the peach education tax credit.
The bill also adds some uniformity to both programs in order to mirror some existing
tax programs.
If you recall, we made some of these changes to Georgia Heart last year and these new,
the peach and Georgia Heart and the last act all have similar technical language to
include the sunset date extensions, the pre-approval requirements and similar caps for qualified
contributions.
So, overall, a few changes to the peach and law enforcement programs, but we also add
in language that achieves some uniformity across several detached private programs.
Any questions, Mr. Chairman?
You got a question for us.
Big protein.
I had a question.
What is the cap lifted from and to on each one?
For the education, it's from 15 to 20 million.
We raised it to 15 last year from five.
The law enforcement would remain at three
and qualify contributions for corporations
would drop from 75% to 30%.
Okay, don't see any other questions.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Chair and members of the rules committee
On page 8 under structured rule, House Bill 260 respectfully request this bill, which
is an increase in the state minimum homestead from $2,000 to $5,000.
That would be the first increase since 1978.
Appreciate the speaker identifying this issue and Chairman Blackman's work with the Senate
on this respectfully request that.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I've got a call from the rules office.
presented House Bill's 531-27318 respectfully request those. Thank you. Thank you.
If you need to leave me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And if I may, I have two bills. First bill is
HB390 on page four, first bill on the page known as a halo act. What this bill seeks to do is
provide protections for our first responders. What it does is it creates a felony violation for
for obstructing or hindering them
from doing their official duties on the scene.
There's already some provisions in the law
to help protect our law enforcement,
but what this bill does, it also brings in firefighters
and emergency medical technicians
or emergency medical professionals
when they are performing their official duties
on an act of scene.
Okay, don't see any questions on that.
And second bill, Ms. Chairman, if I may, is HB602.
It is on page six, seventh, down.
It is our campus protest bill.
This bill applies to students who
receive state scholarships, loans, or grants,
such as hope to attend Georgia's public and private post
secondary educational institutions.
It says that if you are such a recipient and are convicted
of certain acts of violence, vandalism, and aggression
that you will lose financial support from the state
for one semester, except for that.
We're not talking here about peaceful protest.
The conviction must be providing violence
or similar unlawful behavior, damaging property
forcefully and physically violating other's access to buildings and events and engaging in harassing behavior.
We've got a couple of questions for you.
Representative Millen.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author over here.
I'm sorry.
Hi.
So I just, I want to understand what we're trying to do with this bill.
Obviously, I would not be sitting in this chamber had it not been for students who
protested who were arrested, who were beaten, who were accused of being
disruptive and accused of being violent. My concern is this, if a student on a
campus violates the criminal code, gets arrested, gets convicted, gets sentenced,
gets suspended or expelled from school, why do we also need to take away their
financial support? Don't we want that student to reintegrate back
back into an educational setting?
We do.
What this is, this is another step, another tool for the University System, T-S-G, and our
private institutions.
We've seen over the past year protests going on campus, and at times we've gone on
ruling.
This is not going after peaceful protests.
This is not telling students you cannot protest, you cannot have your voice heard.
But once the line is crossed, and there are certain crimes you commit, you will lose hope
if convicted for one semester.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Fleming, is there a rule substitute on this bill?
I'm sorry.
Is there a rule substitute on this bill?
Is it not true that the bill that passed the House Higher Ed Committee would make Boeing
pissing and a sit-in under this bill, would it not penalize it for that?
Is that not considered a peaceful protest in your mind?
If they are allowed to have a sit-in, they're allowed to have their protest,
but once it becomes unlawful and there are laws broke, that is what this bill
affects Mr. Whip and as you know, we had three committee hearings on this with lots
of discussion in the base.
So to clarify for the record, this would take away financial aid for students who
to engage in peaceful civil disobedience?
No.
If only if they violate the law.
No, sir.
Yeah.
Mr. Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the author, following up on the last question,
you do understand that you can peacefully violate the law.
So when you say that a student can be penalized
for otherwise unlawful behavior,
if they are sitting in a place that they're not allowed to sit,
even if they're not hitting anyone,
even if they're not screaming,
I think the civil rights taught us that this.
It's still unlawful and you can still be arrested.
Is that your intention?
And they can still have that peaceful protest.
They can still have that peaceful system.
How?
How?
Line 36.
Otherwise unlawful.
OK.
We're going to ask a question, and we're
going to answer a question, OK?
Could you please explain how a student can engage
in peaceful but unlawful behavior
and not be penalized under your bill
considering the line of line 36.
Otherwise unlawful.
What our bill says, as you can still,
we are not going after the first minute rights.
We are not going after saying that they cannot do this.
We were just saying once that line is crossed
and laws are broken, that is what we're going after.
We are allowing, it is allowed.
That is your right to peaceful protest.
That is your right to have your voice heard.
That is right to have that.
But it is once you cross that line,
and there are laws broke.
That is what we're going after.
Any laws broke.
To me, it's pretty simple.
You can peaceful protest, and if you cross that line,
and it becomes unpeaceful, unruly,
that is when this act will take effect.
Do you recognize that a lot of civil rights protests
that led to a lot of rights being gained in the state
and others were peaceful, but they were otherwise unlawful?
Yes, and we have seen over the past year with these protests on college campuses that there are many many
many peaceful protests and there are many many times where students have had their voices heard and and they have followed the law
It is when that line is crossed and they are breaking the law. Mr. Chairman
He's not answering my question. You can be peaceful and break the law
So just because you're being peaceful doesn't mean you're not breaking the law doesn't mean you won't get arrested and this bill
would take away rights of those students who are doing exactly what I think you're
saying you want them to be able to do like those in the civil rights movement did
but you're still taking away their scholarship is that your intention?
Our intention is if you are unruly and you cross the line and you break the
law and you're convicted of that crime you're going to lose hope for the
substance. And the line is breaking the law not being not being loud. You have to
go through the process you have to you go through the trial and you have to be
convicted. Your bill doesn't do what you think it does thank you Mr. Chair.
Okay, here we go. We still got several questions and obviously there's a lot of interest in this build
I'm going to suggest that all of you that have questions get with the author and y'all have a conversation offline
And we'll go ahead and try to listen to some other folks here. Thank y'all
If you got one quick question, isn't it true, Mr. Chairman that this does not take away hope
This means it takes away your ability to use hope in the next semester
I just want to that's a very important part. It does not take away hope. It takes away the ability. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Look.
Y'all get together and have a conversation. Okay.
Thank you.
If you have any sense in
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I bring to you House Bill 646, which is on modified structure page
7 at the very top House Bill 646
for corners and we all have a corner and our district provides minimum salaries for corners
throughout the state of Georgia. That is House Bill 646.
Okay, no questions. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm here to present House Bill 668. It's a little on the
middle of page seven and what this bill sets to address is the fact that the
statutes currently on the books in Georgia with respect to service animals and
service dogs and training are extremely problematic because when they're
overlaid with the Department of Justice final requirements set forth in those
regulations it causes a much confusion as to how what the applicability is and
this bill sets to address all of those issues and bring Georgia in alignment
with surrounding the states and the federal statute.
Would that be happy to take questions?
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you.
And Mr. Chairman, I presented a House Bill 461
previously, so I'd also like to ask.
Okay, don't have to ask for that again, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Happy crossover.
I was asked to present House Bill 506.
I've already presented that previously,
so I'll skip that one.
We can go to House Bill 728,
which needs to be read by the clerk again.
House Bill 728 provides confidence and clarity
to our state election officials,
but more importantly, to our voters
by requiring any rules and regs issued
by the State Elections Board
within 75 days of an election.
Don't go into effect until 30 days after the election.
This one hasn't been read yet.
Correct.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Mr. Chairman on page 8 third from the bottom house bill 266 in
collaboration with Representative Ballard and Chairman Shaw bring to you a
substitute to house bill 266 which would double the military retirement income
tax exemption going from 17,500 to 35,000 with a gradual tax year increase of
five thousand dollars I'm starting in tax year 2027. Thank you. You don't see any
questions. Thank you. Yes sir. Good morning rules. Thank you for sharing my
heavy crossover day. My bill is not on the blue sheet if it was it would have
been on page four between H. B. 461 and H. B. 466. I would like to ask for H. B. 464. H. B. 464.
I would like to ask for H. B. 464. Okay, it hadn't come out yet, right? No, just made it out of
committee. Okay, thank you. May I continue? H. B. 464 simply provides protection for individuals
who are victims of sexual crimes or violent crime,
but they can report those crimes without penalties
or prosecution or being afraid that they too will be drawn
into court and be prosecuted or witness jail time.
So simply providing victims protection
so they will no longer or continue to be victimized.
Thank you.
Okay, good, no questions.
Thank you.
It came out of the judiciary non-civil.
Thank you.
I yield the will.
I put a star by that.
thank you I guess if you don't ask you don't get right okay how about wait a minute one
more here come on thank mr. Chairman on page last page second to the bottom house bill
So 577, this creates a state level solution to the vapor vapour issue that we've seen with
illegal disposable Chinese vapes flood the market.
No saying questions, thanks sir.
Okay, any members of the committee have requests.
Okay, you've got a couple of chair lady Cooper.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Bill 717 on page 7, they're down close to the bottom.
The Board of Medicine is asked for this.
We are having clinics popping up all over our state, which are using an off-label drug
and injecting it to cause supposedly help with depression, but the drug causes hallucinations
and out-of-body experiences and extremely likely to affect the respiratory system and
leaving to a possible death.
They're totally unregulated and this will put regulations
around them just like we get on paying clinics.
Okay, thank you, don't see any questions.
Chairman Weaveson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Bring the House Bill 586 page nine,
very last bill on the blue sheets.
And I want the attention about entrepreneurs in the room
and that might be listening to us online
because every entrepreneur knows what I'm about to refer
because house built 586 extends the current exemption on intangibles recording
tax on recorded security dates from three years to seven years. Currently
bikes make 35 month loans and renew every three years to avoid this tax on the
borrower. This measure would allow longer loans and give interest rate certainty
to the borrower and thereby reduce paperwork on both the borrower and the
biker. Since this tax is currently being avoided because of these three
or reserves, and this is important, there will be very minimal fiscal impact of the local
governments which collect this tax. There's no fiscal impact to the state. It comes with
a strong support for my banking community and no long, and no objections from both either
the Credit Unions, ACCG or GMA. It simply offers interest rate certainty to the bar and
reduces paperwork. Appreciate your favorable consideration in this measure.
Okay, don't see any questions on that.
Thank you, sir.
Jim and Hawkins.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Haspill 419 came out of higher ed.
Yesterday, this is a bill that deals with Narcan.
Is we all remember a hope that we passed a bill last year
that put Narcan dispensers in government buildings.
I removed colleges and technical universities
and technical colleges.
I do the fact that they did not know
how many numbers are locations of buildings
with AEDs, so this bill now addresses putting those in the universities and colleges.
This is a very important bill.
You know, it only takes five minutes for brain cells to start to die on an overdose, so
it's very imperative that these young folks have this.
Thanks, sir.
Don't see any questions.
Jim Lonson.
House Bill 5-11 on the blue sheet page 9-5 from the bottom.
This is a piece of model legislation that comes from the National Council of Insurance
Legislators.
I would note that several of our surrounding states have already passed this.
Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina and several other states are considering
at this session and in light of the storms and things that we have experienced here in
Georgia recently, it simply puts another tool in the toolbox for our citizens.
It deals with the reduction of one's taxable income by way of a catastrophic savings account
which can be used in a declared catastrophic event, works much similar to a health savings
account.
It can be a regular savings account or a money market account but it's got to be designated
as a catastrophic account and it can only be applied for one's individual home.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Chairman Jasper's.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have two bills, House Bill 248,
the geothermal tax credit on page eight.
And additionally, today I have on page six,
House Bill 604.
So bill that's come from my community
and that those around me,
it will give the local elections superintendent
the ability to do a hand accounting, not a recount,
but a hand accounting of all ballots cast in one race.
It is very permissive for their superintendent,
and it allows them to terminate it immediately
if they've so seen that it was in interfering
with the normal counting the ballots.
Where it comes from is when a community wants
to do a hand accounting or recount,
there's no letter of the law that allows them to do this.
And so local attorneys choose to rule against it and not allow the election boards to do it.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Is that everybody on the committee?
Okay.
Speakers have been fussing at me because we've been getting in there late.
And I told them we were going to make up for that today.
So we're not going to add anything to the calendar this morning.
about 20 something bills that are on the calendar already. I would expect to be
talking with you later on around lunchtime so just hang around and it's gonna be
a long day so let's all be on our best behavior and have a good day. Thank you.
