----------
They are convening having arrived. All members will please report to their assigned seats and take their seat. All members will report to the House of Representatives, the clerk will ring the bell. All right. We're about to have the morning roll call. All members. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Well, good morning. What a beautiful day out there today, huh? A little windshield factor felt like about green bay, but the sun is shining. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 34th House District Representative Bert Reeves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I get to introduce a really good friend of mine here this morning. Dr. Ick Riker, and I tell you I love him. I worked for him back in the summer of 1999. I was a youth ministry intern at his church, a North Star in Kinesa, at the time. And Mr. Speaker, I've had to wait seven years. I've wanted to bring him down since I've been a representative, but I had to wait for the pandemic to bring him down. And the reason why Ick is because normally in a non-pandemic time, after you give your sermon, everybody lines up and talks to you. I can't risk, Tray Kelly, being able to tell lies about me to you. So I had to bring you down here during the pandemic year. But Dr. Riker has lived an amazing life. He actually started out. He was a DJ in Atlanta. He was a DJ for Z93 a long time back in the day. But God called him into the ministry. He's grown churches all over the Metro Atlanta area, New Hope, down in Fayetteville, North Star, in Kinesa. And now Piedmont Church in Marietta. He's been the president of the Georgia Baptist Convention. He has authored numerous books and speaks all over the country. But the thing I want to say the most about him is what the heart that he has for our community. In addition to being a full-time pastor, he has been the CEO of a major nonprofit, Must Ministries, which serves a lot of Northwest Georgia, feeding the hungry and providing shelter for the homeless. And that has really become his passion and his leadership in that organization has been phenomenal. And he was telling me earlier that in a normal year, Must Ministries feeds between 32 and 34,000 different individuals throughout a year. And in 2020, they fed 178,000 folks during our pandemic year. And so, his leadership with Must Ministries is serving the people of Northwest Georgia in a tremendous way. And it is a real honor to welcome my friend, Dr. Ick Riker. Thank you. Thank you, Ick. I appreciate that kind introduction and speaker Rossin. Thank you for allowing me this privilege and it's an honor to get to be with you today. And let me take white such an honor for me. I grew up in downtown Atlanta on Marietta Street. And so we used to ride our bicycles down to the state capital and we would walk around and just think about the opportunity to be able to walk in this building. And I think that you have the privilege of being able to serve the state of Georgia in the role that you've been elected to and to be able to come into a place that's as historic as the place that we're in today. And so it is quite an honor to be with you. And I know that everyone in this room is a leader. That's why you've been elected into the position that you're in. And I want to talk to you for just a couple of moments about leadership. And I want to tell you about the greatest leadership lesson that I ever learned in my entire life. And ironically, it took place right there on Marietta Street because I tend to go Smith Elementary School. And in the sixth grade, I was selected. I was so outstanding that I was selected to be a school patrol person. Have any of you in this room ever been a school patrol person? Take a good look around. If anything happens, you find one of us. We'll take care of you. We'll make sure that you're escorted. And just I mean, we know what we're doing. We are highly, highly trained. And I think back to the fact that on Marietta Street, at the corner of Rice Street near Grove Park, I'm sitting there as a sixth grader helping first and second graders get through intersections with all the traffic that existed on Marietta Street. But when I was a school patrol boy, I learned our motto. And our motto was the greatest lesson, honestly, that I've ever learned in leadership in my entire life. A few years ago, I was with a group and I said, how many of your school patrol and a lot of them raised their hand like today. And then I just kind of rhetorically said, do any of you remember what our motto was? And someone yelled out, stop, drop, and roll. Dude, that's if you're on fire. You cannot move small children through an intersection with any efficiencies by yelling stop, drop, and roll. Now that's not the deal. But it was the motto that was the single greatest leadership lesson that I've ever learned. Because here's what the motto said. And as I start it, you'll be able to remember it. It's stop, look, and listen. Stop, look, and listen. Greatest leadership lesson that I've ever learned. If you want to have some fun with it, take it home tonight. And when your spouse or your significant other starts talking to you, stop what you're doing. Look at them, and then listen, and watch them freak out. Because the first thing they're going to do when you do that is they're going to go, why are you looking at me? And you're going to say, well, because you're talking. And then you're going to hear them say, well, you normally don't look at me when I'm talking. And you're just going to reply to them, well, you know, I heard a little, you know, opportunity this morning about how to be more engaged. Because to me, that's what you do as representatives of this great state. You do, you have the job of stopping and looking and listening to the people who help to elect you. For you to come here and to stop what you're doing, to look and to listen, to what takes place inside of this chamber, this very sacred spot that you're able to come to. Because you help to be able to direct what happens in the lives of ordinary citizens every day. And it's an awesome responsibility. And it's one I know that you do not take lightly. I want to show you out of scripture very quickly how this very same principle came into being. It's in the book of Nehemiah, which I think is the greatest leadership book in the Bible, it's in the older testament. And there was a day that a group of people came to Nehemiah and Nehemiah had never been to the city of Jerusalem. One of those men was named Hennoniah. And Nehemiah said to Hennoniah, how are things in Jerusalem? And when he asked that question, Hennoniah looked at him and he said, there's only a remnant of the prophets who survived in captivity. He said, they're in distress, they're in disgrace, and the walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire. And when Nehemiah heard these words, I want you to listen to what he did. He said, I sat down. One of the best things that we can do as leaders is learn to sit down and not always talk. There's a lot of things that are going on in our country today. There's a lot more listening, taking place, and that listening is something that's definitely been needed. And he said, I sat down and I fasted and I prayed and I wept before the God of Heaven. He said, I looked at the situation and I wanted it to be better. To me, this is a bias for action for people who are people of faith. You weep, you mourn, you fast, and you pray, and you ask for God to give you wisdom in this awesome, awesome responsibility that you have. May we pray together? Almighty God, we give you thanks as we stand in this assembly today. We thank you God for the amazing men and women who serve in our armed forces all around the world and at the very doors of this assembly. God, we pray that you have grant protection. We pray, Lord, that you would help our nation to sit and to listen to one another more carefully, that there would be more conversations that are courageous about how we too can rebuild our walls. So God continue to grant that discernment to the people here today. Grant them knowledge about how to lead our great state of Georgia. And Father, I would ask you today that you would bless America. And we pray these things together and all of God's children said, amen. Do you pledge allegiance to me? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.

We are about to go on to morning orders. If you have signed up for a morning order, be up front here and be ready to go. Chair recognizes Chairman Watson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be really brief. I just need to make sure when I get home tomorrow that I get to stay in my house and not the dog house. So I need to wish my wife, Emily, happy anniversary. It's been 15 years, and nine of those I've spent here at the Capitol with you guys. But I need to tell her, thank you for the sacrifices that you make and the support that you provide for our family. And I love you and the girls, and we'll see you tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Bernal for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On Monday, November 2nd, my youngest stepdaughter Valerie Bernal passed away. Then on November 8th, my mother Mary Hammons passed away. Our family had two funerals in one week. If that wasn't enough, on December 15th, we put our boxer Cocoa to sleep. Today is my brother Kevin's first birthday without either parent. I want to wish him a happy birthday and let you know that even with all of that, I trust God. Proverbs three, five, and six. I yield the well, thank you. Chair recognizes representative Kendrick for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleague. So today I rise to celebrate yet again the history that was made on January the 20th as the United States elected its first ever woman as vice president of the United States. Carla Devy Havers was born on October the 20th, 1964, and she is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. As I stated, she is the United States first woman vice president and the highest ranking female elected official in US history and the first African American and first Asian American vice president. She was born in Oakland, California, and she graduated from Howard University where she plays my awardee, Alpha Kappa Alpha Awardee, and she went to the University of California, Hank Steens College of Law. Following the election of Joe Biden as US president in the 2020 election, she assumed office as vice president of the United States on January 20th, 2021. Her first act as vice president was wearing in her replacement, Alex Badea and Georgia Senators, Raphael Warnock and John Assof. Her mother told her that she may be the first of many things, but to make sure that she is not the last. And so today we celebrate her making her story. Thank you. I'll just give you a minute. Chair recognizes representative Kasia for a morning order. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Good morning colleagues. This morning I'm here to talk about someone who sits right next to me because I think after we heard a lot about the election, me because I think after we heard a lot about grievance, we also need to hear a little bit about hope. I'm here to recognize the representative from George House District 177 Baldosta, Mr. Dexter Sharper. Dexter is a frontline worker and has worked as a paramedic for over 20 years. A few months ago, he got infected with COVID-19 and it hit him hard. He was in the hospital for 11 days and now he is a living reminder of what risk our frontline workers take every day in fighting this disease. He had no pre-existing conditions, no comorbidities. It should not have hit him that hard, but still it got close. He almost did not make it. Now he is one of the many COVID survivors who struggle with the long-term effects of this deadly disease, a long hola. Regardless, every day he shows up here, serving the people of his district in Georgia, he comes in with his little portable oxygen machine. He has to check his oxygen level every day regularly and he hopes that he will gradually regain full lung capacity, but it will take time and he is not sure. So if there is anybody who is still questions why we have to wear our mask or why we should get tested or keep social distance, talk to Dexter. He is a living proof of why we have responsibility to everyone around us and not just to ourselves. So let's give him a shout out and if you have time, give him a round of applause. Thank you, Dexter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Okay, the House will come to order. We are going on to the rules calendar. We are going on to the rules calendar. Cherry is going to ask that members please take their seats. If you already know everything you want to know and have a discussion that is really important, then take it out to an appropriate location. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 80. House Bill 80 by Rosita Rolston on the 7th Jones, the 47th Burns of the 159th in England of the 116th to be titled the Act to Men in Act Making and Providing Appropriations for the State Fiscal Year beginning July 1st, 2020 and ending June 30th, 2021 known as the General Appropriations Act. Ms. Bill, I'm referred to the Committee on Appropriations. Does that committee recommend a disbill due pass? Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a committee of the House for the purpose of considering House Bill 80, which is the Supplemental Appropriations Bill. The chair appoints the gentleman from the 159th District. Majority leader Burns is chairman to preside over the committee of the whole House. Good morning, colleagues. This time we'll recognize that the committee is chairman from the 116th to representative England to present a bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, everybody. I hope everyone is doing well and got a good night's sleep last night, so I don't put you to sleep too bad here this morning. You have in front of you two different documents, well actually three different documents. You have your tracking sheet, you have the bill, and then you also have a packet of budget highlights that House Budget Research Office has put together for you to be able to easily reference some of the changes, plus some of the highlights that were already presented in the Governor's budget, and seem brought it to us earlier this month. Always need to start off by thanking quite a few folks to Martha and Christine and our House Budget Research Office staff who do an incredible job every year, but especially this year with the need for a little bit of increased speed, that has meant that the days have been longer and the weekends have been much shorter because they have been here working with us, working for us. Well many of us have been able to be at home, be with our families. They've been sacrificing their time to be here doing the work that has to happen behind the scenes. So thank you to our subcommittees and subcommittee chairs and our members as a whole. Thank you for the participation that you did in the Joint hearings last week, the subcommittee hearings, the virtual format, and of course once again thank you to House Media Services and Betsy and her team for an incredible job that they did helping make all of those things happen. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Ashley Newton in my office and the other admins that work with our subcommittee chairs. It gets hairy sometimes and trying to get meeting notices sent out and figuring out how to get a Zoom link attached and a streaming link attached and all those sorts of things and they have done an outstanding job at that as well. Our friends and the Senate budget and evaluation office said, I mentioned yesterday when I started, we have worked literally on this budget since last fall and with them and with along with the Governor staff and OPB. So that's why when we go through the document today, you're not going to see an awful lot of changes. And again as I said yesterday, as OPB has to basically lock the budget down in December, as we continue down the stream, things continue to happen and you find out more and more information. And so the adjustments you see today will be those things, those bits of information that we have found out since they had to lock their version down before it came to us. And very quickly want to mention former colleague Terry Rogers, this beautiful new purple tie that I'm wearing today. Terry and I started years ago, both of our families have been impacted by Alzheimer's and purple and Alzheimer's color. And as always, I try to wear a purple tie when I present a budget on or a mother that we lost four years ago. So the amended fiscal year FY21 budget of $26.5 billion is built on a modest 2.5% increase over last year. The 2.5% is $654 million, just slightly under the 722 million that we're running ahead on revenue collections right now. And as I've also noted in yesterday in committee and in numerous interviews, we still have some headwinds in front of us. As we get to the tax filing season, we will start seeing refunds made. Withholding was taken out, personal income tax withholding was taken out of unemployment benefits when they were paid. So we do realize that there will be some impact of those refunds when they go out. So we have to be mindful of that. Georgia, as always, as well, has the benefit of a multi-stream revenue flow. Income tax, sales tax, corporate income tax, motor fuels, all of our fees come from many different directions. So typically, if we see one of those streams impacted, one of the others kind of help sustain or make up for it. And that's what we've been seeing through this COVID recession and now coming out of the COVID recession. Income tax has remained incredibly strong. Sales tax has remained incredibly strong. But we didn't see a drop off in motor fuel tax fairly significantly. It is now back to about where it is as about a two tenths of a percent difference from where it would have normally been to where it is today. In the amended budget, there are some adjustments. The primary adjustments come in those areas which we would all argue with the places that we should be making adjustments and doing it in the amended budget. The mid-year adjustment for increased enrollment in K-12 and help for those systems that seem declining enrollment of $147 million dollars is present there. Again, adjusting for the stronger than anticipated revenues allows for a 60 percent restoration of the QBE reduction that we had to take as we were here in June in order to balance the budget. That's $567 million going back into QBE. The House also made some other adjustments in K-12 programs that are funded outside of the QBE formula and in our version that accounts for another eight and a half million. We agreed to the adjustments for restoring $73.6 million in post-secondary formulas, formula earnings, and like K-12 added over eight million for teaching activities within the B units of the university system of Georgia. When adjusting for other needs, we true up the mid-year as we always do. One of those issues is dealing with the non-deemed dish hospitals, disproportionate share hospitals. The total funding there this year is $35.7 million. Also an additional $25 million that goes directly to your communities to offset for the Forest Land Protection Act. Then another $3.5 million in the adjustment for actual revenues on the outdoor stewardship act as well. As always, we did do some adjustments in contracts and services and start dates and those sorts of things that you see throughout the document. But the governor also proposed making an investment in tourism and advertising tourism of our great state, second largest industry in the state's tourism. We all know we're here in Atlanta today. We see the hotels and the very diminished revenue stream. We see the issues. We've had to rural congress center with no conventions coming to town. So once everyone starts feeling comfortable with a vaccine and Lord willing, the virus disappears at some point. Folks will free up and start traveling but we want them to know that we want them to have Georgia on their mind when they do. And then again, amended budgets are a great place for some one-time things and you'll see a few of those throughout the document. Piloting in one Georgia as the governor's recommended addition of $20 million there for the rollout of a broadband grant program. Purchasing school buses for $38.6 million a house and that you'll find in the education budget. Purchasing vehicles throughout a lot of different state agencies. We postponed vehicle purchases last year which means those vehicles now have another year of age on their under the belt and another 20 or 30 thousand miles on their wheels. Upgrading the data system for the ethics commission. Startup calls for the hemp program and the medical cannabis programs as well. Then allowing us to address some emergency needs as well. You'll find 15.4 million to address a shortfall for the age drug assistance program or ADAP. $35 million being spent in behavioral health to help our developmentally disabled clients properly address their unique needs. Many of those brought on by the COVID pandemic. And then funding for our nursing homes. You'll see that spread in a couple of different places in a few minutes as well. The very people that built this state it is our obligation morally, biblically to take care of those individuals and that's what we're proposing to do. And then an $18 million ad under public health to help update their data system. I think we all commonly refer to it as grits. But to update that registration system to help them on vaccine tracking. And pandemic tracking. You know, and the other thing too, best of all amended budgets can be fast. And with the amount of work that went in in November, December and the first part of this month. As I mentioned a while ago with the governor's folks and OPB and their senate colleagues. It allows us to be able to do something we haven't done in a very long time. As a matter of fact, the earliest a budget ever passed out of the house was February 3rd of 1994. Now that was the final passage. We're going to miss it just a little bit, but we're not going to miss it for. But again, that's because a lot of good people have spent a lot of time working together that that makes this possible. Again, thank you to our subcommittee chairs and all of our members. But it's basically to our staff. If you will, taking tracking document will run through yet. It's not going to take us very long. Notice I've only got two bottles of water up here and I got one in spare back here. Scottie's got it ready in case I need it. Section one, Georgia Senate note changes. Section two. Georgia House are representatives due the passage of SB 176. Last year it does require the employer to pay the employee ERS contribution for retirees and that's what we're adjusting for there. Moving on to section three, the joint offices. You'll see it 3.1.2. Last year we had posted for it to help Georgia host the National Black Caucus of State Legislate Tours. That meeting got proposed. Those funds actually lapsed back into the RSR. So we're just re-upping because they do plan on doing that this year. Under legislative counsel, you'll see another ad for the ERS adjustment there. Audits and counts, no changes. Once we get into the courts and prosecuting attorneys, I'm going to make a blanket statement here so I'm not going to mention it each time you see it. But you'll see there at 5.1.1 there are some expenses for a temporary judge on the court of the appeals because one of those judges is stepped back and suspended himself while there's some actions pending. And so we have to make them hold in order to make sure they've got a judge there to be able to function. But what I was mentioning a second ago, look at 5.1.2 and you'll see a 50% restoration on some of the salaries that we had basically told them take furlough days within the court system last year because they're almost 100% personnel funds, very little operating funds. That's the only place that they have any wiggle room. So we've added that back there and you'll also see it under the business court. Moving on forward into judicial counsel and upgrade for one of their computer tracking systems at 6.4.1, the restoration at 6.5.1 as well. Moving over to prosecuting attorneys, under the DAs, we normally have to provide some legal representation or fund the legal representation for DAs. We're just truing up that $446,000 amount to $50,000 because the use there is lower than was projected. And then again the restoration. Again, it's a period of courts, you'll see the restoration in two or three places there. Surpring courts also the same thing, the restoration and allowing them to keep some of their personal services funds are utilized some of the personal, you utilize some of the existing personal funds that they have, personnel funds that they have. State accounting office, no changes, Department of Ministry of Services, no changes, Department of Ag section 13. You'll see a few things there and as I mentioned in my open comments about the purchase of vehicles, we always, if possible, would rather purchase vehicles with cash instead of bonding them. That way that you're not paying the interest down the road, sometimes it's necessary that we bond them, but a lot of times we're able to do it with cash funding. The governor had proposed 500,000 for vehicle replacement there and then talking with the commissioner in the department. Again, another year under their belt of not doing other replacements has made that number gross so you'll see an adjustment there. You'll see the funds there at 1322 just completely stand up the hemp program. Now that it's up and rolling, 1331, some IT upgrades, one time IT upgrades. 13 4.1, I know we've got our folks in Thomas Field Cordell and Savannah that we told last year they need to figure out a way to take over their state on farmers markets. They've all come to the table with a commissioner and worked out an agreement and a way to keep those facilities open and part of their community so we're basically saying that's fine. You're not going to have to take over those on July 1 as we had originally said. 1351 under the poultry vet lab, you'll see the one time purchase of a piece of equipment there under the Soil and Water Conservation Commission at the late start date at 1371. Banking and finance, no changes. Section 15, Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. Y'all, we all all the time here about tireless advocates for different causes. And I want to tell you that that chair lady Dempsey is certainly a tireless advocate for our DD community in the state. And it wouldn't surprise me that she goes over limit on her cell phone every week or every month with the work that she does talking to that community, talking to Commissioner Fitzgerald and her incredible team there at DBHDD. And so in doing that it always helps us focus on where we need to focus to help this community. And so you'll see several places throughout the document, not just here, the several places throughout the document. You'll see a caption speaking of the CARES funds and how some of the CARES funds are being spent or have been spent. You'll see it's a zero-dollar item because we don't budget the federal funds. But we're just trying to make some notations to give us all a little more information on where those funds are going. But it also gives a little bit of flexibility and that happens at 152.3 and you'll see there utilizing about $1.7 million to stand up a new and innovative 10-bed center that will serve our individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I'm not sure exactly where that one will be placed. DBHDD knows exactly where it needs to go. Moving on to adult forensic services, 153.1, a delayed start date on that project because of COVID. Then at 1542, just a recognition again of some federal funds in that project. Moving over section 16, DCA. You'll also notice again the recognition of some of the federal funds there. And then when you get down to one Georgia, you'll see the program I mentioned a little bit ago, the 20 million that the governor has recommended to go to one Georgia to set up the broadband initiative grant program to help many of our local communities, especially rural communities that are out there who are again right now kids are having to rely on broadband, but it's not necessarily there for them to be able to do their homework, their schoolwork. But also the pandemic has certainly made it evident to us all that not only is it a hindrance for teaching and learning, but without reliable broadband service, it is a hindrance to doing business and transacting businesses well. So we're fully supportive of that. Section 17, Department of Community Health, 1753. An addition there for some hiring initiatives and some retention initiatives and some contracting strategies there on the health care facility regulation division that go out and inspect our nursing homes. And 1779 and 1717 Chairman Parish and his team working to help our nursing homes. Many of our nursing homes have been impacted through the pandemic not just because of COVID, but the secondary impact that we don't often think about is when hospitals quit doing elective surgeries, there are less people that are needing rehab services. And so just like we have to try and support our hospitals in many ways, we also have an obligation to help support these facilities as well. And so what we're doing there, you'll see about $20 million in state funds that additionally bring down about another $40 million in federal funds. You'll see a couple of adjustments just above that at 1772 and 1773, just truing up of the numbers there. No changes in community supervision, Department of Corrections, again some recognition of some of the federal funds that they've received, but also Chairman Berchette and I know he is visited with the governor and we've had many conversations about the issue on staffing and retention at many of our juvenile detention centers and also our adult detention centers and the turnover rate there. We attempted to address that last year in the original version of FY21 budget, but then COVID hit, we had to pull all of that back to address some of those turnover rates. But what they've been able to do because they're not fully staffed, they're able to take some of the funds, utilize some of their existing funds to then reroute to existing correctional officers for ten-

percent pay increase in corrections and juvenile justice to upstim the tide of turnover rates, burnout and all of that sort of stuff. So you'll see that scattered throughout corrections and throughout juvenile justice as well. Moving on, Department of Defense, no changes there. Drivers services, you'll see a slight change. Some new vehicles for those folks. They do use the medium duty vehicles to pull testing trailers back and forth across the state. Originally, those have been put into license issuance. They'd ask that we move those to Department of Administration. It just gives them more flexibility to be able to use them in different parts of the agency. Under D Cal, again, you'll see some recognition of some of the federal funds, but also just a slight savings based on a delayed start date that the person didn't start until the middle of November. Economic development, again, recognition of some federal funds there. Department of Education, section 24. I think the preacher said yesterday something about where your treasure lies. So does your heart. You can leave here today saying that that is the truth when we look at this budget. Between K-12 education spending, higher education and technical college education spending, we spend well over 50% of the state's budget on education. It is our priority. And to say otherwise is dishonest. And we'll talk a little bit more about that if we need to in a little bit, but I want to point out some of the adjustments that we have made. As I said, a while ago, the governor proposed a little over $560 million going into the QBE formula. As you recall last year when we left, we had to make a reduction in the QBE formula of about $950 million. Federal government gave a not no strings attached, basically about $411 million during that period of time that went directly to the school systems. With the 560 add back, with the 411 that came from the federal government, the school systems, if you just said, okay, let's add and subtract, the school systems at this point are actually 20 million ahead of where they would have been. So think about that. Think about the restoration that you're going to be looking at in the FY22 as well, another 560, 570 million there, with another $1.7 billion that is on its way to education, Department of Education and our school systems, no strings attached for them to be able to use. If you recall last year I mentioned when we had to take the cuts, that it's a three way funding partnership, state, local, and federal, and that when one of the three partners stumbles a little bit, which is the position we were in last year, our revenues at stumbled a little bit, we always lean on the other two to help bring us through. And we have seen that happen just as I said it would back then. Our federal partners have stepped up, our local systems have tightened belts, our local systems have used the dollars that they held in reserve for such an incident. They've come through, upon its been tough, once been tough on the teachers, the administrators, the parents, the students. I think they've come through it remarkably well. And I think we're all standing up and doing what we need to do to help them as well. Under ag education you'll see a restoration there, a full restoration under ag education and career technical education for extended day, extended year, and also a 60% restoration to other programs contained there in. People transportation at 24, 14, 1, you'll see where cash funding the school buses I mentioned in my opening comments, 500 school buses, 38.6 million dollars. Just to give you an idea, we run about 15,000, just under 15,000 school buses are on the road every day in Georgia. And many of you say, well, they haven't been running a whole lot because my system's been out, but what we haven't been seeing because we're not seeing them necessarily at 630 in the morning, we may see them come through at 9 or 10 o'clock because they're out using those vehicles to take food out to these children. We're seeing that a lot. Many systems are up and operating, so they're running these buses. But we're a little behind on replacement. As a matter of fact, they're 5,913 are 40% of the current fleet is past its its expectant life. We've got good folks in the counties that are mechanics and the drivers take care of these vehicles, but at the same time we have an obligation for safety upgrades that come with the new buses to take and do our part to help replace those fleets, and that's what we're proposing to do there. Under local 5ml share at 24, 16,2, you'll see an adjustment there. So as local 5ml share, as QBE funding goes up, the state's portion going in goes up. Then the obligation are the buy-in from the locals. That percentage also goes up, so it creates savings back to the state. So you'll see that there. The portion of that was used for the school bus as a portion of it was used for a few other things that you'll see. Under QBE, under 24, 17, you'll see several changes there. Those again are just formula true ups. The recognition of the federal funds, the ad-back at current technical education as well. ERS note changes, Forestry Commission, section 26. You'll see again where the vehicles were put in one program, but they'd asked that they'd be flipped to another program. So that's what we've done there made that adjustment for them. Under the Governor's Office section 27, you'll see some recognition of some of the federal funds throughout there. And then under the Governor's Office of Student Achievement at 27,7,1, just an upgrade of the longitudinal data system and a licensing for it. And then under 27,7,2, an ad-back of some funds for the Governor's Honors Program. I think there were about 75 students that didn't get to participate last year that they will get to participate this year. Under DHS, you'll see an adjustment first at 2841, just reflecting savings from some vacant positions. 2851 of savings from some late start dates. And again, you'll see the recognition of the federal funds. Just above that, 2852, you'll also see an ad for a contract there at the multi-agency alliance for children that several school systems participate in as well. Moving on, you'll see other instances of federal funds being recognized within the agency. Then over at 2821,1, you'll see an adjustment for savings of a late start date there. And then at 2841, helping them with an IT issue to help speed up the eligibility determinations and it should help speed that process up by about five days for our needy folks there. Section 29, Office of the Insurance Commissioner, no changes. Section 30GBI, under forensic sciences, you'll see an ad there at $427,000. Director Reynolds and his staff have been like a hamper and not strontal wheel trying to catch up to the top but they never seem to be able to get there. The wheel keeps turning. We've got a crisis in our country. We have about 1,100 positions for medical examiners in the United States right now and only about 500 of those are field. Those individuals have the ability to basically name their price to go where they need to go. We as a state have an obligation to have those individuals working for us. And the director is continuing to lose individuals either through being folks being hired away from them or retire and just not being able to find somebody to hire back. So we've been implemented a system to work with them in the amended budget. We'll also address it again in the big budget that we'll be working over the next couple of weeks to steady up that position so that he can maintain the lab here in Atlanta, the one in Poular, and then get back to a full-time operating schedule for the lab in Macon, which is caused quite a bit of issues for our friends in South Georgia. We're also working with the Gust University and Mursher. There are two medical schools as well to see if there's a way that we can open up a pipeline. As they're doing training for medical students, is there a way that they need a few more classes or something like that? Because right now we've got 600 positions that are jobs for these individuals to go right into. We just got to find a way to supply those. You'll look on through and you'll see under criminal justice coordinating council and a couple of entries there that relate to the federal funds, recognition of those. Section 31, juvenile justice, no changes. The Department of Labor, again recognition of some of the federal funds there. Department of Law, no changes. Department of Natural Resources, no changes there. Parns and Peroles, no changes. State Properties Commission, Section 36, no changes. Section 37, Public Defenders, again a part of the restoration of their personal services money there, just as we did in the rest of judiciary. Department of Public Health, I know we have all seen talk and heard from our constituents as we've gone through the pandemic. We've stayed in very constant contact with Dr. Tumi, another speaker has, I have many of us have, and what do we need to do to help you? And there are some structural issues that she needs help with and that's what we're proposing to do here. We're continuing to work on this and we're actually going to hand a couple of projects off to our friends in the Senate. They're going to participate and look at some other projects as well for the Department of Public Health as we move this budget forward. But some of the things that we knew that we could go ahead and do that we all are in a lot of agreement on and that is helping Dr. Tumi and her administration piece there, behind a chief medical officer, a deputy commissioner, and then a chief data officer as well. And speaking of data, drop down to 38.5.1 under epidemiology. $18 million there to stand up the new grit system. That's a lot of money. I understand that. And when we were talking to them, I said if we do this, it's not going to be something that six months from now we're still going to be talking about, is it is it ready to roll? Is this something that we can do in a matter of a couple of weeks? And they have assured us that yes, there is an on the shelf product that they can that they can use that other states are already using that they can put in place and stand up and get it going. Moving on under infectious disease control at 38.9.2, you'll see an ad there for the eight out program. $15.4 million. And again, this is the HIV AIDS medication program for low income individuals that have no other payer source. Should we let that lapse, we would be the only state in the country that would wind up with a waiting list. So it's very important. Moving on to public safety section 39, 39.4.3, just a true up of numbers there due to the attrition of the current trooper class and the delay in not being able to have a trooper class last fall. Moving down to 39.7, 0.2 under firefighter standards and training council replacement of a couple of very high mileage vehicles there. And then a true up at 39, 8.1 for the newly elective sheriff's class. Moving on to public service commission, some minor adjustments there, one dealing with some legal fees that are coming. And then allowing them to retain some funds that they have not currently obligated, but they know that they're going to have some expenses between now and July 1, just allowing them to retain those funds. Board of Regents section 41, as I mentioned in my opening comments about the be units of the budget, you'll see some restorations there. These these are the areas in which people are getting taught. These these are the hands-on learning opportunities within the university system. Experiment station, parking extension service, forestry, experiment, all of those areas are be unit additions. We've gone back and restored 60% to them as well. If you look over at, you'll see several more of those throughout the document. Also knowing that we have a need at the medical college and the hospital down there, so we're doing a 60% restoration there to help them, because in many ways that is an experiment station. They probably wouldn't like to hear it phrase that way, but an experiment station is where you apply practical knowledge, and that's what they're doing there in that hospital setting. You'll notice now at 41, 18, 2, the recognition and increase in funds for formula earnings that we were not able to budget for here in June of $70 million. Then also the recognition of some federal funds that went directly to our HBCUs around the state as well. Moving on to the Department of Revenue, you'll see the ad there at 42.2.1 for the Forest Land Protection Grants. Again, those go to our local communities. Our school systems benefit greatly by that investment as well. Under Secretary of State dropped down to 43.7.1, dealing with the Medical Cannabis Commission, as that goes online this week, as a matter of fact. They were still having some IT initiatives that they were needing to get completed, but we will see that become a revenue generator for the state here very quickly. Section 44, Student Finance, you'll see the engineering scholarship, a little higher demand there than what we've seen in previous years. So you've got an ad of $192,500. That covers an additional 55 students at $3,500 a piece there. Teacher retirement system, no changes, the technical college system. Again, recognition of some of the federal funds that they have gotten, but also at 46.6.1. The Governor proposed and we have agreed to add 3.5 million for their increase in and formula earnings as well as a slight decrease in the square footage that they're using that all nets out to about $3.5 million for them. Department of Transportation are newly minted, subcommittee chair, Clay Parkle. You know, the new guy's always got to show off a little bit. And so he felt like that he had to do something just to do something, but no, seriously. You'll see a few changes there. You'll see a reduction under capital maintenance, but you'll see the addition at construction admin and department admin. As they took testimony within their subcommittee, I found that we're having a little bit of issue and making sure that we're adequately managing federal transportation grants that are coming to the state. And then ask for a little bit of help there. Traditionally, what we've all done, what we've done for years is we're always kind of hard on admin and cut admin and cut admin. Well, we're starting to see now that there are a few places we're going to add a little bit back as the state continues to grow. There are more projects out there. We're going to have to continue to add some things back in different places. And then you'll see an increase over under SERDA at 47.13.1 for an increase in their debt service for the Garvey bonds that they're holding for the 485-car door project up there. Section 48 Veterans Services, no changes, workers comp on section 49, no changes, and no changes at this time in section 50, which is the bond section. Mr. Chairman, that's a walk through of the Tranking Document. And I will be glad to try to answer any questions that anyone may have if you're awake. How many bottles of water did you drink? Well, for you freshman, that was only a half bottle. So we were finishing in record time, getting the budget to the floor, keep drinking. And he normally consumes about five bottles of water by the time he gets his presentation done, and that's hours I'll show you. Mr. Chairman, I did have several questions, but honestly, the detail, I know that you put in a work that you put in attention to detail on this budget is exemplary. Thank you. You, the staff, Christine, thank you for being here with Martha. Thank you, but I'm also heads off to the subcommittee chairs. And I'm sure that our members recognize this is not a sprint. It occurs annually. This is a year-long process that Chairman England and his team and the staff put into this budget. We certainly appreciate it. Mr. Chairman, you were looking out as I was into the members. Thank you to the members, the attention to this presentation that you brought to this today ensures that the chairman's work is appreciated. Not just with a hand clap, but the attention to what he's told us today. He's presented to us and that's a testament to the appreciation they have for you and your staff and the work you've done. With that, thank you, Mr. Chairman. We appreciate that. We have a couple of questions as you said. He would be glad to take a couple of questions. We'll proceed with that. Okay. Our first question comes from room 341. The lady from District 55, representing MITS, has a question. Yes. Good morning. Marie Metz, District 55. I have a parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Will the gentleman yield? Yes. My question. Is it not true that the supplemental budget cut behavioral health by $91 million last year and did not replace any of that funding in this supplemental budget? Thank you for your question. As we had to do with every agency throughout the budget, we did make reductions. Many of the reductions made within the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities were things that, through the years, they began doing that were a little bit outside of their core mission, outside of the Department of Justice Settlement, outside of the things that are statutorily mandated that they do. Not saying that those are wrong to do. We'd agreed to do them. We'd agreed to fund them. So when we looked at that agency, in particular, we spent a lot of time on that particular agency as a matter of fact in those last couple of days. We were very strategic in those reductions there to things like IT contracts and those things that did not directly impact end users. I would also add that even within that, they have also been the recipients of several millions of dollars of federal funds that they've been able to use in the place of state funds as well. And the offset of those federal funds, I don't know a number on off the top of my head, but I would almost guarantee you far exceed the reduction that we were forced to take at that particular time. Will the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. Georgia Virtual School. The amended budget does not include any restoration of the 423,658 cut from House Bill 793. Because you speak to that, please. Again, a lot of flexibility sent in with the federal funds. Even before we adjourned in June of last year, there were $446 million sent to the state of Georgia, specifically for education. 411 million of that went directly out to local school systems. Georgia DOE held some of that back to work with things such as the Georgia Virtual Schools, many other smaller entities that are not actual, what we consider one of the 180 school systems within the state. They were able to do things with those federal funds that, again, because we have to pass a balanced budget. We have to make reductions from time to time. But, again, they have those federal funds and had extreme flexibility with those federal funds to be able to help folks like the Georgia Virtual School, our state FFA camps are another instance. Those are state-owned camps. They had to cancel all of their camping last year. DOE was able to use some of the federal funds to help fill in that gap for them. A lot of those pieces, a lot of those bits and pieces because of this federal funds in the way our state constitution is structured, we do not budget the federal funds. The governor and the executive branch has the sole authority on how those are spent. They're able to fill in a lot of those gaps. We're charged with appropriating the state funds and the state dollars that we have, and that's all that we can do. We're also mandated in that very same constitution that that budget is to be balanced. It's not to be a penny more than what the revenue is projected to be. So, yes, it means that we have to take some tough cuts sometimes, but thankfully, an education in particular, as I mentioned a while ago, is a three-way partnership most of the time. Federal, state, and local dollars going into it. So, there's always a little bit of wiggle room. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the questions. Gentlemen, you, you know, another question? Yes, sir. To the lady in the gallery here, to your left, from the 105, 105 Fifth Representative MacLeod for a question. Thank you, Chairman Ingline. I appreciate you and your staff and all the work you've done. And I do know that it's a lot of work because we did take it on last year to find some alternative funds to the budget. So, I do know it takes a lot of work. So, thank you for that. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Why is it okay to use federal COVID dollars, but we cannot expand Medicaid? And is it not true that COVID will probably be considered a COVID, a cold mobility going forward? Can you state the question again? I didn't quite follow you. So, we're using federal dollars for the COVID and we're not expanding Medicaid. Is that correct? I get it. Okay. I understand. And with the seriousness of COVID and knowing that it's probably going to be considered a cold mobility, why aren't we not expanding Medicaid? Well, that is a policy decision that's not made within the budget. That's a policy decision that rests with this body and the body across the building, in partnership with the executive branch as well. I think we've had numerous discussions over that over the years as that has been a topic. But also remember that with expansion of Medicaid, there is also an increased liability from the state's portion. There is a state match that goes along with any Medicaid spending currently under the Medicaid program that we're under. It's a 70-30 match. Feds pay 70. We pay 30 under the new different program. It's a 90-10 match, but still with that 90-10 match, you're somewhere between 250 million. Depending on the estimate, 250 million to 400 million dollars, additional state funds a year that would be required to do that. But again, that's a policy decision. That's not a budget decision here in this document. In that document. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. Why do we continue to fund private prisons? We have not totally put back the funds in for public education, which was a billion dollar. You put back $636 million. Why do we continue to fund private prison? That's the school to prison pipeline and we need to stop it in this state. So tell me why is that an necessity with our tax dollars? Private prisons are an implement that we use just like our state on prisons. Private prisons, as they are used, are on a contractual basis with the state. And they are a partner with the state in that job that has to be done of keeping people secured behind the fence, keeping the rest of our population, our families, our kids, all of our everyone here safe. So if you decide you want to get out of that particular business, then be prepared to understand that you're going to have to stand up three to four more state on prisons because that population has to shift to somewhere. It has to be housed somewhere. The flexibility that we have with the private prisons has kept us from having to build a new state facility. Now for 14 years, I believe it is, because of that flexibility there. And you also wind up when you're using these facilities because they're contractors, you're not also adding to the state's expense that of the legacy costs that come along with having a state employee, healthcare, retirement, other post-employment benefits. So it is advantageous to us as a management tool to use those facilities. I know you're a great passion on that particular subject. I appreciate it. But again, that's one of those things that's a policy decision that is made that we then have to do in this document to take care of making sure that that contract's lividation is met. Can the gentleman for a year, I just want to make statement, we have to think differently, because if we do fund pre-K and get our children reading and writing before grade three, we can reduce the need for private prison or any prisons. Thank you very much. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Chairman, I'll take one more question. Okay, we will recognize the gentleman from District 130, Chairman Knight, for a question. If you yield. I did. Got my case, yours. We'll get you a portable mine. Thank you. Thank you. This is gentleman, you. Yes, sir. To my friend, isn't it true and I'm very, very proud and very grateful for the work in our House Budget Office along with you as chairman of Appropriations and the Office of Planning and Budget from the Governor's Office, all the work that over the interim that when this body left and the subchairs were talking, that we were we were monitoring all of the federal dollars that were coming in that the rest of this body in some cases are not

acknowledging or not recognizing and that as we monitored those dollars we were making sure that things like education Health care all of those other items that we're talking about we were seeing when those federal dollars were coming in and That that we know that those federal dollars in cases just like education went straight to the school systems Okay, prime example Furthermore, isn't it true that this budget reflects a Lot of those dollars that came down from the federal from the feds such that our budget is a good budget Again that is funding our departments and our agencies As we as Georgia have always wanted to do at a full level. Is that not true? Yes, sir. Yes, sir mr. Chairman I just want to thank you for the hard work and For your knowledge the budget staff O PB because this is very very detailed And it's a lot to it especially in the sheer of COVID in the federal dollars that came down and I want to say thank you for the job that you have done And the detail and the hard work that has been going into this budget. Thank you, sir. Well, thank you to everybody Miss chairman for I for a lien the well Kind of long the lines of chairman night. I mentioned this a minute ago We were we we had to last year in June Reduce QB by 950 million The governor's addbacks 560 million 411 million in cares dollars that went directly to the school systems 971 million dollars I'm not real bright. I went to cannellan, elementary and barricanian I can do a little bit of addition and subtraction, but that tells me that that our school systems just along on those two transactions Or 21 million dollars ahead of where they were had QB folk been fully funded movie end FY 22 Governor has another restoration about 560 500 and 70 million in the QB formula school systems will be receiving very shortly about a 1.7 million dollar addition from federal funds I think that winds up that they wind up about 131 billion dollars ahead in this coming fiscal year so A lot of dollars have flowed into this state a lot of those dollars We don't recognize in the budget because of just the structure of it but You know before before I do sit down I'd be remiss if I didn't think didn't think our Our folks with public health Our folks at the Department of Community Health Department of Developmental Disabilities our National Guard troops our state troopers our DOT employees Forestry Commission folks DNR folks our defects case workers all of those individuals that have truly been Those frontline folks that have been Doing that little uncomfortable thing of sticking the swab up someone's nose to do a covid test That uncomfortable thing of sticking a needle in someone's arm Nurses I've heard of chairman Watson had pointed out the other day. He talked to a public health nurse down in his neck of the woods He got 52 days without a day off Because of their dedication It's not because of what we pay them It's because they care It's because they care about you It's because they care about me. It's because they care about Georgia We're doing our best to pay them and Recognize that but also please when you see these individuals thank them for what they're doing It's not fun I know the fear that I had from my family from my dad that lives at home with us That I would pick up something and bring it home to him But I could kind of isolate myself But these folks are not being able to isolate themselves from coming into direct contact with individuals that may be infected But then have to go home and fix up or fix breakfast or help the kids with homework They don't have that option. So thank them They're dedication to us and I say us as the whole state is incredible They're servants heart You know if there's anything that good that comes out of this On this whole pandemic It's the realization of how many people still have that kind of service heart So thank you to them.
