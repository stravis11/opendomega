It's an honor today to be with you to introduce the chaplain of the day. My friend, Pastor Keith Giles, is the pastor and the founder of the Word of Life, Gospel Ministries, and Carrollton, Georgia. He also serves as the Carroll County Sheriff's Office Law Enforcement Chaplain for the Carroll County Sheriff's Office. When he is not ministering to his flock there at Word of Life and helping the folks at the sheriff's office deal with the tragedies and things that come their way, he's been the owner of the hern monument company in Carrollton for the past 20 years. He is married to his wife, Shelley, and they have three children. One of them is with us today, Ms. Miranda Duncan, if you would please stand. Would like to recognize you in the people's house. And also he has with him today also Captain Shane Taylor with the Carroll County Sheriff's Office. A 28-year veteran of the Sheriff's Office, I might add. Taylor with him today is our good friend Captain Keith Price, if you'll stand Keith. Keith is a 32-year veteran of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office. I just want to say before Pastor Keith comes and delivers the message today, I talk about living out there in God's country a lot in Carroll County where we have a lot of great things going on. And our community is great because of the people that I represent, the people that make up the fiber of that community. Pastor Keith does a tremendous job in his role as Chaplain, but also as his role as the pastor of that church. I recently had a funeral service in that church to see how he loves on his folks and cares for him and the ministers to them at the toughest time of their life is just a real blessing. He is a blessed and our community, our county and to this state. So without any further ado, I welcome my friend Pastor Keith Jiles. Representative Collins, thank you and Speaker Burns, thank you for this opportunity today and as a blessing, a privilege and an honor to be here with you today. I want to thank each of you and the body today for your sacrifice and the things that you do for the community and the people of Georgia and it's greatly appreciated today. And I'm not here today to give you advice on how to legislate and but I'm here to encourage you because I'm not here as a businessman or politician but I'm here as a preacher, preacher of the gospel. So I'm here today to encourage you and I've got to have handcuffs on because I have to be careful because I like to preach. So I'll do this very quickly and but I just want to share a word with you today that I believe the Lord has given us and that is did not lose sight of the prize. Amen. And that we all have a goal and a prize before us but we need to stay focused to achieve that. We can't lose sight of God. We must love Him with all our heart, our soul, our mind while we endeavor to love His people. And I've said many times in her other pastors say that it may not have been for no people, it would be fun to be in ministry. And we were sharing earlier in the Rimsons of Collins office and the same thing. It's about the people and you know your job may be a lot easier if it weren't for the people but the people is why we do what we do. And if we're not focused upon God and our love for Him and our hearts and our soul and our mind will never be able to endeavor to love the people the way He would have us to love Him. Many of us know today and if you're in this room you'd have to be blind not to know but we know that times are different today than they were in our childhood. They're different. They were ten years ago. Times have changed and with that being said I want to read a scripture to you this morning that comes out of the Bible, the book of John chapter number nine and I'm going to read verse 34 and it said and they answered and said unto him, thou was altogether born and sin and do us thou teach us and they cast him out and Jesus heard that they cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him, do us thou believe on the Son of God and he answered and said, who is he Lord that I might believe on him and Jesus said unto him, thou has seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said Lord I believe and he worshiped him and Jesus said, for judgment I am come into this world that they which see not might see and they which see might be made blind and some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him, are we blind also and Jesus said unto them, if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sins remaineth. As I look at the scripture today it reminds me that things have changed and with change it begins the day that were born, changed begins to take place. Some people handle change they deal with it and they move forward with it but others they close their eyes and they are blind to the change that surround them. We can no longer choose to close our eyes. Many people today refuse to see the truth but the bottom line is there is none so blind as those who refuse to see and we must get our heads out of the sand today and we must regain focus and keep our eyes upon the Lord. I believe that is what he would have us to do and whether in church or out of church today and whether they are believer or not there is those who refuse to see the truth there is those who refuse to allow themselves to be focused and they would rather be blind by the light of the glory of Christ than anything else. And Paul warned him that it would be the people like that in the last days he said perilous times would come and he said it would be those people that had a form of godliness but did not have the power thereof. We need that today our scripture today tells the story of a man who was born blind. See we have two groups of people and I want to share with you right quick and there are two groups of people those who choose to be blind and those who were born in that condition. Jesus came to set those free and to heal those that were born in that condition but those who choose to be those who think they know everything see everything and can do all things are blind in themselves knowing that they can't do anything without Christ himself. This man's parents didn't even want to get involved with this. They wanted to keep their head in the sand. They came to him and said was your son blind at birth and they said ask him we don't want to know anything about what's going on. Just talk to him keep us out of it we'd rather stay blind. We don't want to do anything or adjust with the changes but he looked and when they asked him he said I know this one thing. I was blind but now I see and I thank God that one day I was in that same condition that I was blind and when I met my Savior he set me free and today I can say I once was blind but now I see and I hope today that you can see that same thing because I believe this man is a model for us today when people press us to deny the claims of Jesus when they press us to deny the Word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit we are to insist that he is the truth or life and the way and that no man can come to the Father except through Christ our Savior. I thank God today for this opportunity I stand before you and the Lord I believe is called us to focus on him to focus on the fact that we must love him with all of our heart. He says in Matthew 22 35 39 of them the lawyer an expert in mosaic law ask Jesus a question. Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the laws and Jesus replied to him you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul with all your mind this is the greatest and the first commandment. He said the second is likened to it you shall love your neighbor as yourself and that is unselfishly seek the best or higher good of others. God is not obligated to save anyone and those who harden themselves choose to be blind to him they have no claim to his grace and we must reject the light that those people cast and hold on to the true light of God because see it is his glory it is his light that he blinded them and cut them off from salvation but today he is calling us to look toward him our purpose in life is to focus on God and our love for him so that we can see and meet the needs of the people that he loves and that we serve. You may ask yourself this morning what can I do? What can I do today? Turn your focus to him. There is a store in our clothes with us there is a store of a missionary who was in Asia he had tuberculosis on this mission trip and when he left on the mission trip he took tons of bibles and tracks and all these things and he tried to witness over and over and over to these people no one would take any of his tracks no one would read the bibles no one would listen to what he said and when he came down with tuberculosis they put him in an institution and he was laying in the bed one night as he had many other nights he heard an elderly man across the way who was crying and struggling all through the night later in the night he realized that man was trying to get up to go and leave himself but he couldn't and then the attendants came and they were cruel to him and they punished him for what he did there in his bed that night. The next night the same thing the man began to cry and to weep in the middle of the night but this time this missionary said well maybe I can do something so he struggled to get up with a lack of breath and he went over and he lifted this man up out of the bed he was shocked because his weight was so light and he carried him to the bathroom where there was nothing but a hole in the floor and he held him over this hole as he relieved himself and he took him back to the bed and the elderly man reached up and grabbed him by his cheeks and pulled him forward and he kissed him on his forehead. The next morning he woke up with people around his bed asking for tracks asking for the Bible that he had one didn't know more about this Jesus wanted to know more about his faith and you ask what can I do this man said all I did was help an old man go to the bathroom anybody could do that it's our job it's our calling to help people and we'll never be able to help those people without first loving God with all our heart with all our mind and all our soul let us pray together. I thank you for the opportunity to represent you before this body and Lord offering our gratitude for the gift of freedom that you have bestowed upon us as the United States of America as well as the great state of Georgia. Lord let us be mindful of the many men and women who came before us and sacrificed greatly for this nation and the state of Georgia many making that ultimate sacrifice of life. But today Lord we are grateful for the leaders who stand in this hallowed chamber. Lord their daily sacrifices deserve the people of Georgia. Lord we ask that you keep them and bless them during this time of service and beyond. We not only pray for them but we also pray for their families God pray for their businesses their careers as they sacrifice their time to serve others. Lord be with them today keep them and let your spirit lead them in your revelation knowledge of God and wisdom and integrity as they make laws and decisions that will affect not only the future of our state but our children who are the future of the state. Allow them to stand boldly to be wise as.

and harmances, doves, as they stand for truth, focused upon you, that they may see the real needs of the people and the direction that you would have them go. It's our prayer Lord today that you allow the Spirit to move upon this place modestly and lead these men and women to govern this state with integrity and fortitude. Let your Spirit refresh and renew the minds and hearts of all that are gathered here today so that we may fulfill all you have called for us to do and accomplish. And today help us to focus, help us to refocus and let us focus on your word as we look for your great commandment from Matthew, which is the clairs that we should love the Lord our God with all of our hearts, our soul, our mind. You said this was the greatest commandment and should be our focus. But the second is likened to it, we should also love our neighbors ourselves. Lord you declared on these two commandments, hang all the laws of the prophets. Let us not focus on the affairs of this life, nor within our own selves, but let our focus be upon you as we will in our hearts, our souls and our minds to love you and endeavor to love your people as we love ourselves. As we conclude today, Lord, we ask you forgiveness for we have failed you in so many ways. Too many times we put our careers and agendas before your will and commands. We thank you God today and it's in the name of Jesus we pray. Amen. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. For keepers will unlock the doors and you may join the chapter of the day in the south any room. Thank you for being here and thank you for that message and welcome to his guest and we appreciate y'all being with us as well.

We have a lot of morning orders, so I'm going to ask you to hold it to one minute, if at all possible, if at all possible, one minute. We'll start our first morning order with Chairman Ballinger, as a morning order. And I think you will need to listen to Chairman Lady Ballinger. Well, maybe you won't listen to Chairman Lady Ballinger right now. She'll be here in a moment to present it. Representative Kimberley knew for a morning order.

Representative McClain is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I kind of call these from, when that kind of come up, you know, good morning, colleagues. And I guess we're going to all start out 10 happy Valentine's Day. It is also, a Gwyneth County Chambers, Love Georgia Day. And you all got nice little bags on your, on your desk. So I want you all to realize that they came from the Gwyneth County Chamber. The Gwyneth County Chamber has over 2000 members and represent over 22,000 businesses, plus over 10,000 sole proprietors in Gwyneth. Today, we have the President, CEO of Nick Masino in the gallery. That own up. There you go. Along with members from some of the business in Gwyneth Jackson, the MC, Gwyneth Technical College, Porter Steel, Sugarloaf CID, Mr. Cosmetics, C HOA.

But since, you know, the Speaker only gave us one minute. And you're, and I'm about to help you to cut me off. We'll get it to you. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Glenn, you did a nice job. And here to the time that we appreciate that. Since he's already up there, we recognize Representative Rees for a morning order. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I am proud with Gwyneth County's business community here today, and on Valentine's Day, to announce the kickoff of two bills that will show some love to Gwyneth County's homeowners. It has been 35 years since 1988, since Gwyneth County's homeowners got a tax cut. In 1988, of course, President Reagan was present. Dale Murphy was playing for the Braves and Powder Blue uniforms. And Tom Murphy was the Speaker here in the House, and he was in his early 60s. Since that time, the Cab County's Homestead exemption has become more than double Gwyneth's Athens Clark County, is many times over Gwyneth's Homestead exemption. And we have a bill this morning that I'm inviting my House colleagues to come sign with our...

This is community here to double, go in that county's homestead exemption and to grant an additional homestead exemption to public service employees, school employees, hospital employees who we have a shortage of law enforcement who we have a shortage of as well as our first responders and active duty military personnel. So we can pay for this because property tax revenue has increased by $300 million. General, I think he's getting paid by the minute in his regular work. I would invite my house colleagues to come sign at Majority Leader's Eftrations desk. Thank you. All right. Representative Koyay is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to answer a question I get every day whenever I show up here, gave for you from. I am from Nigeria and Nigeria has three big tribes, one of which is the evil.

They're here to just see how we work and to hear me talk about evil because I'm coming back in afternoon order to tell you something about the evil. Proud people not arrogant, industrious and fiercely independent. I yield, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, that's a rookie mistake. You're good. Thank you for that morning order.

Further, if there's anyone in the chamber who is an immigrant or comes from a family of immigrants, if you could please stand as well. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to HR 135? HR 135, I represent Dickey the 145th, 113rd, Washburn, 144, Flaming 114th, per 169th, and others. A resolution recognizing February 14, 2023, this Georgia Farm Bureau Federation Day at the Capitol. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Thank you, Chairman Dickey. We have Chairman Dickey, Representative Washburn, Chairman Perkel, let's see, Representative Fleming, and Representative Lebritt. Chairman Meeks, anybody else, and a former member of this house, Chairman Tom McCall, let's give Tom McCall a big hand, y'all. All right, Chairman Dickey, come on up here and tell us what this is all about. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Today is Farm Bureau Day at the Capitol, and I'm just so proud to have former member Tom McCall here as president of Farm Bureau of Georgia, and you'll be seeing all his members and board members here across the Capitol today. They're here in force and I hope you'll get a chance to talk with them and meet them. And I'm just so proud of Tom, 25 years here serving in his house, such an advocate for agriculture. Continues doing that as his role at President of Farm Bureau and Tom, know your wife, James here, and your board members. So thank you for being here today and what Farm Bureau means to rule Georgia and agriculture in our state. I don't know about y'all, but I've never heard Tom McCall speak to this house when it wasn't meaningful, important, and impact every member. So let's give him the attention he deserves in this great organization he represents, Georgia Farm Bureau. Chairman, Mr. President Tom McCall. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you all for what y'all do for agriculture. You know, I spent 26 years in this room and I only set where it jolted a lot and butted the lurches sitting at, and it's good to be back. It's good to see all my older friends and all these new faces that we hope are going to take care of agriculture. Everybody I talk to wants to know how Jane is. Jane's sitting right up y'all in the bottle, by the railing. But thank you all for what you do and thank you for being remembering at least who my name is, but I want to tell you a little bit, Farm Bureau has about 250,000 members across the state. So there's somebody here today. We got about 700 people here for Farm Bureau Day. We invite you to come down to the depot. Somebody from your district is here. When I say 250,000 members, I'm talking about 250,000 member families and y'all know how to count votes. That rolls into about a half of million votes. So when you start talking about agriculture issues, remember about a half of million votes that are Farm Bureau members. Up here on the stage, women, I mean on the podium, women, we have our first vice president, Mr. Daniel Johnson from Pierce County, North Georgia Vice President, Mr. Bernard Sims from up in Coutusa and Ralph Carwell as a middle Georgia Vice President from over in Hurd County. Thank you for all the y'all for doing the resolution for us. We appreciate you. One thing I want to say to you, when you start looking at revenue, remember to protect gate and Cuba. The largest industry in this state couldn't survive without gate and Cuba. And it's important for what Ag puts back into the economy. I will invite you. Matt Dubinic told me he had already sent me a check for $35 to be a member of Georgia Farm Bureau. Y'all all, I hope got a letter from me asking you to join. If you eat, if you wear clothes and if you live in something made out of a two by four, you ought to be a member of Farm Bureau because that's what we protect is your food, your clothing and where you live. Thank you all very much for what you do. We appreciate you. We are at your disposal if you have an ag question. Thank you very much and good to be back home. Thank you, Mr. Frager. Well, today y'all is Valentine's Day, but before it was Valentine's Day, it was Tom McCall's birthday. So, we're up there in your shop, but let's hear it, brother. It was great to serve with you, Mr. McCall, and good to see you again. So we're going to give you the new version since we have a whole lot of new faces here. All right, here we go. Happy birthday. How many of you have been more, Mr. McCall? One of the finest men, human beings that we remember this house, Tom McCall. Thank you for being here, Mr. President. Thank you all very much. And look, I had the pleasure of being this guy sweet mate for I don't know how many years and I am so proud. He gets to stand up here behind this podium. Y'all don't know how lucky you are to have him. No more commercials. For what purpose does the gentleman from the 49th rise? Parliamentary inquiry, I think I'll face this on. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that if former representative McCall were still up on the roster, I would ask him to take a moment for our new members, the freshmen in the audience, and explain to them what is an attractive nuisance in the profession of forming. If he were still up there with you, Mr. Speaker. He's not up here, but he knows a lot about attractive nuisance as I think. I won't even go any further than that. It's a good question. And I think the gentleman understands the answer to attractive nuisance. We're going to move on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk of your redecaption, HB 76. HB 76 by the way, was it a Paul 33rd? No, there's to be entitled not to amend Article 1 of Chapter 10A, the Title 43, then fiscal to George Ants, and it's an licensing provisions regarding professional council, social workers, and marriage, and family therapists. So it provides provisions relating to education, experience, and training requirements. This bill, I'm for committee unregulated industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. I want to do that. I want to do that. Hey, how are you? Ripper's chairman, Ellen Powell, is recognized to present the bill. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. This morning, I bring you Valentine's gift. A lot of you all have asked me questions about me handling this bill, but this is a, this increases access to mental health professionals. And those would be the marriage and family therapist. And if anybody knows much about this, it ought to be me. And if I did, it took better heat years ago. I'd probably, me and my exes would have been in better shape. Ladies and gentlemen, it's quite, it's quite honestly. It's a very simple bill. That act has not been, has not been upgraded in a number of years. And what this bill will do is it updates the current licensure requirements for marriage and family therapists to bring Georgia currently in line with the national accreditation standards. It updates courts requirements and clinical requirements put us in line with surrounding states. It did go through the Gorp committee for any of y'all who might know what Gorp is. The screening committee of stuff that folks tried not to pass things. And the House of Rural Development Council in 21 in their final report made recommendations that Georgia licensing gets in line with surrounding states. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what this does. Hope you'll see fit to vote for it. I do think it's a good bill because a lot of these licensing agencies do need to be upgraded on a periodic basis. And after all, vote for this because the marriage you say might be your own. Let's just figure out a big glad to stand for any questions, but I hope there's none out of the sense of humor of this house. Well, Mr. Chairman, you talked your way into one, maybe two, as long as it's not my former seat, make Tom McCall. Oh, I'm sorry he's already gone. Well, I don't think he's qualified at this point in time to ask you a question on the floor, but we'll recognize the gentleman from the 71st for a question of your yield. Chairman Collins, does my friend and mentor from Hartwell yield? I certainly will. Do you think that this piece of legislation could have been beneficial when some of the failed relationships that I've had previously? Well, to my dear friend, the only man I know that's been probably married a whole lot more times than I have would be. And whether you subscribe to these professional skills or not, I would actually recommend you do it retroactively. Mr. Speaker, I would certainly ask for consideration of the House members and I'll step aside. I think you both need to yield the well on that one. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Member Abbess. Have all members voted? Thank you, time. have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 173, the NAZero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to HB176? House for 176, my representant. Governor of the eighth to be titled back to amend Article 11 of Chapter 14, Title 15 in the physical order of Georgia. Anteity relaying the general provisions regarding court reporters. So, to increase the amount of court reporters, monthly contingent expense and travel allowance. This bill, I refer to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Gunther to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this is House Bill 176 that is a council-spiric court judges bill. Basically, what it does is it amends the travel expense and other expenses for the official court reporters for each circuit. This was set out in law some time ago. It hasn't been changed in 30 years. And then the way they changed it to get the amounts they got was they were trying to put the dollars from back when this went into place and bring it up to current dollars. That pretty well doubled the amount on each of these. And so that's what the bill does. It doubles that amount. It goes into effect when the budget is in effect July 1st. And that's the bill. You all have any questions? I'll be glad to answer. The gentleman, would you for a question? I yield. The majority leader of this House has a question. You should have talked to him earlier. Evidently, he's going straight out now. Leader, illustration from the 104th. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's the gentleman yield. I yield. The gentleman isn't it true. There's a court reporter shortage in certain circuits of our state and that this legislation will be helpful in consideration of that court reporter shortage that our judges and courtrooms are dealing with across Georgia. Yes, sir. That is absolutely correct. And the court reporter's association also is in favor of this bill. And again, the council has included this in their budget. So it's covered. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. They have not. All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you please lock the machine on the passage of the bill, the yeas or 172, the nays 0. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. That completes the rules calendar. We'll move on to the afternoon orders. Representative Corriez said he wanted to come back. He's back. He's recognized for an afternoon order. Representative. You're recognized to speak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues and these black history months, I want to tell you a story. A story of unsung heroes. These men were taken from the evil land, I spoke to you about the evil people earlier this morning. They were taken from evil land and brought here into slavery. They did not like that. And guess what they did? They fought back, 75 of them, overpowered their captors, and of course none of them knew how to accompany the ship. So the ship ran aground in San Simon Island, Georgia. And guess what? All of them, instead of becoming slaves, linked arms, singing songs in evil, walked back into the sea and drowned. These are the...

song heroes. They will brave and I hope that this story will learn something to be courageous against all odds, to put an emphatic end to the dehumanization of mankind. But ladies in general, I must tell you and as I say to you, I say to those unsung heroes that on song yes they were, but on song they must not be anymore because according to my favorite author, Chino Achebe, the story of the hunt will always be told by the hunters until the lions learn how to talk. And ladies and gentlemen, to my own song heroes I say, your children have not learned to talk just like the lions, they are. I owe back, Mr. Speaker, thank you. Thank you representative. Representative Hutchinson is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. Today I want to introduce you to 13-year-old Connor. Connor is a smart child who makes good grades in school. He is helpful, he is well-behaved, he enjoys socializing, dancing, listening to any kind of music, he likes eating a boy after my own heart. He likes watching movies, TV shows and football games. Connor is one of the many, many children who are available for adoption in Georgia today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Representative Allen Westbrook is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning colleagues. I rise today to mark Asomber anniversary on February 14, 2018, which was Valenz Times Day and also Ash Wednesday that year. America suffered the deadliest high school shooting in the United States. When 14 students and three staff were slain at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, staff died that day attempting to save the children and their care. We know that the grief of the families affected is endless, especially today. We know it is a grief shared by the families of the 26 slain at Sandy Hook Elementary, including 21th graders. It is a grief shared by the families of 21 slain, including 19th-4th graders at Rob Elementary in Yvalde, Texas, last May. It is a grief shared by many affected by gun violence here in Georgia, where gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children and teens. And it is a grief now shared by three more American families after another sanctuary of learning was shattered by gun violence last night in Michigan. We pray daily as a body and our members reflect many faith traditions and no faith traditions as is our right as Americans. For those of us who do pray, may we add all of these families to our prayers today. And may we also reflect on our acts, including our acts of emission. I will be reflecting on the scripture of my tradition, the Book of James, which tells us faith without works is dead. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. Chair, Ballinger is recognized for a afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, February 14, 2023 is Stand With Survivors Day here at the Capitol. Family and intimate partner violence with family has familial and societal costs that are expounded and very detrimental to children. Domestic violence and sexual assault strikes from inner cities to rural communities. And regardless of your place in society, it can strike anybody. In 2022, there are 42,000 family violence calls according to the GBI. And in 2022, there were 114,640 crisis calls to the domestic violence line. We are hereby honored by the dedicated professionals working with survivors and hereby commend them with much gratitude. So I would ask you to stand and offer them a clause. I don't know if there's any in the gallery. So I don't think so. But anyway, but Stand With Survivors today talk with them and find out what they need and how you can help them in their community because they do a very important work. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Lady. Representative Townsend is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a reminder, a week from today is going on a day here at the Capitol. We'll be having a low-counter bowl at the depot that evening beginning at 530. Everyone's welcome. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Representative Washburn is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Legend gentleman in the house today is Valentine's Day. And it's a very special day for me and my wife Donna because it marks the anniversary of our first date. I was 16 and she was 15. And I asked her to go to the Valentine banquet at the church we attended. And of course, God has blessed us with many, many years of marriage and she's a great blessing to me. She's often here with me in the chamber. And actually, she's sitting in her favorite seat back in the corner today. So if Mr. Speaker, if you'll permit me to let her stand, I appreciate that. She's a beautiful lady. She's done a good job raising you. There's no doubt about that. She's to be credited for that. That concludes our afternoon orders. What purpose does representing Mayna rise? Thank you, Speaker. I'd like to make a motion. State your motion. I move that House bill 282 be moved from the Committee on Education to the Committee on Industry and Labor. Both chairman are in agreement. Clerk, we'll read the caption. House bill 282 by Representative Maynard 56. Another is being titled back to Men Park 2, Varticle 6, Chapter 2, a tunnel 20 in the physical to Georgia and attested, relating to competes and core curriculum under the Equality Basic Education Act. On the ladies' motion, that HB 282 be withdrawn from the Education Committee and recommitted to the Industry and Labor Committee is their objection. Here in none, it is so ordered. Before we go to announcements for planning purposes, for planning purposes, today is Tuesday, I believe, Valentine's Day. Tomorrow's Wednesday. And I believe you will have a motion from the majority leader in a few minutes and a few minutes that we will be here at 10 a.m. on Wednesday. On Thursday, for planning purposes, this body will convene at 1 p.m. 1 p.m. on Thursday. For planning purposes, we will come into session at 1 p.m. on Thursday. That will allow us to take care of any committee meetings in the morning, so be prepared to be here. Listen to the announcements.
