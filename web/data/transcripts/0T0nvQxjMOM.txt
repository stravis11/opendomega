4th and should be final committee meeting on service delivery strategy and Chair
again and I have been communicating a lot with with some of you and the two associations
ACCG and GMA and hope we can have some good discussion today and make great strides towards
wrapping this up. So I want to thank those committee members who have chimed in with recommendations
or responses to the draft recommendations. It's very helpful to keep the conversation
going. Before we go any further, I would like to ask someone to open up in prayer and
Chairman Prince is going to do that for us.
Let us pray, eternal God, our Father, we thank you for this day. We thank you for another
opportunity to come together and do the business of this great state of George. Father, we
ask that everything we do here be pleasing unto you. God has strengthened us. Give us your
wisdom guidance by most of all thank you for your son in Jesus name. Amen. Thank
you, Chairman Prince. All right so we will call them in the order. You've all
seen the draft recommendations which we'll get in front of me and Mayor Ward
has sent us all his responses to those, his recommendations and Commissioner Chris
Dockery has done the same as early as this recent as this morning so what I
like to do is just hear from the committee members your thoughts on these
recommendations and then I've had some conversations offline with with
chairman again and we both talk with ACCG and GMA and what we'd really like to
see here because I've been in the legislature since 2018 and this this issue
predates that by a few years. Yeah but the way I understand it this issue has
been, you know, there's been talks to resolve some of these differences, the dispute resolutions
for at least 15 years. And here we are still talking about it and we've had this study
committee that GMA and HCCG and others have asked for and we're still not quite there
with a joint agreement or a list of recommendations that both parties are agreeing to be the solution
to this dispute resolution.
So what I'd like to do is just talk through these comments and then ask the two associations
to get together in short order and get back with chairman again and on, you know, those
points you can agree on. And I hope there's only just a small, small number that you
say you can't agree on. But we need something that we can go into legislation, into session
with or else this is going to continue. And then we'll look back 15 years from now and
and we might still be having the same conversation.
So, Chairman Prince.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And again, I'm looking at the recommendations
and I think there's spot on.
However, come I know ACG and GMA
have policy meetings or something else going on
around the same time.
Will they have time?
Because I think, well, I guess the maximum question,
don't we have to have a report or something
back to the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker here.
We do.
The initial deadline was December 1st, which is passed.
And we asked for an extension.
And they gave us an extension to December 31st.
So thank you for clarifying that.
So we do have to December 31st.
However, we don't want to wait till the laminate hour
of this extension.
And I'll ask Chairman again to weigh in, too.
But I think we have holidays coming up.
today is what the, today the fourth, that's right,
Sanazon is way.
And so, first of all, this meeting today,
we've agreed needs to wrap up within an hour,
and then we'd like the two associations to come back to us
with your approved recommendations in plenty of time
for us to get together on a report before the end of the year.
So, I'd say before Christmas, do we
want to set a hard date to meet with them. Yes. We got a question from Chairman Burns.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we look at these recommendations there, I guess six. Is that
right? Is there consensus on any of the six? Is there consensus that we could say we
We can settle those and leave the two or three that might still need more consideration.
I'd love to get to closure on something.
I would like to hear the answer to that from the parties, if there's consensus to both.
If I may, a misdemeanor, I'd like to suggest that ACCG and GMA address all of the six recommendations
and just say, we're good with this.
We like to consider this further.
That's what I want to, what's I'd like to hear.
I don't see a great deal of contentious debate
about statewide mapping standards for SDS agreements.
They may be, but I would say I don't anticipate that.
So thank you, Chairman Burns.
what I'd like to do is hear from here from the two parties.
But also I'd like Commissioner Dockery and Mayor Ward
to be able to summarize their recommendations
for us while we're all here together.
So it looks like Commissioner Dockery
might be ready to do that now.
Mr. Chairman, I would just suggest that we
as the committee since that's our charge
to come up with this report that we go through it and come up with what we think is right.
And then if there are outstanding issues that we as a committee can't iron out, then
we give ACCG and GMA time to look at those issues or help us to address those issues
us to what a compromise could be and then of course I can't speak for GMA but ACCG we
will want to go back and vet that through our policy council and we could do that we
could do that via Zoom in short order so I don't think that's an issue but I would suggest
that we as the committee go through each one of these bullet points and discuss them
as a committee and then if there are outstanding issues maybe ACCG and GMA here with us today
they can help us get through those.
Just a recommendation.
Yes, I'm in favor of doing just that.
But I'm not in favor of finalizing the report
without ACCG and GMA saying, we agree with this,
or we don't agree with it officially.
That's what I want.
I want some finality to the report from each association.
So would you like to go first and explain your,
summarize your recommendations that you sent out to us?
I'd be glad to.
Do we just want to go over the first bullet point
which is statewide mapping?
I can tell my position.
And then if anybody on the board
or on the committee wants to give theirs
and just do them one at a time.
Yeah, that works for me.
What's your say, Mr. Chairman?
Okay, so the statewide mapping,
I do think that that's good.
It adds a lot of standardization.
And in my comments, one of the biggest concerns I had is forcing communities to identify
100% of their areas as for a service delivery.
In other words, there may be some areas that are not designated and they, you know, a community
may desire to leave that undesignated, not knowing what the future development may be.
if you designated a certain way and then the development comes in and it's completely
different from what you anticipated, then whoever's designated to provide that service
and might not be able to.
So I'm not sure that there's a benefit to making sure 100% of the land areas would be designated
by doing so.
I think what you're doing is your forcing communities to do a pencil drill where we say we'll
just do this and you do that without any thought behind it and then when it comes down to it,
it might not be the right answer and it could be very contentious in doing so.
One thing that has to be considered is the ability of certain communities to do the GIS mapping.
So that might be a fallback to regional commissions to help with those things because I'm not
not so sure that every municipality and every county in the state of Georgia has that
same capability for GIS mapping.
And then we talked about the DCA rulemaking authority and I think that's a bullet point
on down but I think it's applicable here because this is a very specific issue that I think
that that rulemaking authority could be a big benefit
because this technology changes,
maybe the requirements for those maps would change as well.
So that's, I don't think that's something
that has to come back to a legislative body to update.
So that would be in my mind a good place for DCA
to have that rulemaking authority to change
what that requirement would be.
And it would be equal across the board for all communities.
So those were my big comments on the statewide mapping
standards, Mr. Chairman.
All right.
So just for my clarification, the rulemaking authority
to DCH, I believe that's what some believe is given too much
of the legislature's role away to not DCH, excuse me.
D.C.A. is that in my right on that?
Mr. Chairman, if I may, I think if you just give a blank check so to speak to D.C.A.,
you're putting them in a very uncomfortable position because I think that is the job
of the legislatures.
But if it's something as simple as what's required as far as mapping, a very specific
rulemaking function then I think that that would be acceptable. It certainly would
in my eyes because it allows them to adjust maybe as technology changes. But to
come up with rulemaking authority as far as how you're going to have dispute
resolution, I don't I don't think that DC that they're going to do I'm sure
what you tell them to do but I don't think that that puts them in a very
a comfortable position to pick winners and losers or to come up with a process that favors
one government entity over another. So the rulemaking just as a blank check, I'm opposed
to, but if it's a specific issue that can be defined, I think there's a place for it.
all right thank you and that's your position on bullet point the first bullet
point Mayor Ward we'd like to speak to that one all right what number are you 13
all right go ahead so I think the low-hanging fruit on this is the statewide
mapping when I think policy you know a lot a lot of the role we play on the
mayor level is to set policy as opposed to set procedure if you will so the
The why and the how is what we, you know, the why and the what is a lot of what we answer the how we try to maybe leave that up to our staff a little more. So that's more the long, long lines of what I was thinking in this.
But if we just look at Chairman Dockery's report and kind of eliminate mine for a minute or his, his input.
I don't believe that under the first bullet point, his subheading number one. I don't think that the GMA position will differ greatly.
There could be territories that are left unestablished, if you will, because then it wouldn't necessarily be a, well, you have to take it from me later if it's unestablished for now.
It could be unestablished on an ongoing portion.
And I think in support of that, if you were to look at the proposed recommendation on my report on page one, that's why we kind of indicated there including data and parcel jurisdiction level.
So then we really lay this thing out and we know what the data and parcel jurisdiction levels are.
With regard to the DCA rulemaking authority, I don't know that we drilled down that close.
We did recognize that the Georgia Geospatial Information Office has on its board members of GMA and members of ACCG.
And more so leaned in the direction of saying, hey, these are mapping services that both of these entities have a part in.
and let that mapping service play more of a role.
So to keep my comments brief and to help us get through this,
I think that's about where I wanted to start.
Okay, thanks. Chair again.
And I think they're both hitting on the same thing for me.
When I talk about, and I'm on DCA's rulemaking,
you know, this is what you've got to have in your maps.
This is what you've got to do.
And I think that DCA can work with us as local governments
to make sure that, you know, across the state, there is uniformity in those maps, I think
those rules can come from DCA. I don't think that's something that we need to legislate
in. But I do think that when I look at, and truly the first attempt in Georgia that
I know anything about on service delivery was the maps that were created for the Electric
Territory Service Act of 1973, where you identified all areas of the state for who's going
to serve with what area. There are a few places in that map that show that there are some
undetermined areas of the state, but very few. And so for me, when I think about most
counties, yeah, there'd be, there'd be some counties I think about the Oki-Fonoki swamp
or something like that that, hey, it might not be one of those places we'd put in the map
as far as who's going to serve as delivery in there. But very, very few. I think it'd be
the exception of the rule. And I'd like to see that, you know, and when the maps are
done as much as possible would be there. I think it would, because then you're either on
this team or that team as far as who's going to serve it. And then I think, and I give
my local officials a lot of credit that they can work amongst themselves to, okay, it's
ours now. Either you're going to serve it or tell me that you can't. If you can't serve
it then the other service providers would come in and serve it. But I think it's by having
it known when you when you agree to a service delivery map that it is in A or B or C or
D or any of the providers that may be in that community by it being an assigned at least
one of them if they can't provide it then somebody else can step up to the plate and make
that recommendation, and for me, I think that's a prime example of where we'd use DCA's
rulemaking ability to, hey, here's what your map's going to be like, here's the format,
and here's what you got to do.
Thank you, Chairman Gan.
Any more discussion on the first bullet on the maps?
That one seems pretty agreeable.
All right.
All right, second bullet point.
Mayor Ward, you want to go first on that one
and explain your recommendation.
Thank you, agreed on it.
I appreciate you giving me the easiest one on the board.
Yes, I think the consolidated governments
can make their own rules and get along with themselves
much easier than cities and counties
that are not consolidated.
All right, and Commissioner, Dr. Lee.
Mr. Chairman, I don't have any comments on that one either.
That's kind of a no brainer.
Yeah, and I don't mean to skip over anybody else
if you've got anything to weigh in.
So that one seems pretty simple as well.
All right, how about the third bullet point
who wants to start?
Anybody have any comments on reconsidering the issue
of veto power?
I think that's the not so easy one.
I had a lengthy response on that one
if you'd prefer I started.
If you want to summarize your thoughts, go ahead.
I think in conjunction with the staff,
we tried really hard to modify this window where it was a,
hopefully a simple recommendation that could be adopted,
that was broad enough it could be adopted.
With regard to the veto power,
we feel like primarily the thing to look at
is that the consideration of a holdout city
was addressed in the current legislation.
And I think I've cited the statute there.
I don't want to try and recite those off the top of my head.
But we definitely can understand the discrepancy
that a small city trying to take captive everyone else
could be an issue, but there is already a statute
that says if it's a small city,
well they are still able to hold out,
they're not forced to provide the service,
but that doesn't cause penalties against the county
or the other cities that bought it.
We see a lot of wise decision making
and how that's already drafted
and don't see the reason to alter that.
With regard to, you know, coming to an agreement,
And we also see some wisdom in the required signatories as they're currently drafted.
It's literally, if you look at the statute, I mean, it's just a chart of 1, 2, 3, 4.
These folks can rattle that off the top of their head.
I'm not that eloquent.
But we don't see a lot of reason to alter that format either with regard to establishing
a new veto power versus what's the current signature perspective.
I think that's a good high level for where we are at the moment.
So if I'm right, you would prefer just to remove that recommendation from the list.
That's right.
Yeah, that's right.
We just think that the current plan with regard to preserving any chance of the county
getting harmed by a small city being a holdout has already been dealt with.
And we think the current plan of required signatures under this four level process, we think
that's appropriate.
We don't see a reason to try and modify those.
Okay.
All right.
Anybody want to respond with thoughts?
Do you have thoughts on this one, Commissioner?
Dockery?
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, if I may.
Mary, you said there was a process in place
by which a smaller city could not hold
all the other parties hostage.
Can somebody smarter than me explain what that process would be?
Does it go based on population?
How does that county see?
Larry, I don't know if you want to address it, but for me, a good example would be I'll
pick on Franklin County where I was county manager.
The county seat was one of the smaller cities, population wise, in the city as far as the
county, and if you don't have that signature from the county seat, you basically can hold
The agreement is my understanding.
I think that's right, Mr. Chairman.
Larry Ramsey with ACCG.
So the existing law that Mayor Ward is talking about lists
what local governments have to sign off
for a service delivery strategy to be submitted to DCA.
That's the county, the city that serves as the county seat.
Mr. Chairman, again, was saying any other city
that has at least 9,000 population,
than at least half of the cities
that are within between 500 people and 9,000 people.
So, in effect, what that means,
if you have a city that's less than 500 people,
they don't get a vote, they can't hold it up.
And then some number, if you have multiple cities
between 500 and 9,000, only half of them have to sign off.
So there could be some that or don't have a vote
that could hold it up in that category,
but of course that will vary county by county,
depending on what the city makeup is.
All right, Mayor Ward, on page two of five in the report, I put together the last sentence
of the second to last paragraph, OCGA 367027B1, when I went, what I did, and when I got
you all's report, as I reread the entire act, just to try and make sure I was fresh on
what we were thinking and where it could apply. And that's where this one already does
as mitigated against sanctions against the county
and any other municipality located in such county
and the circumstances of a hold up by a city
of less than 500 people.
We felt like that's a good, good statute there.
Mr. Chairman, if I may,
when this was brought up in Brazlton,
I can't remember who brought this issue up,
but I was thinking that it might have been
somebody representing a municipality
that brought this up, I don't have strong feelings
one way or another because I think it could affect
municipalities equally as counties.
And if it's something that is not that important
or beneficial to include, then I'm okay with it.
Taking it out.
So, the idea is, on the table to remove it, is this, what does the committee think about,
you know, part of the purpose here is to put some processes in place that encourage
dispute resolution.
Is taking this out, going to soften that, or is it going to be another barrier to come
into a resolution to encourage these disagreements to linger?
With respect to the GMA side of this, I feel like what we're also looking to incorporate
is going to be maybe more effective and more appropriate.
I do think the encouragement towards sanctions and the encouragement towards better procedures
for sanctions, so maybe we don't make a decision on this third bullet point at the moment,
We wait to see how we discuss the others and feel of those would be the right process when we come back
Yeah, I do do believe that the fifth bullet point about the sanctions may
It's gonna gravitate this. That's right. Yes, sir
All right
So we'll move on to the fourth bullet point which states further consideration
Use of arbitration versus mediation in the case of disputes and whether both or neither should be binding
Any comments there?
I think Chair Dockerick should lead on this.
I tried to lean into his comments more so in mind to make sure we felt that way.
All right.
Chairman Docker.
So, I think it all goes back to home rule.
You know, I was involved in lost negotiations and baseball arbitration and we all know
what the court ruled as it related to the baseball arbitration. I'm not sure that you can
have binding mediation. I'm not sure what that looks like. I think mediation should be
encouraged as a first step. And then I think arbitration is a good method of resolution
as long as both parties agree to go into arbitration. So, you know, if you just establish the
recommended process I think that's what should be done. I'm not so sure that
the binding should be included. You know again I think it all goes back to
home rule and I can't remember who said it in Brousalton but you know your
local officials are elected to do these things and when you take a decision
out of the hands of the local officials and you put it into some special panel that's
made up of people outside your community. I'm not so sure that that's what our constituents
are expecting us to do. So I'm not in favor of that panel or any binding arbitration.
I think arbitration should be encouraged, mediation, and then arbitration, but I'm not
in favor of any binding arbitration by an independent third party that's appointed
by somebody other than the people that should be held accountable in those communities.
Go ahead.
If I may, Chair, I think we actually have some common ground here as a person who deals
with, there's a bunch of words here, let's get the word solid correctly if we will, alternative
dispute resolution or ADR kind of begins on the spectrum of mediation and then it goes
up to arbitration and then it would go to binding arbitration. That's kind of the three
layer spectrum, if you will, of alternative dispute resolution. I think the current
statute incorporates mediation as a mandatory role and I think the consequence of that mediation
has not been harsh enough if we're going to get into the consequences discussion.
And is that where you believe the next bullet point would address?
Well, I think this in this article, this number four bullet point is going to lend itself.
What I personally see is that we can use this role of what Chairman Docker just said
was, hey, not binding arbitration, but arbitration.
I think that's a common ground we could look at.
that's a ratcheting up of consequences to just help further that beginning
illustration and hopefully not to go too long. Mediation, yeah, I have failed
mediations, right? I sit down with my clients. They're not going to come to a
resolution. They're not going to settle the case for less than what they want.
So the whole process is a failure. It's all under a confidentiality perspective
and you walk away. An arbitration is where a neutral third party is going to
actually issue a decision, and that decision could be made public. And that's where maybe
it's not binding on the parties, but we think that could be another layer of accountability
and consequence if we want to look at arbitration versus just the mediation angle that's currently
in the statute. Does that make sense to you and how I see that as a consequence?
I think so, yep.
So that's where the two roles of this that we feel like on the GMA side that I believe
we've talked about, I'm not looking at my colleagues enough to get nodding heads, I should probably
do that. There's a lot of heads over there, I'm not sure if they're all looking down or
looking at me. They're looking at each other.
Yeah, like, put this guy up there, right? But I think if we were to look at arbitration
to make a recommendation to increase the ADR option from mediation to arbitration, and
And then to also consider this closed record discussion that was mutually, I think, offered
by the ACCG and GMA panel, and that I feel very strongly about to say that it does expedite
resolution.
When you close down the number of arguments, just think of it as a criminal prosecution,
right?
This is the one that's the easiest way to understand.
If you're accused of a crime, the prosecution's got to tell you everything that they're going
to charge you with, and all the evidence they have, and you know what that does?
That gets 99% of cases settled that people take a plea agreement.
Because everybody understands what's going to be on the table and what's going to be
dealt with in front of the judge and what the arguments are going to be.
And then they coppably deal or they go and fight it, right?
But you see the percentages from my colleagues that are in the prosecution side.
So I really feel like the close record component, I would again encourage that and encourage
it along the arbitration level may be more so than the mediation level.
All right. So, you know, I know you're, you know,
more aligned with with GMA and
Chairman Dockery, more aligned with ACCG,
although not necessarily speaking officially for either one, and that's why
I'd love, you know,
at the proper time for both associations to let us know what they
What they're what their official position is on this and
Commissioner, do you have anything to add to Mayor Ward's comments?
I think I think like Mayor Ward said there's some some common ground there and if you go to the next bullet point five
You know if there's consequences for not reaching an agreement that goes right in line. I'm just not so sure that
binding
is the last and final step.
So, I mean, if you have a mediation and arbitration,
I do like the idea of disclosing your arguments,
your closed record as you call it,
disclosing everything that you're going to present,
so that you don't have new things popping up
that I've been through that, that's ugly.
It kind of galvanizes both sides when you do that.
So, I would be in agreement with that,
it's just the whole binding part.
I don't think I can support.
All right.
Well, let's talk about that fifth bullet point.
The clear definitions for sanctions
with counsel to review the current legal viability
of withholding loss slash loss funds from non-compliance
with SDS renewal.
New a previous version of this maybe
went as far to talk about a time frame, maybe six months,
up to six month, the bayents.
But after that, the consequences sink in.
I'd like to hear some comments on this one.
Because I think this is where we're actually
getting into forcing the parties to make a decision.
And to come to some agreement.
I mean, this is when citizens will
start to feel it and notice it.
Yeah, and that let's let Chairman Dockery speak first.
You always want me to go first.
I agree, but I think it needs to be a timeline.
And I think that that vice needs to tighten.
You're not going to drop a hammer to start with.
So those sanctions, if you will, would be graduated.
So, you know, as you go through your mediation,
your arbitration, the results of the arbitration may public.
And then you start losing some of your funding
or your status, your ability for funding.
But then I think if that is a graduate
and know what that actually looks like,
it's probably gonna take somebody smarter than me.
But there has to be consequences.
At the end of the day, there has to be consequences.
These things that go on for seven years
or crazy.
So I think if there's consequences
and it's very well laid out up front,
then I think that gets the parties to the table.
When you start having more to lose than you have to gain,
I think if I can steal some of my lawyer talk
and you go back and talk about Bacaria,
the punishment has to outweigh the benefits of the crime.
Is that right, Mr. Mayor?
So when you go back and look at that,
I think that the punishment or the consequences have to outweigh what you're gaining by holding
out.
That's the only way it's going to work.
But it needs to be graduated from my thoughts.
You got to agree with that here, I think.
The way ours has drafted, if you were to look at the statute, 367025.1, D2, this is discussed
on page 5 of 5 of my report.
But again, D2 is where the statute currently allows the court to hold that, those sanctions
and abayants, and the way that I redrafted the proposed recommendation on page two with
regard to this is just to say that further consideration on imposing sanctions at staggered
levels and intervals, which I think Chairman Docry is talking about a spectrum of how to
do that.
You know, the illustration I give in my discussion on this is kind of start with removing radar permits and then as it ratchets up.
And I would be extremely naive and inappropriate to say what those levels should be and what those penalty should be at what level.
But I do think that's where your thought of saying, hey, ACCCGMA, we really want a firm list on this.
I think we're all in agreement as a committee that they would want to do that and to further
comment outside on a previous meeting that if you say arbitration is going to take six
months to do, will it maybe allow them to be held in a balance if you're participating
in arbitration for those, but after that arbitration, the material, the consequence kicks
I personally like that one, I think that that's the one that's going to get things moving.
All right, so I think what we want to do is hear from GMA and ACCG on more specifics
on the graduated sanctions.
All right, the last bullet, granting rulemaking authority to DCA.
I think the mayor is there now.
Sir, we didn't have any strong comments about the recommendation.
I think it's a simple statement.
I would like to keep this at the lowest level for everybody's opinion as much as we can.
And I'm fantastic, and I'm already at the end of the course.
Both the seats and the seats go ahead, I think.
So that's it.
That's Chair McIntyre.
So we have a given that.
Giving it a blind check.
I can feel a little.
Please come right here.
Thank you.
Chair McIntyre, again.
Thank you.
One of the things, and you know, it's come up,
and this happens in our legislative process.
We have a lot of different boards and associations in the state.
and DCA being one of those. If they're looking at a rule-making and rule-changing situation,
then part of that, they have to notify the legislature and the correct committee in the legislature
that that rule change is subject to take place. That gives the legislature an ability to
put that, if the appropriate committee objects to that, they can pull it back.
it back. So there's one of the things that there is a check and balance on that. We give
them rulemaking authority, there's still a string attached that we can reel them back
in if it gets too far off note. And I think that's important to know what we do with
our different boards and authorities across the state.
So not to put anybody on the spot too much, but the GCN in the room is that something
that you feel like, you know, some limited rule-making authority is something that would work for you.
All right. So we've gone through the six bullets and it looks like some are pretty easy to agree on
and others are going to need a little bit more, I think, meeting of the minds between the stakeholders.
Chairman, again, and I feel like December 15th is a reasonable time to, you know, allow
the parties to meet and get back with us on, you know, just tell us out of these recommendations
which ones can you agree on and which ones do you not agree on? What's your position
on each of these? And if you want to get a little more specific in some of them, I'm okay
with that too.
Mr. Chairman, can I make one last comment on number six and I'm just going to read my bullet
point to verbatim because I think the Department of Community Affairs does a great job for
local governments, both municipalities and counties in the state of Georgia.
But I'll just read that bullet point.
I think that sums it up says DCA should be a neutral state agency that's not subject to
special interest or political pressure from either side without specifying the rule-making
authority, it will put this agency in a very precarious position of potentially being
influenced by special interest organizations.
This holds true in selecting panels by DCA as well.
So even just those panels that DCA selects, you know, I think it would be very naive
to think that there wasn't some political posturing as to who's going to serve on those
panels.
So, I think that, again, that needs to be very limited and with that.
All right. Mayor Ward.
In the directive you're giving by the December 15th deadline,
is that directive to say that the two agencies need to agree on the terminology that you all propose,
or if they take the model you propose and agree on their own terminology to
come back to you, is there flexibility for them to do that?
Yeah, I don't think we want to limit any more ideas from coming to the table.
I do believe we want to use these six bullet points as somewhat of a framework
for the discussion.
But if the ideas that are discussed expand beyond this, I'm okay with that.
I think Chairman again is, we think we've narrowed it down pretty well in these six bullet
points, but again, if you need to massage those or expand some, I think that's good if
it brings solutions.
But the main thing is, and I realize, you know, this is going to get debated heavily during
legislative process. I just think it's helpful to have, especially since these two associations
asked for this study committee, I just think it's appropriate that they, you know, honor
that. All of our time that we've spent, you know, a lot of us hundreds of miles coming
to these meetings and a lot of time. And so I just think it's the thing to do, to get
them to to state their position on these and hopefully they can come to agreement on
almost. So the committee feel comfortable with that and also don't want to diminish
the voice of the committee members. You know the recommendations that have been brought to us
and the expertise is invaluable, and has got us to where we are now, and I just think
this is that last step that we need for the...
What you're asking for in our role is your want to consolidate into trial order before...
You're want to consolidate and pre-trial order before we go into the session, right?
I think that's a very fair request.
You know, I don't know the legal term, but it sounds good.
Right.
Right.
And so, if there's no other discussion from the committee, and seriously, I appreciate
you know, everybody's time and consideration.
I think we've narrowed things down pretty well.
And if ACCG and GMA could help us finish this, I think everybody will be grateful for that.
And going into session, we'll have some good solutions to work off of.
Otherwise, I think this just game and ship just continues indefinitely.
So alright, well if there's no other discussion, preach everybody coming today and we'll
be adjourned.
Alright, thank you.
