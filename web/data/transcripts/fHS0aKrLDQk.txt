We'll have the morning row call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain. After which, we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 48th House District, Representative Scott Hilton. Rep. Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning, colleagues. God is good. And it is my amen. God, this is my great pleasure to introduce my good friend, Pastor Steve Wood. Pastor Wood is a lifelong Georgian born in Sandy Springs. And earned his bachelor's degree in finance. I knew I liked him. From the University of Georgia in 1980. He felt a calling for a higher purpose and answered the call by attending as-berry theological seminary and Wilmore Kentucky. Today, Pastor Wood is the senior pastor at Mount Pysca Church in Johns Creek for the past 17 years, with a total membership of 8,000. Pastor Wood's Church also runs a K-12 private school, Mount Pysca Christian Church, Go Patriots, with a total of over 1,000 students. Pastor Wood has been married for 38 years. He told me this morning all to the same woman, and is the loving father of four children and two grandchildren. Colleagues, as you know, down here the speaker is God, but Jesus is my savior. And here is my pastor to tell you all about him. Well, good morning and God bless you. What a joy it is for me to be here with you and be in ministry with you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of the House. Thank you, Scott Hilton, for your grace and civilization to come and be with you. In case you haven't heard today is super Tuesday, and we live in a time of complexity, don't we? For almost 40 years now, it has occurred to me that we, the people, have had the privilege not just of supporting you, electing you, and advocating for you, we've had the great and holy privilege of praying for you. So I want to offer you a passage of Scripture that I think is germane to all, and is affable to all, and it comes from the book of Jeremiah. I don't know if people still carry Bibles into the Georgia House, but if you do, what did you turn there or on your device? God bless you, brother. Thank you to Jeremiah chapter 42. While you're turning there, let me just mention this. Prophets of the Old Testament never had good news. It was always turned and repent and get right, and do the right thing, and do act for justice and righteousness. It was a call for the people to turn back to God. And so we are in the latter part of the prophet Jeremiah's call and mission and ministry. And finally, the people who had been disobedient stiff deck and rebellious for so long came to him, and they were feeling overwhelmed. They finally realized we're not in one accord. We're reeling from the pressure of not knowing how to proceed. And they were actually willing to acknowledge to God and to Jeremiah we have made a mess of things. They had proceeded with their own passion, with their own agenda. They had proceeded without the consultation or the wisdom or the leading of a God who cared for a nation and loved a nation more than they could ever understand. So all the people, the scripture says, all the people approached Jeremiah from the least of the greatest and said these words, Jeremiah 42 and 3, pray that the Lord your God would tell us where we should go and what we should do, where we should go and what we should do. I once heard Bill Curry tell a story about this Lombardi who in practices for the Green Bay Packers on Monday would begin each practice and hold up a football and say, gentlemen, this is a football. Sometimes in the complexity of who we are and the culture in which we live in the myriad of our different philosophies and opinions and passions, we lose the simplicity of the commonality that God has called us for the good of all people. And so it occurs to me that you need to know in your journey that there are people like me praying for you and I suspect there are tens of thousands of us in the great state of Georgia who are praying God's wisdom over you. Do you need to be strong in courageous? Absolutely. Be very strong. Be very courageous like Joshua. But you also need to be humble and usable in the hands of the Lord for it is the Lord that has opened the door to call you to the servant leadership. We would do well to pray for one another and to do it often. Over the years, I pray from your brothers and sisters and all kinds of different places as I've fastered, Wayne Garner and Bill Embry. God bless Bill Embry in his health journey these days. I had the opportunity to come and to stand in this very well and to offer prayer at a devotion almost 35 years ago and I can remember that during my prayer I heard a slight rustling over here to my left and I popped one eye open just long enough to see Tom Murphy loading a large cigar into his mouth. I thought he must be really secure in his relationship with God. We've seen characters, we've seen movers, we've seen shakers. I'll always appreciate Keith B. Love and his humility. And then as I move to the North part of town, Mark Berkhalder, Brandon Beach and others and now we're really blessed to have Scott Hilton. I just came to remind you what I often tell myself after 40 years of ministry. Keep it simple, Steve. Tell us what to do, tell us where to go and teach us how to do it for your glory. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. If you're able, I'd like for you to stand so that I can pray over you please. Let us pray. Oh God, our help and ages passed. You who are strength and our hope to come. We give you thanks and honoring praise this day for the gift of life, the gift of faith, and the wonderful privilege of being able to answer your call for your glory and servant leadership. Bless this assembly. Give them wisdom. Encourage. Give them compassion and thoughtfulness. Help them to be the people you are calling them to be, to understand the simplicity of your great love of God for all people. And we pray that as you give wisdom and discernment, that you would also personally come alongside them to help them realize they are not alone. They may be surrounded by lots of people and feel alone, but your promises that you will never leave us nor forsake us. And Lord, we stand in the reality of your promise that those you have called, you will equip to do your will and work. And so now may the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you. May the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace. Be strong in very courageous for God is counting on you. And we pray that in the name above all names, in the name of Jesus Christ, and all of God's people said. And then would you join me now in the pledge of allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. And the flag of the United States is the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands.

On morning orders, the rest of you, I'm going to ask you to hold it to as close as humanly possible to one minute, one minute. Chairman of Appropriations, Chairman Met Hedge, is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this was put on your desk at 9.50. This is your only copy. Y'all get it, so don't lose it. There's a certain person called the clerk of this house that says we're not making any more copies. So I'm not arguing with him or others that may work with him. So this is your copy. Don't lose it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good work. I enjoyed hearing your subcommittee chairs present this morning. They did well. Well, we have a special day today in the house. One of my favorite days, Chairman Dickie, tell us about the good stuff going on today downstairs. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I've got some other our colleagues here who peanuts are very important in that district. You know, March can get a little crazy and netty up here. But so March is peanut month. And I just want to recognize our great industry we have here in our state. Georgia grows 53% of the nation's peanuts. And they are used in so many wonderful foods. As many of you had a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich downstairs that I enjoyed. And I hope you do. And all the great peanut butter and other products, peanut brittle is probably my favorite. But besides the peanuts we're using this country, we export $471 million also throughout the world. And 250 Georgia companies are engaged in the agobusin sector of using these peanuts. Not including our great peanut farmers throughout South Georgia. The Georgia peanut industry plays a very significant role in the prosperity of our state. Two billion dollars contributes to our economy employing more than 150,000 Georgians. So I just want us to thank our Georgia peanut commission that contributes to promotion and research for that great nut and keeps this industry strong in our state. So if we can all give our peanut industry and peanut growers our land and price. Yeah. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My favorite nut peanuts. There's no doubt about that. Not for cons. Peanuts, man. Peanuts. Peanuts. Peanuts. Number one industry in our state agriculture and a big, big part of that industry.

In fact we have a couple of them which give your attention to the presenters and the resolution Mr. Clerk where you read a resolution House resolution 1026 1026 House resolution 1026 by Representative Gamble of the 15th and all of what's the 42nd Kelly the 16th fry the 120 second and Beverly the 143rd of resolution commending Taiwan for its relations with the United States and the state of Georgia. Well we have co-chairs of our two of our members who have done a great job bringing the issues from Taiwan to our attention and being great friends and I appreciate Representative Matthew Gamble, Governor's floor leader and Representative Terry Anola-Witz. So I thank you. We're going to go first. Chairman Gamble. Chairman Gamble to speak to the resolution. Well thank you Mr. Speaker. Members it's an honor to be able to recognize our distinguished guests today Director General Elliott Wang from the Taiwan Taipei Economic and Cultural Office here in Atlanta and Representative Anola-Witz and I co-chair our Taiwan Caucus which I know many of you are familiar with and I'm going to let her share a few remarks about the resolution that we've done for them today. Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you colleagues it is an honor to be here this morning to introduce our very good friends from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Development Office in Atlanta particularly Director General Elliott Wang. The Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office they sponsor Constellar Services, Commercial Services, Informational Services, Cultural Services, exactly as an embassy would here in the United States Southeast. They service all of these things in Georgia and Alabama Kentucky North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee and they also offer a few of the services in the state of Florida. Since 1979 the United States Friendship with the Nation of Taiwan has been very clear. They're a key partner economically they're a relentless friend and supporter as they were with COVID during the COVID-19 pandemic with the donations of personal protective equipment that was used throughout the United States of America and throughout the world. I am proud to be a co-chair of the Georgia Taiwan Caucus along with Chairman Gamble. We at the Capitol here I think and many of you have taken advantage of the educational opportunities that we have here at the Capitol to hear from the Director General and to learn more about what the caucus is doing to learn more about what the what the priorities are for Taiwan in Georgia. I hope you have been able to participate in cultural events like the Lunar New Year celebration that the office hosts in Gwinnett County. It is fantastic and then I hope you've been able to take part in celebrations like Taiwan National Day which was most recently celebrated at the Georgia Aquarium. That was important because the whale sharks that we have all enjoyed seeing at the Georgia Aquarium came to the United States from Taiwan. Director General Wang has been in Atlanta since 2020. He has been in the foreign service since 1998. He is a seasoned diplomat and has served in Washington DC in Brussels. He has attended a range of universities including programs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Oxford University. He has a degree in international relations to which I can think is a wonderful thing to get a degree in. And it is my honor to welcome him to the Capitol here today. Thank you so much. Good morning. Wow. What a privilege for me. I thought I'm only allowed to speak over there but now I'm standing here. So good morning Mr. Speaker, I'm seeing my House members, ladies and gentlemen. I know today is a big day because this is super Tuesday for your presidential election this year. Well, the United States, a beacon of hope and freedom, has long inspired people across the world, myself included. Today, I stand before you representing the people of Taiwan with a profound sense of a privilege as we work hand in hand to advance. Georgia House Chamber has passed resolutions supporting Taiwan for 19 consecutive years since 2006. I think we do a round of applause. And together, we commit to fostering Georgia Taiwan relations by Taiwan caucus, spending party lines and both chambers. I wish to express my deepest appreciation. Taiwan has been dedicated to democracy, manifested in our successful presidential and legislative election on January. This success is more than a local triumph. It is a testament to the standing resilience against authoritarian influences that threaten global stability. In light of a continuous provocative actions by China, both before and after our election, from the frequent military intimidation, economic coercion, diplomatic battles, to the recent unilateral change of international flight routes and forced inspection on Taiwan's domestic waters, but our domestic processes still prevailed. And this year marks the 45th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. This act was passed by US Congress back in 1979, strengthening close US Taiwan ties in security, business, education and culture. As we celebrate that what we have achieved together, this milestone also caused us to explore and test possibility for future collaboration. Nowadays, the artificial intelligence is leading the force wave of industry revolution. And the most influential leaders are from Taiwan, including the founder of TSMC, those CEOs from Navidia, Super Microcomputer and AMD, you name it. So I strongly propose a Georgia Trade Office in Taiwan, following your neighbors like South and North Carolina and others. And I really admire that Georgia has been the top state for business for 10 years in a row. Yes, go dogs. So to maintain your leading position, Taiwan stands out as an ideal collaborator. Engaging with our electric vehicle and high-tech industry, open stores to Taiwanese market and resources for Georgia, as the ongoing shifts of Taiwanese business from China to the US, accelerates the alignment of global supply chain. Therefore, I want to recognize some Taiwanese entrepreneurs with us today in the gallery. Whose contributions to Georgia are truly commendable? In sectors such as IT, auto and airline industry, shipping and logistics, chain restaurants like flying biscuits and more. So please stand up to receive our recognize. Furthermore, I advocate in education cooperation with Taiwan. As other South Eastern states like Kentucky, Alabama and South Carolina have done, focusing on the promotion of rendering English teachers and student exchanges. This will better educate our next generation to be global citizens. I also like to recognize those leaders of a Chinese language schools, upgraded by Taiwanese community in Georgia. Please stand up, please. So once again, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for the enduring relationship between Taiwan and peach state because of you. I look forward to a continue cooperation ensuring that Taiwan people always keep Georgia on their minds. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Director. Thank you, members. Thank you, Georgia House, for our continuing great relationship with Taiwan. We have another invite resolution. Representative Mathis, and our community supervision officer. Mr. Clerk, will you suspend just for a minute? Thank you, members. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 1094-1094? House Resolution 1094 by Representative Mathis, the 149th, of Resolution, recognizing and commending community supervision officer Christopher Burke, the Department of Community Supervision 2023 Officer of the Year. We're representing Danny Mathis as recognized to speak to the resolution representing Mathis. Thank you, Mr. Baker. Thank you, members of the House. It was a great honor of mine to honor Mr. Christopher Burke, the Community Supervision Officer of the Year for the Department of Community Supervision. Officer Burke is joined here by his beautiful wife, Connie DCS, Commissioner Michael Nail, and Representative Mac Jackson, who retired Department of Community Service Probation Officer that had a little hand in training some of these folks, Mr. Speaker. So I'm glad he's up here with us today. The Birx was out in Twizz County, which is in my district. Officer Burke has served the state for 38 years and is currently a mental health officer and mental judicial circuit. Officer Burke goes above and beyond to protect his community and his dedication for helping those whose supervision is an example for his fellow officers. I thank you so much, Chris, for being here. If you'd like to say a few words, you can't at this time. I would like to just thank the State of Georgia for allowing me the opportunity to serve the great State of Georgia. I would like to thank my agency for letting me work with them. I'd like to thank Mr. Dell for his recognition of me. I'd like to thank my supervisors for putting me up for this recognition today and God bless the State of Georgia. Congratulations. We're going to take a photo right there, Commissioner. Thank you for what you do. And this is a very important agency for the people of our state. We appreciate your mission and we appreciate the hard work and cooperation. And this house continues to stay in with you and work with you. So thank you for being here. CANUT Members will come to the floor. We're moving on to the rules calendar. Moving on to the rules calendar, Mr. Clerk, we're hearing the caption to SB 332-332. Senate Bill 332 by Senator Roberts in the 29th, Kennedy the 18th, Gucci the 51st, hatch of the 50th and others, to be entitled back to amend code section 15, 1832. The official bill to George annotated, relating to the prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission, authority, membership, export, take communications, governance, disciplinary actions, and confidentiality. This bill I've referred to the committee on Judiciary, non-civil that committee recommends the dis bill do pass. Representative Gullet, are you ready? Representative Gullet is recognized to present the bill. Members, thank you, thank you, Speaker. We've talked about this issue numerous times. I bet if we added up, we're probably over 10 hours of debate about this issue. Here on the House floor. SB 332, as I'm sure you all remember SB 92, laid the groundwork by establishing the prosecuting attorneys' qualifications commission. And like I told you last time, I'm pleased to report that the commission, the investigative panel, the hearing panel members are all in place, the standards and rules are established, and that commission is poised for action. And once this bill's passed, this commission will be able to begin their real work. That is, bring accountability to those rogue prosecuting attorneys, who abuse their office, sexually arrest their employees, and do not show up for work. That's reaffirming our states. Reaffirming that our state's prosecuting attorneys will have the highest ethical standards to ensure that those in power in prosecuting cases are not above the law, but rather will uphold the law impartially and justly. And for many of you in this body, this commission will give you the confidence that each criminal case will be reviewed on its own merits rather than dismissed by a written memo that informs the public of specific laws that would not be enforced in areas of the state. Back in November of last year, the State Supreme Court declined to review the rules for the investigative and hearing panels, which has stalled out the ability of the commission to review complaints. So to address this issue, we have removed the requirement that the standards and rules of the commission be reviewed and adopted by the Supreme Court. In the bill that's on 16 and 17. That's identical to what we did in the previous bill, House Bill 881, that was passed just a few weeks ago. Colleagues, this commission needs to get to work. We've legislated, we've created it, that's passed. I'm sure the arguments you're here today is not about what this legislation is doing, but about the commission as a whole. To me, the commission is settled, it's there, it's established, it's ready to work. This come together, this past this bill, this led the commission to do their work. And like we've said before, this is not a Republican Democrat issue. It's a Republican and Democrat issue. There are prosecutors across the state, both Republican and Democrat, who have let their constituents down. They represent the state, and since we legislate for the state, we are addressing that issue that our constituents have asked. Again, Republican and Democrat. Even so much so, I know we've had debate before talking about issues of the past that they weren't addressed. I can't say I was here to address those issues because I wasn't. But now that I'm here, I'm here to address those issues. We're going to have prosecutors in the state enforcing the law. We're going to have prosecutors in the state looking at each the law on a case by case basis. That's all we can ask them to do. Mr. Speaker, I know it's been heavily debated many, many hours on this floor. And so with that, I'll move us along and answer any questions and get out of this well. Someone has a couple of questions. If you yield, I will. Representative Bernal to your left has a question. Representative Bernal. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman yield. I have two questions. First one, can you give me what your definition of rogue is related to prosecutors? Yeah, rogue or the ones that are not abiding by the law. They believe they're outside the law, not abiding by the law. Okay. Thank you. I do. What is the percentage of prosecutors that are rogue based on your definition that are not following the law that we would have to have the distillation and have a commission to monitor them? So I think throughout the time, members of your party have actually dropped bills in the past to create a legislative prosecutor oversight commission. So at that time, I believe that you guys believe that they're rogue prosecutors. I believe Glenn County was a rogue prosecutor not doing what she should be doing at the time during the Montaubery days. That's a rogue prosecutor. I believe my county, Paulton County, we had a district attorney repeatedly sexually arresting members of his staff. This is what this is what it's to address. This is to address Glenn County. This is to address Athens-Cart County when you have a district attorney writing a day when memo is saying I'm not going to prosecute these cases, posting it on the wall to the members of the community. That's a problem. That's a rogue in my mind. Will you yell for one more question? Third question, I will. Okay. I noticed that you're giving our party credit. However, the bill that Ripson to Scott had at that time for Montaubery never received a hearing. So while you're telling that we believe that, yes, we probably did at that time. However, we were not given an opportunity to legislate our bill. So my response would be...

Was there a problem during the Montaubri? I think we can all agree. Glen County was a problem. Montaubri issue was a problem. And so for members to sit here and say, well, it's not a problem. That problem can still exist. We didn't change anything. How can that problem not exist? This will address that problem for happening in the future. And so I believe that that's what you guys wanted and that's what we're doing now. So thank you for the question. Gentlemen, yield. I do. We'll park to your left. That's a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentlemen yield? I do. I appreciate your mention of this being a bipartisan issue. Is it not true that there were multiple opportunities to amend this bill and improve upon the existing commission by ensuring that there would either be bipartisan oversight or nonpartisan oversight? I think there's plenty of opportunities to all kinds of things, but I will say that the bill that Democrats have dropped three times didn't do that. And so now all of a sudden that's a problem for you guys. That's an interesting perspective. Does gentlemen yield? Is it not true that you just said in your previous remarks that you're going to be talking to this specific bill? And so we're not debating previous pieces of legislation regarding this issue, but this bill with that we have in front of us. Sure, let's talk about it. Let's talk about striking the Supreme Court piece out of it. Sure. And again, is it not true that there were multiple opportunities to ensure that there was bipartisan or nonpartisan oversight to alleviate concerns that this mechanism is being used for hyperpartisan purposes as we've seen after it was enacted last year? I would say there's plenty of opportunity to always amend the bill, but what I will say is you guys had three bills to do this. And none of those did what you're asking me to do now. That's interesting take on it. So I appreciate the question. Thank you. Sure. I'll take one more. Here we have dueling whips. Whip Birchett is recognized for question. Does it gentlemen yield? I do. Thank you for bringing the bill. I just want to bring us back home to the four corners of the document. Does your bill constitute a commission? No, the commission is already creating. All right. Does your bill set up a nonpartisan or bipartisan or any type of commission? Already created. Very good. And as I read your bill to one page bill and it only does one thing and it strikes some language on 16 and 17 that would require the Supreme Court to review the rules before they come effective. Is that true? 100% true. All right. And is it not true as you alluded to? Is justice blind? Justice should be blind. Absolutely. Justice should be blind. One more question, Mr. Speaker. If it's a good idea in 2020, then it would be a good idea in 2021 and 22 and 23. Would you agree with that? 100%. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I know we've debated it a long time. I'm sure there's plenty of speakers to talk about the bill and maybe I have an opportunity to come and wrap things up. But I urge your favorable consideration. This is something that the commission is there. It's working. It's ready to work. Let's let them do their work. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. General Geo to the well. He is very wise. We do have other speakers on the bill. And the wisdom of the rules committee pursuant to House rule 33.3. We have limited to debate to one hour and 40 minutes, 30 minutes of those opposed, 30 minutes in favor, 20 minutes for minority report and 20 minutes for the chair's time. So at this time, chair will recognize representing Stacey Evans to speak to the bill. Representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, colleagues. I rise again in opposition to the idea and specifically Senate Bill 332. And while there's not a lot I can share today that hasn't been shared already, I didn't want to break my perfect streak of taking up every opportunity there is to speak against this idea and specifically Senate Bill 332. But before I do, a friend and colleague this morning handed me a little encouragement. And I thought some of my friends in this chamber would appreciate. God grant me the courage not to give up on what I think is right, even though I think it is hopeless. I rise to a post in a bill 332. And for those of you that are considering a yes vote or who have already decided that you will be voting yes, my simple message to you is, are you sure? Are you sure? Are you really sure? And this is inspired by a visitor I have with me today. She's going to kill me. But my daughter Ashley is here with me today. She is on spring break. So we don't get the beach, but she gets the capital. And she will tell you that that is the word if you were to ask her what does my mom say? Are you sure? Ashley get your jacket. I don't need a jacket. Are you sure? Ashley, are you hungry? Do you want to get a snack? No, I'm fine. Are you sure? Do we need to go by this store? No, mom, it's fine. Are you sure? Are you sure? And I know that we've heard this morning. This is not about creating the commission, the commission is already created. But right now, without rules, there is no commission. So yes, maybe somewhere in code, just like a lot of things, there are some words that create a commission. But it cannot work unless you say yes to send it bill 332 and the governor ultimately puts his signature on it. So yes, I understand that the basics of the commission are in code, but they do not work. So yes, we are ladies and gentlemen, creating a commission. And so I ask you, are you sure? Because really what we're doing is creating a mechanism for those district attorneys who are already very watched. We've talked about this, watched by judges, watched by the voters, watched by the state bar because they're all lawyers. They're already watched. They're already going to be called to account. But this body now wants to also watch them in case we in our infinite wisdom and all our prosecutorial experience in this room, which I would guess is very little. In case we want to question the priorities of the district attorney. And so are you sure? Because right now the district attorneys that you may want to bring in front of the commission because you don't agree with their priorities. Tomorrow, they will be different district attorneys and there will be a different group of folks in charge in here who might disagree with those priorities and might want to bring those already watched district attorneys before an oversight commission. So I just ask you, are you sure? Because the little encouragement that I read to you, God granting me courage not to give up on what I think is right even though I think it is hopeless, will not always be true for those with a deep aside their name. And I know it may be a little while, but y'all know it's going to happen. It just is. So are you sure? The last thing I'll say is we are, yes, here today if we pass this bill creating an oversight commission and we are creating an oversight commission with no oversight. We thought or those that voted for this idea last time around thought that it was important that the standards and rules for the commission be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court didn't disagree that perhaps there should be oversight of this commission, this unelected commission to oversee elected district attorneys, but they said we can't do it because separation of powers. That bothers at least one branch of the government. It may not bother this one. They said we can't do it, but they didn't say no one should. They didn't say no one else could. We could have the writers of this bill could have said, okay, so the Supreme Court can't oversee the rules and procedures, but how about the state bar or how about pack? There's any number of checks that we could have put in place, but instead of, I guess, taking another risk that there might be a neutral fair body like the state bar or pack that might have created rules that we didn't like, we just said no rules. I'm not sure that is the right message to be sending to the state of Georgia, and I definitely do not think it is good policy. And so I urge you to think again, are you sure? And please vote no on Senate Bill 332. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Ladies yielded the will. Representative Scott Reeves is Matt Reeves, I'm sorry. Yeah, that's Scott Hilton. Representative Matt Reeves over here is recognized to speak to the bill. He did have to chaplain of the day today, and he was on my mind. Representative Matt Reeves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've been called much worse. You have Senate Bill 332, the prosecuting attorney oversight council's rules, adoptions, one of the shortest bills you're going to vote on this session. There are 19 words that are changed from the last version that you voted upon. It's been carefully vetted by the House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee. And it says once again that no one is above the law when it comes to prosecution in Georgia. Previously, we've looked at the fact that in Florida, the governor removes prosecutors that happen recently in the courts upheld that. That's not what Georgia is doing here. We have a process that we are enacting that is similar to our Judicial Qualifications Commission, which has worked well. We also have impeachment. That is not something that would be attractive to do, and it hasn't been done in many decades. In previous hearings on this subject, some people said, let the state bar of Georgia handle it yet. The state bar responded. They're just not equipped to handle situations like this of prosecutors who are saying they are not going to prosecute entire sections of the Georgia code. Since we discussed this issue last, we are all very familiar with the tragedy and Athens and many other terrible crimes that are happening in areas where there have been deliberate decisions to ignore entire sections of the Georgia code. It's high time to act now to do the final step in implementing this prosecutorial oversight commission to scrutinize flagrant dereliction of duties by rogue prosecutors. There was a good question earlier about how many is it? We've got about 50 DAs in Georgia, 50 circuits. They're only a handful or less who are saying I'm choosing not to handle entire sections of the code. This would be a narrow and limited focus of this bill. In Georgia, we can't afford to have any judicial circuits that are not enforcing the law for the sake of public safety. People deserve to be safe in their homes and neighborhoods, to be safe in their businesses, to be safe out in public parks and their communities. This prosecutorial oversight commission and the rules that we are adopted today through this 19-word change will do just that and provide checks and balances and accountability when you have DAs who decide to go soft on crime for partisan reasons. We need to have professional and nonpartisan DAs who are enforcing the law for the sake of public safety and not being soft on crime in entire areas of the Georgia code. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield the well. Gentlemen, yielded the well. Representative Yolton was smiling when I got him mixed up with you, so I was half wrong anyway. I will leave it at that. Representative Houston Gaines has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know we've already heard from several that have emphasized how many times we've debated this issue and like Representative Evans, I think I've felt obligated to come back up and present one more time to discuss the importance of this issue. Because it is time to put the debate to rest. Because our constituents are desperate for a path to hold district attorneys who aren't doing their jobs accountable. Our constituents can't wait any longer. Every time I've been before you on this topic, I've had new information to report about my district attorney and the Western judicial circuit. Last time I talked about victims, families, how I've had the chance to visit with multiple parents of young people who have been tragically killed in our community whose those families have not been able to get justice for their loved ones. Certainly over the last couple of weeks with the tragedy that happened to Lake and Riley in our community, that's highlighted our district attorneys issues in that office nationally. And we also have seen some of her decisions that she said on day one in her first first day memo, you've heard a little reference to that. But in particular, related to the Lake and Riley case on day one, our district attorney said she would never seek the death penalty. On day one, our district attorney said that when charging individuals who are here illegally that she would take into account the collateral consequences to undocumented defendants, those sort of statements and policies are unacceptable. I'm glad that in that particular case that the DA has allowed the prosecuting attorney's counsel to handle the case and Sheila Ross who will be prosecuting it as I understand as an individual who is more than ready to take on this case. But it shows that even Gonzalez knows she wasn't up for this task when she has to outsource this case to the prosecuting attorney's counsel. The reality is the office has routinely failed to convict violent criminals. In fact, Debra Gonzalez, this is an amazing statistic. Debra Gonzalez's district attorney has lost every single case she's personally tried zero. She's one zero cases as DA that she's personally tried. That includes murder and rape cases in our community. She's lost every single one, every single one. I'll give you just some new information because we've debated this. I've talked about my DA multiple times up here, but some information that came out last week and some new details that I think are important just to show you the lack of justice that's being seen in the western judicial circuit. There was a case last year that Debra Gonzalez dropped against an individual who had raped a 14 year old. She dropped this case. It was the first time in our state's history there had been a violation of Marcy's law. First time in state history where a district attorney had failed to uphold what we passed several years ago and Marcy's law to ensure victims of crime have their day to be heard in court. Debra Gonzalez dropped that case against somebody who again raped a 14 year old. Fortunately that case was able to be re-indicted by another district attorney Randy McGinley who represents Walton County just next door. McGinley took the case to trial, four day trial. Got a jury verdict within 45 minutes. Within 45 minutes, guilty on all counts, a life sentence plus 50 years for rape and multiple other charges. This was somebody that Debra Gonzalez had dismissed those charges just a year ago and thanked goodness for Randy McGinley to come in and prosecute the case. But how many other victims cases have not been reopened? How many other victims cases won't be prosecuted? How many victims of crime won't see their day to have justice in court? Because you have district attorneys like Debra Gonzalez who have no clue how to do their job or failing victims across this state. And that's what SB332 will address by getting the prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission up and running immediately. And as soon as this body passes the day, it has the governor's desk. And I'm very thankful for Representative Golett, Senator Robertson, so many others who've worked tirelessly on this issue for years to get this bill to the governor's desk and get the commission up and running. I want to speak right for the body's favorable consideration. SB332 and I yield the well. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Jerry has none. The previous question is ordered. We'll move on now to the minority report. The public park is recognized for up to 20 minutes, Mr. Wip, to present the minority report. Wip Park. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think I have an exhibit. It's coming up now, sir. Yes. Thank you. And if you could zoom in, if it's possible, to zoom in on the highlighted section. I'll exhibit that. You'll see this is the first page of the Georgia Supreme Court's order on this prosecuting attorney's qualification commission. And I'll get to that in a minute, but I'll leave that up if that's all right. So to begin my remarks in opposition to Senate bill 332, I do want to address some of the comments made by members of the majority party. First and foremost, yes, this is a short bill, but one with dangerous implications. This is also a short and simple bill that was rammed through the legislative process on party lines, regardless of how you may, however you may want to characterize it as being well vetted in a committee process. 2. I don't think this bill provides accountability and certainly not checks and balances. If this bill actually provided checks and balances for this new commission, it would not have bypass the Georgia Supreme Court, a body of nonpartisan elected officials to approve the standards and rules that would otherwise govern this very important and powerful commission that has the ability to remove duly elected district attorneys. Now, if you want to hold, if you want to ensure that Georgians have the ability to hold district attorneys accountable, I would recommend, and certainly I think my Democratic colleagues would agree with the recommendation to stop making it more difficult for Georgians to vote. Now, further remarks of one of the speakers, I would perhaps recommend that he run for district attorney given some of the concerns that he has with his district attorney. Now, the district attorney that was mentioned by name, like all of us here in this body, will be held accountable by the people of Georgia this November. I trust Georgia voters to vote in their best interests and to vote to move this state forward without the need of a hyper partisan commission that will be controlled by Republican elected officials, any which way that you want to argue this, and certainly based on how this commission has proceeded after it was first enacted last year. There is a lot of concern with this commission from a prosecutor's perspective in which despite the challenges that they are having, despite however many arrests there may be in the state of Georgia, it's prosecutors who are needed to actually convict and put violent criminals away. There is always one or two bad apples in a barrel, but passing this bill as opposed to additional funding and additional support for our district attorneys undermines them. It demonstrates and sends a message to our district attorneys across this state that we as a legislator do not have their back, and it casts aspersions on all district attorneys, I think to the detriment of the intent of this state. There have also been concerns raised about this bill that it lacks due process for district attorneys, which I think is also part of litigation against this bill trying to strike it down as unconstitutional. Let's be clear on this bill. Each state representative that votes in favor of SB332 is voting to allow unelected partisan agents to oversee and obstruct decisions handed down by district attorneys that have prosecutorial discretion. District attorneys are duly elected by the Georgia voters they represent, and this bill will undo and undermine the will of Georgia voters. So again, this is a partisan attempt to control and discipline prosecutors who hand down decisions that politicians, Republican politicians, do not like. This bill creates an unreviewable disciplinary process susceptible to abuse. Under current law, and you all can see what current law is, the Supreme Court of Georgia, a nonpartisan elected body, is supposed to review and approve the standards and rules for this new commission. It was mentioned in the rules committee by the Senate author of this bill, along with the member of the rules committee, that it was a Georgia Supreme Court that was sending a signal that this is the bill that they wanted, that they wanted to be removed from this entire process. As an exhibit, the very first page of the order from the Georgia Supreme Court, they made clear that if Georgia law, which we could do in this bill, if we mandated them to approve the draft standards and rules, they would then decide whether or not that that was constitutional. They would be obligated to comply. However, what the majority party has decided to do, instead of try to ensure some nonpartisan oversight, instead this bill, the lines struck out on line 16 and 17, would bypass the Georgia Supreme Court. By doing so, it would clear a path for partisan unelected prosecuting attorney qualifications commission to terminate district attorneys that don't align with their politics. This bill enables partisan grievance, politics, period. Members of this body, regardless of your political affiliation, we have and we should continue to do everything on our power to improve the lives of Georgians, not finding new and creative ways to protect twice impeached former president Donald Trump from criminal investigation, which is what this bill would do. Again, voting for this bill is voting to allow unelected partisan agents to oversee and obstruct decisions handed down by district attorneys that were duly elected by Georgia voters. This is unfortunate and unacceptable. This bill undermines the voices of Georgians by targeting district attorneys again based on political affiliation. I think again, to get a clear example of the purpose of this mechanism, especially for members of the public who are watching this debate. What were the first actions taken when this commission was passed? Within hours of this commission being signed into law, a partisan member of the majority party on the Senate side who has the ability to appoint people to this commission filed a complaint against district attorney Fahni Willis. As far as I can tell, the only crime that district attorney Fahni Willis has committed is her effectiveness and competence as a black woman trying to uphold the laws in Fountain County and the state of Georgia. Again, this is a bad piece of legislation. It undermines the will of Georgia voters. It creates mistrust, distrust, and prosecutors across the state of Georgia. It does not have due process for district attorneys who are subject to the provisions of this bill. It is more likely that not if this bill passes and is signed into law, it will be used to again undermine the ongoing criminal prosecution of twice impeached President Donald Trump. For all those reasons, I urge members in this body on both sides of the aisle to vote no to SB332. With that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. Chairman Tyler Paul Smith has recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to yield a portion of my time to the majority later representative of the administration. Leader, ifstration is recognized to speak to the bill. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Chairman Smith, for yielding some of your time to meet us speak on this issue. I believe several of the members who have been in the well recently said that they've spoke on all the previous times when this issue has been before the House. And I will just tell you, I was not one of the speakers when this issue was before us earlier this session. You know, I have sat there and really been shocked by the blatant politicization, the blatant partisanship that we seem from Democrats on this issue to obscure us from the truth to try to prevent members of this House from truly knowing the history that's brought us to this point. And I think that that's unfortunate, and it's time we set the record straight. This issue came about back in 2020. You know, at the time the Georgia House had led passing the Haycrimes Law. We passed a bill that went over to the Senate and it sat. We came back for the 2020 legislative session. I remember because I was a sponsor, was asking the Senate to vote our bill, and then we had the pandemic hit in mid March. And we broke. We took all that time off. And it was while we were out of session due to the pandemic that that horrific video of a mod Arbery's murder was made public. And we all saw it in media reports. We were shocked. We were disgusted. We wanted to take action. And I remember at that time when we were in recess due to the pandemic having a call with a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights. A lawyer here who had bipartisan respect and who cared about civil justice issues, criminal justice issues here in the state capital. And we discussed the pending Haycrimes bill. And we discussed that that did not go far enough to address the horrors that we had seen on the...

fought our worry, video. And what we concluded on that call was that number one, we needed to pass the hate crimes bill. Number two, Georgia needed to be the first state in the nation to repeal the citizens of arrest law. And number three, we needed a prosecutor oversight bill. There's those three things we agreed upon. It shocks me that there has been such a distortion of this issue by Democrats that have obscured the truth here, which is that this was a bipartisan legislative agenda to ensure that all Georgians felt that they could rely on the justice system. And an acknowledgement that as we all talk about the rule of law, the importance of the rule of law, that extends to the enforcement of that law. You cannot have prosecutors setting their own rules, setting their own standards, taking what we do here at the state capitol laws that we pass, thrown them out ignoring them, or even worse, in cases of corruption or incompetence, not doing their job and harming Georgia's citizens. So what did we do? This House and the General Assembly followed that path, that bipartisan path. And I would love to see media coverage talking about this history, because it's well known that this is what occurred. The General Assembly passed a hate crimes bill in 2020, as soon as we got back in the summertime. The next session, 2021, Representative Burt Reaves, as a floor leader, introduced a bill to repeal citizens' arrest. And yes, Georgia became the first state of 50 states to repeal citizens' arrest. Following that bipartisan agenda to get that done. And it is true, as has been mentioned, Representative William Bodie, who served as whip of the minority caucus, introduced a bill, House Bill 441, I'm sorry, House Bill 143 in 2021, which would have created a DA oversight commission. Now, to say, well, that bill didn't get a hearing or that bill didn't move, is really bordering on disingenuous. If you consider that the House was passing a repeal of the citizens' arrest law at the time, and the legislation is introduced, only would have regulated DAs, not mentioning solicitors, and only had a half solution to this very complex problem. To say that, oh, well, that was different, that bill was different. Yeah, that bill was incomplete. And it just so happened that in 2122, Representative Joseph Gullet had a real problem with the DA in his judicial circuit. A DA who had been accused of sexual harassment within the office, and concerns, as he detailed in his presentation today and previously, concerns that nothing could be done about it. Because unless an indictment could be sought, and the procedure followed to remove an elected DA from office, that there was no remedy for the residents of the judicial circuit. What are they to do? Speaker just today said, well, that's what elections are for. Oh, great. So you have to live under a corrupt or incompetent DA until the next election rolls around. Just crimes are not going to be prosecuted, or that office, which is an incredibly powerful office, is going to be used for an illegal means until the next election. That's not a solution. That's obscuring this issue. That's preventing this house from getting to the truth of the matter here, which is this is necessary. Just as we have a JQC for judges, if you have elected DAs or solicitors who are using their office for improper purposes, they need to be out. And there needs to be a process to see that through. And claiming, oh well, the state bar should take that over. That's not the function of the state bar of Georgia, first of all. And secondly, with the amount of time required for an overview by an unelected body, that is not a legitimate solution to put forward. The state bar does not disbar individuals for acting in their prosecutorial capacity or failing to act in their prosecutorial capacity. Lawyers in this room know that. To talk about impeachment. So what there's going to be a special session called because a DA is acting improperly illegally in office when a commission would be a much better means to investigate the allegations, get to the bottom of what's going on, and have the ability to remove. I submit to you that the way this narrative has taken such an unbelievable turn is unfortunate because this house has a history of coming together to stand up to do the right thing. And we showed that with hate crimes, we showed that with a repeal of citizens arrest, and then suddenly this issue appears, and it's become blatantly political by Democrats. And that is unfortunate. I mean, just today, a member who's my good friend, who we serve in the same Gwinnett County, as members of the Gwinnett County delegation said here, that this has to do with some specific case, that this has to do with elections. Nothing could be further from the truth. You want to know the history here. Look at the legislative website. Representative Gullett had legislation on this years ago that he was working to pass. This house passed legislation over to the Senate. It didn't get voted in the Senate. Back the next year to pass a bill. And this Supreme Court opinion that's been discussed, you know, one of the speakers here today said, very few members of the house have prosecutorial experience. Well, that may be true, but I do have prosecutorial experience. I served as an assistant DA in my home circuit. I prosecuted cases. I watched the elected DA work, and I understand the responsibilities and obligations that follow that important office. I also know the importance to the citizens of the judicial circuit, because I've looked crime victims in the eyes. I've seen how they're depending on the prosecuting attorney to see the case through, to do so fairly and effectively, to advance the principles of justice, and to ensure that criminal laws and Georgia are enforced. And for years, the discussion debate had been around, well, for years there was no discussion, certainly in my mind, that as a prosecutorial attorney was a member of the judicial branch. And this opinion that's been cited to here today has asked us to review that effectively, to bring this issue back in a different form, so that there's no ambiguity about that. And that's exactly what Senate Bill 332 was doing here today. We're removing that ambiguity, so that this commission can begin to act, can begin to work to serve Georgians. Let's put the politics aside. Let's end the blatant partisanship, the divisiveness, that's unnecessary, and is not in keeping with the traditions of this house. Let's stand up for all Georgians here today, not make this a political issue because it isn't. And let's ensure that Georgians know that if their prosecuting attorneys are not doing their jobs, are not following the law, are putting themselves above the law, are failing to meet the standards that are required of the chief law enforcement officer within a circuit, that they can be held accountable. Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as you did well, Chairman Smith for the remainder of the chairman's time is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to everybody who's been here listening on this debate. Thank you to the members of the opposition of this bill. And Mr. Speaker had a curse to me. This is an election year, if you couldn't tell from downstairs, but that being so, I wanna direct everybody's attention to paragraph two of section two of our state's constitution. If you got your little booklet there, it should be on page five. Origin and structure government, read all of it, but I wanna point out to you paragraph two, the object of government. I'll read it as far as the people of this state have then heard right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people. And at all times, they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it. Mr. Speaker, I was taught that you don't give air or light to debacles that go on in this state. I'm not going to dress what's going on across the road because I truly believe that it does not have anything to do with what we have here. I see this in my practice as a criminal defense lawyer. And my advocacy in protecting people's bill of rights, unfortunately, in some parts of the state, I have to have prepared what is called a batson motion. Batson versus Kentucky. That is dealing with racial discrimination and jury composition. I have to have that ready because although they may be all the well too careful and not admitting to racial discrimination and jury selection, you see the results of it. I have to have that ready to go. So just take that out of your mind that this has anything to do about race. The composition of this commission that we have created gives us the appointments to the commission by the Speaker Lieutenant Governor and the Governor. That is a Republican form of government that has been with us since the institution of our Constitution here in the United States as a whole. We model our same Constitution after that very principle. I will point out if you're so concerned about being bipartisan with this, if you're so concerned about it, it's not just about what's going on in Athens, it's not just what's going on in Atlanta, it's not what's just going on in Clean County or what's going on over in Columbus. We have prosecutors that are not taking advantage of the felony murder statute to go after those who are selling fentanyl that are killing our citizens. Why have you not got aggravated about that yet? This process does not circumvent our impeachment processes. It's interesting that I've heard impeachment mentioned before with the party of Jackson evidently just G Han with his whole impeachment deal. Why have none of you introduced these articles? And so that would be what I would challenge all of y'all. If you so bent on supporting that part of our Constitution, which many of us do too, why won't you come and help us? This commission and this legislation specifically is in response to that Supreme Court decision dated November 22nd of 2023. Yes, there was a lot of excess language in there according to laypeople, but if you truly read it, it mentions that they do not have the power to authorize these rules. This is a power that is given by statute to this commission under the executive branch of government. And so I would implore each and every one of you to read what the bill actually does. I've been a little surprised at how long this debate has went on with Mr. Speaker because when we passed this out of committee, there was not too much debate or discussion over it. I remember there was on the first bill, but not much with this. So Mr. Speaker, it clearly seems to me that this election year, you gotta get your sound by it in, go home, and you know, rattle your saver, I get it. But this commission and by us passing this legislation will allow us to hold disc attorneys across this state accountable for their actions, accountable for their actions and not prosecuting those that deal fentanyl and kill our citizens, those that don't seek murder charges against killers and those that just simply because they think due to their education wherever they went, that they buy in that, oh, we shouldn't prosecute this law. Well, you know what, that's not your determination to make. This General Assembly passes laws each and every year for again, when I will read to you, which is what is the object of government for the good order of this state, for the welfare of this state. This commission going forward will help ensure that our legislative aims are carried out and that the law and justice is served in our state. With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask this body's considerable consideration and yes vote on Senate Bill 332. Thank you. I yield well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well that completes our minority report and our chairman's time is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the past of the bill. Chair, his none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes, all those opposed, we'll vote no in the clerk, we'll unlock the machine. We'll vote it. For what purpose is representing Brnail, rise? Parliament's your inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that we should be referred to as representatives and not you guys? I think we are representatives I didn't hear the you guys, but I don't hear at all. For what purpose is will park rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry sir. Is it not true that while understanding legislative history is important that actions speak louder than words and the actions taken by Republicans may clear how this commission is being weaponized for partisan purposes? I'm sure that's a general's opinion. For what purpose is will perchett rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it true the Georgia Constitution is the highest law on the land here in Georgia? I think that's widely held to be true. Further, further Parliamentary inquiry. State that inquiry. Is it true in section eight paragraph two, the words of our Constitution say as it pertains to district attorneys, discipline removal and involuntary retirement of district attorneys, any district attorney maybe discipline removed or voluntary retired as provided by general law? And isn't this a general law? I think the gentleman is well read and knows of what he speaks. For what purpose is representative Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry sir. Is it not true that some of the speakers indicated that we need this bill because of the speed in which we can remove rogue prosecutors? However, is it not further true that in appeals court judge in March of 2020 was accused of malpractice and it took until 2023 before they removed which seems like you might have had an election in between then that this bill does not speed up the process that can just cause contention among this body. I'm sure the gentleman believes what he speaks for what purpose is representative Townsend rise? Parliamentary inter-environment, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the DA in Glen County actually supports this bill and has testified previously in support of this bill? Yes, I'm sure the gentleman is accurate for what he speaks. For what purpose is representative Kelly? Trade Kelly rise? Permit your inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry sir. Mr. Speaker, is it true that while we've had reference to the state bar having the ability to disarm disert attorneys, I'm not aware of the state bar ever taking a disciplinary action against the disert attorney? As a learned member of that profession, I'm sure you watch that closely and know of what you speak. For what purpose is representative Howard rise? Parliamentary inter-inquiry. State your inquiry sir. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that there are Republican and Democratic-Lenin district attorneys opposing this bill? I'm sure there's a lot of leaning out there representative and I'm sure you've heard some of that. Have all members out voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 332. The yeas are 97, the nays are 73. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 375? 375? Senate Bill 375 by Senator Strickland and 17 Jackson, the 41st compatriot of the 32nd and others, be taught on act to amend code section 3724. The defense go to George Anitetti relating to behavior health coordinating council, membership meetings and obligations. This bill I refer to the committee and public and community health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Mr. Clerk, thank you for correcting my speech. I forgot that Senate was working over there the last week or so so they have passed a couple of bills. Senate Bill 375, my apologies members. Representative Washman is recognized to present Senate Bill 375. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I come to the well to present Senate Bill 375 of Senator Strickland of the 17th. This is a simple bill. It adds the commissioner of veteran service to the behavioral health coordinating council. The only other changes are that it changes the reference to the lieutenant governor to president of the Senate in two places. That is the bill must speak out, you have any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, our area is your favorable consideration of this bill and I yield well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair, here's none. Report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate bill 375, the yeas are 167. The nays are 0. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will ye read the caption to Senate bill 443-443? Senate bill 443 by Senator Watson. The first trick on the 17th tiller, the 19th, and others to be entitled to amend chapter 2, title 41 of the fish go to George Anons, and to relay an in-bate of new systems generally. This bill is also required for inclusion of claims against promoters and organizers for costs incurred by local governments. This bill I refer to the committee on Judiciary Non-Civil Act Committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Representative Petrie is recognized to present Senate bill 443. Representative Petrie. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Bring you Senate bill today, 443. Senator Ben Watson, my senator. And this bill very simply addresses a recurring problem in certain jurisdictions where individuals promote and organize unpermitted events in local jurisdictions and create public nuisances which require an expense of burden on local government and providing public safety, supplemental law enforcement, sanitation, traffic control, fire services, EMT, paramedic services, all of these things. When they circumvent the permitted process, the permitted process is there. They choose not to do that. These are similar to some of the issues we dealt with with the drag racing, where it was organizers and promoters of unpermitted events were bringing these together. And so similarly that bill, we're creating here an opportunity for this bill simply allows local governing authority to file a public nuisance claim against those promoters and organizers to recover the expenses incurred by them associated with all of those public safety costs. The hope is that all groups will simply seek a permit as most do. Encourage them to go through the permitted process so that local government can ensure that all the public safety preparations are made in advance. Mr. Speaker, that very simply is what this measure does. I'm glad to answer a question or so if necessary. General, we have a couple of questions for you. Yes, sir. I yield. Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I yield. So do you explain to me why local government couldn't already do this? I'm just curious as to why. Yes, yes. Thank you, Representative. Good question. So right now there is a claim for individuals. Individuals have a path. But local government does not have a path and that's what this bill creates. It's a path for a representative local government to seek damages civilly through this public nuisance complaint. Thank you. Thank you for the good question. Representative Angela Moore to your left has a question for the gentleman who will yield. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I yield. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield. In your bill is there a certain size because there's a size of an organization or is it all organizations? No, yes, ma'am. So the size of the event isn't mentioned because again, different municipalities have different capacity. They have different room. They have different space. They have different resources. So if someone chooses to seek to have an event in an unpermitted fashion, I think it depends on the, this is all about the burden that it creates for that particular locality. But it doesn't relate to the size in the aggregate. So if the parents wanted to sell jelly or jammed for a school to raise money for uniforms and it's a very small event, they'd have to pull a... No, ma'am. No. That's not what's... That would be an event. We're dealing here with... Remember, the statute is around public nuisances. So it has to be... You're talking about a situation that creates a real burden on traffic control, on public say, all the things I mentioned before law enforcement where they have to hire ancillary enforcement. We've had some events that we had to fly Narcan in from other because they couldn't get to sites because of the traffic congestion for overdoses. Things of this nature, there's a lot of public safety concerns and that's what we're talking about here, not reasonable appropriate events that happen all day every day. But it does the bill... But thank you for the good question. Does the bill explain what reasonable and appropriate is? The bill speaks to public nuisances and there's a definition of that. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen has... Someone who would like to speak on the bill? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, you did the well. Representative Scott Hilton has recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to speak real quickly. Bring it home for us here in Atlanta. Georgia's host of one of the largest ten-kays in the world, the Peachtree Road Race. Imagine if the Peachtree Road Race promoted the event, held the event. It's about 50,000 runners and spectators, upwards of about 100,000 people. Imagine they did all that, but they didn't let the city of Atlanta know. They didn't bring the police down there. They didn't have portapoddies. They didn't have EMS. Imagine the burden that would place on our local governing authority. And so that's what this bill seeks to address. I know there is an issue in Taibe Island specifically that drew the attention of this bill. And so I think it's a good bill worthy of consideration and helps to stop off an issue that we're having in some of our local counties. So appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, geode of the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here has done? The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Miller rise. Parle men are inquiry. State you inquiry, ma'am. Mr. Speaker, with the lack of definition in this bill of organizer and promoter, is there any concern that an individual citizen who is in support of a demonstration might be targeted even though they are not considered an organizer or promoter? I would trust our public safety professionals to make that determination was a good question. For what purpose is represented? Court arise. Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't that true that the city of Stolkres has to endure extended costs because of unpermitted?

parties that have happened that they publicize months and months and events and the city has had to better burden of finding those people to shut that down. Is that not true? I'm sure the lady understands a lot of things about Stonebridge and I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks for what purpose is representative Jasmine Clark rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it not true that I wanted to clarify with the sponsor that this would not in any way harm or stop people from being able to protest in any way.
