Glory, glory to old Charger.
Here is a grace to feel before you.
Men with hearts, bodies and minds in which the entire mold of our nation can be justifiably proud.
But tradition of unbridled excellence demonstrated by these individuals and many others
Spain's more than a full century.
And now a new bringing of Mordor
of Spain's ready to take the field back
through the silver reins of the Georgia border
We continue that tradition, understanding that there is no tradition more worthy of envy,
no institution worthy of such loyalty as the University of Georgia.
As we prepare for another meeting between the Hedges,
let all the bulldog faithful rally behind the men who now wear the reddened line,
get two words, two super words, which express the relevance of the entire bulldog nation.
Welcome to legislative day one of the 2022 session, but more importantly, well,
Welcome to the National Championship Day.
When the Georgia Bulldogs tonight, before midnight,
will set everything right with the world.
And they are for convening, having arrived.
All members will please take their seats,
and the clerk will ring the bell.
I'm going to ask for unanimous consent that we dispense of the morning row call today.
Is there any objection?
Hearing none, it is so ordered.
keepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will begin our day as we do each day
with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag
of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be, our chaplain this morning will be the gentleman
from the 22nd House District, a colleague of ours,
and a friend of all of ours.
And that is Representative West Cantrell.
Representative Cantrell is finishing up eight years
here in the house and term-limited himself.
And so I wanted him to speak to us this morning
during this his final session.
We're going to miss you very much.
Representative Cantrell has been a real advocate for those,
for education reform and many other issues that he has fought for.
And he's a worthy advocate too for all of the causes.
So please make welcome the gentleman from the 22nd District Representative
West Kim Trill.
Good morning, colleagues. Happy New Year to you.
You know, the speaker faced quite a dilemma today in trying to decide who would be our
chaplain for the day.
So after much deliberation and prayer, he decided to just make the choice easy.
He decided he'd simply ask the person who he likes the most, but that person said no.
Then he decided he would simply ask the person who was the best-looking person in this chamber.
That person said no.
Then he said, I'm going to ask the smartest person in this chamber to be our speaker today.
That person said no.
called me. And I said, dog, gone at Mr. Speaker, you've called me four times now. Yes, I'll
be the chaplain today. I also find it interesting that on the very day that the University of
Georgia is playing for the National Championship in football, the speaker would ask a graduate
of the number one public college or university
in the country.
The Institute of Technology,
Georgia Institute of Technology, to be the chaplain.
But all joking aside, we are very blessed here in Georgia
to have two great institutes of higher learning
in tech and in Georgia.
So in light of that, and in display
of a great of unity today, I wore my red black tie,
I brought my Kirby smart visor, and I want to wish everybody a happy, hunker-down day.
And for the first time in my life, I want to say, go dogs.
So I want to read a passive scripture to us today, make some brief remarks and we'll
be done.
in the twelfth chapter of the book of Romans, the Apostle Paul,
in a very couple of brief paragraphs, sums up everything we need to know
in order to live a life of distinction, a life that truly makes a positive
difference in the challenging world in which we live. There's a there was a famous book written
many many years ago called All I Really Needed to Know I Learned in kindergarten.
And I would say about this passage of scripture, similarly today, that all we need to know
about living life successfully can be found in Romans chapter 12, so let me read it to you
verses 9 through 21. It says, don't just pretend to love others, really love them, hate what is
wrong, hold tightly to what is good. Love each other with genuine affection and take delight in
honoring each other. Never be lazy but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically. Rejoice
and our confident hope, be patient and trouble and keep on praying.
When God's people are in need, be ready to help them.
Always be eager to practice hospitality.
Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them.
Pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy
and weep with those who weep.
Live in harmony with each other. Don't be too proud
to enjoy the company of ordinary people
and don't think that you know it all.
Never pay back evil with more evil.
Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable.
Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.
Dear friends, never take revenge.
Leave that to the righteous anger of God.
For the scripture says, I will take revenge.
I will pay them back, says the Lord.
Instead, if your enemies are hungry, feed them.
If they're thirsty, give them something to drink.
And doing so, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads.
Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.
My own words of summary of this passage of scripture in order for us to live a life of distinction.
Number one, love people, disagree on policy, all you want, but always value the worth of the other person.
Hate wrong. Hold on to the good. Don't be lazy. Work hard. Be enthusiastic. Rejoice and hope. Be patient during trouble. Keep on praying. Help people in need. Welcome them into your home.
Bless those who persecute you. Be happy with those who are happy. But be ready to weep with those who are weeping.
Get along with others. Don't be proud. Don't be a know-it-all.
Live up to your title as the honorable.
I remember when I first got elected, my wife wondered who this male,
who all this male was coming to, that addressed to some guy called the honorable.
Do everything in your power to be at peace with everyone.
Don't take revenge. Go out of your way to be kind to your enemy and do good.
do good. These are simple tasks, but they're not easy. The only people I know who are
able to live like this on a consistent basis are those who have a deep and abiding faith
in Jesus. It is only as we allow him to lead us to guide us and empower us that we can
live a life of distinction as described here in Romans chapter 12. So my challenge for
each of us this year is that we all lean into our faith. And if you're not a person of faith,
I would challenge you to seriously take a look at the life of Christ and prayerfully consider
his teachings. Would you join me in prayer?
Father, we're grateful for a new day, for a day of beginnings. And Lord, I pray that you would
would give us all great wisdom, courage, and the strength
to live a life of distinction.
And I pray that we would treat each other
with great kindness, be very forgiving,
quick to forgive, be eager to listen and slow to speak.
And so we give this 2022 session to you,
ask you to use it in whatever way
what honor you the most, and we pray all this
in Jesus' name, amen.
Would you join me in the pledge?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, the indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
I want to commend Representative Cantrell.
I've been known to walk out on preachers before, and I do it again this morning if you went
too long.
