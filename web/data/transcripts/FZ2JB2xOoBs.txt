Good morning.
Thank you, Christiane Holmes.
Thank you for blessing us with your incredible voice and for being part of today's program.
Thank you as always to Governor Kim and First Lady Kim, our Lieutenant Governor,
Bert Jones, legislators of the Georgia General Assembly, to the presidents and leaders of our
HBCU colleges in Georgia represented here today, and to the many students and graduates of Georgia's
HBCUs. My name is Senator Somia Halper, and I am honored to welcome you to the beautiful
Georgia State Capitol as we convene for our third annual HBCU Heritage Day. Thank you
again Governor Kemp and First Lady Kemp for joining us here today and once again presenting
this celebration in partnership with my office. Thank you. So today we salute Georgia's
10 historically black colleges and universities, better known as HBCUs. Our University System
of Georgia institutions, Albany State University,
Port Valley State University, and Savannah State University,
and our private institutions, Clark Atlanta University,
the Inter-Denominational Theological Center,
Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine,
Morris Brown College, Pain College, and Spellman College.
I said the names out loud because they represent
the best of our countries, 103 HBCUs.
As the 8th largest state in the country and home to 10 HBCUs, Georgia is the model state
for higher education excellence and has the opportunity to set the bar forever on the
national stage.
Today, I am calling for us to create and launch the first state-level version of a White
House HBCU initiative.
I'm a proposing an HBCU Georgia HBCU initiative led out of this building to create sustainable
public-private and philanthropic partnerships as well as private sector initiatives to
promote centers of academic research and program excellence at Georgia's HBCUs.
I call also on my colleagues to create the first-ever Senate HBCU internship program.
That's host an annual meeting with the HBCU Alumni Associations for all HBCUs with
chapters here in Georgia, the more the better when it comes to excellence.
These esteemed institutions have shaped and graduated young people who become leaders
in academia, business, sports, arts, civic, and faith community.
And let's not forget that here in Georgia, they've also contributed over $1.3 billion to
Georgia's economy annually.
We are in a better place because of the heritage of Georgia's 10 HBCUs, thank you for coming
and now we will just have a quick prayer.
Y'all called us, she said quick because I'm Baptist so I won't be before you long.
Let us bow in prayer.
Most precious Lord in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
We come to you this sacred hour now that our lives might be changed and we thank you
for your grace that keeps us day by day.
Lord, it is our prayer that you would just simply have your way.
Father, we thank you that our leadership of this state,
our governor, our First Lady, our Lieutenant Governor,
and all those presidents of the HBCUs have assembled here on today.
God, would you just continue to guide the leadership of this state
that they may have a hand on our HBCUs
so that they may grow and continue to prosper.
We ask all of these things and your most wonderful
precious name we do pray and everyone's sat together. Amen.
Now have the awesome distinct privilege to introduce our next speaker and that is President
Frinch. In 2019, George T. Frinch, Jr. became the fifth president of Clark Atlanta University,
the largest United Negro College fund member institution in the country and the largest
private HBCU within the state of Georgia. Prior to his appointment, Frinch served for 14
years as the president of mouse college making him one of the longest serving university
presidents in the nation and nationally recognized leader and influencer in higher education and
educational policy.
French has served three secondaries of education under the United States presidents as a congressional
pointee to the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity.
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please join me in a warm welcome as we receive George
Steve French, Jr., President of Clark Atlanta University, and also the President of AUC.
Thank you so much, Senator, for that introduction.
Most certainly to the Governor, Governor Kim, First Lady, Marty, to our Lieutenant Governor,
Governor Jones, First Lady of Clark Atlanta University, Dr. Bacon French, to the Secretary
state to Senator Sonia Halpern, to all constitutional officers here, to my colleague presidents,
those presidents, that the Senator named, those schools, the hardest working university
presidents in the nation right here in Georgia, give it up for my colleagues again.
You all stand up, we want to recognize you all again.
My colleagues, thank you all so much.
to have my colleague from Albany State University,
from Pain College, from Fort Valley State University,
from Morris Brown College, from the ITC,
from Fort Valley State, Savannah State University,
and representing Morehouse College.
Thank you, colleagues, for being here.
And most certainly, we have found ourselves here.
Appreciate it, Governor Kim, for your courage as being the only Republican that visited
Clark Atlanta University, and we took good care of you.
Thank you.
It is my distinct pleasure to stand very quickly before you today to thank the state of Georgia
because Senator Halpern is correct.
We have an opportunity to leave the nation in displaying partnerships in how a state can
support HBCUs economically and socially.
Why?
Because we are 20,000 strong, 20,000 of the best and brightest students that you will find
in the nation, 20,000 students that come here from all over the world.
They meet their mates, they find searchers, they find synodogs, and they remain in
contribute to our economy. The Senator was right. $1.3 billion is what we contribute annually.
We are unapologetically black excellence. That's who we are and that's what we do.
So thank you, Senator, for leading the effort on the bipartisan committee and we look forward
to establishing the first replication of the White House
initiative on HBCUs right here in Georgia,
because believe it or not, because of Trockett Lanter,
because of Morehouse, because of Savannah,
because of Fort Valley State, because of Morris Brown,
because of ITC, because of Pain, because of Albany State,
everybody in this country is saying that Georgia is on my mind.
Good morning, I'm State Representative Sandra G. Scott and I serve District 76 out of Clayton
County and as you can see I am a graduate of Florida AMM University.
Dr. Paul A. Jones.
Dr. Jones was appointed to serve as the 10th president
of Fort Valley State University in December 2015.
Before joining Fort Valley State University,
Dr. Jones served two years as the interim president
at Dartmouth State College in Albina, Georgia.
Dr. Jones served in numerous senior leadership roles
at Georgia College and State University.
He also was a professor of education
administration of Georgia College.
Dr. Jones is also a member of several boards to include,
the Medical Center of Peach County Board of Directors,
Navier Health Board, Fort Valley State University Foundation
Board of Governors, and Dr. Jones in his life
was named 2012 alumni of the year at Utah State University.
Please welcome Dr. Jones.
Good morning, Governor Lieutenant Governor Senators.
It's really a pleasure to be here this morning with you
and appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of the public HBCUs in Georgia representing
Albany State with President Mary Frederick and President Kimberly Ballet, Washington
of Savannah State University.
We appreciate you allowing us to be here today on this very special day, and we also want
to welcome all of our students that are here to date from across the state.
HBCUs have had and continued to play a vital role in our country and beyond.
In a recent U.S. University System of Georgia Economic Impact Study,
Georgia's public HBCUs had a statewide economic impact of $540 million,
and an economic employment impact of more than 5,100 jobs.
Georgia's public HBCUs represent nearly 12,000 students,
conferred annually roughly 2,500 degrees,
and importantly, nearly 80% of its students are palgrant recipients
and many more our first generation students.
This means that from a social mobility perspective,
we have an awesome task of helping students
to climb the important social ladder of success,
which not only changes their lives,
but it changes the lives of generations to come.
These state-supported institutions are diverse
and are vital to the state's economy,
located in Middle, Coastal, and South Georgia,
these institutions play a pivotal role in Georgia's healthcare,
marine science, and agricultural economies,
and so much more.
We're also proud of the number of STEM graduates
that we produce each year,
which is important to our state's economy.
An investment in these institutions
has a direct correlation to the overall impact
of the state's economy.
As Georgia's public institutions,
we rely much more so than our private counterparts
on the federal, state, and local funding.
So now is the time.
The time is now for reinvestment, not divestment.
Let's continue to uplift these institutions
that are so important to our state's economy.
Thank you again for having us here today
to celebrate and recognize the contributions
that we make to Georgia's economy.
Thank you very much.
My name is Jason Antivatar and I have the opportunity to serve as the chairman of the majority
caucus in the Senate and also represent almost 200,000 residents in West George including
Paulton County, Georgia where I live.
I want to thank Senator Halpern for bringing us here this morning as she always does and
was an honor to serve on the HBCU's study committee that she also chaired.
As we look to find ways to advance the mission of all the HBCUs in Georgia through her work.
And hopefully one day we'll be passing an HBCU bill in the Senate and the House will pass it in the governor will sign it.
It's my distinct honor to introduce to you the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Georgia.
He's a former colleague of mine in the Senate from middle Georgia.
a small business owner, he has run businesses,
started businesses.
He's played football at a university
that I won't talk about since I went to Georgia Tech.
He'll get me later, but I'm very proud of this gentleman
for the work that he's done to advance in the lives
of Georgians in the higher education, K-12,
but most importantly, to my heart,
is moving those that live in poverty,
to get them jobs and employment,
and seeing prosperity in our state
for the many decades and decades to come for my kids
and their grandkids down the road.
So without further ado,
the 13th Lieutenant Governor, Georgia, Bert Jones.
Applause.
Good morning, it is good to be with you all this morning.
I appreciate everybody coming down to the Capitol today.
I'm looking forward to the lunch I'm having later on
with the presidents of our historically blank colleges
In universities here in the state of Georgia, there's no question that the 10 public and
private institutions are, it is a long and proud and rich tradition that we have here
in the state of Georgia.
And I want you to know the state of Georgia is proud of that rich tradition.
And I appreciate Senator Hal Hopperen for all of her hard work.
I'm going to tell you, I have been down here 10 years and I've served with many colleagues
suit. Maybe had one college in mind, they might have had Fort Valley mine or Savannah State
mine or whatever, but Senator, the good senator from Atlanta here has made sure you should
give her a round of applause. She has made a strong effort in making sure that we are
partners with our colleges and universities and we want to try to do that. So I'm looking
forward to continuing the work that the senator has done and want to be a
partner with her in those initiatives that we have and it is a good day to be
in Georgia and I'm just proud to be with the governor and the first lady here
and I think you'll see that he and I are on the same page when it comes to this
issue as well so without further hesitation I'd like to introduce the senator
This made it all happen today center house
Okay, I I'm just gonna quickly introduce a man who really needs no introduction our governor Brian camp
He of course is a husband a father a businessman a public servant entrepreneur and he built his first business
Cam development and construction company and understands what hard work is
and always keeps the minds of Georgians to the forefront every day when he thinks about
the needs of this state and the direction that we need to move.
So 30 something years later, he sits as our 83rd Governor and has brought much economic
success to this state, to communities across the state of Georgia, championing us as the
number one place to do business in the country.
So with that, ladies and gentlemen, our governor, Mr. Bryant-Jackson.
Thank you very much.
Well, thank you all very much.
Thank you, Senator Halvin, for that.
And good morning, everyone.
On behalf of our great First Lady Marty Kempley,
we are honored to be here today.
And I certainly want to thank the great leaders that we have
from our HBCU for spending time with us today.
I also want to thank Lieutenant Governor Bart Jones for his steadfast support of HBCUs,
the rest of the legislators that are here this morning, particularly just want to thank
Dr. French for his leadership and also Dr. Jones for his comments earlier.
I want to also thank the members of the General Assembly that have had awards for us this
this morning, Representative Mallow and Senator Anna Vartarte, and also Representative Scott.
I appreciate somebody from Florida, A&M, being here to celebrate Georgia's HBCUs.
That says a lot about us.
But we're just so grateful for opportunities like this and are so grateful that you all
are in the capital with us today on what you can see as a very busy day and what will
be a busy couple of weeks. Some of the nation's most noted leaders graduated from our historic
Black colleges and universities right here in the great state of Georgia, both public
and private. And many of the guests here today are distinguished alumni. We are proud to
be home to some of the most renowned HBCUs in the country that have produced major figures
like Dr. Martin Luther King, Rosalyn Brewer, one of only two black female CEOs of Fortune
500 companies, legendary singer and band leader, Cab Callaway, Ralph Abernathy, whose name
is prominent throughout our capital city.
The civil rights leader James Weldon and Johnson, who famously wrote the lyrics to lift
every voice and sing.
Keisha Knight-Polium, who of course charmed all Americans as Rudy Huckstable and her other
roles in many, many more.
The students who have walked these campuses of this proud history have broken barriers
in science and engineering, in art and culture, in the very course of events of our state and
our nation.
It is important that we continue to build on that valued legacy.
In many cases, HBCUs opened the door for educational opportunity that did not exist before
as Dr. Jones just alluded to.
That is why we have made and will continue to make key investments to further the good
work of our HBCUs and other institutions.
Last year we allocated $230 million to eliminate the Special Institution fee at our public universities
and colleges, including our three HBCUs here in Georgia.
And this year I proposed an additional $61.2 million to fully fund the HOPE Scholarship
and grant awards at 100% of tuition for all public higher education in the state.
I will continue to advocate for that increase
as the budget moves forward in the process,
because it would save an average of $444
for all full-time students each year
on top of savings from no longer having to pay
the institution fee.
But even more so, fully funding hope
represents what we're talking about today,
connecting opportunity to learners
from literally all communities.
As we all know, having the right teacher
can also make a world of difference.
And that's why as part of my office's teacher pipeline
package that passed a couple of years ago,
we included a provision that requires
a professional standards commission to work closely
with HBCUs to track greater numbers
of minority teachers into the field.
Students from all backgrounds should be able to see
themselves in their teachers.
And that's what this measure does.
We also appreciate and need your students
in Georgia's workforce.
As was mentioned,
Georgia's the number one state in the country for business.
And the students that you are pumping out
in arts, entertainment, engineering,
medicine, business, and more
are vital to our future in the state.
And by working together with the leaders and students
to HBCUs represented here today and by working with local and state officials and with other
educational leaders, we will continue to celebrate and support our HBCUs because they are
important part of why Georgia remains the best place to live, work and raise a family.
So thank you again for your partnership in these efforts and also for what you're doing
to prepare the next generation of leaders in our state.
Congratulations on another successful year
and for your steadfast work.
God bless.
Well, we have come to the end of our program, but I want to remind us that it is incumbent upon
us to make sure that the legacy of HBCUs continues so that these institutions for higher
education can continue to not only make an impact on African Americans, but also on
our communities, our state, and our nation.
I do have a resolution marking today as HBCU Heritage Day,
which I will get to each of our presidents.
And separately, I have a resolution actually honoring
each of you for your leadership, your steadfast guidance,
and direction that you give these important schools
every single day.
Thank you for everything you do.
To our Governor and First Lady, Lieutenant Governor,
General Assembly colleagues, and of course, again,
our HBCU presidents and their institutions.
Thank you for what you do and what you mean
to historically black colleges and universities here in Georgia.
I want to thank each and every single one of you
for attending today's HBCU period of day 2023.
So let's give a final round of applause
to all of our honorees, Albany State University,
Clark Atlanta University, Fort Valley State University,
the Interdenominational Theological Seminary,
Morehouse School of Medicine, Morehouse College,
Morris Brown College, Pain College,
and Savannah State College.
Thank you to each of you for what you're doing.
Thank you for celebrating with us again today.
I can never talk about HBCUs without just saying
that though I did not go to one myself,
I am the beneficiary of an HBCU education,
having parents who both grew up in the 1940s
And Jim Crow, Mississippi, on farms,
who found their way to an HBCU and created a life
that they never could have dreamed for themselves
and my sister and I.
So keep doing the work that you're doing.
And thank you again.
Thank you, everybody.
Hope you're doing well.
