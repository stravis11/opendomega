Representative Leveritt is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the majority of the Congress Chairman, Williamson pointed out to me it was on the board, I just hadn't seen it, so my apologies. This is the bill that allows a written declaration that does not have to be notarized to be introduced into evidence. It was sponsored or proposed by the Atlanta International Obitation Society. If you recall, we approved that bill, sent it back on the way over. We caught a cleanup issue with regard to the form of the signature block, where it actually had to say that you understood you were signing it under penalty of purgeary because we required that it's only effective if it's signed outside the United States. We also have an affirmation that you understand you are affirmed that you're signing outside the United States. So, what's good changes and we would ask that you approve that substitute. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask your favor consideration of the Senate substitute to House Bill 80. When you're the will, on the gentleman's motion, then the House agreed to the Senate substitute to HB 80. All those in favor will vote yes.

Again, this is our completion school bill that we passed unanimously out of this House earlier this year or this session. That the Senate changes are that we've given a definition to the Department of Defense, Youth Challenge Academy within the bill. Those are those students that are in those different academies. We also added language for grandfathering the existing kids. Remember, we have three of these programs, Mount Ned, Foothills, and Coastal Plains across the state. We have grandfathered those children that are already enrolled in those schools. And then the last thing here was if a student lives very close to a school outside of their zone. So in the zone right next to them, remember they're zoned by what we call recess. So there are two recess put together that is counties of schools. If they are much closer to that other zone to school, they're allowed to go there then. So it would make sense if they're 50 miles away from the zone they're in, but they're only one mile away from the other zone. We're allowing them to cross over to that zone and go through there. Thanks for what I ask of you as your favorable consideration of these subs. This is a good program to help our students that are nontraditional and at risk of dropping out.

It's not in my district but I have a lot of friends that live over there and that bridge is getting hit every month at hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. Probably millions by now. Well, depending upon its location and its use and the frequency of use it gets it could be considered under here because it would be included within a transportation system. It's clearly marked. It tells you how high they still keep going in there knocking it down and blocking the residents into their neighborhoods.

I am very much a conservationist and stand very firm with making sure we protect our resources both on land and in the sea and water. And what this resolution deals with is proposed rules that are coming out of National Marine Fisheries Service in regards to vessel strikes on the Atlantic right whale and we know those are endangered species. And again, we in Georgia take our conservation very seriously. Ultimately, what we want to do with this resolution, if you'll look at the end, is to make sure that we're urging Congress to make sure that they are funding and properly trying to fund and find a real solution to make sure that they get funding to make sure we've got a real time monitoring solution on these right whales. Let me repeat that. We're urging Congress to make sure that they've got the funding to do a real time monitoring on these right whales so that we know where they are. But as it currently stands right now, as it currently stands, there are proposed regulations that are coming out that would impose a vessel strike reduction rule and that rule would impose, get this, a 10-knot maximum speed for nearly half of the year out to 40 miles offshore. Again, 10-knot maximum speed limit for nearly six months out of the year up to 40 miles offshore. And there are significant problems and concerns here. And quite frankly, it's the unforeseen, it's a human risk.

going to get in boats that speeds make a difference and the thing on the oceans the weather. We also know that there will be negative. In fact, I would say detrimental impacts to the Georgia anglers and boaters in the fishing, boating industry. In addition to the economies of the coast plus the biggest thing I think one of the biggest things is our ports and all those cargo ships that are coming into Georgia. And we know that the technology is out there through aerial surveillance, acoustic monitoring, satellite tagging, DNA detection technologies that we can do this in a real time way. And we know that Congress has authorized the National Marine Fisheries to take these measures and we just want to make sure that they can do design and deploy these real time monitoring and mitigation program. So it does not kill. And I literally say that the the sport fishing industry, our commercial fishing and our our our boating industry in addition to our ports, our cargo when what's going on on the coast of Georgia. So that's what this resolution does. And we want to make sure we're good stewards. But we also want to do it in a way that protects our coast. Resources and that culture on the coast. If there's any questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to stand for something. Okay, you have a whole bunch of questions. Let's see. A lot of them are from the coast and I know they know what they speak down there. To your left, the representative Al Williams is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. It was a gentleman yield to my friend off the coast. I sure will. First, it's not true that I would like to apologize to a member of the chatroom delegations that I told this resolution it already passed. It's inadvertent on my part. Well, I'm you're going to help my hope, I hope make sure we rectify that problem. Will the gentleman further yield? Yes, sir. What effect based on what you're saying? What effect would this have on the commercial stripping industry on the coast of Georgia? That's a great question, representative. I know that it's very dear and your heart not only being right there at the heart of what we all enjoy is the Georgia seafood and shrimp, not only shrimp, but again the seafood and fish off of it. My understanding again to the rules, if you've got a vessel that's 35 feet or longer and during this time, almost six months period, if you're outside of Georgia waters, which I think is the three or four miles, you are restricted by this. And I think it would be very detrimental to our commercial fishing industry, and certainly detrimental to our local folks, especially shrimpers who are already under the gun. Speaker, I'll take maybe two more questions. Okay, you got it. Let's see. Chairman of the economic development, Chairman Ron Stevens, your extreme left has a question. General is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, you. I will to my friend, Savannah. Is it true to things that the Georgia Ports Authority has sent letters in requesting they reconsider this action? That is true. And is it also true that a boat with our ship, with all those containers on it at 10 knots, can't safely navigate if they've got the tide pushing them in? Is that not true? Yes, sir. I think you bring up some great points. My understanding is, is that quite frankly, there may be ships that are waiting out at sea for weeks or months for a birth to come in, because this would slow down the pilot ships and the captains, quite frankly, we could see cargo. And again, this is all across the Atlantic seaboard. We could actually see cargo. This has changed how cargo imports and exports happen from the state of Georgia. We could see those start pushing to the Gulf Coast or even the West Coast. And if we think we've had supply chain issues in the past, this is likely to exacerbate that to a level that we haven't seen before. We've seen some bad times. And additionally, it's about $3.8 billion in revenue. It can mean to Georgia. And about 26, almost 27,000 jobs do the important export and the activity on the ports in the coast. So thank you. You're very exactly right. One more question, Mr. Speaker. We're part right in front of you. Has the question, gentlemen, for recognize? Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman, I would certainly defer to your expertise in your wisdom when it comes to conservation measures. And of course, without a doubt, I would never question your sincerity. Just to clarify, this resolution would simply urge the Georgia Congressional delegation to assist coastal communities by appropriating funds and does not ask to urge for the repeal or reconsideration of any rule or pending rule. Is that not true? I think that's what we're trying to do. There's a lot of data that was in here. And we believe that marine fisheries didn't take some of that data into account. And what we're hearing from the voting industry, sport fishing industry, you know, maritime industry, is that their technology out there through real time technology that we can identify where these wells are, making sure that our voters, our sports fishers, our commercial fishermen, our cargo ships, know where these wells are, avoid them, avoid the strikes, but yet not disrupt. And quite frankly, I would, I dare say, decimate part of Georgia and its economy, its revenue and the tradition of sport fishing. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I don't know, I don't know if there's one more, maybe, or that's it. Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, you have more questions if you want to take them. Yes, sir. Chairman, Petrie, to your left, has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentlemen yield? Aye, I sure do. My friend, I know you know well my commitment to the islands, haven't been born and raised there. I want to ask you a question. Is it not true that we have a vibrant fishery and we have a great deal of charter fishing well off the coast? Ten nights is 11 and a half miles per hour, so the body is aware. Is that correct? And is it not true that oftentimes people are fishing 30 miles off the coast and everywhere in between? My friend off the coast, I know that when I've been offshore off the coast of Georgia, we're out to 40, 50, even 60 miles off to we find, you know, blue water. In essence, it would do away with offshore fishing and the charters in the state of Georgia during those times, basically doing away with that profession. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is exactly what I was trying to emphasize. Thank you, sir. As I appreciate it and I urge you to support this resolution, we can begin to question. One more question. One more question. Representative Williams to your left has a question. You yield? I mean, do you waver? He has a question. She's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, ma'am. So I'm genuinely confused. My question is, are you, you're worried about a study or a practice that seeks to protect right whales, having a negative impact on the fishing industry? Is that what this is about? I think the proposed rules that we're seeing that have been proposed, I know the marine fisheries, national marine fisheries, are rules that quite frankly, I think fall short of good conservation because we know that technology, the tools are out there to do real time, and again, real time monitoring. But instead, they have chosen to propose rules that would, would, frankly, be almost impossible if not kill every part of the coast by limiting vessels that are 35 feet or longer to 10 knots or less for almost six months out of the year. One that will devastate the state of Georgia is economy at sport fishing, the boating industry. Okay, the commercial fishing industry. But on top of that, as a conservationist, we know the technology is out there to do real time monitoring. And that's what this resolution is seeking Congress to do, is put the funds, the money in there to do real time monitoring. You know, I followed O-Surch for a while, and you can get on a app and they've got tags, and you can see what sharks are around the world. We can do this with the whales. Yeah, so thank you. So for the question, so is the plan that is being proposed that troubles you, who is it being proposed by? The national marine fisheries. In the NOAA, yeah, out in NOAA. Okay, and for the question. Yes, ma'am. So the money that you're proposing and the technology for actually monitoring and keeping up with right whales during real time, would that go to that same, I mean, if that, I know this is an urging resolution, but would that money go to the same group? And is there any way to? Yeah, it would. And if you look online 24, it's a great question. Make sure we clarify this. Congress has already implemented some measures through section 11303 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 23 that authorize as a pilot program to design and deploy near real-time monitoring and mitigation program for these whales. Okay. And what we're doing is urging Congress to continue along that and to fund that measure so that we can get real-time monitoring, meaningful monitoring, and we can also make sure that our coast, our state, are not decimated by this, I would say, not wealth on outrule. Yes, sir. I just hope that whatever we do end up doing does not lead to the extinction of the right whale. Thank you. No, ma'am. I want to make sure you're clear on that. There's nobody that wants that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge you to support this very, very important measure. And so we can keep Georgia on the forefront both from a conservation perspective and as a growing state supporting a lot of economic jobs. Gentlemen, as you ordered the whale, is there any objections to the previous question being ordered that Chair Hiznun, the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair Hiznun, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does Chairman Collins rise? I know you have some whales up there where you live. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Stage inquiry. Have we ever heard any kind of response back when we send up urgent resolutions to Congress? Have they ever respond back and say, hey, we appreciate you? Or we don't like you? It's a curious question. I'm supporting the resolution by the way. Just Parliamentary inquiry. Well, that's a good question. I think they probably read them to the, an empty house from time to time when we see up there. But it's definitely a good question. And I'm sure the gentleman believes everything he said about the U.S. system in the Senate and the House, have all members voted, all members voted, is so the clerk will lock the machine. All in the adoption of the resolution, the yeas were 168, the nays 2. The resolution having received it requisite. Constitutional majority is therefore adopted. The representative of the Senate is recognized for a motion. Mr. Whip here, recognize for a motion. You have a motion? Let's hear it. Sorry. Getting late. Our is late, Mr. Speaker. I have a motion that we agree to House Bill 611 from the Senate. The Senate substitute. That's one. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 611 by Representative Prachetta, 176 to be titled. And act to amend part one of our four chapter 12 of Title 45, the official to George annotated, relating the management of budgetary and fiscal affairs. Those who are required for the disposition of state funds to arrive from certain legal judgments or settlements. Mr. Whip is called multi-tasking. I think that's what they call it. Chair Berkschett is recognized to explain the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 611 is the bill that we voted on that essentially says this. It says that any monies or funds that come from settlement agreements or judgments that the House and the General Assembly should have the opportunity to appropriate those funds. As with any lawyers bill, the lawyers over on the other side rearrange the words and didn't change the underlined policies. The same bill, same exact bill, the effective date is June 1. And essentially says that any settlement agreement or any proceeds from a settlement shall be appropriated in line with any MOU settlement agreement that is a part of that litigation. We will be bound by those settlement agreements and MOUs. In other words, the money that we receive as a state, we can't just spend however we want to spend. If there's an MOU or a settlement agreement that says opioid mitigation is where we must spend the money, that is where we must spend the money. We can't just spend wherever we like. But it does assert that the General Assembly is the appropriators of the state and that we will have an opportunity to appropriate those funds. And that's for any settlement agreement going forward after June 1. And Mr. Speaker, that's the crux of the bill. General, you yield for a question? I do. To your left, Representative Lisa Campbell has a question. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you yield, please? I do. I remember discussing this in committee. Could you just clarify what the Senate Substitute added or changed? They didn't change the underlying policy of the bill. The only thing I did was rearrange the wording in the bill. We added judgment to the bill and made sure for clarity purposes that June 1 applied to settlements, judgments, and any MOU that is attached. We added the word MOU for because these national settlements all have a MOU where the state gets the local jurisdictions, cities, counties to agree to an MOU. And so we thought it was important that we recite that in the bill. So there's no, there's no underlying policy change, just addition of words. Gentlemen, has no further questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, all in the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate Substitute of House Bill 611. All those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will lock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted. Now that's your speech but request to speak but in their representative Williams, you've already spoken. Okay, we got you now. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the gentleman's motion. The yeas are 171, the nays are zero, and the House has agreed to the Senate Substitute to House Bill 611. Chairman Chuck Martin has recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House disagree to the Senate amendment to how the House substitute for Senate Bill 13 that the House disagree. Mr. Clark, will you read the caption? Senate Bill 13 by Senator Albers, the 56 and others to be entitled to act to event code section 913-161-4414-162. 48-41 of the fiscal to George annotated relating to where and when sales under execution held and change of places of public sales by court order. Ladies and gentlemen, the Senate added back in some language. Hold it just a minute, Mr. Chair. So you're doing this so you have a disagreement here. Yeah, we need you to disdime. We need you to explain that motion you just made. That's what I need, so I need to know what you're doing. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Apologies for getting ahead of my speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I just asked that you disagree. So we will get in the posture to appoint a conference committee and work this out. The Senate added some things to a good bill we had passed out of here. I think without a descending vote and we'll work with them if I can get you to concur with me and disagree to the Senate amendment. If there are questions I'll answer them. Otherwise, I yield the well. Great job. You have no questions. The gentleman jeal to the well. All in the gentleman's motion that the House disagree to the Senate, to the Senate amendment, to the House sub is their objection to Chair. He's done and the House has disagreed to the Senate amendment to the House sub to Senate bill 13. Chairman Blackman is recognized for a motion. I know, I know. I just thought I was one more. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we agree to the Senate sub student House bill 414. Mr. Clark, will you read the caption? House bill 414 by the House of Blackman and 146 and others being titled an act to amend chapter 1 in title 37. The Fish go to George Aniteta relating to governing and regulation of mental health. So survive for a grant program within the Department of Behavior Health and Developmental Disabilities. Chairman's recognized to explain his agreement to the Senate substitute. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members, if you recall, House bill 414 would create a matching grant program to help our military service member veterans and their families access behavioral health services through non-profit community programs. There are two changes from the Senate. One, and this is agreed upon by both departments. It would move from the administrative portion from the Department of Behavioral Health to the Department of Veteran Services. And it would also add a transparency piece on lines 53 through 55. Both are agreeable and I would ask this body's favorable consideration to this Senate substitute. Gentlemen, you have a question? I would. To your right, Chairman Bonner has a question. Is gentleman Yeal? Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true that this is a great bill and will benefit more than 700,000 veterans and their families here in the state of Georgia? I certainly hope, as gentlemen, knows what he speaks. Yes, sir, I would agree with that. You have no further questions? Oh, you'll the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen. Gentlemen, is Yeal to the well? All in the gentleman's motion that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 414. All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machines. All the gentleman's motion, the Yeas are 169, the Nays are zero, and the House has agreed to the Senate substitute to House Bill 414. Chairman Allen, the power is recognized for motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to move this House to agree to the Senate substitute as amended by the House. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption? House Bill 196, by the Rubs of the Paul of 33rd, and others will be titled an act to amend Article 9 and Chapter 12, the Title 16. The official go to Georgia annotated relating to access to medical cannabis, so it's required that the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission shall be subject to the administrative procedures act. Please, members, give your attention to the member in the well. Representative, excuse me, Chairman Powell has recognized to explain his motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. Y'all may remember on cross over, we passed House Bill 196 and were trying to do a correction to a situation that's existed for seven years plus. Seven years ago, if you remember, we adopted and accepted the fact that medical grade cannabis oil could be a cure to a lot of the illnesses of the disease from children to veterans to a number of different diseases. Four years ago, we had established a commission to move forward, and here we are four years later, and it's still not gone forward. There was two, you may remember that were granted a license before TRO was accepted. You may remember the dialogue of that day that they were not subject to open records, and because of that fact, they brought on litigation that has tied in and brought this process. Now, what we passed out of the House, we thought, was a pretty good bill, but you may remember, at that time, I spoke on this that there was a lot of interest on both sides of the House and in the Senate about moving this to a more open process through the Department of Agriculture. The legislation that passed was basically amended quite frankly and not so favorable of a light over the Senate committee. Now, what this bill does, and I want to give some thanks. I want to thank Chairman Tyler Paul Smith. I want to thank Chairman Jay Collins. I want to thank the members of the various committees. I want to thank and most special thanks to Leader Efestration. This bill came back in a totally unwarkable fashion from the Senate, and what you've got before us is a new bill that what we've done has gone forward with a lot of the same language that we had, plus some new improvements, in my opinion. Ladies and gentlemen, what this bill does, this abolishes the cannabis commission, and it transfers its functions to the Agriculture Department where there's a responsible elected official that can be accountable to the people of this state, and the minister of the program. The division of agriculture will be subject to administrative procedures and open records act, so there's no secrecy, and by any unelected bureaucrat, the appeals and decisions of the administrative agency will be made. Any of these appeals will be made by the statewide business courts. If you'll remember that came from the bill that we've left this house with. Licenses will also be able to have an additional dispensary own location. The dispensary will be able to sell any of its products as well as those other products manufactured by any of the other operations, so then that will be a fully professional operation that this vital medical oil will be accessible to any and all of these different diseases and ailments. Joint study, a joint oversight committee is established. This is by chairs from the House, the Senate, plus one appointed by the Speaker and one by the Lieutenant Governor to oversee the workings of the Department of Agriculture in this industry. Then we get into the real guts of how to, this is going to be fixed ladies and gentlemen. The Agriculture Committee will mediate. We're not allowing them to just give licenses to the nine who protested, but the Ag Commissioner will mediate with the nine companies, and if they're acceptable, and if they meet all the credentials and the qualifications, then they may. They might be able to get a license if they then drop that litigation that we had talked about earlier. The Commissioner also have the discretion, but not an obligation to issue additional licenses based on that registry that you remember we talked about on crossover day, based on the number of new registrants that go on to this. So we're looking at 15 possibly 20. This invests in the discretion of the Ag Commissioner to allow him and his team of experts to ensure a healthy and a fair market to bring this needed medication to the citizens of Georgia. Last but not least, this added one additional illness, and that was the ulcerated colitis. That ladies and gentlemen is what this bill does. If you go through the bill itself, you'll look at a number of the sections that deal wholly with abolishing and transferring this to the Department of Agriculture. With that Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to stand for questions.

Gentlemen, you have a couple of questions? Yes, sir. To your left, German work-hizer. To recognize four questions. Yes, sir. Thanks, sir. Are you here? Yes, sir. Is it not true that right now we have 35,000 card holders and the six proposed licensed holders would supply 1.2 million patients. And that you're proposing that we may add nine more? I think, well, the number, true number, it has dropped off in the registrants. It's dropped off with expiration. Now, understand is down below 30,000 into the 20s. It's actually grown by 20% in the last six months. Is it not true that a administrative law judge of 17 years with a background in health care heard every one of the protesters over a 60-day period and issued several hundred pages of unredacted applications and rejected every one of the protests? If the gentleman so states, I'm not an attorney, but I know that that's what is led to the litigation in those cases. Speaking of litigation, is it also not true that the Georgia Constitution Article 3, Section 6, paragraph 4, prohibits this body from passing legislation to specifically reward individual protesters with licenses? And this would not only not get rid of lawsuits, I can think of at least six or seven more lawsuits that would be brought forth because of those who invested millions of dollars because they thought they had a license or now being told that we're going to not open the process up to give this to who knows who commissioned that we're now abolishing, that both this chamber, the chamber across the hall and the governor signed, and that we're basically allowing a couple of individuals to rewrite the law. I just think we are 45 days away from having all on the shelf and to bring forth legislation that would put this in jeopardy when we're, in fact, two of our- Is there a question there, Mr. President? Is it not true that two class 1 licenses are producing and we're one lawsuit away in full county for the other four to start producing and we would have the six licenses that this body, the body across the hall and the governor signed? If the gentleman thinks that's correct, I'm sure that he believes in his heart and soul, he's right, but then again, that gentleman represents one of the cannabis operations that has a monopoly in this state today, the either the same arguments that were heard in the House, special, the House Judiciary, and non-soududishary. Now, as far as the litigation and the constitutional requirements, this legislative body has the ability to change and to correct any of- This body has the ability to pass legislation to correct and to change anything that may have been disperaged or any errors in judgment by previous legislative bodies. Now, the argument was made in the House Judiciary Committee by some of these attorneys representing the two- the two companies that have a virtual monopoly in this state. Now, there's four that have not been that were tentatively awarded and you have nine, and for the people in the House that they may remember the arguments, that the nine that protestors, they protested because of the process of the evaluation, which was not dealt with and that's the reason it's in litigation today. This has been tied up and it has a potential according to the attorneys on Judiciary and to the attorneys that basically spoke during these committee meetings that this could be tied up for a number of years. And most of us have realized that it is not healthy to have two companies to have a virtual monopoly in this state. Is it not true those two large companies that you're referring to, testifying committee, both in the House and the Senate, that they wish the other four were producing? And the only reason we have a do-oply is because the protestors are keep filing additional lawsuits and a fit of goal of this body and everyone else to get medicine to the patients within 45 days is it not true we should know on this bill. I appreciate your passion. We've been on opposite side of this for a couple years and I'm glad we agree on every other issue and I appreciate your efforts. And I appreciate your zealousness to represent from this floor the interest of the company that's located in your district. Well, that's the gentleman will stick to answering the questions. Very closely. Now you have a lot of questions here, Mr. Chairman. So we're going to have a couple of more representing the state's Evans is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Mr. Chairman, is it true? I'm looking at the documents here. The bill you're asking us to agree to is 54 pages. Am I right? If there's a second part that's going to be addressed again dealing with the hemp legislation. Will you further yield? Yes, ma'am. That 54 page bill that were asked to agree to right now is much different than the 12 page bill that was vetted in committee and the House and voted on by this body on crossover day true. That is correct. Will you further yield? I certainly will. Do you share my concern that if we make these changes, which is now going to be the second session that we've made significant changes to this commission, that we really urge anybody who's gone through a competitive bidding process and lost to run to the courthouse and create a bunch of chaos to make us sort of chase our tails around here and keep changing and changing and changing and really take away uncertainty for business and for consumers and most importantly for patients who need this medicine. As a learned attorney who makes her living serving as an attorney for litigants, I'm sure that you understand that everyone has got a right to file suit if they've been wronged. It was the opinion of these protesters that they had not been done correct because you may remember the language that we talked about or that I had spoke from, was when the applications were given, you had the commission members that divvy them up, the same application was put forth, but that yet whenever the applications were done, they were graded on a numerical system so that the same answer, no matter what it might have been, it was given a one or a five. So it was basically a system that was flawed from the beginning. There's where it has brought this forward. And if I may further address in this bill, over half of the pages deal with just disassembling the commission and then reassembling it under the authority of the Ag Commissioner, the base of the bills continues to be what it was when we passed with that exception. Then the back starting on page 40 of this bill deals with the hemp, the Chairman Purple and Chairman Corvette. So diligently dealt with, that starts on page 40 in section two. Now that was a consumer bill that I'm gonna address or they will address through questions, but that's to be sure that we don't have a adulterated CDB hemp based products that have been imported to the state, the synthetic grade products, the things that created more of a health issue to the people of Georgia. So in fact, you have two bills that were basically disregarded in the Senate committee at the wham of the one of the people that was chairing that meeting. So that's where the limit you asked about the page numbers. That's where the number of pages come from. They glad to answer any specific questions, but if what you're saying is and your original question, was it not, is it not right that we're giving someone, we're not saying that the Commissioner will give a license. They will then have the opportunity to go through a mediation to see if they meet the qualifications and then he can have the ability to move forward if they so desire. We yield for one five plus. Yes ma'am. I understand your point about legislation relating to hemp being added, but that still wouldn't make this, build it, we're asked to vote on today with other than being able to ask you questions, no real debate, we're not allowed to come up and speak. So 38 pages compared to 12 that we passed out of this house and crossover that was subject to the committee process. Am I right that that means that this is 38 pages of legislation that has not gone through the committee process? That legislation has gone through the process and we're debating it as a committee of the whole house at this point. I'll be more than glad to go by section by section for the good lady if she wishes. Well I wish we could have a full debate but unfortunately our house rules don't allow us to do that, but thank you. If you would prefer I'll be glad to go section by section through the bill to show you where the number of pages that you're talking about were created. Let's go. Gentlemen, do you have another question? To your right, Chairman Perkel has recognized for a question. Yes sir. Famous to speakers, Jim and you. Yes sir. I will not ask you to go through section by section. Is it not true that the part two of the amendment is virtually identical to HB 458, the only change being to tighten the guard rails that we've talked about with Hemp as it relates to this consumer protection bill? You're absolutely right. Could I ask one further question? Yes sir. Is it not true that a recent Journal of American Medical Association study found that 76% of Hemp products are inaccurately labeled and the part two of this bill that was passed out of this body 168 to 2, seeks to do two things, provide consumer protections and to make sure that those under 21 do not have the ability to purchase these products. You're absolutely right. And thank you. Thank you for yours work on this. Thank you. Gentlemen, further yield? Yes sir. Let's see, Representative Shea Roberts to your left out front. The gentleman yield? Yes sir. Okay, I was sat through the hearings and I listened to a lot of it. This is a lot different than what was there. I want these people to be able to get the medicine they need. So I'm trying to, I just want to be clear. I'm not necessarily opposed to going to the Ag Commission. I always love more transparency in government. But if we do this, is that going to hold up the current license, light, life, people who got the licenses from getting the product out to the people who need it? No ma'am, if this bill passes away, it is already similar form to this, abolishing the cannabis commission, moving it to the Commissioner of Agriculture and the oversight committees there. Then they have a date by May 31st that they've got to enter into mediation with the protesters. If the protesters show good cause that they are under the standards, that they're eligible, then they will be allowed to have a license. If and under the condition that they drop any litigation, and that's the determining factor. This goes back to the same argument that was made, that this is going to be tied up for probably a considerable period of time. It's in the court of appeals right now, as a potential to go into the Supreme Court. But I don't know that I feel like this is actually going to get us out of litigation. It may get us back into more litigation. And that's the part that I'm struggling with, I'll be honest. Well, the language that you had heard from one of the earlier questions was the same language that was used by some of the attorney lobbyists that were representing the two companies that had received it got out before the TRO was issued. And they used a lot of clever language about how they could sue in such a set. There's nothing that prohibits the General Assembly of Georgia for changing laws to fix law, to fix litigation such as at any time through legislative action. This body can add as many more as they wanted to. So there's no litigation to be filed. These were veil threats in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Judiciary Committee. Because they passed it out pretty handly. OK, thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen, you'll majority lead an frustration right in front of you. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Jim Maniel for a series of questions. Yes, sir. Probably, yes or no questions. So first of all, as members are concerned about the legislation that's before them, we can actually go through briefly. Because as you point out, the whole first part of the bill, dealing with the Cannabis Commission, and now the Ag Commissioner regulating this, as a lot of pages just related to removing commission and replacing it with the department, isn't that true? That is correct. Isn't it true that the transparency provisions that were in House Bill 196 that this body previously voted on and passed are included in here to provide transparency to this process? Absolutely. Isn't it true that the bill here is we look at section 16 would create legislative oversight of this process so that there would be specific legislatures who would have the ability to ensure that this new system that would be in place is being handled properly and that if there are issues that come up, that action can be taken by the General Assembly. Absolutely correct. Isn't it true that section 18 for the Class 1 licenses and a companion section in 1-9 for the Class 2 licenses would simply allow for the Department of Agriculture to issue licenses consistent with their new oversight of this cannabis process? Absolutely. And isn't it true that the only mandate that was questioned or earlier asked about is unconstitutional to mandate the outcome of litigation? That that's not what is being done in this bill at all. There is no requirement that licenses be issued to any protest, protestors. Isn't that true? Absolutely right. Isn't it true that the only thing required is that the Department engage in mediation with those protestors and that that take place by the end of May. So to the General Eddies' concern, that there is some an expedited period within which these protests could potentially be resolved? You're absolutely correct. Isn't it true that the trigger, what I call the trigger provision, that deals with the automatic ability of the Department to issue subsequent licenses into the future to ensure that there is not a monopoly by a small number of holders of these licenses remains in this bill. And that is similar to language that we passed out of this body in House Bill 196 before. Absolutely. And the only difference here is an actual increase in the number of patients that would be on the registry. So to the concern that was raised earlier, that maybe the license holders could address the need, there would be a greater number of patients needed compared to what we passed on House Bill 196 for additional licenses to be available for issue? You are correct. And then finally, with respect to the conditions for coverage, only UC, Ulstertiv Collitis, is being added as an additional condition. No other conditions, as maybe have been, so in other words, the only additional condition today is the one that was debated in committee in the House. Correct. Right, that's correct. Now, part two of the bill dealing with him, that legislation was carried by Chairman Perkel and previously passed this House overwhelmingly. Correct. Absolutely. And that includes common sense measures to ensure that ingestable hemp products are properly regulated so that miners don't have access to those products and so that we have a regulatory structure in place for the reality of these new ingestable hemp products. Is that correct? Correct. Right. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions really yield? Yes, sir. Representative Hutchinson to your right has a question, ladies recognize. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that this legislation will move the needle forward for all of the patients who have been patiently waiting for medical cannabis for the last seven years? Yes, ma'am. You're exactly right. And thank you. Thank you for bringing this legislation. To your right, Chairman Newton has recognized real quick. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, yes, sir. Thank you, sir, for this legislation. I do want to point out that as you move it from the Medical Cannabis Commission to the Department of Agriculture, is it correct that there's nothing in this bill that it changes the use that's been approved by this body that, rather than recreational, this is really for compassionate medical use and that's your question. You're absolutely right. This sticks into the medical category. There's no recreational drugs allowed in this. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, yield. Yes, sir, maybe one more question. Okay. Will Park is recognized for question? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So in conclusion, Chairman Powell, is it not true that this bill would expand access to THC oil by including the number, by expanding the number of licenses while putting additional restrictions on hemp products? Is how I'm reading it? You will expand the production of medical cannabis facilities and stop the do-opathy that exists right now on the hemp part of the bill that was sponsored by Chairman Perkel. This puts guardrails into the hemp of the CDB type things, the Delta things and those type of products in the gummies to be sure that any of these products that are sent into Georgia, whether it be from wherever overseas or the West Coast or wherever, that they're not synthetic and that they meet certain health standards. Thank you. Thank you. You have one more and we'll have them all to insist you're just about there. This is our last question. Bigger I'll do one more and then I'll finish it up. Representative Willis is recognized for question. Representative Inca Willis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Did the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Isn't it true that this legislation, not only addresses the existing do-opily and current licensure and allows for more transparency and process? You're absolutely right. This is a gentleman further yield. Yes, ma'am. Isn't it true that proper regulation of specified hemp products serves to protect the consumers of Georgia? You're absolutely right. And would the gentleman graciously yield one more time? I certainly will. Isn't it true that on the other side of this debate that has lasted for years, there will be thousands of Georgians that will receive medicine that they desperately need to improve their quality of life, especially our seniors? You're absolutely right. And that's what is most important. Thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you for the questions. Mr. Speaker, if I might sum this up to the ladies and gentlemen, you know, the question came because of the number of volume of pages in this. Well, the 41st 40 pages of this deals with the canvas and most of those deal with disassembling the commission and moving it to the Department of Agriculture. Certain languages put in there to be sure that we're not saying that we're rewarding anybody because they have filed a lawsuit that they have to go through the mediation process. We have put a lot of efforts into this and I would encourage you to move forward, especially the language that Chairman Perkel and his folks had put together about the other protections under the CDB based products. And that, Mr. Speaker, is the bill, and I'll be more than glad to support all of your help on this bill and let's move it back to the Senate. Gentlemen, as you did the well, he has any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment. Chair here is doing the House Amendment has adopted. All the General's motion that the House agree to the Senate substitute to House Bill 196 as amended by the House. All those in favor of vote yes, those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. The law is misused. have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will a lot of the Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that we disagree to the Senate amendment to Senate bill 246. Clerk, we'll read the caption. Senate bill 246 by Senator Hodges III. And others to be entitled to amend chapter 10 to title 49. And if it's good to George annotated, we're leading the Georgia Board of Healthcare Workforce. Representative Gamble is recognized to explain the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment is a technical issue that we are working to fix and disagreeing to this amendment will allow us the ability to do that. Happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. On the gentleman's motion that the House disagreed to the Senate amendment. To the House, sir, is there any objection that Chair here's known and this House has disagreed to the Senate amendment to SB 246? We're going back on to the rules, calendar. Mr. Clerk. Will you read the caption to Senate bill 133133? Senate bill 133 by Senator Strickland of the 17th. And others to be entitled to amend chapter 11 to title 15 of the official go to Georgia annotated relating the juvenile code. So it's to create a uniform process to assume custody of children as a result of disposition orders. This bill ever referred to the committee on juvenile justice. That committee recommends a dis bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Representative Rob Leveritt is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, House. It's my pleasure to present you Senate bill 133. This is a bill that attempts to provide a statutory framework for juvenile court judges when they are considering certain cases that might involve placement of a child with Department of Family and Children Services or just removal of a child. It helps to understand there are basically three different sort of kinds of proceedings you can have in juvenile court. There's dependency, delinquency, and child in need of services. Of course, dependency is where a child is found to be dependent. Where that is the, I'm sorry, I have the definition here. The child has been abused and neglected as a need of protection of the court. Or has been placed for care adoption. Then you have delinquency, which is kind of the version of criminal court for juvenile court. And then child and need of services, which was a proceeding that was developed several years ago, this basically intended to try to avoid removal of children from a home when they are engaging in certain behaviors, which makes them difficult for parents to manage. They don't attend school, they run away, they're loitering, they're, it even says to patronizing a bar. So generally, in delinquency and chins, they call child in need of services, it's not contemplated that children will be removed from the home. That's more of a dependency determination. And there's a fairly detailed set of statutes in the juvenile code that deal with the procedures that a court has to go through to make sure that it protects the parents' constitutional rights, the due process rights of the parents and the child, and just to afford all parties notice. This bill is attempting to ensure that if a court does make a non-emergency placement, and that's a very important distinction, this is not for an emergency case. But if a court is starting to make a non-emergency placement in a child in need of services case or a delinquency case, that it, that it go through certain steps, and these are fairly common sense, but they are, the law currently doesn't have a set statutory process for the courts to go through. So this just makes sure the court does things like check on what might else be available for placement. Find out what services the child has had in the past. Find out if there are any records relating to the child that would be useful to review. And it does that both in a delinquency and the, this is called, Chins cases. So we believe this, this would provide greater uniformity. It ensures the protection of the rights of all parties and ensures that there's notice provided. And it would, we believe ultimately it provides for a better placement and protects rights of the child and make sure that the child's getting the best placement and the best services that's possible, which is ultimately the goal of any juvenile court proceeding early. So there is a letter I think that was handed out a few days ago when we were considering bringing up the bill and then it didn't come up. We placed it out again today. The Office of Child Advocate does support the bill for the reasons I've mentioned, just ensuring a process that we give courts a checklist to go through to make sure that the rights of all parties are being protected. So we would urge your favorable consideration bill and Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. You do have some questions to your left. Representative Oliver has a question to your extreme left. Ladies recognize. Does the gentleman you yield just ma'am? Isn't it true, sir, that there are 5,324 removals of children in the juvenile court to defects? Is that number correct, sir? I personally do not know, but I have no reason to question the ladies figures. And isn't it true that currently there's a confusion over about the removals of about 25 of these children who are in the Chense Program? Is that correct, sir? Again, I have no reason to doubt the general ladies. And this bill might relate to a dozen of those 5,324 removals. Is that correct? Well, assuming your figures are correct, which I don't question, that would be true as of the case is pending today. We don't know about cases in the future. Final question, does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Wouldn't it be helpful if we went back to our districts and talked to our juvenile court judges about how the children in need of surgery?

as programs really working and what we could do to help them prevent these 5,324 removals into defects. I would concur, yes. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Gentlemen, yield. I yield, Ms. Speaker. Representative Panich has a question to your left towards the back. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. I know that the juvenile court judges who appeared in our committee had some problems with this bill and it went back to committee. I mean, I'm sorry, it went back for further negotiations. Do you know if those issues had been resolved or are the juvenile court judges on board with this bill? I don't know that they're on board. I believe that a number of changes were made to address concerns they had with the language of the initial bill, which could have been interpreted in a way to require that a court not proceed until it had obtained certain information or provided certain notice. And I believe that has been addressed. I can't say it's to their satisfaction, but I believe reasonably those changes have been made to make it clear that the court has to consider these things on the record, but it doesn't necessarily have to stop the proceeding and go or have files delivered. It just needs to make an inquiry and consider to the extent of the information it has. Okay. Does the gentleman further yield? So, just to be clear, you don't have a sign-off from the juvenile court justice judges. I'm not aware of such a sign-off, no matter. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Gentlemen, has one more question. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So, when these children in need of services or as you refer to them, the delinquency cases, when they are taken into custody of defects, where do they go? I think that's sort of a question beyond the scope of the bill. And I frankly don't know for sure, but I know they try to place them with family, then they place them with foster parents. And I believe there's been some news about other placements, but I don't have any personal knowledge of that. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. So, you might be alluding to what I'm going to ask next. Earlier this year, we saw a lot of articles about hoteling and the fact that a lot of these departments don't have anywhere to send these children, so they're putting them up in hotels. Would anything in this bill help or exacerbate that issue? Well, to answer the latest question, I think part of the reason for the bill is to make sure that defects is aware and has an opportunity to be heard before a court places a child with defects. And I think some of the issues to which the ladies alluding have happened because defects isn't always made aware up front when the placement is going to happen. So I think it is the hope that this will allow defects to engage with the court, provide the court information and help the court make a decision that might avoid placements that are less satisfactory to all of us. All right, so there's a gentleman further you for one last question. Yes, ma'am. So is the goal of this to get less children in the custody of defects or is it to get more children in the custody of defects? I would say that I don't believe it has a stated goal of increasing reducing placements. It has a stated goal of making sure that the placement we make is based on the best information available to the court at the time and that it's the most appropriate placement for the child under the circumstances. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Mr. Bigger, if there are further questions, I'll yield the well, ask your favourable consideration. I'm Senate Bill 133. Gentlemen, as you go to the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitute is withdrawing. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair, here's none. The rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes, all those opposed, we'll vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 102, the nays 69, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Representative Washburn has recognised for a motion. Representative Washburn.
