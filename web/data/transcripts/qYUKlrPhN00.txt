Having arrived, all members will please report to the floor of the house and take seats.
All members will please take their seats.
Mr. Clerk, we'll ring the bell.
All members.
We are about to have the call of the roll for the first time this year.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
and the clerk will unlock the machines.
Herman Hogan, it's the green button.
If you're here, have all members voted?
Have all members now voted?
If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
keepers will please close the doors and keep them closed.
Well first of all happy New Year and welcome back to the
2020 session of the Georgia General Assembly.
I don't know about y'all but I'm excited to be here.
How about y'all?
We're going to begin today with our chaplain of the day, and I'll introduce him momentarily,
but at the end of the chaplain we're going to do things a little different.
I'm going to ask you to please remain seated.
You can greet the chaplain afterwards, but we're going to have a little, as we like to
do on the opening day and day 40 have a little special treat. And we have a great one today.
So I want you to remain seated and stay at attention and stay at your desk. They gave
me a long biography of our chaplain of the day. Early this morning, Mack, I'm not going
use it.
Mac Jackson, who is the representative from the 128th district, first of all is just one
of the finest people that I have ever known.
And we all go through challenges, I've been through a few, and it seems as though when
I am going through one of those tough times that I hear a message from Mack and God speaks
to me through him in a way that touches my heart and gives me encouragement, gives me
strength, and I can't tell Mac how much he means to me, and I know many of you feel the
same way. In addition to serving the 128th House District down in Middle Georgia, Mac
also pastors a church and has since 1993. They obviously don't believe in term limits.
And it's probably a very good thing they don't, but they wouldn't have Mac Jackson.
But you're going to be blessed today.
You're in for a real treat.
It is an honor, a real honor for me to introduce our chaplain of the day, Representative
Mac Jackson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I got more than happy new year to everyone.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank you for the privilege
and the honor to do this devotion for the opening session
of the year 2020 of the Georgia House of Representatives.
I've had some great things that happened to me in 2019.
It was a great year for me and my family,
even through the death of my wife's brother
and the death of her father just three weeks ago.
But despite all that, we've still been blessed by the Lord.
We've been through a lot,
but we still got joy and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Because of his grace and his mercy.
And I just wanna tell you that I was overwhelmed
on one Sunday morning,
as I was getting ready for service that morning.
And I saw State Trooper cars driving up in the yard of the church.
And I went into the church, and in the foyer,
Speaker of the House, David Ralston was standing there
at our church for that church service.
And that was the most overwhelming moment that I've had in a long time.
So I'm going to speak, I just want to publicly say thank you
for being so kind and gracious to come to our church service
on that Sunday morning.
I got a lot of calls afterwards, people in the community
even knew that you came to church that Sunday morning.
So thank you.
You can't find a better friend and speak a David Ralston.
He's proving himself over the years to be a true friend.
But this morning, because he's asked me to give the devotion,
I want to bring your attention to the book of Lamentations
in chapter three, verses 21 through 23.
And it says this, this I recall to my mind.
Therefore have I hold.
It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
because his compassion's failed not.
They are new every morning.
Great is his faithfulness.
And it's because of the mercies of God
that you and I are still here in 2020.
Nothing that we've done or accomplished
is all because of the grace of God.
And I like what the prophets said in verse 23.
They are new every morning,
morning by morning, new mercies I see.
Great is thy faithfulness.
And because of his faithfulness,
I've found a new love for God.
Through all my trials and tribulations,
I've developed a home gonna thirst for righteousness
in this new love for God.
And in the book of Micah, chapter six, verse eight,
it says, he has shown the old man what is good.
And what does the Lord require of thee?
But to do justly, to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with your God?
Now think about it, that's all that God requires of us.
He requires us to do justly.
He requires us to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with our God.
And I don't know about you,
but I've decided to build a closer relationship
with God in this new year.
And I believe that's what the psalmist had discovered
when he wrote these words in Psalm 9.
He was talking about the brevity of life,
how brief life is.
And he wrote in verse 12,
so teach us to number our days
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
My grand daddy used to say,
nobody knows the day nor the hour.
And they used to sing a song that said,
this may be the last time,
Maybe the last time, I don't know.
So I wanna be able to number my days
and I wanna apply my heart to wisdom in the year 2020
because every day is valuable
and I don't wanna waste a minute or a second
in this new year with a heart and heart.
And that's my prayer for this year.
Lord, teach me to number my days.
Shall we pray?
Heavenly Father, God of all truth, God of all mercies, as we come before you in this new
year of 2020, we ask you by your spirit to visit hungry hearts.
We ask you to mend the broken hearts in this place.
We ask for your wisdom and your guiding us as we come together to solve the issues of
this great state.
there be no division in the hearts of these brave men and women who have given so
uncephishly of their time and talents to serve the people of Georgia. We ask
your blessings upon the governor, the speaker of the house, the lieutenant
governor, the men and women who make up the Georgia General Assembly, bless
our soldiers wherever they are today Lord, protect them from all hurt, harm
and danger. And this we ask all in the majestic name of Jesus, that name that is
above all names, amen. The pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all. Thank you for speaking. God bless you. Thank you, sir.
You can stay up here if you'd like house will continue to be at order house will
continue to be at order I told you that we had a real treat for you this morning
and we do. We have a tenor. Somebody that sings in tenor. Okay, don't look at me. Blank
looks like that. Timothy Miller is a native of Augusta, Georgia, and has performed nationally
and internationally in opera. And Timothy, I'm not going to try to tell them all the operas
you've been in because I can't pronounce them, but he had been in some of the greatest
operas in the world.
He's probably more known for his performances here in the state.
He gives a stirring rendition during the seventh inning stretch at Atlanta Breaves Home Games
of God Bless America.
He's saying and performed at Governor Nathan Dill's, I think both of his inaugurals and
he is honored us by being here today.
He is a Georgia, a son of Georgia, lives here in the metro area.
He's an assistant professor of voice and music at Morehouse College.
an honor for me to introduce to you now Timothy Miller.
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
gave proof through the night that her flag was still there.
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O the land of the free and the home of the brave.
Where the storm clouds gather, far across the sea, let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair as we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.
God bless America, land that I love, stand beside her, and guide her,
Through the night with light from above, from the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans,
White with a foam, God bless America, my home, sweet home, God bless America,
My home, sweet home.

Council come to order, we're moving on to morning orders and I should clarify it's a morning order today. There will just be one.
The chair recognizes Speaker Ralston for a morning order.
Thank you very much Madam Speaker.
On November the 26th, this house lost one of its best.
So I thought it only fitting and appropriate that we pause on this first day of session
to remember a very special colleague.
J. Powell loved this house.
He regarded it as a place where good sound policy was formulated, not a place to be burned
down.
For members who sincerely wanted to understand the legislative process, there was not a better
member of this body.
And it didn't matter if you were Democrat or Republican, rural, urban or suburban, female
or male, didn't matter the color of your skin or whether you have been here for a few
days or several years.
Jay was incredibly generous with his time and talent.
You know, we were truly blessed that he passed our way in that for a season we had the
the benefit of His brilliant mind, His wise counsel, His kind heart, and His humble spirit.
J. Powell had a strong and deep-seated conviction about right and wrong, and he could be a
little stubborn.
You know, we live in an era, I never thought we would get to, where there are some coming
into the political process and they self-advertise themselves as being principled.
And sometimes it helps that they do that, because otherwise you might not know.
Jay listened to and followed that inner voice of conscience and the political consequences
could be damned. He never had to tell you about his principles or his righteousness. You just knew.
Nothing made him happier than discussing and analyzing policy options to advance a particular
objective. And one of the objectives that was most important to him was the revitalization of
of rural Georgia, because J. Powell was truly a son of Southwest Georgia. Wherever the
road led, it always came back to Quitman, Camilla, or Valdosta. As a founder of the House
The Role Development Council back in 2017, he brought an intense passion and unrivaled
work ethic to the goals of the RDC.
And I want to tell you today that because of Jay Powell's leadership, Southwest Georgia,
and particularly future generations of young people there will have greater opportunities
in a better quality of life. This house will miss Jay Powell. His passing leaves us with
a void. He was a model of legislative leadership and that model is now gone. A public servant
who believed that civility was a virtue and not a sign of weakness. One who believed that
The power of ideas could be expressed
just as effectively in a normal conversation
as by loud or angry.
I will miss J. Powell.
I will miss seeing those reading glasses
push back on his head.
That ever present cup of coffee.
The countless hours we spent discussing legislation and I'd love to go to one more Georgia football
game and watch him sleep through it.
Jay Powell had no problem in telling me no.
He did not hesitate to let me know when I was getting off the track or how I could do something
better.
And you know, he did that because he was my friend for as much as I hurt over his
loss. I can't even wrap my brain around the pain and loss of Deedra and the
family. And Deedra, we're honored that you're here this morning. But we will and
And we are moving forward because he would not just want us to, he would expect us to.
And we can take comfort knowing those of us who did not get to tell him goodbye that
we'll see him again.
So to the chairman, thank you my friend and I'll see you down the road.
Madam Speaker, I yield the will.
The clerk will read a resolution.
House Resolution 877 by President Burns 159th resolution to notify the Senate that the House
of Representatives has convened and for other purposes.
Chair recognizes the gentleman from the 159th
the majority leader of the house, Mr. Burns.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, and Mr. Speaker, thank you for that
remembrance of our dear friend.
This morning we have to make sure that the Senate
and those were here and I heard they had a little technical difficulty over there this morning.
Unlike house members who know how to roll up their sleeves and go to work as it was demonstrated
with representative Williams yesterday as our colleagues moved chairs around and got everything
ready for the Tillman Convocation. The staff was not in this morning and the senate didn't
did not know where the light switch was. So they were a little slow, they were a little slow getting
going but um finally the staff came in and they were able to get started with
there so as as our duty is to um notify the Senate HR 877 does just that
and mr. Speaker I would ask that we are favorably adopt house resolution 877
notified the Senate that we're here and we're ready to go to work mr. Speaker I
yield the well you have no questions the majority leader has moved that this
House Adopt House Resolution 877 Notifying the Senate that the House of Representatives
has convened.
Is there any objection to the adoption of the resolution?
The chair here is none in the resolution is adopted.
The chair appoints as a committee of notification the following members, Representative Gaines
of the 117th Representative Weed Hour of the 119th Representative Fry of the 118th Representative
Bershit of the 176th Representative Earhart of the 36th and Representative Prince of the
one hundred and twenty-seven.
Clerk will read House Resolution 878.
House Resolution 878 by Robson to Burns in the hundred and fifty-ninth.
A resolution calling a joint session of the House of Representatives in the Senate for
the purpose of hearing a message from the governor.
Inviting the Justice of the Supreme Court and the Judges of the Court of Appeals
be present at the joint session.
Chair recognizes the majority leader of the House to explain House Resolution 878.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As is our tradition each year, we hear from the governor on the state of the state, and
That will be this Thursday at 11 a.m. January the 16th.
Ms. Speaker, I would ask for the favorable adoption
of House Resolution 878.
You have no questions.
The majority leader has moved that House Resolution 878,
calling for a joint session of the General Assembly
to receive the State of the State
from his Excellency, the Governor of Georgia,
be adopted. Is there any objection? Is there objection that chair here's none in the resolution?
Is adopted. House will be at order. House will come to order. We have one more resolution,
But before we get to that, I want to introduce to you the doctor of the day.
It would not be the first day of the session if Dr. Bobby Kaufman weren't our doctor of
the day.
He, I know he's a friend of many of you and he is a friend of mine, follows in some great
footsteps of his father who I think I actually established the doctor of the day program,
didn't he?
Dr. Kaufman is board certified in internal medicine. He earned his medical degree at Morehouse School of Medicine, and has practiced here in Atlanta since 1989 at the Kaufman Clinic, which has offices here and in Woodstock.
He's a lifelong resident of Atlanta,
where he resides with his wife and 17-year-old twins.
I can vouch that he enjoys golf
and is very involved with the Alzheimer's Association.
And for the last 18 years has served as chairman
of the James A. Kaufman golf tournament,
which has raised over two and a half million dollars
for the Alzheimer's Foundation.
Please give a great house welcome
to Dr. Bobby Kaufman.
Applause
It's quite an honor to be here.
I think back over the years that I started as a six or eight-year-old following my dad
down to the Capitol and then served a day, then would come down as a page.
you're a kid, it was a great way to miss a day of school. But this is my 30th year of
coming down here, which is hard to believe. So many familiar faces and so many friends
that I have down here and I'm very grateful for that. My office is right around the corner
and I'm always glad to help and I'm also easy to reach and it's quite an honor. But the
The doctor is important, but the single most important person for the medical aid station
is our nurse, and that's Ms. Julia Mack over there, so make sure you all know her because
she's the one who's really important.
And again, thank you, and hopefully I don't have to see any of you of y'all, but I'm always
happy to.
The House Resolution 879 by Representative Burns, 159th, a resolution relative to meetings
and adjournments of the General Assembly.
Chair recognizes the majority later to explain the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This is the one y'all want to know something about, I think.
So if you will, it's on the board.
Mr. Speaker, as they look at the, as if there's any questions on this first adjournment resolution,
I do have a question for you.
I was wondering if in the dictionary, when they explained the meaning of tenor, I'm wondering
if there's not a name there of Timothy Miller.
not there should be. Absolutely should be. No doubt about that. As y'all see, you can
look through it. We're in four days this week. Certainly out for Mr. Chairman is
that correct. We're out for budget hearings on Tuesday, Wednesday and block on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday morning and block grants Thursday afternoon. And then we come back
on the 27th, which of course is Monday, and we're in five days, then the first week
of February, we're in those four days and this resolution carries us through Monday, February
the 10th, Legislative Day 14.
There are any questions I'll be glad to try to answer them, Mr. Speaker, but I think
it's pretty self-explanatory.
You do not appear to have any questions.
Ms. Speaker, I would ask for the favorable consideration of House Resolution 879, and I will also say that
we work very closely with Leader Dugan in the Senate, and as we work on this resolution, we appreciate
this cooperation in that of the Senate.
Ms. Speaker, again, I would ask for the favorable consideration of House Resolution 879 and I yield
the well.
before the body is only adoption of House Resolution 879, all those in favor of the adoption
of the resolution will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted?
If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of House Resolution 879.

This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted.
I don't know how many times this will happen this session, but today we have no announcements.
We have no birthdays, and we will be doing page photographs
at the rostrum immediately upon adjournment.
No other business to come before the house.
The chair recognizes the majority leader,
