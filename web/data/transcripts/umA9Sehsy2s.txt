Mr Clark If you read the caption to
House Bill
504 504 house rule 504 by representative
Hatchet to the 155th to be entitled not
to amend code section 20 to 164. the
official go to Georgia annotated
relating to local five mil share funds
so it's exclude amounts attributable to
level 10 free Port exemptions for
purposes of calculating this bill I
refer to the committee on education that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute
chairman Hatchet is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker this is not a
simple Bill
House Bill 504 removes the value of
level one Freeport exemptions from the
equalized property tax Digest
for the purpose of calculating local
five mil share and Equalization within
the QBE formula this does not have
anything to do with removing the ability
of counties to establish Freeport
exemption but what it does do is it
takes that out of the QBE formula so
that or because school systems have no
control over the establishment of
Freeport exemption it's determined at
the county level so what this does is it
equalizes everything so your school
systems don't have to worry about what
what as far as Freeport exemption in
their in the calculation of QBE
and I will try to answer any questions
if there are any
you have a question to your left
representative Jasmine Clark has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes so you're right this was not a
simple bill
so to clarify what this reduce the
amount of money
that goes into that once you calculate
the QBE would it reduce it or increase
it or not change it at all it it
possibly will increase the amount of
money that goes into qba and QBE
Equalization
over the next few years but it will
change the calculations for all the
systems it could change what's required
for local five mil share it could change
what you get for Equalization those we
really don't know until
until it happens so did the gentleman
further yield yes so it could increase
but could it definitely not decrease or
could it also decrease it could do all
of what you said okay thank you
chairman you for one more question yes
speaker chairman Martin to your right
has a question
chairman chairman Hatchet to Yale yes
sir isn't what you're doing here is if a
County school board has no Chin no
choice in the matter of taking something
off the tax roll which is what Freeport
does isn't it true that what this bill
will do is not count that against them
when their five mil share is being
calculated so it would actually be a
more fair way to just distribute the
money it may add it may take away across
the state but isn't that what you're
trying to do with the bill correct thank
you
gentleman has no further questions thank
you Mr Speaker and I will yield the will
and ask for your favorable consideration
thank you Mr chairman the gentleman has
yielded the well is there any objection
to the previous question being ordered

thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house I Rise to present
House Bill 514 the bill has three parts
uh the first bill the first portion uh
deals with moratoriums on single-family
residential construction
and the bill proposes that local
governments would be limited on those
moratoriums to a time period of 180 days
after that they could not impose an
additional moratorium for for an
additional 180 days now I would want you
to know that the Georgia Municipal
Association and the association of
County Commissioners had come had some
concerns about this language and I asked
them to bring suggested language that we
included in the bill which basically
gives some conditions that that time
period can be extended and those things
are things like a state of emergency
declared by a federal state a local
emergency management agency a natural
disaster
any other set of conditions or
circumstances it might pose a danger to
health or safety also an order for any
from any federal state or local agency
with jurisdiction over the government
that ordered them to extend it and then
lastly if they had engaged a
professional firm to do some sort of
Consulting work relative to that sort of
development and that work was not
finished they can extend the moratorium
until the work is finished we did ask
for GMA and accg to suggest language and
that was the language they suggested and
we negotiated with them to put that in
the bill the third the second portion of
the bill has to do with limiting fees
permitting fees to the cost not to
exceed the cost of administering that
permitting process the last portion of
the bill
allows local governments does not
require but allows local governments to
waive fees on housing that is for units
that are 2500 square feet or less
if they choose to do so in order to
incentivize more single-family
construction Mr Speaker that is the bill
and I urge a favorable consideration
from the members of the house and I am
available for questions
okay the gentleman's beautiful for
questions to your left representing
Stacy Evans has a question
Mr Speaker does the gentleman yield yes
ma'am what was the magic of 180 days and
did the committee or you consider other
time periods and if so why were those
rejected uh we were asked to look at
this issue by the uh Home Builders
Association of Georgia and actually
there was a suggestion for a shorter
time period actually there was a
suggestion of 90 days but uh we we felt
that 180 days
was acceptable do you yield further yes
ma'am
did you hear from any local governments
for example the city of Atlanta or
others that had wanted a longer period
and if so why did you not consider a
longer period in this bill
well we did hear from the city of
Atlanta actually we invited them in to
talk about this bill and another housing
Bill we were doing
um we just felt like that this would be
something that would be acceptable
uh to put that time period on it thank
you
gentlemen yield
yes remember Roberts from the 52nd has a
question thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield yes ma'am isn't this
bill
uh isn't it true that this bill does not
deprive any of the local governments
from denying a zoning application or a
building permit it's simply puts some
controls on some of these blanket
moratoriums that we've seen in some
jurisdictions and by providing those
exceptions you have that the ACC G and
GMA have given you it it really doesn't
pose much of a risk because if there's
something serious the cities can still
impose longer isn't it true yes ma'am
this bill does not affect their ability
to do zoning it is about moratoriums on
single-family Construction
representative Darlene Taylor straight
out in front of you has a question does
the gentleman yield yes ma'am Madam
chair does this bill make
um it availability for developers to
move forward when local governments
don't feel like they have the roads
under control or school um
taken care of if it's not ready and
prepared to assume this new growth
well it allows them to declare
moratorium for any reason for 180 days
but they are they cannot continue to
extend moratoriums over and over again
does the gentleman further yield yes
ma'am what happens at the 180 days if
school projects haven't been addressed
or roads aren't prepared or Water
Systems aren't in place will they be
able to move forward without that
yes ma'am according to this bill they
could not refuse to permit single-family
construction after 180 days
thank you
representative fry to your left has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker this is gentleman
yield
always for my friend
president Boston isn't it true that I
fully applaud you for the work that you
have done
lifting the heavy loads for the
single-family construction industry at
this time of its most necessary time of
existence when we're in the middle of a
housing crisis isn't that true if the
gentleman saw states do you further
yield yes sir isn't it true that this
bill does not take away one single
zoning power
of our municipalities or our counties
and that if these counties or
municipalities wish to
not have a single family zoning then
they wouldn't have to be affected by
this bill at all is that correct
outstanding
um
does the gentleman further yield yes sir
all right isn't it true that you are the
one of the few Representatives that
actually heard our state leadership
when they said we needed to do something
to reign in the municipalities
and get more doors in the market
and build more homes for people in this
time of an unprecedented housing crisis
in the state of Georgia is that not true
that is true sir
thank you
gentlemen yield I will
we have a lot of bills let's see
chairman David Knight to your right has
a question thank you Mr Speaker to my
friend well do you heal
uh yes I do you Mr chairman to my good
friend I I do have this is a serious
question I know that in some communities
some counties
uh perhaps moratoriums have been put put
in place because of a rush if you will
an influx of of a lot of Development
coming
isn't it true though that some of these
counties may not be prepared from a
point of view of
permitting in regards to having the
infrastructure needed to do the
permitting process for for instance
epd issues uh clearing permits those
sort of things
how would this affect those those
counties that are trying to deal with
preparing and setting up the
infrastructure within that local County
Government
to properly prepare for
new in an onslaught in some cases of
these residential facilities
that's my concerning question to my
friend
well thank you I think the best way to
answer that question is if if a if a
local community has a lack of sewer
capacity for instance
well they can't issue sewer taps and so
a permit to build a house could not be
issued this this the intention of this
bill has been that for communities who
just
don't want any more growth but don't
have these issues that are being pointed
out
uh the intention is that we all know
that our state is growing and growing
rapidly and the people have to have a
place to live and we are always
applauding that growth and applauding
the growth of the industry is coming
the reality is if a local community can
just declare a moratorium
and say well we just don't want anybody
else coming
well then we're allowing them to build
economic walls around that County and
City
and I just uh the intention of the bill
is not to hinder them or put them in a
difficult situation because they don't
have infrastructure it is to control
those candidates who decide that they
just don't want any more growth right
now and they're trying to stop that
growth
Mr Big I will yield for an additional
question if needed chair lady Smith
straight down the front aisle has a
question
gentlemen yield yes ma'am first of all
thank you for all the hard work you put
into this and you have identified a
problem before our state for housing is
that not true yeah yes ma'am it is the
concern in the area where I live is that
my single family homes
are having developments coming in
that would need better roads and access
in other words they're going to be
landlocked with poor traffic control is
it not true that this moratorium could
be used as a negotiating fool tool to
outlast this concern therefore creating
the opening the door or opening the gate
to have to develop without giving
quality of life access to Transportation
around their communities
into the lady show States
chairman Powell to your right in the
back has a question
thank you parliamentary inquiry
do you have a question I'm sorry well
the gentleman yield uh yes sir Miss Jim
is it not true that this bill that you
presented in no way stops local
governments from being able to control
growth in their in their jurisdiction
given the tools that they have in their
tool boxes
yes sir that is true is it not true that
you also worked in uh in in good faith
with accgg and GMA and y'all came up
with additional language that would
exempt certain parts of that moratorium
uh that is true Mr chairman is it not
further true that this bill needs to
move forward because of a lot of
misinformation it was put out across
this state to the intent of this bill
but at the end of the day that these
local governments once they do a
six-month moratorium they need to reach
down and solve the problems they have by
using all the resources that they have
if the chairman so States and I agree
with that assessment further question is
it not time for you to sit down
Mr chairman I am sure that is corrected
well Mr Speaker I asked for the house
the favorable consideration of the house
on this bill that the GMA and the accg
are not in opposition to in fact spoke
in favor of in the committee meeting and
with that I will yield the well thank
you Mr Speaker

McCullum rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it true that if a city or I mean if a
County uh does a moratorium on
residential housing they are are don't
do a moratorium on Industrial and
Commercial and when they do that they
put unburdened uh more burden on the
counties around them to to be bedroom
houses for those industry that the
industrial sites that they do in their
County and themselves and not let
housing in for those industrial sites
if the gentleman sow States I'm sure he
believes that to be true and I've heard
that before as well
for what purposes representative Carter
rise
parliamentary inquiry statue inquiry
isn't that true that lines 19 through 23
restricts a county or a city from
extending a moratorium for six months
after the six months have passed even if
that city or county needs that time for
development is that not true

chairman from down in Ocilla Georgia
chairman purple is recognized to present

thank you Mr Speaker he may have enjoyed
the apple tart we had in the Auntie room

tough tough a tough sell this allows
student finance to adjust the HCT score
to be equivalent to a 1200 SCT as it
relates to the zyl Miller scholarship uh
it's a pretty simple good government
bill
um
thank you Mr chairman Mr Speaker I
ask that everybody vote Yes on this one
I'm sorry Mr chairman you had a couple
of questions do you mind standing in the
well yes sir
to your right representative Jason
Ridley has a question you're extreme
right
it's a gentleman yield yes sir I will
all right first of all uh is it not true
that that was not an apple tart that was
a fried apple pie
uh and secondly is this going to be
retroactive or when will this go into
effect if we change this
um so this does go in effect in uh July
of uh first of 2024 not retroactive to
where you could take advantage of it uh
Mr representative uh regarding the pie

gentlemen yo for another question yes
sir representative glaze is recognized

does a gentleman yield yes sir I will
does this actually go up or lower or the
percentage So currently the s.a.t uh the
75th percentile is 20 is 1200 uh the ACT
currently encode at 26 is 82nd
percentile uh so this will put the ACT
down at 25 to be roughly equivalent so
while we had them we have one more
question he was right there next to you
but we'll do it this way chairman Martin
has a question to your right gentleman
Neil yes sir to further explain the
gentleman's question isn't it true that
currently the 1200 sat uh yields you
have to make about a third uh a 12 30 to
be equivalent to the 26 on the act so in
this particular case should it have been
done this year the ACT would have gone
down to a score of 25 instead of 26. it
would make more people able to get the
the
um the Zell Miller scholarship yes sir
make it if you will easier for people to
attain excellence

thank you Mr Speaker colleagues this
will be a quick explanation House Bill
611 does one thing any settlement
proceeds that the state receives if we
pass this bill today anything after June
1st any settlement proceeds will be
appropriated by the general assembly
versus being appropriated through a
trust or any other mechanism if you
recall last year we had the opioid
settlement agreement those dollars were
allocated to a trust and then the trust
appropriates those funds outside of the
general assembly this would require that
any state proceeds for a settlement to
the state of Georgia will be
appropriated by the general assembly
which would originate
in the house

house for 196 by represent Apollo the

amend article 9 of chapter 12 of title
16 either fish go to George annotated
relating access to medical cannabis
shows provide that the Georgia access
the medical cannabis commission shall be
subject to the administrative procedures
Act
this bill Everman for the committee on
Judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chairman Powell is recognized to present
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker and ladies and
gentlemen with the house I bring to you
this afternoon house bill 196. this bill
is is the product of a couple years of
work now for the benefit of all the new
members in here I want to give you a
brief time frame seven years ago we
passed the medical cannabis act to allow
those people who qualified for the
doctor's excuse to get a medical
cannabis card
well that was seven years ago
and I remember it was probably one of
the most touching scenes I'd ever seen
in this house that we had families we
had children we had all of those folks
that through all the Sciences had
decided that cannabis oil was actually a
cure-all it wasn't the double weed of
the old it had been portrayed over the
years
four years ago this legislature passed
the Cannabis Act
to allow for the licensing of six
Growers and those processes to refine
the oil and to open up dispensaries four
years ago ladies and gentlemen
and there were some flaws in the bill
and I'll tell you throughout the
presenting the bill itself what they
might have been but there were flaws
along the way
well that was four years ago
well there was a lot of stuff that was
subject to us to look at now your
regulated industry's committee
by no means could I say that that commit
is lightweight and I want to thank the
members both past members of the last
three years and this year for bearing
this commit this process out
last year we had hearings we brought in
the people from over to cannabis
commission but yet in no time could they
even testify or to acknowledge any
information to a standing house
committee
and their view was that in the law that
they didn't have to and they were sworn
to secrecy well I would tell you as a
lesson not just to this exercise but all
legislation all government agencies need
to be subject to administrative
procedures and open records but that was
four years ago
because of the process of their how they
did their evaluations there was a number
of protesters nine protesters that took
it to the to the mat they hired a filed
their protests they went to court and
that process is tied up into the court
of appeals right now and several other
jurisdictions which it could be go on
and on and there's tros out there that
have stopped the other four from being
licenses being issued until this is
heard in the courts now that being said
I will remind you that there's two
classes the two class one licenses they
were issued a license before the tro
kept literally days before the tro
kicked in to stop them so these two so
these two licenses they're in full
operation getting ready to open up and
I'll talk a little bit later about what
we've done is what has happened is that
they have actually created
a monopoly of two in this state and
that's not the intention I don't think
it's the intention of this legislature
because of things happen when you have a
monopoly so that being said I want to
get into the guts of this bill
and I would thank a lot of people in
here a lot of this is uh my original uh
and regulated Industries our original
um
a way to solve this problem was a
straight shot
and that was to give all of those
protesters to give them a license
because they had standing in the courts
and to give them a license to get get
them out of court so that this process
could go on and thanks to a lot of the
work of the leadership and some other
folks here there were some changes that
were made into this and it might be a
little bit better for a lot of people's
taste to do that but I want to go
through the bill with you if you would
look on section one this puts the
Cannabis commission under the
administrative procedures act and open
records
something that will guarantee that
questions can be asked and the whole
process can be viewed in section two
this defines that they will also be
under the department of administrative
Services rules and regs when issuing of
contracts
at the end of that section two this says
that any appeals from a final decision
will be made to the Georgia Statewide
business Court
that's quite an interesting change and I
think that might bring a lot of a lot of
the issues about these appeals to bear
section three it adds a dispensary
one of the things that we did that all
of the those are licensed were
authorized to have five dispensaries
this opens it up so that they can have
an extra Dispensary on the location of
the grow processing center
something that if you go to other states
that some of me we visited several years
ago there was always a dispensary that
was Affiliated in a separate building
attached to the grow processing center
so that makes it a little bit more
applicable as far as dispensing these
medicines
if you'll look at the bottom of section
three
this would allow dispensaries to also
sell the product of the other
dispensaries in the other drawer and the
distillers of this oil
what that does is this thing is becoming
more and more specialized every year
we have had interviews with different
companies and that now certain Growers
they're perfecting through their
biological sciences in the agricultural
sciences that they're they're blending
and they're doing a lot of things with
cannabis oil to narrow in on specific
diseases
specific diseases so basically One
commercial operation may not have the
particular oil of medicine that would
satisfy one but it would satisfy this
all but they can sell from other
dispensaries
if you look at the top of section four
This spells out clearly that personal
information that information that they
may have about
Cannabis cards or Physicians information
and all that and trade secrets are not
that they are that is not opened and not
subject to open records for the obvious
reason that a patient's personal
information or Trade Secrets should be
section five and six oh this is a little
complicated but I'm going to give you
this information as in tandem
right now there's nine protests you have
two class ones that's been issued you've
got four tentatively uh that will be
issued and you've got nine protesters
this will allow the Cannabis Commission
to issue up to nine more licenses no
more than a total of 15 total but that
would give them the latitude to do what
they need to do I've been asked the
question does this guarantee that the
protesters will get a license no it
doesn't
this gives a cannabis commission the
authority to do it if they so wish so
that then itself might be a step forward
to solving this dilemma
section 7
puts a commission again under the open
records law and it eliminates any
secrecy of any of their activities
Section 8 it creates a future path
something that I had talked to some of
the leadership that they had brought up
to me that at some point it needs to be
a future path for more of these
distilleries or the growing operations
or whatever you wish to call them and
that's the the system in here that for
every 5 000 patients that are prescribed
the low THC oil on the registry there
could be a Class 2 license issue if
there's ten thousand more there could be
a class one and again that would be at
the discretion of the Cannabis
Commission
section 8.
nine and ten this deals specifically
with Georgia Statewide business courts
to say that they will have jurisdiction
exclusive jurisdiction over appeals and
any grievances that may be filed and
that's in section 9 10 and 11. number 12
something that I truly believe should
have been put into the original bill
this is a financial disclosure this says
that each member of the commission shall
file an annual Financial disclosure
statement with the office of the
Inspector General no later than July the
first of each year
this is just a little bit of good
government ladies and gentlemen
and then last but not least in section
13
. uh there's about two or two dozen
illnesses that are defined in a law that
would be acceptable to get a cannabis
card this adds two more that the
Committees himself uh ulcerative Goliath
colitis that was a product of the former
representative Mike wolinski last year
and my stevia
gravis whatever that may be and but I
have no idea that the committee knew
from whence they worked on that that is
something that probably needed to be
added that ladies and gentlemen is a
bill
I would give us I would give a footnote
to this
I had said in the committee that this is
about money and it is about money we saw
who the lobbyists were hired we saw all
of these folks
uh because of the process and what
happened in the process
and a lot of that in my opinion was
strictly due to no open records and no
administrative procedures Act
that there were errors there were some
major heirs both in the grading of how
things were graded and things such as
that
but it's time for us to move on
this isn't about us this is about the
people of Georgia
I remember what got me actively involved
in this several years ago when I made
the comment from this very well
did anything that God lets grow
naturally has got to be better in
something manufactured in a laboratory
and if you don't believe that you hadn't
seen how many folks are addicted to
prescription drugs
I saw these children that came to this
Capitol
I have a personal stake in this not a
family member but the friends of a
family member that I that I grew up with
these folks they had a grandchild that
was born 12 years ago with severe
seizures
that child had seizures every 30 seconds
and because of that was has never been
able to develop
that child is 12 years old now
but after this cannabis oil was
recommended to that family
the mother had to move out of the state
luckily the family had resources that
were available and the mother moved out
of the state took an apartment in
Colorado
to provide the medicine for that child
ladies and gentlemen that's a shame and
it's a disgrace

passed an issue forward and foul
bureaucracy did not move it forward but

advocating for this bill because it

170 would update our tax code that so
that we're beginning to tax products
digital products that you download on
your phone so to make sure that we have
parity across our taxation system
currently if I go buy a book at book
Barnes Noble I pay sales tax but if I

field and I'll yield for any questions
you have no you have a question I'll
take the one representative Moore to

house for 101 by representative Crowe
with 118 to be talented knack to amend
chapter seven a title 48. the fish go to
George annotated relating to income
taxes so it's to change certain
definitions regarding such taxes and to
provide an effective date this bill Evan
referred to the committee on ways and
means that committee recommends this
bill do pass by committee substitute
the gentleman down
ey County representative Crowe is
recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues uh as stated this is House
Bill 101's committee substitute
lc-432771 s and it deals with uh several
different tax credits uh qualified
redirected tax liability credits uh part
one of the bill
deals with the Georgia or rural Hospital
tax credit Georgia heart program makes a
couple of changes to that program with
some definitions of of what those
hospitals are
the biggest changes is it changes the
aggregate amount of tax credit that
allowed from 75 million dollars to 80
million dollars and it increases the
amount uh that a pass-through entity can
contribute per year from ten thousand
twenty five thousand uh it also extends
the sunset uh to December 31st of 2028.
part two deals with the student
scholarship organizations the only
change in that is it increases aggregate
amount of tax credits by 10 million
dollars to 130 million dollars for 2024
year
part three adds a new tax credit for a
qualified mortgage loan originator
um which essentially it defines Habitat
for Humanity and other type
organizations that would qualify under
this this will have a 10 million dollar
per year aggregate limit with two
million dollars per year per entity
it'll be a five thousand dollar limit
for individual filers ten thousand per
year for married couples filing jointly
and ten thousand for pass-through
entities it will also have a sunset of
December 31st 2028.
and then lastly part four will deal with
the uh education to the Georgia Peach
program which are uh qualified credits
to Public Schools grants to public
schools and the peach program folks
asked us to extend the Sunset date on
that which we did which is December 31st
2028 and that's the essentials of the
bill Mr Speaker and I would yield for
questions
gentleman yield
yes sir I do
to your extreme left representative Mary
Francis Williams has a question
does the gentleman yield yes ma'am I do
so this bill
you said
um
expands the rural Hospital tax credit to
include rural freestanding emergency
departments can you talk to me a little
bit about what that would look like and
are there any emergency freestanding
emergency rooms in Georgia at this point
uh yes ma'am I believe there are um
there are several of these freestanding
emergency departments that may not be
some of your local emergency facilities
that may not quite be attached to a
hospital that could have an emergency
department so
I I didn't think we had I did not think
that we allowed freestanding emergency
rooms in Georgia
to the bill so we do from the Georgia
heart program folks
gentleman yield I do
represent representing Wilkerson
in the back on your left
has a question gentleman's recognized
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I do
I guess I've received a number of calls
regarding the increase in the money for
student scholarships by 10 million
dollars
I believe is that the program that takes
public money and and allows it to be
redirected to private schools
no sir what it does is it allows
somebody to take their tax liability and
donate it to the organization of their
choice much like the rural Hospital tax
credits due and the Georgia Peach
program does so they can they can choose
to uh pay their tax liability their
state tax liability to those
organizations or their Habitat for
Humanity or the peach program or the
rural Hospital program does the
gentleman further yield for one more
question I do
so in essence my for the ssos I do
someone can give to this organization
but the end recipient because we're not
using the appropriation process the end
recipient of those funds are private
schools correct yes sir thank you
gentlemen yield I do
chairman Carpenter to your right and
back has a question gentleman's
recognized thank you uh does the
gentleman yield yes sir is it not true
that this this SSO program that you're
speaking of actually saves the state
taxpayer money and is it also not true
that in the budget that chairman
Hatchett just presented we fully funded
QBE
yes sir you're correct on both of those
items
gentlemen yield for another question
yeah I'll take one more Mr Speaker
representative Maynard to your right has
a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes ma'am is it not true that the
students that benefit from this tax
credit scholarships at the private
schools are usually minorities and
disadvantaged children
there seems to be some debate on that
man but I I do believe that to be the
case in in many instances
and further Yelp I do
is it not true that I have many students
within my community that have benefited
from these credits that the state allows
to private schools if the lady so States
yes Maryland thank you Mr Speaker I will
uh
ask for favorable consideration and
yield the wealth
the gentleman has yielded the well we do
have a speaker signed up on this bill
chair recognizes whip Park
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to oppose
House Bill 101 there are a lot of good
Provisions in this bill including the
rural Hospital tax credit and the
Habitat for Humanity tax credit however
I encourage all members to vote no to
send a message that this bill still
needs to be perfected
on line 155 as if you mentioned as a few
members have already mentioned the bill
increases at the tax credit for student
scholarship organizations or vouchers by
another name by 10 million dollars
beginning in 2024 and for all subsequent
years
this bill puts tens of millions of
dollars into a program with little
oversight that's already received
hundreds of millions of dollars since it
was first created in 2008 and has fallen
short of serving the state's
economically disadvantaged children as
revealed by a review of State records
that found the tax credit favors
children from middle class and wealthier
families over those from low-income
backgrounds
at the same time on lines 346 the bill
provides that tax credits for qualified
education donations to award grants to
Public Schools will be repealed in
December 31st of 2028.
the Georgia Association of Educators
opposed the provisions that I've
highlighted in this bill so I hope
you'll join me in voting no to House
Bill 101. thank you Mr Speaker ayoduo
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there an objection to the previous
question being ordered to cheer his none
the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute the chair hears

machine
[Music]
for what purpose is representative fry
rise
parliamentary inquiry nature inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker
isn't it true that I love rural
hospitals
but I just cannot vote for a bill
that's going to allow no sunset on a
private school tax giveaway
to a group of people
a group of organizations who are not
held to anti-discriminatory policies in
the rest of the policies that other
schools are held to at the state
is that not true
if the gentleman sow States I'm sure he
believes in what he speaks
what purposes represent representative
Ridley rise represents Jason Ridley Paul
Mentor inquiry
State inquiry is it not true Mr Speaker
that my son has a learning disability
and if it wasn't for these scholarships
he wouldn't be able to got the help he
needed from private school in her area
is not further true that is a farce to
think that Minority kids don't get these
because ninety percent of the kids
that's in his school or minority or
lower level and they do get these
scholarships and that's the only reason
they can go to that school
yeah if the gentleman sow States I'm
sure he knows of what he speaks
for what purposes representing Stacy
Evans rise parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry isn't it true that a number of
years ago we passed language that should
have made sure that we're getting
demographic information on the students
that are benefiting from the student
scholarship organization Awards but to
date we've yet to see those reports and
so we really do have no idea the
demographics the need the race the
gender of the students that are
benefiting from these private
scholarships
the lady so States I'm sure she has her
a fact straight
for what purpose does representative
Bentley rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true Mr Speaker that I'm I'm
really feeling some kind of way right
about now because I know in my district
we don't have hospitals in my district
and and this bill
is it not further true that this bill's
reference
rural hospitals this is a support to
rural hospitals
is that not true and I'm very I'm just
I'm just really feeling some way about
this legislation right now and what I
know that's in my district what we don't
have in my district is the access to
health care like most communities do and
so with that being said Mr Speaker is it
not true that I am going to vote Yes for
this bill
I'm sure the lady feels very strongly
and knows thoroughly what's available in
her community
have all members voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
102 the days 73 the bill haven't
received he requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed

Article 2 chapter 5 of title 16 of the
official code of George annotated

Bill 383 this bill protects those who
care for us at the hospitals already
emergency room workers inside the
hospital and outside of the hospital
teachers Transit workers paramedics they
are already protected in a similar
fashion as this bill would do this bill
will also allow all hospitals to form a
Hospital campus security police force
just like the hospital in Macon does
under a grandfathered legal statute as
well as hospitals tied to higher ed like
Emory and other schools it would allow
them to be trained and know how to get
from the front door all throughout the
high school

to hospitals in Atlanta that were
non-profit hospitals we heard an
outpouring of support from around the
state and broadened the bill nurses

representative Kennards is recognized
for a question to your left
this is gentleman yield yes isn't it
true that I believe uh crimes against
our medical Workforce should be punished
yes
is it also further true that I believe
that discretion and sentencing should be
left to the bench
I believe the gentleman has so stated
and
and to further address representative
Kennard this does not raise any
mandatory minimums it merely fits
Hospital workers into emergency room
workers teachers Transit workers and
paramedics so it's it is well
precedented and it would fit those
Hospital workers who keep us safe under
those categories as well
the gentleman has one more question than
representing Maynor to your right has a
question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes I do is it not true that
Hospitals now have de-escalation

schedule 2 Controlled Substances this
bill ever referred to the Committee on
Public Health is that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
let's give the dean of the Chatham
County delegation the honor and respect
he deserves when he presents a bill
chairman Stevens is recognized to
present the bill
Jeremy Stevens
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen the house you might recall
this bill for Pas and the physician
assistants and aprns to prescribe class
II narcotics on a very limited basis as
House Bill 369 which passed out of this
body overwhelmingly 143-12 a couple of
years ago what this bill seeks to do is
in an emergency situation that allows
aprns and PAs to write to write a
five-day supply of emergency
prescriptions of Class 2 stimulants and
if you're over 18 a hydrocodone compound
products it requires AP aprns and PAs to
have at least one year of post
licensing experience they've got to work
from Clinical experience before they're
allowed to do this it requires aprns to
have a protocol agreement Which
authorized from an authorizing physician
to allow them to do it and it requires
PAs to have a job description on file
with that position
it requires aprns and PAs to both have
one hour of continuing education and it
seeks to streamline some of the
procedures and requirements of the
composite Medical Board ladies and
gentlemen the only other state besides
Georgia that does not allow this is
Oklahoma
the alt for aprns the only other state
that doesn't allow this for Pas is
Kentucky
now I don't know about you but I trust
my physician and the and if you're in
rural Georgia this is your health care
is your PA and your APR in
Mr Speaker that's the essence of the
bill and I'll take any questions
a gentleman has no questions good I
yield a well thank you for your
consideration the chairman has yielded
the well we do have a speaker on the
measure representative owl is recognized
for
her time in the well
thank you Mr Speaker so I Rise to speak
against HB 557 let me first make clear
what these remarks are not okay these
are not remarks designed
to impugn the clinical skill or the
training of physician Assistance or
advanced practice nurses I work very
closely with many Pas and aprns and not
only do I consider them some of my
closest friends I respect them and I
would trust them to care for my own
children
these are also not remarks meant to
minimize the health care Workforce
shortages we face right particularly in
our underserved under-resourced rural
communities these problems are real and
they do need to be addressed
but the last thing Georgia needs In This
Moment is more people writing
prescriptions for opioids
as a nation we're suffering an
unprecedented epidemic of opioid
addiction and Georgia has been hit hard
in fact what we've seen is that we've
had more than a 60 rise in opioid deaths
in the past two years of recorded data
and in the medical community we know
that some of this addiction has in fact
been seated by a cultural ease in the
medical community to write prescriptions
for opioid-based pain medications okay
research shows that even just a
three-day course of opioids can increase
the risk of opioid addiction even a year
out from that initial encounter and what
we're seeing in the medical community
is that we really have to come to terms
with our role in ceding this addiction
because
I know the easiest thing in the world to
do is to write someone for a
prescription and when we increase the
number of people who can prescribe
opioids we will increase the number of
opioids being prescribed
the ability to write or refill opioid
prescriptions should not be conflated
with health care
so I deeply respect the sponsor of this
bill I really like working with him I
respect his intentions in bringing this
bill but I believe it does our patients
a real disservice that goes far beyond
the issues of Workforce or of
convenience
we do have a larger duty to protect in
this body and I therefore ask you that
you vote no on this bill and I'm happy
to stand for any questions
the lady has no questions
well excuse me one did come up if you'll
yield
to your left
representative Mary Frances Williams to
your extreme left
Dr oh I say this with a uh does the lady
yield I do I say this was the greatest
respect but considering that we are one
of
only two states that's not doing this do
you do you think that
our opioid
addiction rates are that much out of
line with all these other states
well I think we're talking about two
different things the fact that many
other states do allow this profligacy of
opioid prescriptions
is related I think to the fact that we
do have a national opioid epidemic right
also I don't think if everyone else
jumps off a bridge that we should also
does the lady further yield I do
um
isn't it true that the this is a
this has to be this is done by an APRN
and it has to be under the supervision
of a doctor
that is true however what I will note is
that oftentimes when we use uh physician
extenders or sometimes we call them it
is to handle a large volume of patients
right and as I noted sometimes the
easiest thing in the world to do is to
write a prescription because we feel
that we are serving a purpose and it's
what the patient wants
but that actually does tend to feed in
to an ease of writing more opioid
prescriptions I will note there was
actually a study that came out in a
medical journal somewhat recently that
showed that while the median ease of
writing prescriptions between Physicians
and aprns was roughly the same however
that mid-level practitioners like Pas
and aprns had more outliers in terms of
being much more quick or loose to write
these opioid prescriptions because it's
it's very easy to do it right and then
you've stopped getting the calls one one
more question please certainly so we're
not just talking about opioids though
aren't we aren't we also talking about
um ADHD drugs and I I thought this was
only for emergency situations this isn't
just any any uh nurse in any doctor's
office writing prescriptions all day
long it's in an emergency situation
under a doctor's Supervision in an
emergency situation
you are correct in that this does
include stimulants such as adderall
which is written for aadhd these are
schedule 2 drugs which do include opioid
medications but I will note again that
it allows for a five day up to a
five-day prescription of these
controlled substances and even a
three-day prescription has been shown to
increase the risk of addiction for up to
a year out so it's just about increasing
that interface for patients having an
increased ease of getting an opioid
prescription and having people who are
maybe more motivated to write these
prescriptions being able to do so
later year for one more question
absolutely chairman sayings to your left
do you yield for a question I do is it
not true that even though you may call
these individuals physician extenders
that Physicians physician assistants and
nurse practitioners are the individuals
who give most of Georgia access to
necessary Medical Care and that this
bill will further citizens in this
state's ability to get needed in crucial
care
thank you for that question I want to
re-emphasize that I work very closely
with Pas and aprns every single day that
I'm at work so this is not meant to
impugn their skill or their value to the
medical community right my point simply
is that it increases the ease with which
patients can get opioid medications and
we have seen historically that this has
led to a blooming of the opioid epidemic
in this country so this is purely a
patient safety issue
lady has no further questions
lady has yielded the well is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered the chair hears none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute the chair here
has done the committee's committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill the chair hears none
the report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill we'll vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
for what purpose does representative
sharp arise a parliamentary inquiry
State your inquiry is it true that I've
been in the medical field over 30 years
as a paramedic working with some of the
great Pas and aprns here in Georgia and
that we really really need this service
and we got to also understand that this
is still under a medical director's
protocol and that they will be able to
do this just for a short term and I
think that we should support this bill
because we need it especially in rural
Georgia we need this so if you guys just
support us on it I appreciate it
I'm sure the gentleman
knows of what he speaks is very
passionate about it
in his profession
for what purpose does represent aisle
rise parliamentary inquiry States your
inquiry is it not true that we should
not conflate the ease of writing opioid
and Controlled Substances with Health
Care at Large
I'm sure the lady believes exactly what
she says
one more
for what purpose this
representative Roman rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker is it not true that
after a severe infection I was
prescribed oxy and after three days I
almost became addicted to it and had it
not been for a doctor who knew how to
support me through that I probably would
not be here today
I'm sure the lady knows of what she
speaks and we're so glad she's well and
doing great great representative
is there any objection to the excuse me
I think we passed that point
have all members now voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine on the passage of
the bill the yeas
were
136 the Nays 38 the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
house bill 33-0
House Bill 30 by representative Carson
the 46 to be titled neck to amend
chapter one and title 50 the official go
to Georgia annotated relating the
general Provisions relative to state
government so as to provide for the
definition of anti-semitism
this bill I haven't referred to the
committee on Judiciary that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute
the gentleman from Cobb County rep
chairman John Carson is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
folks I Rise to ask you to support house
bill 30. this is effectively the same
bill that we pass as House Bill 1274
last year
141-19 overwhelmingly bipartisan in this
house last year what this bill does is
codifies a definition of anti-semitism
as adopted by the international
Holocaust remembrance Alliance or IRA
such that anti-Semitism is a certain
perception of Jews which may be
expressed as hatred toward Jews
rhetorical or and excuse me rhetorical
and physical manifestation
manifestations of anti-Semitism are
directed toward Jewish or non-jewish
individuals and their property
toward Jewish Community institutions and
religious facilities what this basically
does is ensure that when analyzing
intent behind discriminatory actions
that Target Jewish people
whether it's hate crime or illegal
discriminatory actions that there is an
allegation that the action was motivated
by anti-jewish sentiment the relevant
authorities consider as rebuttable
evidence the world's most accepted
definition of anti-semitism this
definition is adopted by about 1100
different separate governments ngos this
same legislation has been passed by
Statute in Six States including Arizona
Iowa Tennessee most recently Arkansas
several other states by executive order
and 22 by resolution
I want you to make clear that this bill
does not limit Free Speech we've
discussed that at length in chairman
gutter's uh house Judiciary Committee
I would point you to lines 30 through 35
noting that nothing into this bill
infringes upon the First Amendment
this bill is necessary why are we doing
this I know everybody saw the news
coverage and some of you experienced
the anti-semitic Flyers that were handed
that were thrown in driveways just very
hateful uh Flyers that were handed out
in driveways earlier this year
anti-semitic incidents are on the rise
and they keep Rising the Jewish people
make up less than two percent of the
state of Georgia beget prop
approximately 60 percent or more of all
the hate crimes are our Target against
Jews and Jewish facilities
groups in support of this I we have a
number of friends here in the gallery or
at least I hope we do
we we have a number of people if you
don't mind standing just one up by one
uh silently for us Dove wilker Regional
director for the American Jewish
committee
Cheryl darcinski executive director of
the Atlanta Israel coalition
Mark goldsfetter general counsel for
hillels of Georgia
Eric Robbins president CEO of the Jewish
Federation of Atlanta It's on Davidson
Regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League
Regional director of the Israeli
American Council Renee Evans Israel
advocate
Leslie Anderson executive director of
the Jewish community relations Council
and Harold Kurtz president that of the
Jewish community relations Council and
we also have support from other groups
such as Hadassah Greater Atlanta
National Jewish Advocacy Center National
Council for Jewish women on and on but I
got to tell you colleagues what what I
keep hearing more and more is why am I
hearing so much opposition to this bill
from Jews
and let me tell you
in just a moment you're going to hear
from the only Jewish lawmaker in support
of this bill but I will tell you this
there is a loud group
of quote unquote Jews that are opposing
this because they support Palestine they
do not support Israel and the in the
Jewish people
you might have some items on your desk
I left a letter both Esther and I
left a letter of support from all of
these groups which again represent over
90 95 percent of the Jews in Georgia
these are the people
to which we're trying to protect really
just all Jews but the 90 95 of them are
in support of this measure and so you're
saying who are these groups that are
speaking against
one group is called Jewish voice for
peace jvp and I'll read this this is
straight off the Anti-Defamation League
website
the Jewish voice for peace jvp is a
radical anti-israel anti-zionist
activist group that advocates for the
boycott of Israel and eradication of
Zionism
you might have heard of the Union of
Reform uh Judaism that they're against
this
here's another article reform Jewish
institutions affirm Ira working
definition of anti-semitism and on page
two of their online article
the bottom line is is we endorse the IRA
definition is a powerful tool serving
the cause of combating anti-Semitism
bests when those standards are
maintained and the definition is used to
strengthen efforts to enforce and
enhance America's existing anti-hate
crime laws
you know folks people ask me you know
John you go to a Baptist Church in Cobb
County why do you support this why are
you fighting so hard I'm fighting
because there's not enough people
fighting for the Jewish people
my the the word of God in Genesis in
chapter 12 the Lord says to Abram I will
bless those that bless Israel and I will
curse those that curse Israel
that's why I do this
Mr Speaker I know I've gone on this is
effectively the same bill as Lee had
last year
and I'll take a question if not
if there is one I will yield if there is
not I will yield it will you do have a
question yes sir I'll take one
representative Ada and Sonia has a
question for you he's over to your left
thank you Mr Speaker would a gentleman
yield yes
is it not true that the main group that
Target the Jewish community and uses
anti-semitic slurs at Jews or white
nationalists in white supremacy group
that is my understanding as well sir and
I do ask for your favorable
consideration on this with that Mr
Speaker I know the hour is late the time
is short and I'm going to yield the well
Mr Speaker
the gentleman has yielded the well we
have a couple of speakers on this bill
we'll start with representing Jasmine
Clark who wishes to speak to the issue
representative Clark
if the lady will suspend just for a
moment we allocated time on these bills
there are two folks signed up to speak
in favor and two opposed they will have
30 minutes each to be divided amongst
themselves if they wish to take that
long representative Jasmine Clark is
recognized
today I rise in opposition to hb30
but before I go any further I want to be
explicitly clear
there is no place for hate and our
beautiful diverse state of Georgia
there is absolutely positively never any
excuse for anti-semitism
none whatsoever
and when a person commits a crime
against another person because that
person is Jewish they should face stiff
penalty
that is why I am extremely proud that I
voted yes for House Bill 426 in 2020.
for those of you who aren't here in 2020
that is the hate crimes bill
if I were given the opportunity to vote
on HB 426 again I would vote Yes again
and again and again
but today I am opposed to hb30 not
because I don't believe that we that
acts of anti-Semitism need to be
punished
but because I
today I'm opposed because when this
working definition was constructed on
May 26 of 2016.
their intentions and their own words
was to adopt the following
non-legally binding working definition
non-legally binding
non-legally binding
why are we legally binding something
that was not meant to be so
if someone were to hand me a jug of
water labeled not for human consumption
what I'm not going to do is pull out a
bunch of Cups and pour it for everyone
to drink
I do believe that anti-semitic acts are
covered under the current hate crime
statute this increases the penalties if
a person selected their victims based on
race
color
religion national origin sex sexual
orientation gender mental disability or
physical disability
but by creating a definition for
anti-Semitism when anti-semitic acts are
already covered in statute it begs the
question as to why the Georgia Code does
not define
anti-black racism
or anti-latino racism or anti-asian
racism
each of these groups could make the
argument that they have been subjected
to an increase in acts of violence over
the years
and while I certainly do not believe in
partaking in oppression Olympics
I do believe that a bill such as this
may unintentionally have the effect of
having each
marginalized group
wondering where is their definition in
the code
so I'm going to close
because the hour is kind of late I know
some people are hungry
I want to talk about consensus
I'm not Jewish I don't purport to be
Jewish and so when making decisions that
come to the Jewish Community I wanted to
make sure that Jewish voices were
Amplified
I will not go so far as to qualify who
is Jewish or who is quote unquote Jewish
what I will say is that I received
approximately an equal number of emails
in favor of this bill
and opposed to this bill
that told me that there is not consensus
on this matter of this specific
definition being codified in Georgia
I say that to say that just because I
vote no on this bill does not mean I am
making a vote against Jewish people
I support the Jewish community
however I also oppose referencing
non-legally binding working definitions
in Georgia code
those two are not mutually exclusive
and with that Mr Speaker I will yield
the well
lady has yielded the well representing
Holly is recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
fortunately
I have the privilege of being
a former resident of one of our
colleagues
who
a resident in the formerly resident in
the district which is now represented by
one of our colleagues who was a
recipient of some very hateful
um
horrible
dissemination
of speech
that was against her it was against her
people
I don't believe that in any instance we
should have
our members of our community subjected
to such hate
however I realized that
one of the best things that we can do
in the face of hate
is to speak out
is to speak in love to speak in a manner
that addresses the wrong
in the end we will remember the words of
our enemies but the Silence of our
friends
these words by Reverend Dr Martin Luther
King Jr place a moral obligation on each
of us to condemn
actions like these anti-semitic Flyers
as a Young Man growing up in that area
I know that diversity is welcomed by all
especially among my Jewish friends who
I've had the privilege the privilege of
being able to have over the last 34
years
he persists because of Silence
in 2021
when a North Georgia congresswoman who
will not be named
shared an anti-semitic conspiracy theory
about space lasers
our body was largely silent
because she's in Congress and we're in
the State House many of us incorrectly
assumed that it was not our place to
speak up
but as we have learned from our drum
major of Justice it is always the right
time and place to speak out against
Injustice and hatred
we must not support a law
that seeks to criminalize the freedom of
speech and I know what it says
but if you look at the ihra's definition
it is very clear that it equates
the hate against Jewish people with
sharp criticism of the state of Israel
as a political government
despite its good intentions that is
exactly what iohra's definition of
anti-semitism does
it seeks to fight anti-Semitism by
prohibiting the criticism of a political
government
if you decide to adopt that ihra
definition of anti-semitism
and you make it illegal to criticize the
political government of Israel
how far will you go to police our words
perhaps anyone using the n-word past or
present can be charged with a hate crime
perhaps anyone who condemns critical
race Theory should be charged with a
crime perhaps anyone who says they
oppose gun restrictions even after a
mass shooting
can be charged with a crime
it would be irresponsible to offer
criticism without offering an
alternative
and that's why accordingly I propose we
adopt the Jerusalem Declaration on
anti-Semitism that has been signed by
350 Jewish Scholars around the world
the Jerusalem declaration lists 15
guidelines by identifying anti-semitism
it allows us to Monitor and to combat
anti-Semitism head-on while still
allowing legitimate political criticism
of the current Israeli government
we can add and we will defeat
anti-Semitism here in Georgia
my fellow Democrats and Republicans our
voices will unite to speak against hate
just as we did when we passed the hate
crimes legislation previously
but our voices will not be heard without
fully exercises and freedom of speech
that is defined more accurately by the
Jerusalem Declaration on anti-semitism
we must preserve our American values and
vote no on this definition of that is
provided by the ihra
but I leave you with this message of
Hope
we have the opportunity to move beyond
words
and put our fight against anti-Semitism
into action and so therefore I hope that
you join me today in accepting a better
definition through the Jerusalem
Declaration on anti-Semitism and voting
no against this
measure again
we stand in support of the Jewish people
but we can be critical of a government
without making any of those remarks
against the people who are themselves
our fellow Americans and with that I
yield the will
gentlemen has yielded the well
members give your attention to the lady
that's entering the well
members
sees conversations
representative pennich is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
hmm
colleagues friends
today I stand before you as the only
elected Jewish official in this chamber
asking you to pass
HB 30.
legislation that I had never imagined
would be necessary in Georgia in the
21st century
sadly this bill is needed that the
Jewish Community which includes my
husband my children the men and women
that I worship with have these same
protections granted to every other
religious group in Georgia
doing so does not the advance the cause
of any group it simply ensures
protection
nor does it impinge on the rights or
interests of any other group
protections for Jewish people do not
come at the expense of anyone else
except anti-semites
the ways in which hate has been brought
against the Jewish people are plentiful
throughout the ages
but I don't have to reach across the
ocean or back into history
many of you are aware of the hateful
Flyers that were distributed in heavily
Jewish neighborhoods against Metro
Atlanta just a few weeks ago
children who went out to play in their
driveways on Sunday morning picked up
baggies of hate and asked the questions
to their parents what is this
and just over a week ago various
Neo-Nazi and white supremacists
proclaimed a day of hate for the Sabbath
intending to disrupt worship across the
country
and synagogues across the country braced
for attacks
we are grateful at least in Georgia
neighbors and law enforcement stood by
us and these plans did not come to
fruition
but others were not so lucky
just this week in Los Angeles or two
weeks ago in Los Angeles two Jews were
left were shot leaving their synagogue
by a gunman who blamed the Jews for his
flunking out of dental school
that man is a member of the same group
that left the flyers on my driveway
hb30 would not stop those flyers from
being spread but would make sure that
God forbid if someone shot a Jew they
could be used as evidence of their
motive
I want to be clear about something
because it was brought up and it's
incorrect when this says this is a
legally binding definition if you just
read the bill it actually says lines 14
anti-Semitism has the same meaning as
provided for in The Advisory definition
of anti-semitism this definition is used
to discern intent by a prosecutor or
investigator only after an act of a
criminal act or unlawful discrimination
has already occurred
please understand that
and it's not that difficult if you read
the bill
in recent years in Pittsburgh in
Colleyville Texas men came into
synagogues with their Grievances and
their guns
in one case 11 worshipers were murdered
in another a brave Rabbi and congregants
were able to overpower their attacker
under these circumstances a bill of this
type should be uncontested
it gives our legal system a clear
definition of anti-semitism so that
existing anti-discrimination laws our
own hate crime law can be applied with
the most acceptable definition
just to be clear be just because they
hate crime law says it's against
religion does not mean a swastika would
be considered anti-Semitic
a swastika does not go against my
religion there is nothing in the Torah
about a swastika
you need a definition
to be able to say that a swastika is
anti-Semitic it's as simple as that
things that you would think would be
obvious are not obvious and I'll get to
an example in a moment but that is all
this is and it has been twisted and
contorted into making something it's not
and I don't know why
this should be obvious that calling for
the killing or harm of a particular
group is wrong even if they are Jews
that blaming all members of a group for
real or imagine wrongdoing committed by
a single member of that group is wrong
even if they are Jews
the path of this bill has been torturous
some claims that you have heard have
been that it might stifle speech or that
a definition of anti-semitism that
includes any mention of Israel for use
in assessing intent as part of the hate
crime conflates two different issues
unfortunately those who traffic and hate
have already scrambled that egg and I'm
sorry to say that some of my colleagues
have been caught up in that
and this bill is our state's best
opportunity to restore the distinction
between the criticism of Israel which is
completely Justified and allowed
and hatred of Jews which is a wall that
has been slowly chipped away
the definition literally says that
criticism of Israel like any other
country is not anti-Semitic
more importantly this bill does not use
a definition to deal with any speech at
all again it's only triggered by
unlawful action
our state should not and could not pass
a law prohibiting criticism of Israel
but in the last decade it has become all
the more common for hatred of Israel to
spill over into hateful language
discrimination or violence against Jews
and that's what the opponents of hb30
want cover to be able to do and I will
not give that to them and neither should
this body
in May 2021 when conflict ranged between
Israelis and Palestinians a group of men
drove to a predominantly Jewish
neighborhood in Los Angeles and
assaulted seven diners at a sushi
restaurant shouting free Palestine and
death to Jews the diners were not
Israelis they were Americans
just last week prosecutors in New York
City found that a pro-palestinian
activist went looking to beat Jews at a
pro-israel rally
well last week in an act of solidarity a
colleague the gentlewoman from the 89th
introduced her own bill against
anti-Semitism something that I
personally wouldn't do to somebody of a
marginalized Community if I wasn't a
member of that community
nonetheless our bill hb30 does not
include a finding section but her bill
does and I have put it up there I agree
with every word in the section I want to
read it to you for the record because it
applies equally to hb30
the section reads and we only had one
page up so I'm going to read before it
anti-Semitism including harassment on
the basis of actual or perceived origin
ancestry ethnicity identity affiliation
or faith remains a persistent pervasive
and disturbing problem in Contemporary
American society
Jewish people continue to be a targeted
minority in the United States
data show for instance that Jews are
consistently the most likely of all
religious groups to be victimized by
incidents of hate and that such
incidents are increasing at an alarming
rate
State officials and institutions have a
responsibility to protect citizens from
acts of hate and bigotry moded by
discriminatory animus including
anti-Semitism and must be given the
tools to do so
valid monitoring informed analysis and
investigation and effective policy
making require uniform definitions
while there could be this is the
important part where there could be no
exhaustive definition of anti-semitism
as it can take many forms the
international Holocaust remembrance
Alliance IRA
working definition which is the
definition that both hb30 and
representative Becky Evans Bill used has
been an essential definitional tool used
to determine contemporary manifestations
of anti-Semitism and include useful
examples of discriminatory anti-israel
acts that can cross the line into
anti-semitism
I'll summarize the definition has been
used by our federal government and over
30 governments around the world
recommended for use by the European
Council and the European Parliament
endorsed by the Secretary General of the
UN and of the uas policy guides over 11
and 1100 organizations have approved it
thank you to my colleague for your
support of Ira I couldn't have said it
better myself
and just to put some meat on what was
referenced in IRA
and why it's so important just this week
an activist named Sada Masood pled
guilty to conspiracy to commit the
crimes against Jews
his defense team argued in writing that
he had violently assaulted Jewish people
on at least three separate occasions
because he disagreed with the political
beliefs about Israel
but in the sentencing submission
prosecutors laid out the actual
conversations he had with Associates
about how to evade law enforcement he
told them remember don't chant out chant
out Jews it's the zionists to avoid
allegation of anti-semitism
in the words of prosecutors the veil of
anti-zionism is pathetically thin in
this case
but he tried it anyway in court that's
why we need HB 30 and that's why the IR
examples of when allegedly anti-israel
actions become anti-semitism
for a long time Georgians didn't have
protection Georgia was one of the last
states to pass a hate crimes Bill and it
took too long
the straw that broke the camel's back
was the horrific murder of Ahmad Arbury
three men targeted him solely because of
the color of his skin that's the essence
of a hate crime
the victim's race religion or national
origin is the reason for the crime
violence motivated by hate deserves
special attention in our legal system
because it is intentionally specifically
targeted at individuals because of their
personal immutable characteristics
as a result these crimes are very
personal with extraordinary emotional
and psychological impacts on the victim
and their community
so this is where we get to some of the
events that have eluded investigators
which is why we need this definition
this happened in Fulton County Public
Schools not far from here
Beth gen a mother testified testified at
the house Judiciary Committee for what
her sons went through until the
Department of Education had to step in
and threaten Fulton County
for over 18 months her sons were
terrorized with anti-semitic symbols
finding swastikas on bathroom walls
graffiti stating graffiti stating Jew
killed the Jews gassed the Jews
swastikas saying Hitler
so during the Hitler's salute in class
and screaming anti-semitic slurs it's an
experience that's still haunts them to
this day and they are still in therapy
since there was no definition they were
gaslighted and told by numerous school
officials that what they were witnessing
was not anti-Semitism that it was not a
swastika it was a symbol of peace
and the graffiti was not anti-semitism
in matters of law I know it when I see
it is not sufficient
a recent study found that half of nearly
half of all Americans say they do not
know what anti-Semitism is
it is not in the interest of justice for
all to provide it is in the interest of
all of justice for all to provide
Clarity on the bright lines of what is
and what is not
racism against Jews to prevent racist
acts from hiding behind the shield of
geopolitics and to assure that
prosecutors are not tempted to overreach
this bill is not why I came to the
legislature I came to advocate for
others for the well-being of all people
in my state but sometimes life puts us
in a particular place at a particular
time
if you have read the Bible
and I know you have
today you probably know the story of
Purim
there is an attempt to wipe out the Jews
from ancient Persia
and a Jewish woman named Esther has
found her way into the palace and finds
the weight of her the lives of her
people on her shoulders
she wonders why me until her uncle
Mordechai tells her in chapter 4 verse
14.
for if you remain silent at this time
relief and deliverance for the Jews will
arise from another place but you and
your father's family will perish and who
knows but that you have come to your
Royal position for a Time such as this
the chaplain this morning said the same
thing
Esther takes these words to heart and
convinces the King to undo the evil plan
hatched against her people
that story is taken as the Jewish
holiday of Purim which is to be observed
tonight in about an hour
when my parents named me Esther they
didn't imagine me Walking The Halls of
the Georgia Capitol in the sandal steps
of the first Esther
but perhaps like that first Esther it is
for this moment that I am here
Purim is a celebratory holiday with
costumes cookies
and a commandment to get drunk
really but I'm not going to celebrate
until we're done here
I'm here to remind us that when tyrants
and bigots have Arisen through history
they start by targeting racial and
religious minority groups including Jews
but have rarely stopped there we have a
chance to stop it here and now with our
votes thank you for your time I ask for
your favorable support of hb30 and in
the interest of time and because I am
Queen Esther for tonight I yield the
well
the lady
the lady has yielded the well chair
ladies the lady has yielded the well
cheerleader silcox is reckon silcox is
recognized to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker the hour is late
and I will be brief but I also come to
speak this afternoon in favor of HB 30.
the rise of anti-Semitism in our society
is real
in fact there is a large portion of our
population that does not understand what
anti-Semitism means
this bill will address that void that
has trapped people around us from being
understood and they are regularly
persecuted for their beliefs
this bill will be a guide and support to
prosecutors and others that wish to help
our Jewish neighbors by defining this
problem in law
I humbly ask for your favorable
consideration of hb30 thank you and I'll
yield the realm
the lady has yielded the well

we're going to move on with the rules
calendar and I'll just remind all
members of this house
as a day draws draws on and longer and
into the night probably
I'll remind you of House Bill house rule
1.3 no members speaking shall be
disrespectful to any other member and
all members shall carefully avoid
references to personalities when
addressing the house or addressing
another member in a committee meeting Mr
clerk will you read the caption to House
Bill

528
which is the Georgia online automatic
renewal transparency act I'm sure many
folks in this room have tried to cancel
online subscriptions where you signed up
online pay monthly but then in order to
cancel you got a call and sit on hold
for hours or you got to go in person and
cancel I printed out one example from a
gym membership here where you can sign
up online in order to cancel you have to
go in person to cancel even though
you're able to sign up online so what
this legislation does it simply says if
you can sign up for a subscription
online you can cancel your subscription
online it also notifies you a company if
they're going to charge your credit card
they should notify you and just let you
know they're about to charge your credit
card and so that's what this bill does

provision several times and again we
we've added one item to it House Bill

twice convicted for 13 uh felony level
sexual offenses to have a lifetime
concurrent sentence because of Park V
State uh the Georgia Supreme Court
ruling that is necessary to allow us to
do a GPS monitoring shown to be the most
effective way to deter future victims in
this area with that we will also be
adding based on the Merriam's law
advocacy a ability for a requirement for
the Department of Community Supervision
to have GPS monitoring on those awaiting
the sword leveling
um that is the there's a huge backlog of
this area as they await this is a
psychological assessment to look at how
highly high of a chance there is at risk
will work in the Senate to scope that to
the the instances that are specifically
necessary that we know are highly likely
to be dangerous sexual offenses
um in addition to this we'll also be
doing a name change at the request to
soar from the sexual offense registry
board to the review board which is more
accurate accurately reflective of their
name and with that Mr Speaker if there

thank you
for what purposes representing
representative main arise thank you Mr
Speaker is it not true that these
parliamentary inquiry sorry State your
inquiry is it not true these are the
crimes we really need to be punishing
and sentencing versus having our jails
filled with people sleeping on the floor
I'm sure the lady knows of what she
speaks I'm not sure I've fought her
completely
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will
lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
171 the Nays zero the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
foreign
will you read the caption to House Bill
364 364. House Bill 364 by
representative Holcomb the 81st to be
entitled knack to a man Article 4
chapter 5 of title 28. the official go
to George annotated relating to the
claims Advisory board so as to create
the wrongful conviction compensation
review panel this bill ever referred to
the committee on Judiciary non-civil
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
apply committee substitute
and representing Scott Holcomb is
recognized to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker it's my pleasure to
present to you house bill 364.
what this will do is it will reform the
way in which the state compensates the
wrongly convicted what we're talking
about here are the truly innocent not
those who get off on a technicality or a
procedural issue but the truly innocent
to have a process by which they can be
compensated for the time that they spent
in jail in Georgia since 1989 47 people
have been exonerated as being innocent
and they lost a total of 538 years those
were years that they were spent
incarcerated away from their loved ones
away from their ability to make a living
and so this idea is to compensate these
individuals and to set forth a structure
whereby experts will make a
determination of innocence and then make
a recommendation for compensation
there's been a lot of thought that's
been put into this bill over the last
couple years and those of you that were
here last session it was House Bill 1354
that passed with overwhelming support
the makeup of the compensation panel is
found on page four
and it would include a judge a retired
judge or retired Justice a current
district attorney a criminal defense
attorney and then individuals with real
expertise in forensics in the background
almost every
individual who has been exonerated it
has been due to DNA evidence
helping with that exoneration so this
for sets forth the process for that
um going forward I want to commend
leader illustration he worked on this
last session and actually got the ball
rolling and then we collaborated and
then I started working on it from that
point forward we've collaborated with
the various actors who would be involved
the prosecuting attorneys Council the
defense lawyers the Innocence Project
after innocence and they're all in
support of what we're trying to do here
and the bottom line is to take the
politics out of it my sense is shortly
or this evening we will consider
individual resolutions some members have
expressed to me that is very difficult
for them to make those evaluations
because they don't know enough about the
cases so this will will put that
decision into a board that has
tremendous skills knowledge and
expertise to make these decisions and
then it would go
via the courts since that is where this
error takes place it would be a
recommendation into their budget into
the the Judiciary Council so I'm happy
to go into any specifics if anybody has
any questions otherwise I will yield and
ask for your favorable consideration
thank you
you have a couple of questions gentlemen
yield yes sir I'll yield
representative Williams has a question
representative Al Williams is recognized
for a question thank you Mr Speaker will
the gentleman yield yes sir
is it not true that I'm very thankful
for you bringing this bill it has become
very cumbersome and I'll be frank with
you sometimes quite emotional so we need
to do this in a very set Manner and
thank you again in rocket Lamont Rock
Lamar thank you
to your left chairman Parsons has a
question chairman Parson is recognized
thanks speakers the gentleman yield yes
yes sir well isn't true that uh
in 2006 I believe it was that I chaired
a committee that had one of these
compensation resolutions and I know how
difficult it was and has been and ones
we've had since then and uh isn't true
that since that time there have been
some improvements that actually now
there's a recommendation from a
committee or some commission I can't
remember the name of it that there is a
recommendation with a with a set uh
recommendation for a for an amount that
we didn't even have back then
and isn't also true that I've changed my
mind over the years and I completely
agree with you and I appreciate you
bringing this bill and I completely
support you in it thank you sir thank
you
representative Fleming representing
Barry Fleming is is recognized for a
question
thank you Mr Speaker to the gym and the
well first of all isn't it true that I
appreciate your attempt to work on what
is generally a very difficult issue for
us thank you for that
uh but my question goes to this
in the numerous years that you and I
both been here every time we pay
compensation this house appropriates
that by the individual vote on an
individual case isn't that true it is
and under this system as I understand it
and I stand to be corrected if I'm wrong
but under this new system that you're
proposing these compensations will be
wrapped into a general Appropriations
bill and we will vote on her
Appropriations Bill based upon what this
committee has suggested not our
individual votes on each case is that
correct that's correct okay thank you
sir thank you
gentleman yield for another question yes
sir representative Roberts right out in
front of you to your list thank you Mr
Speaker this is the gentleman yield yes
yes
um isn't it true that it does go through
the Appropriations process and that is
the one thing this body is required to
do so we don't risk these individual
bills not making it through on Sony die
we know that these people will be
compensated who deserve to be
compensated and isn't it further true I
really appreciate this Bill thank you
yes thank you and and my understanding
is that this is the only
thing that we do chairman Hatchet could
correct me if I'm wrong that is separate
from the budget where we have individual
resolutions and so this would still have
an oversight process but instead of
having them as individual resolutions
they will go into the budget and and
very quick it's anecdotally but I think
it's worthy of of mention
last year there were two resolutions
that we did
chairman Hogan was the author of one and
I was the author of the other
one of them was the second to last bill
that was called in the Senate
at around 1208 1209 A.M
and the one that I carried was the third
to last at around 1208 and 1209 am
that's not how this process should be
handled we have to do better please vote
yes thank you

thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon

is enacted
we're going to have to continue with the
old-fashioned way of dealing with these
compensation resolutions and so I am
here asking for your favorable
consideration of house resolution 48
which would compensate Michael
stinchcomb for the 18 years that he
spent incarcerated for a crime that he
did not commit Mr steenscom was the
first person exonerated by The Fulton
conviction Integrity unit
it was determined as he had maintained
from the beginning that he shot in
self-defense what happened was he was at
a home with a co-defendant who will will
be talking about in another resolution
Mr sinscomb was in this home there was a
woman in a car who was shooting toward
the home
into the home into the Windows onto the
porch there was nowhere for Mr
stinchcomb to retreat to be safe so he
got his firearm and came and shot back
and along with a co-defendant in one of
those bullets hit the dryer hit the
person who was shooting from the car
um Mr stench called maintained from the
beginning that he had shot in
self-defense the physical evidence
supported always that he had shot in
self-defense there was a eyewitness who
was in the car with the person who was
who ultimately died who was in the best
position to see that in fact this person
was shooting toward the house that
witness was believed to be dead for a
number of years
they were found for several years the
prosecutor's office tried to keep that
eyewitness's testimony from coming
forward but ultimately the Georgia
Supreme Court said no this testimony
should be heard in order new trial and
then there was a null process a complete
exoneration and support of the
self-defense Theory defense that had
been said from the beginning Mr stench
con spent as I said 18 years
incarcerated he missed seeing his two
children grow up miss going to family
members funerals and all the things that
all of us would do in life he's now

there was no physical evidence for it

of a sweatshirt he was arrested even
though all these things were not evident
and then once he was arrested it took
and he uh evidence was withheld by the
D.A
a
public
let's see how to say it without telling
who it was
there was a police report a safety
person
uh falsely testified agency person
falsely testified against him and then
he had to wait four years to get a copy
of his transcript for the retrial
he's spent 23 years in jail and there's
no amount of money that can take the
place of what this man went through you
you can talk about compensating somebody
but there's no money for that this man's
life was just completely ruined he was a
young man and then the DNA came back
when DNA came up to be popular that the
it the DNA on that ski mask that was
found in the victim's car did not belong
to him
and he and a judge said that you
couldn't go by the DNA evidence when he

you read the caption house bill 231-231
household 231 regression of Gullah to
the 19th be entitled an act to amend
article one of chapter 18 the title 15
of the fish go to George annotated
relating to General Provisions regarding
Prosecuting attorneys so to create the
prosecuting attorney's oversight
Commission
spillover for the committee on Judiciary
non-civil that committee recommends this
bill do pass
by committee substitute
representative gullet is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
House Bill 231 is a bill that we've
passed three times in this house last
year and unfortunately uh the Senate
just didn't get to it on Sani die from a
conference committee report
what this bill does is it tries to
address willful misconduct like sexual
harassment misuse of funds as well as
persistent and blanket refusal to
prosecute cases based on political
motivations
a little bit about the bill first it
creates a prosecuting attorney's
oversight Council Commission
it's a the commission is made up of a
five-member investigative panel and a
three-member hearing panel and all those
are appointed by the Supreme Court of
Georgia
the investigative panel is responsible
for the investigative prosecutorial and
administrative functions of the
commission and the hearing panel is
responsible for
adjudicating formal charges filed
against the invest filed by the
investigative panel issuing disciplinary
and incapacency orders and issuing
standards of the commission
we've narrowed the scope the grounds for
removal for a district attorney or
solicitor general
are mental and phys mental or physical
incapacity interfering with the
performance of his or her duties which
is or is likely to become permanent
number two willful misconduct in office
willful and persistent failure to
perform his or her duties as described
by law
a conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude
conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice which brings
the office into disrepute
intentionally instructing authorizing or
permitting an assistant district
attorney or assistant solicitor general
or their staff to commit any act to
constituting grounds for removal
or for violating the rules of the
Georgia Bar which include rule 3.8 which
governs prosecutors in the state
if a complaint is filed there must be a
sworn affidavit detailing personal
knowledge of the facts supporting the
complaint
all disciplinary action will be reviewed
by the Supreme Court
and additionally the bill adjusts the
duties of the district attorney which is
section one and solicitors General
Section 3 the bill to include reviewing
every case individually for which
probable cause exists in making
prosecutorial decision based on that
case specific facts and circumstances
again this is something that we've
passed three times this is an important
bill to many of us in the state who've
dealt with prosecutors who have torn our
communities apart for instance I had a
prosecutor in my county that repeatedly
sexually arrests some of his staff
um not only did it play out into the
community people lost confidence in the
judicial system of my County which is
the whole circuit my county is one
circuit we have a number of other
district attorneys or solicitors
generals across the political Spectrum
mine happen to be Republican there are
Republican problems and there are
Democrat problems and this is to address
it it's a nonpartisan type of idea this
is this is not a partisan issue in my
mind regarding who's Who's acting in bad
faith as a D.A Bad actors out there but
this is vitally important to the
communities who have District Attorneys
who are who are Bad actors and not
Prosecuting cases or uh
or become doing things illegal and
ultimately just bringing really really
bad light on their offices so with that
Mr Speaker I'm happy to answer any
questions
you have a couple of questions but we
have a lot of speakers I'll take two
you'll take two okay
to your left representative Jasmine
Clark has a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I do so there are a lot of things
um that are in our code that are
considered illegal for example adultery
things like that
does this bill require that a prosecutor
has to to review and make a decision on
every single thing even some things that
prosecutors might say it's not worth
their time because they have a lot on
their plates already yeah so what this
bill will do require them to look at
each case on a case-by-case basis it
doesn't require them to prosecute all
the cases it makes them look at each
case on this individual merits and
decide what they're going to do with it
there's a gentleman for the yield I do
is that not what prosecutors do already
no it's not what prosecutors some
prosecutors do already I'm sure some do
some also issue blanket statements to
say anything in this world I'm not going
to I'm not going to prosecute they don't
look at the merits of each individual
case today and that's a big reason why
this Bill's being brought forward
thank you
representative Miller is recognized for
a question representative Tonya Miller
to your left thank you Mr Speaker does
the gentleman yield I do
um can you please explain why your bill
does not include the Attorney General as
an elected D.A or prosecuting attorney
who could be brought before the
commission yeah so um what we're trying
to do is focus on District Attorneys and
solicitor generals the Attorney General
was in the judicial system he has a
checks and balances um over there today
prosecutors who have prosecutorial
discretion on individual cases in our
circuits is what I'm trying to address
here does it do you further yield I do
um is it your belief that the Attorney
General does not do exactly what you
just said and that is assessed cases on
an individual basis to determine if
there's probable cause to move forward
the Attorney General does a lot of
different things including prosecute
some cases but primarily what we are
focused on is the individual cases in
our circuits of judicial circuits on
what they are for what they are focused
on so it's not an attorney general bill
this is a Prosecuting attorneys for
district attorneys and solicitor
generals
thank you thank you Mr Speaker I know
the hours late everyone wants dinner I
know there's some speakers so oh yeah
they will
the gentleman has yielded the well
representative Kendrick is recognized to
speak to the bill
we have
some folks signed up there's 30 minutes
allocated to those opposed to the bill
then we have a Minority Report as well
so there's three folks signed up three
members signed up to speak opposed to
the bill so we will allocate the time
accordingly that the speakers take
thank you Mr Speaker
good morning or good afternoon
colleagues
today I Rise to speak against house bill
231.
what I call the prosecutors overly
oversight bill
we have a great lineup of speakers that
you're going to hear from but this is my
one wish for all of you is that you
listen to the other side
we have a tendency to come to this floor
with pre-formed opinions as I do
sometimes because it's Human Nature
but I ask that you forego going to the
ante room
four gold chatting it up with the
lobbyists in the hallway for go
negotiating a bill on this floor because
this bill ladies and gentlemen is
important to you and it's important to
our communities
let's go back to what we learned in
kindergarten which is there's a reason
that we have two ears and only one mouth
and that is to listen to the other side
one of my favorite poets is Napoleon
Hill he wrote the book Think and Grow
Rich he published it in 1937 but he also
published another book one of my
favorite books in 1938 called outwitting
the devil
but it was so controversial that his
family didn't publish it until 2011.
and in this book he talks about the
three appetites that we must Crush so
that we don't become what he calls
Drifters people who lack independent
thought
the first one is an appetite for food
I'm guilty of that one the second one is
an appetite for sex and then the third
one is an appetite for uninformed
opinions
now we're all entitled to our own
opinions so if you listen to this lineup
of speakers and you still vote yes
that's your prerogative we all have to
do what we need to do
but even though you are entitled to your
own opinions ladies and gentlemen we are
not entitled to our own facts
the facts that you will hear today are
these number one we already have an
existing infrastructure with multiple
ways to do exactly what HB 231 seeks to
do
the second thing is that the fiscal note
that's attached to this bill is
inadequate to handle what this bill is
purporting to do you're going to need a
lot more money
the third one is their prosecutorial
discretion is vital to allowing our
locally elected DA's to examine the
specific facts of each case when
deciding if and how to prosecute and
that's threatened under this bill and
last the vast majority of DA's and the
D.A Association oppose this bill
I wonder does yours as well
so the question I leave with you today
is this will you actively listen today
as to why you should vote no to this
bill or will you leave with an
uninformed opinion
I hope that you choose the former before
deciding if HB 231 is good for our state
thank you Mr Speaker and I yield the
will
the lady has yield yielded the well
representing Stacy Evans is recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen I rise in opposition to House
Bill 231 for one simple reason I believe
in prosecutorial discretion
and if you start trying to pick and
choose what da should be prosecuting or
what they shouldn't based on the whims
or the feelings of the day you are
trampling on prosecutorial discretion
there's just no way around it you either
have it or you don't
do I like everything that I'm seeing
from Republican DA's in this state no of
course I don't do I like everything I'm
seeing from every Democratic D.A in this
state no
I just came up here and asked you to
vote on a compensation resolution for
someone who was wrongfully convicted and
had to go through the exoneration
process
after a case that in my belief should
never have been brought
but that was not my decision
that was up to the prosecute prosecutor
to make those decisions
now that's not to say that we shouldn't
that da shouldn't be watched
they shouldn't be held accountable to
anyone
and they are
they are watched
a lot
they are accountable
to the State Bar
they are accountable to the Attorney
General's office
they can be criminally prosecuted by
that office
they are accountable to us in the
legislature they can be impeached
and most importantly they are
accountable just like everyone in here
to the voters
the voters get to decide who their DA's
are and whether they think that that D.A
is exercising his or her prosecutorial
discretion correctly they can listen
they can see they can they can listen to
our compensation resolution requests
they can read the paper they can hear
how many arrests are being made versus
how many convictions are being made and
they can decide is my D.A doing a good
job or not that's not up to us
now I believe this legislation has come
before us because there are some that
don't like what some democratic DA's are
doing across the state I think that's
why we're here
if you believe that too and you think
these Democratic DA's are going rogue
I want to make sure
that you do not leave this room today
and that you do not put your vote up on
that board before knowing this one thing
it is not just Democratic DA's that pick
and choose what cases they bring and
what cases they prosecute every single
D.A across the state does it
and I tried to gather some data on this
so that it wasn't just hey Stacy said
this
I picked three of the most brick red
areas in this state
and I called those DA's and I said I
want a list of the cases that you know
Prost meaning you didn't prosecute them
that you just missed that you never
presented to the grand jury
crickets
I called and followed up I put my
request in writing as an official
request that led to me getting calls
from two of those DA's
we can do it
we can give you the list
but it doesn't tell the whole story
there were very specific reasons why we
might have null crossed that or why we
did did a dismissal on this one or why
we never presented this one to the grand
jury Witnesses come and go testimony
changes
there's only so many hours in the day
DA's have to allocate resources they
make those decisions and they're very
individualized
I still don't have the list
and I'm not going to tell you the DA's I
called because I don't blame them
I don't blame them for not wanting me to
get that because it doesn't tell the
whole story how many cases get presented
or don't does not tell us the story they
were elected to exercise their
prosecutorial discretion and they should
be able to do that
newsflash hopefully it's apparent now
every time someone gets arrested does
not mean that that person ultimately
gets to have their day in court or that
there's ever even anything presented to
the grand jury
if you think that that's happening in
brick red counties
you're wrong if you think it's just in
these blue counties where not
everybody's getting prosecuted I just
want to make sure you know that you're
wrong
now
a lot of you on here might not like some
of the things I do some of the bills I
choose to bring or the votes I choose to
make and I'm sure I feel the same way
about some of y'all
I don't get to discipline you and you
don't get to discipline me why are we
treating DA's any differently I've heard
folks say well we've got a Judicial
qualifications committee and we look
specially at the judges
you know why
not every judge is a lawyer did y'all
know that
not every judge is a lawyer so the State
Bar can't oversee all the judges we have
to have a special oversight commission
for judges so that we can get them all
under the umbrella of somebody that's
not true for a D.A or a solicitor every
single one of them has to be a lawyer
that means every single one of them is
subject to discipline from the State Bar
of Georgia
now you can see in the bill the very
beginning of the bill there's a list of
duties of the district attorneys
and there's one that's added there
if this was just about making sure that
the DA's are doing their job
doing their duties as we've listed them
out in state law then why is that not
the list that you look at to decide
whether you're going to discipline a D.A
or not
look a few pages back
the list for when you can discipline a
DA when you can impeach them when you
can not impeach them when you can remove
them when you can involuntarily retire
them that's a whole different list
has nothing to do with that first list
that's the duties if this is just about
them doing their job why are those lists
not the same
because that's not what this is about
I want to leave you with an example of
prosecutorial discretion and I'm not
saying anybody in this chamber has ever
had a situation like this but I kind of
suspect maybe you have
ring ring
Mr Miss D.A Mr Miss solicitor
Little Johnny's gotten in trouble
they found a little bag of weed in the
car
had a little bit too much to drink got
behind the wheel I think you could just
put that in the drawer
that is now going to be a basis to
remove somebody
because the prosecutorial discretion was
exercise and maybe this misguided youth
was put in a rehabilitation program or
maybe they were put on community service
or maybe they're maybe they worked it
out with their parents
I'm also not saying that anybody in this
room is doing this but you know gambling
is currently illegal in the state maybe
we can change part of that a little bit
later
but gambling's currently illegal
I know that there are people in this
chamber
that participate in some poker games
those don't get prosecuted
what are we gonna do about that one of
my colleagues asked a question about
adultery that's still illegal
fornication illegal
what are we going to do about the
prosecutors that aren't Prosecuting
those crimes prosecutorial discretion
either exists or it doesn't and I
maintain that it needs to remain in the
state and I ask you to please vote no on
House Bill 231 and I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
representative Yasmine Neal is
recognized to speak to the measure
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I rise
today to speak against house bill 231.
I am going to be brief Swift I'm not
going to be here to scream or shout I
just want to talk to you for a little
bit
I want to speak to a specific aspect
and that's using what we already have
in committee the author alluded to the
fact that there may have been some issue
with some being hesitant of using
certain measures we already have in
place to hold prosecutors accountable
the options are
the State Bar
articles of impeachment
voters
and the AG bringing charges
specifically a reference was made to the
fact that the one option of bringing
articles of impeachment before this body
hasn't been done since the 1960s
why is that
if we have an issue that's at the level
that we claim to have in the state which
we can all acknowledge that there's an
issue that the lady will suspend yes for
a moment
thank you members that he will proceed
thank you Mr Speaker
so why hasn't it been used since the
1960s we have a measure in place that we
can use but no one has started the
impeachment process to any of these
prosecutors since the 1960s
this measure and the three other
measures we have in place to remove
prosecutors who are problematic
already are more than sufficient for
getting the desired solution to include
removal if necessary and we will not
have to spend additional money which
this bill will cause us to do
we should be careful of creating a new
process with this bill when we haven't
even exhausted all of the available
options we currently have available to
us
options that may that my esteemed
colleagues will elaborate on here
shortly but I know some in this body
believe in smaller government and
cost-saving measures
and moving forward with this bill goes
against those very Concepts that you and
we all hold dear to us
so join me in voting no to this measure
and with that Mr Speaker I yield the
well
the lady has yielded the well
now those in favor of the proposition
will have 30 minutes that will be
divided amongst themselves and we will
begin with representative Maynor
speaking speak in favor of the bill
representative Maynard
thank you Mr Speaker
the Declaration of Independence says
governments are instituted among men
deriving their just powers from the
consent of the Govern
that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends it is
the right of the people to alter it
it's everyone's right to petition the
government to redress their grievances
in many instances across Georgia
Citizens are deprived of their
constitutional right to redress their
grievances against prosecutors
if the president of the United States
must obey the law and be subjected to
oversight it's a unfathomable to think a
prosecutor should not
those that believe they don't need
oversight may be just the ones that need
it
hb231 brings attention to a serious
problem
this bill doesn't solve the multitude of
problems established by prosecutorial
reform experts but it brings the
solution One Step Closer
just as there are bad cops and
exceptional cops there are corrupt
prosecutors and outstanding prosecutors
The Fulton solicitor is amazing and
deserves an award for solicitor of the
year
but all prosecutors aren't objective and
prioritize equal protections of the law
it's too difficult to redress grievances
with the State Bar
the ag office says you have to file a
civil suit against the D.A because of
their discretion
there is not one single member of this
body I'm sure that wants to bring a D.A
in for impeachment
I'm not sure if this body has ever
impeached a D.A in Georgia's history but
I believe my friend representative
Yasmine Neal said that there was in the
60s
finally some may say the biggest the
voters can decide but the common voter
does not know what is going on inside of
a prosecutor's office
the Constitution mandates equal
protection of each and every law not
just some until we change the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights I
want all of my rights and so do the
sixty thousand constituents I represent
crimes against women in particular
that have lost people will crimes
against women as well as families that
have lost children to police violence
are particularly harmed by prosecutorial
misconduct and lawlessness
both
excuse me each district has its own
stories
prosecutorial misconduct for crimes
against women further victimized women
if a woman is harmed by someone she's
married to or in a romantic or friendly
relationship with prosecutors have
become numb to these violations because
many women decide later they don't want
to press charges
but for those that have truly been
traumatized by a crime and victimizing
their Community they're further
victimized because prosecutors have
become none none
a prosecutor repeatedly
repeatedly told an immigrant woman that
doesn't speak English they can't help
her because she's married to the Accuser
finally I was able to get her help from
the grace commission after months
as a victim of stalking I received calls
from all over the state about stalking
from women pleading for help because the
prosecutors have become numb to their
stories
additionally some prosecutors practice
subjectivity over objectivity with a
Sprinkle of helping a friend
if there are part of the defense
while they're working for Georgia and
Georgia's victims
police officers admit they take their
investigations to the D.A office before
the judge that could potentially issue
an arrest warrant police officers and
District Attorneys have decided to
partner which gives prosecutors
additional Authority as judge and jury
the police perspective is if the
prosecutor tells them they refuse to
prosecate the case and won't do anything
with the evidence presented it doesn't
make sense for them to go in front of a
judge to get a warrant for the crime
and just like that the prosecutor has
hindered hinder Justice and due process
from the onset
the current prosecutorial system has
lost objectivity because prosecutors
believe themselves some to be the ruler
of the law without oversight
this coordinated effort to eliminate
judicial oversight and due process is
unbeknownst to the General Public
it's a secret relationship between some
DA's and some officers
people have the right to speak freely
just as I am
this is my right and why I'm speaking on
behalf of House Bill 231 and the victims
that have been victimized by prosecutors
you can't shut people up because you
don't like them or what they say and you
certainly can't muzzle a person because
they don't agree with you but
prosecutors
can silence a citizen's voice
from ever being heard
how would you feel as a victim
if your voice is stolen
and you lose your right to due process
of the law
I say this bill is bad
I say this bill is bad it's actually
very sad
the saddest part of this political
propaganda is that it only helps the
politician while further suppressing
victims that are overlooked marginalized
and alienated
there are a group of families that stand
on the capitol steps year after year
I've seen them for the past two years
they hold up pictures of their loved
ones mostly their children because of
police violence
about three weeks ago I learned
no one was helping them
I ultimately spent seven hours with each
of them over the course of the next two
days to understand the details of each
killing and to introduce them to some
bipartisan leadership in hopes of a
solution for prosecutorial reform
I met with the governor's office as well
to introduce these family stories to the
highest officer in our state Governor
Brian Kemp victims don't care about
party affiliation they want help
Davis Benjamin and Andrew Smyrna Jr's
family
wish the Dekalb D.A did more for their
cases
Pernell Harris's family Wishes the
Coffee County D.A did more for their
cases
jabril Robinson and Eric Holmes they
wish the Clayton D.A did more for their
family members that were killed and
leading boykin's family wishes Paulding
County did more for their family member
that was killed
Jairus likes Nigel Collins and more have
been coming to the Capitol holding
pictures of their loved ones but not
getting Justice because of prosecutorial
subjectivity
some may call it discretion
others call it a violation of their
rights
DA's can't be allowed to abuse their
office to help friends
they cannot be allowed to abuse their
office by helping defense out if that is
why they're doing it they also cannot
say that they're not Prosecuting cases
because they just don't have the time or
resources
there must be an opportunity for checks
and balances with the chief law
enforcement officer of a county which
represents the state of Georgia their
power is traumatizing when used
inappropriately in a frivolous manner
this is not a Democrat Republican bill
even though it is being portrayed that
way
but Democrats in my district want
Justice in Safe Streets
no one likes people looking over their
shoulder but the safety of Georgia
Georgians is at a critical stage right
now and it requires much from our
prosecutors
there is a D.A in Georgia
that has committed crimes
and I say to you again
alleged crimes I say to you again
to get help for victims you cannot go to
the AG's office
the AG's office will tell you you have
to file a civil suit you cannot go to
the bar it's too difficult to file
complaints with the bar if you're not an
attorney voters who elect the DA's have
no idea what is going on and we've
talked about impeachment that hasn't
happened since the 1960s
this bill doesn't solve every problem
but it's better than nothing and it
brings attention to a neglected problem
we actually need a prosecutorial reform
study committee to dig deeper into the
injustices happening across this great
state
vote for your community and the families
I mentioned that didn't get Justice from
their prosecutors your yes vote will
lead the state one step closer to
fairness for victims that have been
traumatized by prosecutor
lawlessness
thank you
the lady has yielded the well
the chair recognizes representative
Petrie to speak to the bill
thank you madam speaker ladies and
gentlemen the house
I'll tell you a couple stories I want to
begin by just asking you a question
so how is an oversight committee correct
and appropriate
for our judges who have the vast power
to sentence someone to life or to
dismiss a case but not for district
attorneys who have their own vast
Authority and discretion
so when a D.A fails to fulfill their
oath of office and to protect the
community they are indeed the chief law
enforcement officer in the community
and then they pretend they're protected
somehow under the guise of being elected
official how long does the community
suffer
and so I listened a moment ago to
representative Evans and I wanted to say
Amen about something you're speaking to
representative
indeed these issues are in both both
types of counties to use that
phraseology whether they're red or blue
matters not to me and I'm going to give
you two examples
two examples of a red and a blue County
to make your point
so let me I'm going to tell you a story
about the county I live in then I'm
going to tell you a story about the
county
my father died in where my Farm's
located
each politically different
same problems so let me tell you a
little bit about Chatham County right
now
in Chatham County in the last two years
we've had 30 murders reduced dismissed
or pled to probation
we had a rapist who got 18 months for
raping a girl a young lady
we've had victims that have not been
notified of Court hearings and pleas in
violation of the law of course we had
143 employees two years ago in our DA's
office
now down to 75.
our judges got a memo about whole
classes of laws that would not no longer
be prosecuted our DA's office was
recently held in contempt of court by
sitting Superior Court judge for not
complying with numerous scheduling
orders resulting in delays
we've had several not guilty verdicts
for murder in the last month alone due
to lack of experience
and due to the high turnover most of our
Superior Courts are understaffed and one
indeed has no assigned DA's to it today
so
that's one example now let me give you
another example of a completely
different County
the place where my daddy died so about
three years ago my daddy died in an
accident
where the other he was hit and he was he
was killed in an accident and the other
driver
at 8 A.M
was way drunk way over the legal limit
8 A.M
he had a history of multiple DUIs he was
driving on a suspended license he had no
insurance
doesn't matter the county
but here's what happened
repeated calls to the county to the
courthouse to find out when is this man
going to trial repeated calls again and
again and again messages left again and
again and again never a call back
family was never notified when it went
to trial
and indeed it went to trial and that man
was given reckless driving my friends
when I finally Weeks Later
found the incompetent and corrupt
solicitor of Evans County Georgia
let me tell you what he told me I wrote
it down in my notes
on a yellow sticky pad the day I finally
got him on the phone this is what he
told me quote
I did not know there was an accident in
that case
my friends I don't care what county
you're in
when you're the chief law enforcement
officer of a community you have one job
and that is to protect the community
and if you can't do that
somebody needs to provide some oversight
and some guidance and that's what we're
trying to do here this measure I hope
you'll join me in voting for this Bill
thank you madam speaker
chair recognizes the majority leader
Administration to speak to the bill
thank you madam speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house I come to you
today to speak to a very specific aspect
of House Bill 231
of course I'm a former assistant
district attorney worked as a prosecutor
felony prosecutor and familiar with the
responsibilities the DA's have
but also I want to talk to you as a
legislator and I've spoken on this
subject from this well
you know this issue and I think that
this is very important to note because
the characterization of this issue in my
mind has really been distorted as we've
been debating this uh discussing the
bill this session
you know this issue originally came I
remember the moment when this issue was
first discussed with me
it was just after the horrific video of
Ahmad Arbury
was made public of his murder was made
public
and I was I had a call with an attorney
respected attorney from the southern
Center for human rights respected civil
rights organization discussing
she and I had served together on the
council for Criminal Justice Reform
discussing the needed reforms we needed
to see as a result of this horrific
video and at the time it was 2020 we
were on the break for the pandemic at
the time and the hate crimes Bill had
passed the Georgia house in 2019 was
pending in the state senate
and we discussed number one we've got to
pass the hate crimes law
number two we've got to repeal citizens
arrest
and as you recall we've done both of
those things in this chamber and in this
school Dome
but the third thing we discussed back in
2020 was the need for prosecutorial
oversight the fact that in Georgia there
was no means of holding DA's accountable
if they acted in a corrupt or an illegal
manner
there was no effective means under the
law as we had for judges with the jqc
and we needed something comparable for
DA's
and you know as this issue has been
discussed this session I feel that that
has really been missed that was the
Genesis at least in my mind of how this
issue came about
and the need to have oversight for
prosecutors I think ever since has
really been shown and you know why
because since that call since that time
there have been times in Georgia where
there have been multiple elected
prosecutors under serious investigation
or under indictment
multiple prosecutors and there was no
means to take steps effectively as this
bill would provide for to allow for an
investigation by competent individuals
qualified to look into the allegations
and by a panel to allow for removal
I would just submit to you that having
been a prosecutor understanding the
importance of prosecutorial discretion
this bill in no way erodes that in fact
I think it highlights the importance of
it the importance and necessity to
review cases Case by case
it also I think recognizes that the
proposed alternatives for removing
prosecutors just are not sufficient
unless this bill is passed
waiting on the voters to consider an
issue with a D.A until the next election
is up having the the voters in a
district you just have to live with
things as they are until the next
election four years from from then
that's not practical
the State Bar of Georgia generally only
takes action against licensed lawyers
and in criminal cases after the
conviction has occurred
that I'm familiar with
an impeachment
if we're not in session what are we
waiting until the legislative session
reconvenes in January or holding a
special session to pursue impeachment I
don't see these as viable options
this is a reasonable approach under the
circumstances to deal with a real issue
and that is there are certain we have
terrific prosecutors in the state of
Georgia but for those circumstances
where a D.A or a solicitor is violating
the law is instigating sexual harassment
is cause is the target of a corruption
investigation we need to have adequate
law so that the voters are protected so
that the citizens are protected and the
immense power that an elected prosecutor
has as has been discussed is not further
abused and it's for that reason I would
encourage you to vote in favor of House
Bill 231. thank you madam speaker I
yield the will
the gentleman has yielded the well there
is a Minority Report is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered the chair here is none the
previous question is ordered the chair
recognizes
representative Roberts to for the time
reserved for The Minority Report thank
you madam chair I'm Madam speaker
um
colleagues I rise today to ask you to
vote no on House Bill 231 in addition to
all the reasons outlined by my
colleagues I think every single one of
us needs to think about this I have
listened to all the arguments and as an
attorney
I know how much
thought and preparation has to go into
each case and we as attorneys we use
discretion whether it's a civil case or
criminal case
these prosecutors or solicitors are
subject to the State Bar the
Constitution there are multiple avenues
for which we can hold them accountable
including elections
the sponsors of this bill have been very
open about why they are filing it and
who they're targeting the thing I heard
most was Democratic DA's that have made
statements about not Prosecuting
specific types of cases
um
but here's the thing all the DA's who
testified in our committee said their
decision not to prosecute
uh crimes such as
a doctor whose administering
reproductive care
um
is because they were prioritizing
violent crimes pursuant to their
prosecutorial discretion
isn't that what we've been doing this
entire session
I have listened to bills addressing gang
crimes drive-by shootings increasing
mandatory minimums in several sections
of our criminal code
so if the targeted DA's and members of
this body are focused on what we keep
talking about which is Public Safety and
reducing violent crime in Georgia then
why do we need to spend valuable
taxpayer dollars to create another layer
of government to perform prosecutorial
oversight when our code and Constitution
already have Provisions that do just
that
all of our DA's across the state are
overworked understaffed and underfunded
why would we put additional burdens on
them when they are trying to protect
Georgians just like we are
something else to consider in subsection
F5 on line 175 one of the grounds for
discipline
removal or involuntary requirement is
and I quote conduct prejudicial to the
administration of justice which brings
the office into disrepute
and for reference the Cambridge English
dictionary defines disrepute as the
state of not being respected or trusted
but who decides if a D.A
is in a state of not being trusted some
of you might think it's the liberal D.A
saying they won't prosecute certain
arguably less violent crimes
you would say they qualified under this
very Broad and ambiguous ground for
discipline others of us in this chamber
might think a D.A is in a state of not
being trusted when she consistently
requests bond be denied in cases that
haven't been sufficiently investigated
and it results in citizens unnecessarily
spending months or even years in jail
only to be acquitted
I'm aware of one rural D.A who took
office at the end of 2020 and just in
just two years under her leadership
wrongfully accused individuals
spent a cumulative total of seven
thousand days in jail only to be
acquitted by a judge a jury of their
peers or a dismissal
one particular gentleman requested Bond
three times spent over three years in
jail
only to receive a not guilty verdict
someone might say they were just being
tough on crime
that they were keeping the violent
criminals in jail
I think we can agree that bringing the
office into disrepute is open to so many
interpretations and we may all want to
think about our own DA's and whether we
want to open this Pandora's Box
during the Committee hearing I tried to
make a friendly amendment to at least
limit who could file a complaint against
a D.A I wanted it to be restricted to a
voter
in the county or judicial circuit where
the D.A or solicitor general was elected
or appointed or a victim of crime
that occurred in that same jurisdiction
this would prevent for example a Fulton
County voter from filing a complaint
against the D.A in Bullitt County simply
because they believed her conduct was
president prejudicial to the
administration of justice
the D.A is elected by the people of that
County or judicial circuit and they know
best who represents their values so I
believe standing should be limited to
those voters but my friendly Amendment
wasn't accepted
I thought that was really strange you
know we've all said this isn't political
but why would they object to standing
that makes sense
and I think it was raised that anyone in
the state can file a State Bar
complaint so why shouldn't it be the
same that's true but if you go on the
state Bar's website and you pull up the
form that you file it very clearly asks
when was your first contact with that
attorney
the nature of Bar complaints is you're
complaining about your attorney
you have special
grievances against them and how they
represented you so I think we should
keep that same thought process to
standing but this was not accepted so I
have to ask myself again why why are we
spending taxpayer money to create
another level of government when there
are already Provisions to address
prosecutorial oversight the only
conclusion I can reach is that it's more
of the same we've been seeing where
members of this body don't like
Democrats that Democrats are winning
elections so they want us
substitute their will over the that of
the voters in those majority Democratic
communities we saw it last year with
local districting bills but y'all this
is dangerous territory when you start
chipping away at georgian's fundamental
right to elect their local leaders and
they can't even hold you accountable at
The Ballot Box because they aren't in
your District that is the very
definition of authoritarianism
demographics are changing populations
are increasing who knows what the
political landscape will be in two years
or ten years before you vote on this
bill I want every member of this body to
really think about whether you want
someone from outside your community
filing complaints against your D.A or
solicitor general because this bill
doesn't just allow liberal DA's to be
challenged more importantly consider we
have a multiple we have multiple Avenues
under our state code and Constitution
for addressing these issues
is this the best use of taxpayer money
because the fiscal note that was done
initially on this is 1.5 million dollars
then it was brought up it was added to
the bill that special recall elections
and the sponsors of the bills said there
was no fiscal note on that
um we have no idea how many challenge
how many complaints against DA's will be
be brought uh so we have no idea what
that cost is is that how we want to be
spending taxpayer money when we already
have Avenues to resolve this finally if
our DA's are prioritizing reducing
violent crimes shouldn't we be
supporting them rather than targeting
them thank you
Madam speaker I'm just trying to see you
there I yield the well
there are no questions and the lady has
yielded the well it's the Chairman's
time and the chair recognizes chairman
Smith to speak on the bill
thank you madam speaker uh Madam speaker
I yield the balance of the Chairman's
time to Vice chairman Gaines
the gentleman has yielded the well and
the chair recognizes representative
Gaines to speak to the bill for the
Chairman's time thank you madam speaker
and first I want to start off by
thanking representative gullet for his
leadership on this issue and bringing
this issue to the Forefront uh the
speaker just before me mentioned that we
were targeting Democrats well his
interest in this bill is because the
Republican D.A who had issues in that
Community but his leaders as leader
registration outlined you know the the
real intent behind this measure has been
uh has been widely uh but the issue and
the purpose behind this has been
distorted
both by the national media when you read
what's I saw an article on the New York
Times this weekend about this bill
what they're saying is the intent behind
it and what the minority party is saying
in the intent behind the legislation
it's not where it's not what the issue
is actually before you
when I hear the minority party talking
about discretion this bill does nothing
to take away the discretion of elected
solicitors and District Attorneys that's
not what this bill is about
instead I want to walk you through what
this measure will address in our state
we have an issue in areas throughout
Georgia and representative Petrie talked
about this in in the Chatham Area but I
want to tell you about the Western
Judicial Circuit
on day one when our district attorney
was elected she put out a memo outlining
what what cases and what issues she
simply was not going to prosecute what
what offenses she was just going to
choose on her own to not prosecute and
that memo is right here was the first
thing she did on day one
that was early on in her term but let me
tell you just this was over just the
last four months what I'm about to
outline for you again this is just the
last four months and the Western
Judicial Circuit and explain to you why
lives are at stake and the importance of
passing this measure I'll start off just
with an example a couple of weeks ago
where our district attorney was actually
caught lying to the court and that
brought issues before in that case
the Superior Court judges all four of
our Superior Court judges signed a
letter in which it outlined how cases
are being delayed because the LA the
state's lack of preparation and or
failure to follow proper procedures
the DA's office has an issue with staff
Staffing I'll read just a couple
headlines from articles in our local
newspaper western western circuits DA's
office limping along with decimated
staff of prosecutors while they were
budgeted for 17 they're down to just
three assistant district attorneys
and you may say well all da offices are
having challenges with Staffing right
now while another local paper went out
and talked to other DA's into the
surrounding counties and the headline
nearby judicial circuits don't have Ada
shortages as significant as the Western
Judicial Circuit
and here's a brief quote from the
article while D.A Deborah Gonzalez is
attributed to prosecutorial Staffing
crisis to non-competitive salaries the
Oconee Enterprise discovered that two of
the four surrounding judicial circuits
are not experiencing Ada shortages to
the same extent as the Western Judicial
Circuit
but really let's get into some cases and
talk through so those are those are
office issues but here are the real
consequences for having no prosecutorial
oversight in our state
effin sex trafficking case dismissed due
to mishandling by the DA's office that's
a headline in our local paper the judge
had dismissed a case against a 25 year
old who faced charges of trafficking of
a person for sexual servitude statutory
rape kidnapping false imprisonment and
aggravated child molestation the case
had hadn't been brought to trial under
the speedy trial statute because a
prosecutorial mismanagement so an
individual who was facing charges again
of statutory rape kidnapping false
imprisonment and aggravated child
molestation was not brought to trial
because simply the DA's office failed to
do its job
here's another case acquitted a murder
in Athens charged with murder in Jackson
County a man who beat murder charges in
Athens over a year ago was recently
arrested for a murder in Jackson County
this was an individual that the law
enforcement agency had found the murder
weapon on the suspect the DA's office
failed to call several key suspects that
several key witnesses that would have
put the suspect of the sign of the scene
of the crime so someone is now dead
because of her because of the DA's
office in confidence again acquitted of
murder in Athens a year later goes and
kills somebody else in Jackson County
here's another headline Athens woman
acquitted a murder charges another
murder charge and boyfriend's 2019
shooting death and her in her first
criminal trial as a prosecutor RDA by
the way just tried her first case
personally in the last three months
reportedly tried district attorney
Deborah Gonzalez reportedly tried to
prove that as a motive for killing the
individual the suspect stood the game
from an insurance policy however the
prosecution was unable to get the
insurance policy before the jury due to
a judge ruling the proper foundations
for proper foundation for its
introduction to the trial as evidence
had not been laid just the other day I
was speaking to a 2L a second year law
student group here at the Capitol they
knew how to introduce evidence in a case
like that but our district attorney did
not
here's another headline again these are
all from the last four months improper
Court procedure leads to dismissal of a
case of Athens man who allegedly shot a
victim in the neck
the case of an Athens man accused of
shooting a person in the neck was
recently dismissed because proper Court
procedure had not been followed
the judge dismissed the case because the
district attorney failed to bring it to
a grand jury yet again to have talked to
many lawyers and very few don't
recognize the need to bring it to a
grand jury we've seen issue after issue
after issue in our community lives are
truly at stake and areas where you have
prosecutors who don't know how to do
their job and are failing to do their
job that's why this bill is so important
and I would urge this body for the
people of the Western Judicial Circuit
but circuits across this state
prosecutors need oversight I can't think
of another elected office in this state
where there is zero oversight so I would
ask this body it's favorable
consideration of House Bill 231 because
lives truly are at stake we can't wait
two more years in Athens for the next
election we can't wait in other areas
throughout this state so please join me
in voting for House Bill 231 and Madam
speaker I will yield the well
ah
Mr Speaker
good catch
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute
chair here's none The committee's
Substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill
the chair here has done the report of
the committee is agreed to shall this
bill now pass all in favor of the
passage of the bill we'll vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
for what purpose does representing Stacy
Evans rise parliamentary inquiry state
tree inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true
that the system that we have Works isn't
it true that the Paulding D.A that we
heard so much about was ultimately
removed by the governor and could have
been removed much sooner if the Attorney
General had actually acted and stood in
his power and isn't it further true Mr
Speaker that the D.A that mishandled to
say the least the Ahmad Aubry case was
also taken care of under the system that
we have and that is the voters voted
that person out the very next
opportunity they have so isn't it
further true Mr Speaker that this bill
is completely unnecessary
I'm sure the lady has her opinion our
attorney general's a fine man and a
great jurist does a great job
for what purpose does represent
representative Kennard rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry Mr
Speaker is it not true that when the
Glenn County prosecutor failed to Levy
charges in the arbory case that the
Attorney General exercised prosecutor
prosecutorial oversight by grabbing a
new prosecutor in another County and
that person successfully prosecuted that
case that led to a conviction is that
not prosecutor prosecutorial oversight
sir I'm sure the gentleman has an
opinion and I'm sure he believes in what
he speaks
for what purpose is Chairman Collins
rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry is
it not true that I'm supporting House
Bill 231 because of a terrible job that
a former Republican D.A out in West
Georgia did and I want to make sure we
have oversight of these kind of folks
I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he
speaks that's where he's from
for what purposes represent representing
Miller rise
thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State inquiry is it not true
that the jqc which is the commission
upon which the prosecution oversight
commission is modeled often takes years
upwards of five or six years to
adjudicate complaints against judges
I'm not sure how that agency works but
I'm sure the lady knows of what she
speaks follow-up question you have a
further inquiry yes yes Mr Speaker isn't
it not true that the fastest way to
remove a district attorney who has
committed a violation of their oath of
office is to indict them as the Attorney
General already has the power to and for
the governor to suspend him them which
he can do immediately isn't that the
most efficient way to deal with Wayward
prosecutors I'm sure the lady is
educated and it matters she speaks about
and she certainly believes everything
she just said to me and to this body
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine
