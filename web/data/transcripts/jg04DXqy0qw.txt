----------
You
Thank you to the members who are here this afternoon.
I'd like to call the Ethics Committee to order.
I'm going to open with a brief, very brief order prayer.
Follow me, thank you for good days and great opportunities and ask that you continue to watch
over us as we do the business of Georgia.
Christ name.
Amen.
All right, committee, thank you for being here.
We have a chair notes the presence of a quorum and we will take up only one agenda item
and that agenda item is the approval of three caucus applications in your folder.
You see three caucus applications, one for the international caucus, proposed by
caucus chair Don Zell James, any discussion, hearing none.
The HBCU caucus, co-chaired by the President Pro Temp, Kennedy and Senator Sonja Halprin,
any discussion, hearing none.
The third caucus is the American Irish state legislators caucus,
chaired by Senator Mike Dugan.
Are there any questions?
Hearing none, the chair entertainer motion moved to approve these three caucuses.
Second, a motion by Senator Strickland.
Second by Pro Tem, Kennedy, all those in favor?
Aye.
All those, there you go.
Aye, that's good.
All those opposed?
Cheers none, motion carries.
Thank you to the committee.
No further business.
Committee is adjourned.
All right.
