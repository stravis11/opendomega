TRANSCRIPT
----------
The Senate will come back to order. Secretary Reed, Senate Bill 220. Senate Bill 220 by Stilmer Brass of the Sixth and others have been titled an act to amend various provisions of the OCGA. So as to rename low THC oil as medical cannabis to amend chapter 12, title 16, Article 2 of chapter 13 of Title 16 and Article 1 of chapter 2A of Title 31, the OCGA going to offenses against the public health and morals. Regulation of controlled services and general provisions relative to the Department of Public Health respectively, so that to clarify and revise criminal penalties, to write for a later matter of structural people, looking laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute, respectfully submitted, Senator Watson-Chairman. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 220, bill between Title and Act to amend various provisions of the Fischer-Groge Anatage. That's to rename low THC oil as medical cannabis to amend chapter 12, title 16, Article 2 of chapter 13 of Title 16 and Article 1 of chapter 2A, Title 31 of the Fischer-Groge Anatage. The Senate is the number one to amend the Senate Committee of Substitute Senate Bill 220 by replacing online 88th words, 50% with the words 10%. President Senator Brass is six and others are for the following amendment number two to amend the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Substitute to Senate Bill 220 By inserting between lines 340 and 341 the following said chapters further amended by revising subsection A of Code Section 16-123 related to requirements for dispensing low TEC oil as products as follows A rejecting low TEC oil and inserting medical cannabis or medical products shall be only be dispensed and for other purposes. Mr. President Senator Burns of the 23rd and others are for the following amendment number three to amend the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Substitute to Senate Bill 220 by striking line 9 and inserting in Luther of the following such information by striking lines 389 through 391 replacing it with the following reserved. Mr. President Senator Roberts in the 29th and others offers the following amendment number four to amend the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Substitute to Senate Bill 220 by replacing it lines 433 through 456 with the following. A cancer when such disease is diagnosed as end of stage or treatment produced is related wasting illness or recalcitrant nausea and vomiting and for other purposes. Mr. President that completes the order. Recognize distinguished rules chairman speak to the bed. Thank you Mr. President colleagues. I bring to you SB 220 medical marijuana bill. Now first I want to tell you a little bit about why I'm passionate about this bill and the program as a whole back in 2019 when we were going through the study committee to figure out how we were going to set up this program in the state of Georgia. We were in our last study committee and laying on my desk was a letter from a neurosurgeon neuro doctor with the Shepherd Center in support of medical THC for this state. I thought I recognized the name on it but I wasn't sure so I actually texted it to my mother. My mother got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis back in 1999 2000 around that time. I texted my mom the letter and I said mom do you know who this doctor is she said yes that's my doctor. And it don't owe me right then that I wanted my mom's doctor to have every tool in the tool chest he could possibly have to treat her should she ever need it. Now she's fortunate she never has needed it. In fact the medicine she was on for over two decades she's now off of and live in drug free and live with with MS but still healthy. But there's others out there that aren't so lucky and some of them need this medicine some of these doctors need this tool to treat their patients. So I'm going to be very clear on what this bill does. In 2019 when we passed the bill we set a limit of 5% THC oil. When you look at 18 other medical marijuana states in this country medical marijuana only not recreational. The lowest percent is 50% of those 18 the highest is 70%. So this bill would take us from 5% to 50. The other thing in this bill that is going to get the most debate is going to be the vaping. Under current law we don't allow vaping and I understand the concerns I am concerned around vaping. But also have concerns for those with epilepsy who may be going into a seizure. It may need this medicine to work a little bit faster than one hour or two hour however long it normally takes which I think hours about the normal. If they're about to go into seizure they're going to need immediate relief. That is the need for vaping. If you're going to allow vaping which I think we should for those types of patients and there's others I believe you've got to increase that percentage from 5 to 50 at a minimum. Because the 5% is not going to give them the immediate relief they need. So instead of having to vape one time they're going to have to vape 10 times. In the amount of the percentage of the percentages of additives that go into that vaping which some say can cause as much harm as the actual anything that's in there. You're looking at a 95% ratio of additives versus a 50% ratio. So that is another purpose of taking that 5 to 50. And the third and final thing that really is probably going to get the most debate today is around the conditions. Back when we set up the study committee the chairman of HHS and myself and then lieutenant governor Casey Cagle put in a law that said DPH and conjunction with the patient. Conjunction with a composite medical board would make recommendations around conditions for the list of diagnoses. And DPH in conjunction with the composite medical board. And then the final letter requesting that we add lupus. They also sent a letter requesting that we strike Crohn's disease and add inflammatory bowel disease. The conditions are on start on lines 429 and they run through lines 456. That's on pages 18 and 19. The other thing we've done with the conditions. We found that it's it's confusing for doctors and patients with the language severe or end of life. So we have removed that from most of the conditions. We did leave it on peripheral neuropathy. We left severe we took end of stage because there's no such thing as end of stage peripheral neuropathy. But it does still have to be severe and that was to make sure people weren't using this for carpal tunnel and things mild like that. My original bill under altism inadvertently struck through the lines when such disorder is diagnosed for patient who is at least 18 years of age or severe altism when diagnosed for patient who is less than 18 years of age. That language is back in the bill and be very clear on that. So for altism they have to be 18 or up or it has to be severe. One other thing we added under convict conditions because we moved that severe or end of stage. I wanted to put it more back into the doctor and patient's hands and we added this language that says any of the following this is under definition of condition. Starting on line 429 any of the following provided that the patient symptoms associated with any such condition can reasonably be expected to be relieved by the use of medical cannabis and the potential benefits of such use to the patient outweigh the potential health risk that such use might pose to the patient. So that's the meat of the bill. Most of the rest of the bill goes through a patient and doctor listening tour that was sent out by the commission. There was a lot of confusion around the program for the patients and for the doctors and one of the things was calling it a low THC program. So we are you'll see multiple references through the bill striking through low THC and now refer referring to the program as medical cannabis. So that is the bill. I will yield the well to allow time for plenty of debate and I'll be back for closing. Now I'll speak to the amendments. I want you all to vote your heart. I want you to vote your district. But I'll say this. Nobody came and talked to me about these amendments before I looked at them on my desk. Nobody's coming talk to me about these amendments before I came in the well. I'm not mad at you. You still my friends. Just a little disappointing. But I'll be voting no. I encourage you to do the same. I do. Amendment two is mine. It was this this came from the nursing homes. They are finding that that THC is being good and their is is a good tool to use for patients with dementia. And they asked that their caregivers be able to to be able to pick up the cannabis for their patients that cannot drop. So that's what amendment two is again vote your hearts. Vote your district. I yield the well. The senator has yielded. So any other senator which speak for against measure. I recognize the senator from 37th who also authored amendment number one senator floors yours. I think Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Senate author of the bill, co-sponsors. We this is an issue that's worthy of debate. Scientific double blind research tells us that with the regular use of THC marijuana three times a week from late teenage years to middle age adults in the prime of their lives have an IQ of six to eight points lower with the regular use of THC. Now what that means to you is maybe not much. We don't we don't live in the world unless you're an educator and think about such things most of the time. It's not a world we live in. But eight points on your IQ is what's called a half standard deviation. What that means is if THC use regularly over the course of a decade and a half or so lowers your IQ your brain power by eight IQ points. That means the average American in the prime of their adulthood who would be the 50th percentile of intelligence with the lowering other IQ by eight points is now in the 33th percentile. That means if you're the average Georgian you're now dumber than two thirds of Georgians by the regular use of marijuana over the course of more than a decade. This is not a victimless crime. No, when we passed low THC oil in 2015, I was member of the house. There was a sweet little girl that rolled into the back of the house and said that she needed the cannabinoids that was in the oil. It came from the cannabis plant because there were things that happened. There were conditions that even though the research wasn't super solid on it, we knew anecdotally it helped them. And the discussion in 2015 was there needed to be a trace amount of THC maybe a half percent in there. But there was the cannabinoids and all the substances in this low THC oil that made the difference. After a couple years of debate of this, myself and others came together and said, you know what, let's do this for these people. That we recognize all the things that we need for medicine are provided for us if these properly and they're used responsibly. But I would tell you friends that taking young adults and taking the words of a general assembly and our law that says it's okay to do these things to take the kind of concentrations of THC that we're proposing this bill has a big effect on our nation. It's not a victimless crime. Not only does it make people dumb or is that not that's proven in research. Even the proponents of this bill would recognize the idea of motivation and zeal and energy of people who are regular, uses a marijuana is lowered. And friends, we think about what this does, what high THC use day in, day out, weekend, week out does to health. Even the websites of the THC community says don't take, don't take THC don't take cannabinoids doing pregnancy. It has increases the likelihood of children having ADHD autism. And we see that with these high concentrations of THC, even though we may call it a medicinal substance increases the cases of psychosis and even schizophrenia. It's as a massive impact. If the concentrations we're talking about in this bill, there's a massive impact of human health. That doesn't even speak to the fact that in Colorado who's embraced THC openly, there are one person dies every four days in Colorado from THC induced auto accidents. Friends, this is not a small step. The cannabinoid bills that came through the house and came through this legislature in 2015 and 2019 came through my subcommittee in judiciary non-civil. And the discussion about low THC oil that has this sort of hard to define but meaningful impact is made a mockery of in this bill. I say that, hesitantly. I say that because the sponsor of this bill is a friend of mine. I say that because the co-sponsor of this bill, I count as friends. But as we debate this, as we look at what Georgia law is going to allow friends, this is not a bill about medicine in solving medical conditions that the medical community cannot otherwise solve. This is a bill that with complicit doctors around our state effectively puts in place recreational marijuana. The medicinal benefits of these substances happen at much lower rates of THC. You don't need 50% THC honey oil or vape oil to accomplish the medicinal value that cannabinoids can provide. Friends, I provided you on your desk a little flyer. If you're a member of the public watching this, you can't see this. But what it says is, you know, what Senate Bill 220 does, and I say this hesitantly and I say this regrettably, it takes the THC content from 5% to 50%. The concentration of what people are able to ingest in their bodies illegally goes up 10 times in this state by this bill. It's indefensible medically to do this. Unless the purpose of this bill is to get people stoned and being stoned is the medical value that we're trying to glean from this bill, it is indefensible to take the legal limit from 5% to 50%. Many of us don't have a lot of personal experience with low THC oil or the vape oils and these kinds of things. Many of us haven't traveled around the country and experienced these. What I've got for you here friends though is the 28,000 milligrams that's allowed to be possessed under the bill. Technically it doesn't change. 20 ounces at 5% is the same as 2 ounces at 50%. But the 20 ounces at 5% allow someone to kind of stock a year supply if they were to travel to another state to buy it and make it the 20 ounces kind of gave them an opportunity to have a shop stock of a warehouse stock of supply. But what this 2 ounces at 50% does in the hands in the context of vape pens takes 28,000 milligrams of THC and puts in the hands of any Georgian legally. 28,000 milligrams of THC that this bill allows to be in the hands of Georgians in a stack of vape pens you can hold in two hands, puts in your two hands the equivalent THC that will be present in more than 8,000 marijuana joints for the 1980s. I don't know that any members of this general assembly have any experience with such things. But I will tell you the content, the density of marijuana of a THC and marijuana in the 1980s was around 1%. And based on the research, I can show you the studies, a person in this bill is allowed to have in these 56 vape pens they are able to have under this bill. At 50% pure at THC that's the same amount of THC that exists in 8,000 joints from the 1980s friends. The density of marijuana we're talking about here is about getting people stoned. It's not about helping people with cannabinoids. Friends, what this furthermore does is it takes the delivery system of THC from being an oil that's put on your tongue or that's uninvitable. It makes the most bio-available system that we can deliver. Vaping vaporizes the THC that you're able to ingest it and breathe it in like oxygen. Think about the way we're creating our bodies, there are lungs taking in oxygen, automatically translating it into our blood system so we can use it. Things that are eaten or consumed through the tongue go through our digestive system and work their way into our bodies. And as the author of the bill and the sponsor said this is one of the advantages of the bill, they want to be able to get the THC to people as fast as they can. But the bio-availability of 50% THC that's vaporized and goes right into your lungs, the impact that has has nothing to do with medicinal effects of cannabinoids. It's about getting people stoned. Guys, this is a serious bill. This is a serious shift, 10 times the density of this hallucinogenic drug, we're going to legalize by the power of the state senate. The concentration we're talking about, if you want to understand what this means, you think about naturally occurring marijuana that occurred in nature. The 100 years ago, what the cannabis plant produced, about 0.3% of that cannabis plant by dry weight was THC. We're taking the allowable amount in Georgia to 150 times the concentration of THC that naturally occurs in nature. Nature gives us what we need. If someone were taking low THC oil or consuming cannabis in some natural form, those 100s of cannabinoids that are in that, we believe has some medical impact for people. But not by getting rid of all those and distilling down to 150 times the density so it can be smoked, vaped and ingested right into our lungs in a way to make people stoned. Lastly, friends, if we're uncertain about this, why would we consider something that shows these negative medical impacts for adults? Why would we allow for children? The American Academy of Pediatric says that for people under the age of 18, there is no circumstance in which THC is needed to solve children's medical conditions. This bill in 16 of the 18 conditions that are referenced, not all 18, but in 16 of the 18 allow this 50% THC concentration to be delivered to children at any age. Do I believe parents are going to be giving infants this now? I don't believe that's what parents will do. But there is no age limit on who this is delivered to, friends. This is serious policy. And if you believe that the 200 cannabinoids that are in low THC oil and that are naturally occurring cannabis are meaningful, let's protect that. That's what's in law now. But taking the concentration to 10 times what it is today is not about the medicinal value cannabinoids, it's about getting people stoned. It's about legalizing de facto recreational marijuana to the tens of doctors around the state that will give this out for intractable pain or other conditions folks can present and demonstrate and radically change the value of what we did back in 2015 with any so back to give cannabinoids legally to people in the oil form or otherwise the folks that had unique medical conditions and needs. I say this in hesitance to my friends who proposed the bill, but friends, Senate Bill 220 is a dangerous bill. I don't say that lightly. This bill increases what can be given to people legally by 10 times the concentration that exists today and it is not about medicine, but it's about legalizing getting folks stoned and legalizing de facto recreational marijuana under the name of medicine. Mr. President, glad to say questions. Have you yielded Senator? Do you yield for questions? I recognize the senator from the 23rd. Thank you, Mr. President. I will send her yield. Could you refresh my memory when we began discussing the medical use of cannabis? What was the original THC content proposed? We were in 2014, I think it might have been 13 or 14 and it ended up passing in 15. I don't want to quote it wrong. Another discussion is around 0.3%, 0.5%. That was where we started. There was an effort in 2019, I think the center for the six alluded to. When the author of the bill in 19 brought the bill before our House Committee, he didn't propose 5%. He proposed unlimited THC content at 20 ounces. Had we not done our homework, that would have authorized 80% THC at 20 ounces, which at the time about $2 or $3,000 an ounce of street value. We had $7,000 and $7,000 of pure THC honey oil would have authorized. We stopped it. Instead of making an unlimited, we limited it to 5%, which was still a 10X increase over what was originally proposed in this. And 5% was really not low THC oil. It was radically higher, but we left that alone and said, you know what, let's just leave it here. It's not all the THC anyone would ever need because it's supposed to be about the cannabinoids. Thanks, Senator, we filled a year for one follow-up. So I think my recollection is that we started somewhere around 0.5% at least a number of years back. Then we went to 5%, which was 10 times greater. And now the proposal is to go to 50% which should be 100 times greater. Is that not true, Senator? Correct, you know, and I think it's under the false premise that, you know, other states that call themselves medicinal or 50 to 70. Well, that's not, that's really not the question we had to ask ourselves. I don't doubt what other states have done. Many states have wanted to be medicinal in name, recreational and practice. That's what this bill does. This bill is following that lead. If we care about the cannabinoids and the value of this for people with difficult conditions, 5% is probably 10 times what they really need in terms of THC content. Thank you, Senator. Senator, you have, you have no more questions. Mr. President, appreciate that. This is a hard debate to have, but it's a serious question to deal with. I would ask for your opposition to the bill as written in the adoption of the amendments. We passed the amendments that are being offered. I think this is a bill that preserves the integrity of what's proposed initially and that serves Georgians well. Mr. President, that'll yield the well. Senator, from the six. So what we're going to do now, I'm going to let each senator that has a amendment speak to their amendment and then the senators that want to speak, I'll invite them up. So, Senator, from the six, you want to talk, speak to your amendment or you want to wait to your closing. You wait to the closing. Okay. Senator, from the 23rd, I speak to your amendment.

Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues. As has been pointed out, this is a serious discussion, and we're moving quickly to a place where I'm not comfortable. I want to speak specifically to amendment number three. What it would do is under current law, vaping is not allowed as a method of use. Although, if you'll note in the bill on lines 388 through 391, that would allow, it would repeal the ban on vaping. So currently vaping is not allowed. If adopted as is, we would repeal the option of using vaping as a method of delivery. But my amendment simply removes the repeal and goes back to the underlying bill which would require that vaping not be used for the delivery of THC. There are a number of other questions and concerns about the bill, but I look forward to having that conversation with the author. I'm happy to yield the well or yield for questions. Sorry, Senator, I was listening to my boss lady up here, the first lady of the Senate. There you go. There you go, right here. She had me distracted there, so you have no questions, Senator. Thank you. I yield the well. Here from the twilight. Lower your speaks to your amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. President. Amendment number four is really simple. It puts the language back the way it was before we got here today with small exceptions. Under E, on line nine, where one time it said, Crohn's disease, those responsible for looking at the conditions and determining the conditions felt along with the chair, Senator, from the first that inflammatory bowel disease would be better as opposed to Crohn's disease. If you look on the back, it strikes lines 23, 24 and 25. 23, the reason for that amendment. I have a very clear understanding of that condition. I understand the therapies and medications that are out there to address that condition. I have a lot of close friends and late friends who suffer from that condition and the use of marijuana to address that condition is an extremely dangerous mixture. In many cases, it worsens the condition. In number 25, intractable pain, we have all been to the hospital where they hold up the little sunshine and there's a one on one end and a ten on the other end and they ask you to let them know where you feel your pain is there. Have a good friend, retired, Colonel Carl Savry, they said that is absolutely the worst idea that anybody ever had to measure pain. And basically in an environment where recreational marijuana is at the front door knocking, the last thing we need is a condition that cannot be measured, cannot be confirmed. But if you look on the front side, we can measure cancer. We can stage cancer. As the author of the bill said, multiple sclerosis, we can measure it. And all the others, as you come down, whether it's Parkinson's, sickle, cell, when such disease is diagnosed as severe or in stage, Tourette's, when such syndrome is diagnosed as severe, all of those are being measured. But the others we cannot. So all this is doing with tiny exceptions and under the advice of those responsible online E, all we're doing is putting this right back to where it was and not turning it into something that could be easily manipulated and create an environment of recreational marijuana in the state of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chair. If there are no questions, I'll yield the well. You have one question, Senator. Yes, sir. Regan, I'll send it from the 41st. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, you yield. I do. Senator, so you talk about having some concern about people being able to get this marijuana card based on a disease that cannot be measured. We've had this program in place for a little while now. Are you aware of people using intractable pain in order to get thousands and thousands of medical marijuana cards or low THC oil cards? Did you say thousands and thousands? Are you aware of current abuse? Yes. Are you saying thousands and thousands? Yes. I think this is where we lose something in the debate, where we become hypothetical, where we want to blow some number up. I was happy to yield to you for a legitimate question. That's a very close discussion for you. No, ma'am. I'll go ahead and yield the well. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator has yielded. Does any other Senator, well, we have a number of senators just lined up to speak? So, break it down to Senator from 13th. I'm confused. If you're not confused about all the stuff coming out here today you've heard, then you're much more the person I am. But I'm going to read you the definition of confusion from Google. So we know it's true because it comes from Google, okay? To call someone to feel uncertain or unclear or to make something difficult to understand. Are we not there? That's what we are. Let's talk about that for just a minute. First of all, I want to applaud the Senator from the 6th for having the wherewithal and the ability to stand up here and try to do what's right for the people of Georgia. You know it's not proper always. Let me tell you something, folks. Before I came here, and I remember being here in 2020, and I heard about all the stuff about hemp, marijuana, hemp, marijuana, marijuana, hemp, whatever you want to call it, we promised the people of Georgia that we were going to supply them with a quality medical grade marijuana program. We promised them, what have we done? We give them oil to put under their tongue. Why do you think our registry is 22,000 people in Florida's hundreds of thousands? Because they go to Florida to get what they want. We don't give them what they want. Let's take that one step further. You can drive anywhere in this city and get out of your car and guess what you're going to smell. Anywhere you go, we have created a black market in Georgia like nobody's business. And the black market is continued to grow and grow and grow because of what reason, folks. We didn't do what we promised them to, and that's including me and I what even hear. Now I have never drank or smoked. I'm good with banning alcohol, banning everything. You know, we'd have a real fight if we tried that. I mean everybody would come on glue, we'd try that. You know, it's been legally killing people for 200 years, but let's just keep on drinking. Okay. But here we are. We're offering to do a medical grade marijuana for people who need the medical products. Did y'all miss me anywhere in that? I didn't say we were going to go out there and start distributing it like marijuana is going to be legalized and we're going to be taxing it and all that. I didn't say that so I said we're going to supply a medical grade marijuana for people to need it. You take a gummy and I've talked to the scientists, I've talked to the people about this and they'll tell you a gummy takes 45 minutes, basically take effect, about 45 minutes. Now who's going to wait on a gummy, take 45 minutes for you and just pop an opioid? And we want to add dick people on opioids. That's where we go with this, which is what I add it to. So here's the bottom line on the opioids and the gummies. You give them oil. Nobody wants to put all under their tongue. I've heard from people tell me it's horrible and it doesn't give you the effect that you need to get. Now if they vape marijuana from what I'm told and I've been told by many, it's instantaneous and they get the relief they need and guess what? We're talking about vaping medical grade marijuana and here's something you haven't all talking about today. If you don't get it from a medical grade supplier in Georgia, you're going to get it from somebody else. We don't know if it's laced. We don't know what it's got in it. We heard that big word fentanyl. We keep hearing all this stuff. You don't know what it's got. But if they get it from a medical grade facility where we pass laws to make them spend 20 plus million dollars on their facilities and yet we don't allow them to sell their products. Something's wrong with that picture, people. Something's wrong with that picture. Here we are. We're sitting here thinking ourselves, oh, let's just take that right away from them. Well guess what? There's this little thing called internet. Any of y'all ever heard of internet? I'm real tickled with that, the internet. You can find anything you want to internet. You can buy anything you want to internet. Like in Berverg, we talk about it in the morning. Take it away from them. They go order them in. Guess who is the largest supplier of drugs in the country? United States Postal Service. UPS, they're going to bring it right to your door and put it on your doorsteps. Because why? We don't allow them to get it in Georgia. Our medical registry will triple, it'll quadruple, it'll do more than that if we allow people to get quality products in Georgia that makes what they have to have in their system. And I'll tell you something folks, I've seen the effects. I watched where people have epilepsy and a child would have epilepsy or a young person, old adult, whatever. They can take evap and instantaneously they don't have that problem anymore. But no, let's just double up on regular medicine. Let's just go and get them hooked on something for their own rest of their life and hooked on something. Now everybody keeps talking about deaths on marijuana and deaths on this. I swear to you, I keep trying to find anywhere that shows where someone has died with an overdose of marijuana or a vape. I can't find it. I can't find it. Now, anybody who has been a little high and got hit in the car accident, I ain't going to go there. Okay? They also could have been a little drunk and got hit in the car accident. Okay? They also could have been a little stupid and got in the car accident and got killed. Okay? The bottom line of it is it happens. But the reality of it is, medical grade is what we're trying to do to prevent what, the black market that we have in Georgia. And the black market will supply it if we don't allow them to supply it. And I'm telling you right now, I want you pleased to vote down the amendments except number two. All the amendments except number two, there's NG6 offered. And allow and do what we promised we would do to people that need this product. Because if we don't do it, they're going to get it somewhere else. And there's nothing we can do in here. That's 56 people. We cannot change that fact. It will happen. We know it will happen. But at least we'll be giving them something that's medical grade, quality made, and coming from people that we gave licenses to that cost them $100,000 plus dollars had to go build. $50,000 or $100,000 square foot building just to grow this and process this. And we will allow them to get these products to the people that need them. Please vote for this bill and vote down these amendments except number two. And let's move Georgia forward and not be caught in a rat race. Thank you. You'll do well. Senators yielding. We're going to ask the senator from the 56, speaks of the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. This is an important issue with a lot of passion on both sides. I think it's important we have some historical context. Because not many of us were here when this debate first started 13 or 14 years ago. We had a lot of folks here, many with children who may have had epilepsy or other types of medical conditions. And from that, there was a term that we needed CBD oil. And the CBD oil was going to be the answer to help these children, which I think everybody's heart went out to and we wanted to solve that problem. During that time, there was actually a prescription that was created. You can still get today called epidylex, which was designed specifically to treat those with seizures by using the CBD oil. And even though that was available through a doctor in a prescription, we were told, oh no, we must have this and it must be at 0.3% THC. And that debate went back and forth for about 18 months. Finally, they came back and said, it's actually not 0.3, it's 0.5. That's the only way we'll be able to cure these intractable conditions with 0.5 THC. And that went through the committee process and went back and forth between the chambers up to Sinedi-Di one night at about 1158. When the conference committee bill came back and it wasn't at 0.3 and it wasn't at 0.5, it went to 5. 5, a multiple of 10 from what the absolute amount, which was requested, was going to solve all those problems. Think about that for a moment. Now we're talking about going from 0.5% to 50. I mean another 10 times from 5 to 50. Mark my words two years from now. It'll be 100% because that'll be the next ask. But if it was going to be perfect at none and then ideal at 3, but then the only solution was 0.5. And now we went to 5 and now we want 50 to what end? There's a reason why THCs still a schedule one drug. How many times you watch a television and see one more pharmaceutical commercial? Of somebody playing with their dog and throwing the first beat because the next great medicine is going to solve whatever ailments we may have. If this was solving real medical ailments all the time, I promise every big pharma company in the country would have a product on the market already. How is it that since the beginning of mankind, we just found out in the last 12 or 13 years that the solution to every single one of our ails has been popped? It should sound foolish because it is. Let's follow the real science here. Why do we keep doing this? I'll never forget when I met with some folks out in the hall. After the 5% was passed, the very next year, they sat there with tears in their eyes saying, we can't do this unless we can grow our own marijuana. I asked them who paid them. They turned around and walked away. They said they're lobbyists. To what end, I'll ask you one more time what we keep doing this. There's a process for medical conditions. You go to a doctor. The doctor prescribes you whatever medicine or whatever you need in order to hopefully heal you and get you better. We are at such a slippery slope now. If you don't understand what's happened over the last many years, I hope it will give you the perspective you need to support any amendment that will lessen this, or perhaps more importantly not pass this bill. I think it came from those purest of reasoning and thoughts. I respect the senator from the 6th, but the history doesn't line up with the results. Thank you. I yield below. I recognize the senator from the 52nd, speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll try not to take any more time than necessary. I was around for the 0.3%. I remember when the House member brought it over and it said 3%. I thought it was 0.3. He said, it was the top of. But then it was 3% after that. So I knew incrementalism was the goal there. I want to make sure everybody knows how this came about. There was a patient listening tour. Now this tour didn't have the Georgia Department of Public Health, the composite medical board, the Georgia Board of Pharmacy. But their input is that the composite medical board did recommend Lupus and the Crohn's to IBS thing change, I think. But this isn't a randomized double blind control study that we're doing or something like that. This is just a listening tour. You're at 5% what do you want? We want 50%. Okay. We want to wait. Whatever people put on the listening tour was up for this bill and even the department that handles this says the commission and staff prepared this report and should not be construed as an expression perspective practice or viewpoint of the commissioner or staff. Now having said all that, I want everyone to know that that's what it is. My biggest concern though is for the children, the American Academy of Pediatrics do not recommend this. And in fact, they stated that it could be considered child abuse. Now there are a condition too that, you know, there's some studies that say it could help. They also feel like there's other medicines that could be helpful there. But this doesn't limit it to those. I mean, we've got, we're at the point now we're letting three-year-olds vape. You know, and you could say, well, if they've got a terminal condition and they're going to be gone on a few months or something, what's the harm? But a lot of these are not terminal conditions. The evidence is there. Then the brain, it increases the gaps in what's called the synapses. It slows down transmission. It's not good for the brain for these children. And that's not both disappointing part in this bill that they were having this wide open for all these children here. And so because of that, I can't support the bill. With that, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. We're going to add as the Senator from 54th. Mr. President, friends, as many of you know, you know what I did for 30 years working with the kids on probation. And any of those kids came from broken homes, single parent situations. And literally, what I did is I worked with the kids of families. The kids were not necessarily the problem. And there was actually the result of the problem too many times of the desperate and the destitute. And that's what these vices continue to reach out and cuddle to. This is not an answer. And you know, since I've been here since 2017, they're going back to 2015 and 2015, THC cannabis oil legalized for medical use in the state under HB1. In 2018, I was here at that point. The Georgia House Bill 65 added intractable pain and post-traumatic stress disorder to the conditions to qualify. In 2019, House Bill 324 allowed for the cultivation of cannabis and the sale of low THC oil within the state of Georgia. And in 2021, the Georgia Senate passed Senate Bill 195, which allowed the sale of cannabis tinctures and transdermal patches and motions and captions. And each one of these since I've been here in 2017, I brought the point that still schedule one drug. And for those of you unaware, a schedule one drug, the federal government has deemed as having zero medicinal purpose. Zero medicinal purpose. Cocaine is a scheduled to drug because cocaine has been deemed to have medicinal purpose. But marijuana has been deemed to have zero medicinal purpose. So federal law under schedule one says, we're not about to touch this. It said that in 2015. It said that in 2018. It said that in 2019. It said in 2021. And it said it today. The schedule classification has not changed on marijuana in this country. And that takes me back to the reason why you've not got any medical reports on your desk of any Georgia medical facilities or institutions of study because all of these can't put something on your desk. Because all of these are at the threat of losing their federal funding for even touching marijuana. They can't do the studies in our institutions legally out of fear of losing their federal funding. Why? Because marijuana is still a schedule one classification. Until we've got the cart so far in front of the horse on this, it's time to get the horse back out in front of the cart. And if we are a nation of law, and I don't want to go into the history, but the term rule of law came out of the age of enlightenment. Because people lived by the rule of law rather than the rule of kings. We were the great experiment. And that's why we became a nation of laws where every time every job I've had since high school from the Army to 30 years of state probation officer, now serving the Georgia state senate, just like all of you. We put our hands on our Bob and Rita right hand. We just swear in the legents to governor. We just swear in the legents to the president. We swear in the legents to the law. The law is our king and we are all to have reverence for the law to uphold the law and make sure that the law is that sense of understanding is there for generations to come. But going down this path, we open Pandora's box. I voted all against those because I could see where this was going. And one time, anyone that was here back in the ink test, I didn't go speak against any of those. That's the first time coming to this issue. But it's just getting to the point where raising these levels to these amounts. This is just a pathway to get to the point of legalization. And it's still a federal law. The federal government still says it's a schedule one drug, which brings it back to our oaths of office. That my friends is while we all put our hands on the Bible in this room in January. This war knows to affirm and support the Constitution of this state and the United States. Meaning we are all obligated to uphold the state and federal law in everything that we do in this chamber. And so the mistake happened in 2015 when they pushed that aside and did what they chose to do rather than doing what the law allowed. I'll just encourage you not to do it. Don't keep going further and further and further and further down this road. I don't know if whoever closed the door is boxed, but going further and further and further down that road is certainly not the answer. At the end of this, one of these days other people are going to fill these seats in this room. And I would like for us to be remembered in this body and this time as a people that maintain the rule of law for future generations to come, not the rule of our lust or the rule of our desires, but the rule of law. Thank you, Mr. President. Now we yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Senators yielded. I will say that the Senator from the 54th, we do have a special guest, the former Senator from the 54th, Justice Charlie Bethel is here today. Let's give Justice Bethel. Charlie, Justice Bethel was a good friend of mine in this body and he was a, he and I were young. We were young when we started out over here, Bethel. He taught me a lot and I always appreciated his friendship and he definitely enjoyed representing the people of Dalton, Georgia. So he always does well and he does well in his current role too. He's one of those level headed, level headed common sense guys. So good, always good to have you there. Justice Bethel. I recognize the Senator from the first. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief, but I just want to give a little bit of a background related to this. I too like the Senator from the 56th was here. It was in the house actually is the second co-signer for medical marijuana. And what we chose to do then and now is separate out the difference between recreational marijuana and medical marijuana. What we're discussing right now is medical marijuana. What we were discussing the last previous two bills was recreational marijuana. And I voted against the recreational marijuana. I voted against the beverages and so forth. This bill came through Health and Human Services and I helped the Senator on this bill and we modified it and made some good changes. Yes it is true that marijuana is a scheduled one drug but is also true that the DEA is looking to reclassify it as a federal rule one year ago, almost to the date.

They said that they're going to reclassify it as a schedule three drug. So that is to be determined. As you know, the previous administration moved a little bit more slowly than this president administration. So I expect that to speed up. But I'll digress. I'm digressing. That's going on too long. This is about access. Actually, that's what this is about. Access to the medical marijuana coming to see your physician who has gone through the training and taken the test and has the person has the card. They go get it at the dispensary and they get that. What we have done with this, yes, like 18 other states in which only medical marijuana is prescribed. In the words 18 states that does that do just like the state of Georgia medical marijuana, not recreational marijuana. What we have done, we have aligned ourselves to make the nomenclature the same. Those states do it 50% up to 75% and as explained by the author of the bill, we chose the lowest percentage possible. But what we also did was we took down the volume of the oil from 20 ounces to two ounces. A big difference because what people were doing obviously were consuming more of the oil to get a higher percentage. So we just changed the nomenclature basically on that. We added on a portion of public education and assigned that to the Department of Public Health. We also took the recommendation of Department of Public Health and the Georgia Composite Medical Board working in conjunction and adjusted the definitions. I'm sorry, just the conditions, the conditions basically we cleared up and made it inflammatory bowel disease. We made it so you could actually use it for peripheral neuropathy instead of in stage and we made it to just severe. We allowed it to get it be used for cancer, just cancer in general rather than waiting until in stage or terminal cancer. When people have cancer, they want to be able to use it. If we're not allowing it now, they're going to go to Florida or other states adjacent to us that do allow that. I think that's just a common conception. That's all it does. It doesn't do much more than that. Yes, it does push the envelope a little bit more, but I think we are looking at that from that perspective, from a medical marijuana, not from a recreational marijuana. With that, Mr. President, I'll yield the well. Thank you. Seniors yielding. We're going to have a center for the 29th. Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate everything everybody has said up here so far. I would say my good friend from the first while while he's right on a lot of the stuff he said. Someone disappointed that by striking after cancer, when such disease is diagnosed as in stage, well, the treatment produces, you know, and after all the others, they strike afterwards. So it's cancer and understands not skin cancer. And I have a little familiarity with cancer and in stage and all this. I lost my mother and my father to do very preventable cancers. My dad died of lung cancer at the age of 56. And my mother died of colon cancer at the age of 65. And I saw him from the healthy people they were as their life went in the direction it went in. And as they dealt with morphine and other medications and the great treatment they received up here in Atlanta and back home and everything else. And at no time was marijuana ever an option. But we manage their pain. So I don't understand this cancer mean when you get diagnosed with cancer and before you do chemo and all this other stuff, I'm okay to go get it. And I don't have to tell everybody in this chamber. I've witnessed the effects of marijuana. And I'll give you something that's old school that makes me old and rusty and out of touch and all of this. It is a gateway drug. It is. You don't go to a house and find crack cocaine or meth or heroin and other stuff of that nature where you rarely, rarely do you not find an amount of marijuana there amongst it. But the sooner from the sixth intent, I do not believe was to create the wild wild west of marijuana. I don't think that was his intent. But I think that is a collateral effect that will occur as we continue to expand this. To my friends that came up to my friend from the 56 and others that came up here and talked about how this all came about, I was here when CBD oil was voted on for children. And I came to this well and I made a painful prophecy that in a few years, children would not be part of our conversation. It would be adults who saw an opportunity. And there are people that go to Florida to get it. And I say that because Florida has yielded Florida is a marijuana state. The the owner of Morgan and Morgan spent millions and millions and millions of dollars fighting the sheriff of Pope County, Grady Judd and an attempt to make recreational marijuana. Every day business in Florida and the reason he did it is because it's business. It's money. That's what they see it as. They're not thinking about sick children. But limited research has been done on this product and you've heard it because it's a schedule one. And while the senator from the first is absolutely right, they have attempted to do this and reschedule it for research. They've been attempting to do this for almost 20 years to reschedule this so it can be researched. This isn't some new silver bullet that's going to come out. Two years ago, I offered up the opportunity for us to put a study committee together and look at this and do the right thing. That never happened. What we're doing here, there's medication out there to handle these problems. But we don't want to do that. But I want to tell you, if you want to keep pushing the envelope on marijuana, then when you talk about homelessness, understand the impact that marijuana has on the homeless community. When I was in Denver, I went to the largest homeless shelter I ever been to and I asked the man that ran it. I said, did marijuana make them homeless? He said no, sir, Mr. Robertson, it didn't, but it keeps them homeless because now they smoke it and they nobody will hire them because they test positive for marijuana. And nobody wants to accept that liability. When the state of Washington legalized marijuana, they told the Chamber of Commerce for the state of Washington that they could not recommend drug testing through their programs that tested for marijuana. And the Chamber of Commerce of Washington State had to sue the state of Washington to make sure that they still have the right to tell their members that they could continue to test for marijuana. If you want to see the continuation of addiction, then you create this marijuana community. The people that step up in this well and talk about it. If you want to continue to talk about unemployment, then expand the marijuana industry in the state of Georgia. If you want to continue to talk about violence among young people, school violence, street violence, everything that comes along with it, then expand marijuana, then you can continue having violence. Research has shown, legitimate research has shown the young man between the ages of 15 and 25, developed psychosis. These are regular marijuana users and understand the vaping aspect of this alcohol consumption by young people down vaping is up. The average kid vapes enough THC or tobacco during a single day that equals two packs of cigarettes. Think about that. This is what they're putting in their bodies. These are young minds that aren't fully developed and we expect them to follow all the rules of life. This is the danger of expanding marijuana. The impact on the economy is going to devastate. Crime will rise and again I said the other day in the well. Build bigger jails, build bigger prisons because we're going to need them. And Atlanta will be able to fall into that group along with Portland, along with San Francisco, and along with the open drug markets and Philly. Because y'all may not know it but there's somebody over in the house pushing the bill forward. To make hallucinogenics a possibility to deal with PTSD. But my friend from the 13th came up and gave a passionate speech. And my only retort to that is I never promised anybody anything. I never promised anybody a clean and open and healthy marijuana industry in Georgia. And yes, there's marijuana being sold in the city of Atlanta right now. And if we legalize it all, there's still going to be the illegal sales of marijuana in the city of Atlanta as there are in New York, California, Colorado everywhere. Because they aren't going to be able to sell everything they produce in stores and in shops. So they're going to sell it on the street. That's what it's shown for all those times. And there you you asked a great question. I think the senator did about somebody dying from it. But what you forgot is a week ago here in the city of Atlanta, a child at a daycare overdose on a gummy that she got out of the pocket of the daycare worker. There have been overdoses throughout this country of children with gummies and other things that are supposed to be safe. And you're right, they can buy it on the internet. There's other horrific stuff they can buy on the internet too, but we outlaw that, right? And people came in and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars banking on an industry that they hoped would come here. So they could get a good return on their investment. It is not the responsibility of the 56 men and women in this chamber to prop up the businesses of other people. There are people in this room that are business owners that have been very successful and have failed at times. It is not our job to support those industries. The senator from the sixth is well intended. I absolutely believe that. But this is not how we do it. We have it done already. Give it time. Let it work. We're moving too fast. Please vote yes on amendment four. Or vote down this legislation. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. All right, senator. I forgot to let you up here two times. I was out of order on that. But the. All right, thank you. We got one last speaker here. Senator from the 32nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the senator from the sixth for working to make changes from his original bill. And I just wanted to point out a couple things. First of all, we got some problems with our current process. And I'm going to continue working on this. And I think the senator from the six of work with me. We've got a doctor in New York has certified over 2,000 people in Georgia for medical marijuana cards. There's something wrong with the process. We need to fix. Full disclosure, I have some friends in the medical cannabis business. But as a physician, I've always spoken against smoking and vaping. And I've got with me two studies that basically show that cannabis vaping is more harmful than nicotine vaping. I'd be happy to share that with anybody. Many of the conditions on the list are not terminal conditions. And so people might be doing vapes for pre-rolls for months, years, or decades. So I know everybody's tired of the subject. So that's all I had to say. I'm yielding the well. Thank you. All right. We are now at the point where I'm going to close debate with the senator from the six. Senator's floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, this can be an emotional topic for all of us. It's more emotional for some of those at home, those living with cancer, ALS, seizures, MS, Parkinson's, sickle cell, terats, several others. And for those of you listening at home, I want you to know that my colleagues that are speaking against this. They're not against you. They're not against whatever illness that made to be able to teach you. They're simply against recreational marijuana, which this bill does not do. Under current Georgia law, any one of us sitting in these seats, no matter if you got one of these illnesses or not, anybody walking these halls, anybody walking the streets of Georgia, without a doctor can walk into a gas station, biogamy, and get as the senator from the 37th, so eloquently stated, you can get stoned. In fact, we just voted on it earlier. Senate Bill 33, you can walk into a gas station with nothing wrong with you and get stoned. This bill says, and our program says, under the direction of a doctor, someone with a listed diagnosis in law, can go get medicine from one of the most regulated industries, if not the most regulated industries we have in this state. What separates us from other states that went the way of recreational, and even separates us from medical marijuana states like Florida, is we did two things that they failed to do. We got hold of our list of diagnoses, and we got a tight grip around the amount of licenses that we put out there. That is what separates us from those states. That is why we have a good program. And now all I'm asking is that we provide the right to the right to the right. And we have the proper access that will allow the proper dosage to some of these patients that are in need. While we were debating this, I got two text messages, one from an MS patient who actually happened to know her mother, actually was a pastor at one of my previous churches, said her MS is so bad, she's not as lucky as my mother. MS is so bad, she's tried many drugs, and the pain is too much. She too goes to the Shepherd Center. Her doctor is now recommending that she try medical marijuana. Another patient texted me, or I got a patient from someone else whose cousin was end of life with cancer. Throat was so bad, could not eat a gummy, or any other form of marijuana, and the vaping was the only relief he could get in his last eight weeks of life before he passed. And that is all we're asking is for relief for these poor people with one of these diagnoses that we have written in law. Our urge that you vote against the amendments, except for mine. Number two, and our urge that you help me pass Senate Bill 220. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. Senator has yielded the well, and we have closed debate. It is time now to take up the amendments. We're just going to go in order. Amendment number one, authored by the senator from the 37th. Is there objection to amendment number one? There is objection of amendment number one. All those that are in favor of amendment number one will vote ye, all opposed nay, secretary, and slot in the machine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

They all came over for something to snack them. Senator knows what he speaks. Recognize senator from 27th. Probably measure inquiry. Is it not true the house members are over here looking for some good ideas? Yeah. Yeah. Tell you what, I hope you don't have your bills over in the house senator.

Parliamentary. The next bill about THC Mr. President or are we going to move on something else? You never know around here senator. Thank you. All the adoption of amendment number four the ye is our 12th and nays are 43 and this amendment has failed. Questions on the adoption of the committee repent.

All in the pass of the bill the yays are 39 and the nays are 17 and I will, this bill will have received recited constitutional majorities therefore passed by substitute. Secretary Senate bill 218. Senate bill 218 by Senator Robertson the 29th and others the bill is being counted on the 29th to the 10th of 15 of the 50th Georgia annotated. The court says the prosecuting attorney's qualifications commission shall be assigned for administrative purposes only to the administrative office of the court and shall be funded by funds appropriate or otherwise available to the judicial branch of state government to amend code section 16-11-130 of the 50th Georgia annotated. The court says the attorney's qualifications commission is required to apply the court otherwise available to the judicial branch of state government to provide for appeals from the decisions of hearing panel's prosecuting attorneys and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senator Robertson of the 29th offers the following amendment number 1 to amend the Senate Committee on Judiciary substitute to Senate bill 218 by replacing line 11 with the following commission investigators to provide for subpoenas to by striking lines 129 through 153. Mr. President, that completes the order. I recognize the Senator from 29th speaks to the bill. Colleagues SB-218 is something you're familiar with. There's the prosecuting attorney's qualification commission. It's very simple what it does is it moves the commission from the PX from the PAC over to the administrative office of the courts for better management. It also creates the subpoena power necessary to conduct the investigations. In the original bill, if you look on lines 129 through 153, you see where the council have asked for the ability to also have search warrants. I met with PAC, met with the district attorney from, I believe, was the cab county and the president of the Solicitor General's Association and we have struck that language. We feel that any investigation done under these circumstances, a subpoena power would give them the necessary evidence without them being intrusive.

or to be able to carry out the investigation under the power issued in a search warrant. So the amendment is to strike lines 129 through 153. And with that, Mr. President, I'll yield the well unless there are any questions. Yes. You do have one question in the center from the 44th. Thank you, Mr. President. Will the German yield? I do. Thank you so much. Actually, I should have said the whip. Mr. Whip, thank you for your amendment. Thank you for working with the Decav County District Attorney's Office on that. Very much appreciated. Just two quick questions. Number one, I'm looking at line 55 and 55 and 56 where in the original bill, the privilege of confidentiality, I believe, and confirm for me if this is accurate, could only be waived by the person who is the subject of the investigation. And now we're adding also that the complainant or the person lodging the complaint can also waive confidentiality. Am I right about that? Yes, that's way, that's, that's, yes, ma'am. What, in this, and within this rubric that's set up for the PACUC, what does waiving the privilege of confidentiality mean exactly? That the, in my understanding is the way that when the commission asked for it, was that some individuals start out attempting to file anonymous complaints and other things, and this would give the commission the opportunity if they wanted to make themselves known they could. And again, when we met with PAC, the DAs and the solicitors, like I said, there was no objection to any of that other than the search warrant issue that we had. Thank you. One more question online. Lines 84 and 85. Why does your legislation change the effective date of complaint submissions retroactively and to go backward in time so that they could have occurred between April 1, 2023 and May 5, 2023 when originally it was only May 5, 2023. That was a friendly amendment made in judiciary. I believe that was offered up by the Senator from the 19th and there was no objection. To be honest with you, the dates were of no concern of mine. My primary concern of this legislation was the oversight as far as moving it into the administrative office of the courts and the the subpoena power. And so that was a friendly amendment made in judiciary. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the well. Yes, sir. Senator Gilden. Senator Gilden.

Mr. President, Senator Quentin, and judiciary, recommended this bill to pass, or strictly submitted, Senator Strickland, Chairman, that completes the order, Mr. President. We're going to ask Senator from the 46th. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I bring you Senate Bill 207. You may recognize this bill. This was Senate Bill 157 last session. I remember that number because we passed it at least twice on our side, trying to get the house to take action on this bill. Certainly, all went to the well and gave speeches about how important this bill was. We did not get it done last year, so we're bringing it back again. We know now that one in six jobs in our state required occupational license, despite that, all the boards we have set up treat criminal records differently. What we're doing with this bill is standardizing the process to help people who want to go work in our state get a job. We're also helping employers find workers as well. You'll see on your desk a letter of support for this bill from the Georgia Chamber Commerce, the Metro Atlanta Chamber Commerce, and the Georgia Faith and Freedom Coalition as well. I also want to thank the Georgia Justice Project for their work on this bill the last few years. In particular, what the bill does is it confirms the type of crimes that a occupational licensing board will look at when it comes to people that want to apply for a license. It makes certain there's a direct relationship between the previous offense someone committed and the occupation those people will be working in. It also creates due process with an appeal process for someone that's denied a license. It's one of the most important things it does to me is it creates what's called a predetermination process. It's someone that wants to work in a certain industry can find out before they go and spend money on training, on education, whether or not because of their past crimes they can work in that industry. It requires information put on websites. It's very bad to see from each board as to what the process is when it comes to how to apply and how to have your predetermination process made out based on your previous criminal record. Lastly, we're going to collect public data over how criminal records are impacting those that want to work in license fields in our state. Thank you members of the Senate for sticking with me on this issue. Again, thank you to supporters that have been there the last couple of years work on this very important bill that I hope a lot of people in our state find a way to get a job and have to answer any questions. You have no questions. As for your favorable support, thank you. Senator Hizzyilden, does any other senator which speak for against a measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections and the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered.

Related to life insurance, associated prohibit a policy of group life insurance from excluding or restricting liability, for certain deaths occurring while an individual is a service member, provided for related matters for effective dates, your bill conflicting laws, and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Ah, the dean of the Senate. Senate from the 15th. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief. Thank you very much. Senator, I bring to you a very personal kind of piece of legislation today. And I want to add by starting off with the insurance commissioner. I want to offer a great deal of thanks to the commissioner of insurance, commissioner King for his assistance in this matter. Today, I speak to you on the bill that is deeply personal, not just for me, but for a family and I'll say who has endured an imaginable hardship. I'm here to share the story of Mr. Powell Frazier. He's lost almost everything dear to him. And the past year, Mr. Frazier has suffered the tragic loss of his two sons and his beloved wife. His oldest son tragically took his own life. Soon after his wife succumbed to an illness and passed away, and just under two years ago, his second son, Brandon Frazier, who served with honor in the National Guard, lost his life in a fatal car accident. But the famous to Frazier faces doesn't end there. After all of this, when he tried to claim the life insurance benefit for his son, Brandon's policy, he was met with an unimaginable obstacle. The insurance company refused to pay out the claim simply because Brandon was a member of the National Guard at the time of his death. Nothing else. A provision that was buried in the fine print, but it paid his premiums. This is not a matter of policy. It's just a matter of justice. No one. No family should have to have to suffer this kind of treatment, especially it not a man who's already endured so much tragic hurt. That's why today I introduced and bringing to you Senate Bill 109. Hopefully that will be a cure for this kind of action in the future. This bill is about fairness. It's about making sure that men and women who serve in our armed forces and their families are treated with dignity and respect, especially in the time of grief. It's about ensuring that no one else in Georgia ever has to face the heartbreak that Mr. Frazier has gone through. This legislation, legislation of past will make sure that no insurance company can exploit a provision to deny a life insurance benefits the family like Mr. Frazier. Founder in the industry have already given so much to our country and to our state. And please, please support this in favor of our National Guard and men and women of the military so they'll never have to do this again. And I want to once again add that the commission of insurance were very sincerely and diligently and effective with the Senate from the 15th to solve this problem. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll hear for questions if any. You do have a couple questions. Yes, sir. I recognize the senator from the 13th for a question. The distinguished Dean, you have a question? Yes, sir. Is it not true that you are one of the longest serving members in this distinguished body? Well, if you say so, sir. Senator, do you? Thank you. Is it not true that we look up to you and we always kind of follow our new, we want to emulate what you do and make sure everything's done right? Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Is it not true that you walked down the Senate, we're all out to get to the podium? You're, I did. I did. And I'm a strong advocate of walking, not walking down now. But remember this, there was no one in the well at the time. Mr. President, I yield to his superior. Why is, man? Senator from the 40th. Thank you, Mr. President. Does the senator yield? Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me, is this the very first democratic bill that's been heard on the floor of the Senate, this entire session? I don't know the answer to this, but I'll yield to your knowledge of it. Can you repeat, please? I said I don't know that for sure, but I yield to your knowledge of it. And is it the 28th day of the session, or session day and at 3.11 pm? I didn't hear the background. Is it the 28th session, right? She's correct, it is 2.11 pm in the afternoon. Yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you, I'm sorry. I got to go out here. Thank you so much. Senator, I need more questions. You have the first time you have some questions, Senator. But when you get done being in politics, you need to go be a reader for audio books. Because you got that silky smooth voice. So you know, this sounds like, just sounds like a radio voice right there. You raised me right, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you very kind of. Appreciate your consideration. All right. Anyone, any other Senator, would speak for against a measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objections, previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous question is ordered. Question is only adoption of the committee. Substitute, is there objections to the adoption of the committee? Substitute. Hearing none, the committee, substitute is adopted. Is there objections to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favor to the past of the bill? Chair, here's none. For the committee's agreed to. Is there objections to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the past of the bill by substitute. All those in favor vote, yay. All opposed, nay. Secretary, I'm not the machine. All opposed. All opposed. All in the past of the bill, the yays are 53 and the nays are zero. This bill has received rickson constitutional majority. Is there for pass by substitute? Good job, Senator. Secretary, Senate bill 149. Senate bill 149, by Senator Hickman and other. Is there for bill tonight to amend. Code section 20, dash 411. The official got a Georgia annotated. Related to definitions regarding tuition and equalization grants at private colleges and universities. So it's to revise the definition of approved schools. Revived for a later matterstripe of public looking laws and further purposes. Mr. President, the Senate command and higher education recommends this bill do pass with strictly submitted Senate burns to the 23rd. District chairman, Mr. President, I can please the order. We're going to send for the fourth. Thank you, Mr. President. College, this is another great workforce development bill, Senate bill 149. This bill was actually passed out of Senate last year and went to the house and passed out the house, but house attacks and institutions didn't quite have the qualifications that the bill needed. And we got a veto by the governor, but it's just those institutions have been taken out of it. Georgia tuition, equalization grant program encourages Georgia residents to attend eligible private colleges in Georgia by aiding towards educational cost. This tuition acquisition program was started in 1971. This is a non-needs based scholarship for Georgia students that currently revised $550 per semester and $367 per quarter. Currently there are 32 private and college in Georgia that qualified for this program. Senate bill 149 will keep the rigorous requirements for qualified institutions, but allow the program to serve more students as this workforce demands of the Georgia economy growth. Senate bill 149 will allow for newly qualified four year college institution students to participate in the TEG program. The colleges and universities must be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges as a level six institution. This is the highest level of accreditation and is only awarded to college with the highest ethics and practice in Georgia. As I stated earlier, this bill was passed by the Senate last year, but was not successful ultimately because the house attached from less institutions to the bill. Through consultation Georgia Student Finance Commission, we believe that the current level of appropriation is sufficient to support this light adjustment in the TEG program. As Georgia grows, it only makes sense that we support quality educational opportunities for our best and brightest here at home. Thank you, Mr. President and I yield well. Please vote green on the bill. Does any other Senate wishes to speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there objections or green to the Board of the Committee, which is favourable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none. The Board of the Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the past of the bill. All those in favour of the bill will vote yes. Opposed, nay, Secretary, and unlock the machine. On the past of the bill, the yeas are 50 and the nays are four. This bill have reciculated constitutional majority as therefore passed. Moving on to Senate bill 163. Senate bill 163. Secretary? Senate bill 163 by Senator Moore, the 53rd, and others, bill 1710, like to men, per five, Article 4 of chapter 11, the title 16, the official going to Georgia and Tade only to Breedy Law Regulation, so as to revise standards for bringing an action against the government for an unauthorized act relating to regulation of weapons, right for definitions, right for related matters, for political looking laws, and for other purposes. Mr. President, Senate, Committee, and judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, which by force minutes, and the Strickland Chairman. Mr. President, Senate Committee, and judiciary, he offers the following substitute to Senate bill 163, bill 173, entitled act to men, per five, Article 4 of chapter 11, title 16, the official going to Georgia and Tade only to Breedy Law Regulation, so as to revise standards for bringing action against the government for an unauthorized act relating to regulation of weapons, right for definitions, right for related matters, to appeal for political looking laws, and for other purposes. Mr. President, I already purchased the Senate bill 163, he's been attached, that completes the interim. Mr. President. Oh, wait a minute. This is the Senator from the 53rd's first bill here. Ever? Ever in the history of the legislative, even in your time in the House? Well, y'all better go after him. Senator from the 53rd, come on. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I've got a simple bill. It's a good bill. It's a cleanup bill. You see, back in the mid-90s, when the Democrats controlled things, the Democrats put this into law. My piece of legislation doesn't create any new law. It just updates existing law. So, my friends at the Democratic Party, I certainly hope that you will continue on and strengthen up our preemption laws in this state. It's a very simple bill. It says that we, in the Georgia General Assembly, we get to make the laws that govern our states. And municipalities, they don't get to come up with ordinances that subvert what we debate and legislate on in this room. So, when citizens in Northwest Georgia go to a place like Savannah, and there is a mayor there who has put in ordinances that violate their second amendment rights, my piece of legislation simply says that those citizens, just like your citizens, have a right of tort to sue those governments for violating those rights. The Democrats said that that tort would be $100. This piece of legislation simply raises that to $50,000. Mr. President, I'll yield to any and all questions. You do have a couple questions. Senator, from the six. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, do you yield? Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. Senator, I was looking at lines 14 and 15. Lawful weapons carrier shall have the same meaning as set forth in code section 16-11-125.1. Can you tell me the definition as stated in section 16-11-125.1? So, a lawful weapons carrier, I believe as it relates to that code section, is a rifle, or a handgun, but you'll notice in the legislation there's two definitions. There's the lawful weapons carrier, and there's also the definition of a weapon. And the lawful weapons carrier is what relates to this piece of legislation. That's where the tort comes from and the definition that you see on 16 simply defines what the tool to be used is. So you don't know section 16-11-

one twenty five point one. Well Senator this code section as you see has been used in constitutional carry it's it's been used in many different other gun related bills for the last probably I don't know half a decade or so and I certainly trust legislative council in that regard. Did I hear you say you trust government? No sir I do not trust government. Were you farther yield for one last absolutely senator senator most pieces of legislation have an effective date and I was looking through your bill and did not see an effective date is there a reason for that well there is senator because right now as it stands law abiding citizens maybe subject to incarceration if they don't pay a thousand dollar fine or even more in places like Savannah so until this bill becomes law ultimately law abiding citizens could face jail time so that's why the effective date should be immediately. Should be or when does your bill become a law well upon passage and signature by the governor. Do you know that or if there's more questions I want to make sure I get your vote for sure. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. All right senator from the 54th. Senator from the 54th your light zone. Thank you miss president senator yield absolutely to my seat mate. I was looking through this through your legislation and what part of this reclaims the Tennessee River. Senator there is another piece of legislation that will hopefully make it through this Senate you know it's it's very sad that the 35th parallel of our state we've been arguing it since the mid 1800s and unfortunately our state has never had the courage to advance upon the Tennessee and reclaim that land. Thanks senator. We're going to send it from the 42nd. That's Senator you absolutely. Senator I support your bill but to be honest with you to address the elephant in the room I'm concerned whether or not because it's your bill this bill can get passed in the house do you share that concern. No senator I really don't share that concern because it's such a good piece of legislation that certainly they would recognize that and put personal differences aside and work for the people of Georgia and not for their self interest. Do you further yield absolutely. I agree with you but isn't it true that you personally have had difficulty physically getting in the other chamber in this building. That's correct senator and that's why it's so important I recognize what it means to be a law-abiding citizen and have to go to jail okay so I don't want other law-abiding citizens to have to go through that same circumstance and that's why it's critical we passed this legislation. Do you further yield absolutely. So you agree with me for this bill to become law it has to physically go from this chamber into the house chamber correct. That's correct and I've made the same constitutional argument that I've got right to do that. You know that's the led. They burnt the constitution down over there a couple weeks ago and hopefully they've learned their lesson and we don't have those problems anymore. You'll have one more question. Absolutely. To be fair senator you have been successful in physically entering the house chamber. I wonder if you could show me if the bill was watching right now show us physically how you think this bill should move its body to get into the house chamber. Well senator I think it should go in with what I call the Fawni Willis hands. So you got to put your hands back here because if they come up here they'll get you with Fawni assault right so it's got to go in peacefully. Oh my. Senator from the forward team. Thank you Mr. President. The senator yield. Absolutely. Senator obviously we serve together in the house and so I'm somewhat familiar with the way you draft bills. You pick the number fifty thousand dollars as actual damages for a lawsuit in this bill right. That's right. Regarding the number fifty thousand can you describe the location that you pulled that out of? Well fifty thousand is commonly used in a lot of other places and not what you're referring to senator. Okay that's all thanks. Thanks senator. Senator you have your first bill coming out later on. It's one of the fourteenths. Mr. President I would like to articulate too that you know the center from the 14th and now we have do we do have a long history. Yeah we don't care about that. And I'm going to be here. Senator from the 13th. Senator from the 13th ladies. Senator from the 14th I am going to be voting for your legislation today and I certainly hope you vote for mine. Senator you absolutely. Senator I appreciate this bill. I just want in a very very quick answer if you don't mind. Why do you think the Democrats might have voted against this bill? Why they might have voted against it. Yeah well personally Senator I think that they're very soft on crime and I think that that creates a lot of violent situations and a lot of these cities and ultimately the second amendment is there to protect law-abiding citizens from things like violent crime so I think that's why they have a a difference of opinion of both myself and the majority caucus. Senator from the actually your light is own senator from the 53rd but I'm up here. Obviously nobody's home but but the senator from the 51st. This is too much fun. Senator will you give him? Absolutely. Can you explain what that lapel pen is on your left lapel your jack? It's a it's an AR 15. Can you explain to those folks in this building and the people listening back home what an AR 15 really is and that is it up on a salt weapon or what is it? Absolutely not Senator but I would refer you back to a very well articulated argument by the senator from the 13th earlier in this session where he gave the exact definition of where it comes from. It's the AR comes from a branding of a manufacturer that manufactured this style rifle. And is it a fully automatic weapon? Senator this actually is not a weapon at all it's a pen that just goes on my jacket. Could it be used as a weapon? Senator there are some of my democratic colleagues who have seen it in flinched a little bit today but I had to remind them it is just a pen. And if it were a weapon could it hurt someone without that person pulling the trigger? Absolutely could not. The killer is the person who is behind the trigger. That's correct. Thank you. I support you Bill. Thank you. I recognize the senator from the second. Thank you Mr. President. The gentleman from through the director of the UU. Absolutely. Now Senator we had a tort reform measure just a couple of weeks ago. Is that not true? That is true. And you voted in the no posture. Is that not true? That's correct. I was the only Republican to vote no. And so Senator is it further true that you asking for the support of our colleagues and the majority who overwhelmingly say that we need to in frivolous lawsuits. So therefore Senator is this not then another frivolous lawsuit for cities who don't have a cap on damages to then be sued with the maximum damages? Is that not true? Senator I believe that the majority caucus does recognize moderation in this state and since they have eliminated a lot of tort with their tort reform maybe they can you know appreciate bringing a little tort back. Does the senator further you? Absolutely Senator. So Senator it is my understanding that would this not be like the saying that comes from South Georgia that says sometimes people talk out of both sides of their neck. Is that not true? Well Senator I mean we are a bunch of politicians in this room and I think people outside of this room say that about us all. So hopefully we can rectify that and we can all vote for this legislation. One more question. Senator from 31st. Well Senator you. Absolutely. So in all seriousness if I'm a lawful weapons carrier and a criminal breaks into my car and takes my weapon and I'm following the law. Should I be penalized as a Georgian or should the politicians in that local community be cracking down on the criminals who took my weapon weapon unwaffingly? Senator you make the point quite well with that question. I mean ultimately as I said previously the second amendment protects us all. It's the great equalizer and we have places in Savannah. I mean let's not forget about the Ellis Square shooter in Savannah who was out on bond when he did that violent crime. So maybe if we prosecuted criminals they wouldn't have these types of situations in Savannah but when constituents in northwest Georgia want to visit a place like Savannah they shouldn't have to be worried about facing gel time for doing their legal duty to protect themselves and their family. All right Senator this is a point in time where you can yield the well at any given time. Miss President I just want to make sure I've had one opportunity in five years to present a bill here if there's any more questions I will be happy to answer you just want to fill some questions don't you? I want to make sure this thing passes. I can tell you right now you can't oversell something in this chamber now Senator but I'll let you have one more Senator from the eight I'll let you have one more here. Does the senator you absolutely for the senator from the eight so Senator I hear you often when you go to the well you you say that you're from the northwest that's right is the northwest a sovereign nation. Senator we've contemplated it if you'll look at a state quarter you'll notice that my home county of Dade County is not present on that state quarter we're the independent state of Dade we only have one state highway that connects us to the rest of the state and you know I've had senators say because I voted against the budget that you know maybe we're not going to get our roads paved and ultimately you know that Georgia's not been courageous enough to take back the 35th parallel will they be courageous enough to come and get us. Senator you have one more question yes sir so I just want to make sure that the northwest may or may not be sovereign so this will this bill will apply to all Georgians. Senator we're paying our taxes and we're paying too much taxes so I hope we are a part of the group but but senator this will apply to all Georgians. That's correct. Senator we appreciate your vote for those southeast Georgians. All right senator thank you mr. President ask for your favorable consideration to Senate bill 163. All right all right all right good job senator. We do have an amendment here secretary read the amendment. mr. President senator apparent of the 44th and Jones and Attentive Offer the following amendment one to amend the Senate Committee substitute to Senate bill 163 by inserting at line 93. I accept we're possession of a firearm but child is lawful under code section 16-11-132 a person commits to the offense of making a firearm accessible to a child if such child gains access to a readily discharged will firearm and the person with criminal negligence one fails us to give the firearm or two let the firearm in a public space to which the person new or should have known the child could gain access. Jay a violation of subsection i shall be a misdemeanor mr. President that completes the order. Senator from the 44th would you like to speak to your amendment the floor is yours. Senator from 53 he won't leave didn't he? We'll let you close debate. Thank you mr. President colleagues I am pleased I'm very pleased to bring forward for your consideration and amendment on a topic that we really have talked about for a long time here under the gold dome and that is the safe storage of guns around children the well-being of our children here in our state of Georgia should be a top priority but right now unfortunately we are failing our kids the recent mass shooting at apple aptu high school that was six months ago two days ago highlighted a harsh truth minors here in Georgia kids have easy access to firearms because we lack laws requiring gun owners to secure their weapons around children which if one is a responsible gun owner shouldn't be too much of a stretch I would posit to you my distinguished colleagues right now in our in our coat there are no consequences for parents who or other adults who enable kids to obtain weapons and use them intentionally or not leaving kids many toddlers unprotected from this harm and it is a harm because as as you as we know as you've heard many of us say many times over the last few years firearms are the leading cause of death for children in Georgia and the United States and that's why we have groups led by pediatricians and emergency room physicians who have been taking on this cause not to be liberal activists but to say we are doctors and when something's the number one cause of death among kids in your society we ask we exhort we beg of you the legislative law making body in the state to take a look at what we could do shouldn't we do something to lessen the number one the deaths by the deaths by the number one cause of death among kids in our state one third of handguns are kept unlocked and loaded and states with safe storage laws see a huge drop about 68 percent fewer firearm suicides per capita than those without this amendment colleagues I know certainly won't solve or prevent every tragedy but if we can see to have guns and unlocked loaded guns be the number one cause of death among children I stand before you and say that would be worth it this amendment would ensure that gun owners are held accountable if a minor gains access to an unsecured firearm with somewhat harsher penalties if injury or death occurs from that child's access to the gun it is however just a misdemeanor I would note and I based this amendment on Texas law hardly known as a state that is not pro second amendment if every gun owner here in Georgia securely stored their weapons and by the way that can be done in a way that is still very very accessible there are biometric safes where just kind of just like with your your apple your iPhone boom you know you touch it and it opens up with so with instant access these gun related accidental deaths and suicides among children could drop by 30 40 percent and here's an issue a lot of parents believe that their gun that their kids don't know where their guns are stored but that is wrong they actually do know where the guns are stored and most kids report that they have even thought to handle them so what we what we need to do is we need to act now let's let's show Georgians that we got the message after apple acci after that horrible school shooting what our laws say I would I would posit to you distinguished senators what our laws say is a reflection of our values so in this way we acknowledge that firearm deaths should not be the number one cause of death of our kids and we take a step towards aligning our culture and our values with responsible gun ownership and that's what we're after aligning our values with responsible gun ownership which actually protects the second amendment because it it loses support when folks think that people aren't just so ideologically dug in that things that can and should be done by legislative bodies to just make all of us safer and to encourage responsible gun ownership are not getting done and that causes and it's happening it's happening all over our state it's happening all over the country causes a lot a lot of suburban moms for example to say yeah I am not for this this is crazy failing to hold adults accountable means that we are implicitly saying there is nothing wrong with leaving a loaded handgun in your car console and running into your house because you forgot something and when you got back your four-year-old has killed your two-year-old that happened just a couple years ago we're saying by the fact that there's no safe storage law our values are essentially saying through our law that's okay we got no problem with you leaving your loaded firearm your car console among your toddler it's just an accident that's the value that's the message saying oh nothing could have been done it's just an accident and I suggest to you that that's one of the problems we have and that's why we have so many accidents of this nature and tragedies of this nature because the message we're sending is don't look at yourself don't change your actions it's just an accident and if we said no it is unsafe to have these weapons around kids and we mean that and if you do it then there's a penalty not a lock not not be locked up for years and years but there's an actual penalty we've actually made it illegal and I would suggest that's what we need to do to have our citizens take that respond to the incentive set up in our law so that they behave in a manner that is safe and that we actually say we would expect them to but we got nothing to actually say they need to do it or enforce that we made a promise to act in the wake of the Appalachian tragedy here I suggest you we could keep that promise Georgians are widely in support of safe storage laws for guns around children so I ask for your support for amendment one and I'm happy to answer any questions or take my seat Mr. President you do have one question Senator senator senator from 37 I think Mr. President is a lady you of course first of all thank you for raising the concerns we have of the tragedy that's happened within our state of of lost lives I think that's something that every one of the 56 members of this body hearts go out to those families so I want to recognize that and there's full stop having said that in the context of your amendment does the lady know that the age at which young people are able to hunt on their own in Georgia any hunting setting so I actually can't think of it off the top of my head senator but so there are a number of exceptions lined out right here you'll see it online four and that's one of them antique firearms or another in within adult is another so so yes there are exceptions built into take account of scenarios like that senator correct and in in that context you know 60 to be to hunt is a 16 year old in Georgia isn't it true you have to have a license you have to have a hunting license you're not under the oversight of your parents you have your own hunting license eight 16 because when it contemplates is that 16 year olds and older have to be licensed because they're going to be operating on their own without being under the direct supervision of an adult discharging a firearm intentionally in accordance with our laws isn't that true senator knows of what he said I raised that question because in your bill as you have it drafted lines 10 through 11 of your bill says it's it's it's a it's a per se violation it's criminal negligence if you let a firearm in a place to which the person new or should have known a child could gain access you know gaining access to 16 and 17 year olds for 16 and 17 year olds gaining access to a firearm under your bill becomes a crime whereas in our framework today it is specifically allowed and it's it's it's within the framework of hunting so that if we've got young people who get hunting licenses and are operating firearms around our state in a hunting context why do we believe that 16 and 17 year olds can under no circumstances ever have access to a firearm says the parents commit a misdemeanor just by giving them access much less charging them to go use it how how can how's that possibly consistent so under the way I've got this drafted it it it only applies to folks 16 and younger so that's one thing and then the other is that hunting is as I mentioned already one of the exemptions again one for the question for a lady certainly I raised the question because we charge our 16 and 17 year olds not only to get a get a hunting license and operate and use discharge firearms safely the idea that outside of a hunting context they can't manage firearms safely I think it's just on its face nonsense center what I would actually do mind if I respond briefly please sure so I think you're you're actually hitting on a point that I am trying to make although I know I probably can't convince you of it right now essentially you mentioned getting a hunting license having requirements that go into that that's kind of what I'm talking about here in the law we have it where you do these things and then you get the license and we feel that you have sort of passed the test if you will right you you you you have an understanding of why through the licensing process and the other things that the senator just mentioned this is a what is a responsibility right and that's sort of what I'm saying with this bill that we do not have on parents with loaded handguns in particular around children so I would agree with the senator all I want is to sort of shift our expectation of citizens a little bit towards responsible gun ownership and safety and I posit to you that part of what we need to do to do that is to have our law reflect our values if indeed we do want them to be responsible but isn't it true this bill has a per se framework that says 16 year olds that are giving access to a firearm the parents commit a crime by giving them access no that again that's actually not how it is because of the exemptions yeah I don't know that the members understand that the way that maybe that maybe I may turn your question so yeah that's the concern certainly certainly I understand that yeah that's that's that's the point of line four thank you senator yeah no more questions thank you I ask for your favorable consideration of you know what's a really important topic and in amendment one and I yield the well senator from the secretary you doing the minority report okay senator from 31st night speak to the bill thank you thank you president I just want to say a couple things real quick is the the irony and the discussability that we keep invoking apple latchee especially after what we talked about earlier today it's just ridiculous if you talk to Mrs. Aspenwall I'm sure she she'll tell you a whole different story than the senator who just came up here to the well in terms of her feelings of what happened that day a box was not going to save her husband's life personal responsibility with the parent was doing and other aspects that was happened that day is the only thing that would have changed that circumstance riding another law telling parents or telling individuals to basically man how to manage their house ain't going to change anything because unless you're going to sit in that house and hold their hand and make sure they lock up that gun before they go to bed at night isn't going to bring them back to life so we can continue to take advantage of these tragic incidents in our own communities for this discussion but it is absolutely disgusting and if we're going to have a debate we already have many second amendment debates in this in this room which has to be mindful again that we have federal laws we have state laws already on the books that touch on all these things if the situation in Savannah if we're going to blame the gun owner for a criminal breaking into their car or taking it off their person or whatever then what kind of leadership is that that we're going to not sit on the citizen but we're going to sit on the criminal because that's what that's what y'all are saying so Mr. President I'm just going to finish by saying that you know I hope we can get back to a more respectable place if we're going to vote the tragedies that happen because it's getting old y'all Mr. President I'll yield if there's a question you have one question uh center from the 30th does my friend from the 31st yield yes sir just kind of won't clear up what I think was an unintended misinformation is it not true that the leading death the children under the age of 17 is unintentional injuries such as car accidents is that not true is it also not drowning in center of nose and knee speeds or we're not trying to outlaw cars and swimming pools at this time I haven't seen a bill and to go along that list you got follows and poisoning and sometimes they get to that gun bullets threshold you got to increase the age of a child to probably 19 so you can capture the gang of bullets that occurs throughout this country and that's where a lot of your deaths are because of gang of bullets in some of these cities that we see across this land that center knows that he speaks and it's also for a minor half possession of a weapons against the law Mr. President I yield the well thank you sir very nice center from the 50th yes call the question all right centers moved call the question I've called the center from the second to give the minority report and then let the senator from the 53rd close well thank you miss president colleagues I rise to deliver the minority report to senate bill 163 to

a good friend from the 53rd. I wanna echo the words of Dr. King in this chamber. Dr. King said you cannot legislate morality, you can only legislate behavior. And so what the City of Savannah did was to try to create some recourse to have folks just lock their vehicles if they wanna leave a loaded firearm in their vehicle. 266 guns were stolen in 2024 in the City of Savannah and 228 of those came from unlocked vehicles. And looking at how do you track those firearms that are stolen from vehicles? How do you protect the citizens? How do you protect tourists? And the City of Savannah came up with an ordinance to say we want to create a way for folks to think about where they leave their firearm. Not to be just careless because we understand that a firearm is a serious tool. And I spent a long time in the Boy Scouts and I remember my old range officer, Mr. Bob. And Mr. Bob would say you treat every gun as if it's loaded. You always keep it pointed down range and you keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. That was Mr. Bob. He said you treat every gun as if it's loaded. And so even at camp, summer camp many times, we never left a loaded, unloaded firearm on the range. Why? Because if somebody came to pick it up, it was the assumption that every firearm was loaded. And the first thing you do would be to clear the barrel and make the inspection, never look down the barrel, but look down range, clear the barrel, and do all of those things. What my City decided to do was say, look, in the State of Georgia, if you do take a firearm out of somebody's car, you don't get off scot free, you face one in 10 years in prison. It isn't fell in the state of Georgia. What my City decided to do was to try to curb the amount of people who were just knowingly leave their firearms in their vehicles, unlock, and unattended. That's it. Because if you buy a firearm, I don't know about you, I own plenty of guns, and they're not cheap. Now if some folks leave their guns unattended in their cars and somebody came and just pulled the door handle, kids are walking by, pulling door handles, doing it all day long. If you don't believe me, you can see it on TikTok Reels. That's what young folks are doing. They're just going to pull and door handles, finding guns, and guess what? There are some people in the community who say, well, look, I'll give you, you know, pair of Jordans, if you give me that gun, go do this, go do that. That's all this bill was designed to do in the City of Savannah by an ordinance, was just a creating opportunity to ask for people to be responsible in a way that we could have them not leave their firearms unattended in their car. That's it. That's all the city tried to do. And so because we do understand that we have a rise in the epidemic of gang violence and those who wish to do harm, you know, in this body we could talk about a lot of things, about what we could do to curb gun violence and what we could do. We hold everybody accountable. And to the Center from the Fifth and Third made a comment about the individuals that did the L.S. Square shooting being out on bond. Well, and I know the Center from the Fifth and Third supports the eighth amendment that prohibits excessive veil. And so based on the nature of their original charges, they were granted bail because the severity of those charges probably was not to the point of the L.S. Square shooting. But I can guarantee you this after the L.S. Square shooting, not one of those defendants was issued bond by the Superior Court Judges in Chatham County, not one. And so we're not a county where lawlessness is just happening, running rampant and crime is taking over our city. We're the number two state in the city for tourism. And we keep our tour is safe. We have robust law enforcement agencies and they said City Council help us to curb the amount of unlocked firearms that are being stolen out of vehicles. And it's hard for us to track them because when we asked the gun owner, what was the make model in the serial number? Many don't have it so we can't even determine if the firearm was stolen or not. That's just about personal responsibility, that's it. But if we wanted everybody to be responsible like an automobile, we talked about that. Look, you just require everybody to have insurance, right? And then I bet you we see how quick all the laws change, because insurance companies have come back up and tell us, man, we're going to have to do something about these firearms because y'all are running the premium sky high. In fact, we would need a tort reform bill for firearms if it was required for you to have insurance. And so colleagues, I'm excited to see that many of you, if you vote in favor of this bill today, would be supporting the ability to have a tort because just a couple of weeks ago, you were anti-tort and it was bankrupt and Georgia businesses and we're about to close. And so Mr. President, as I close, I'm just reminded of, boy, you can show, do one thing and say another. And so to my colleagues, I hope that you will vote no on the bill, vote yes on the amendment. If you vote yes on the amendment, I'll probably vote yes on the bill. Just to leave a little opportunity out here, Mr. President, because I always think that it's compromised an opportunity to make a deal. So maybe my colleagues will accept the amendment and I'll vote for the bill. And if not, if you don't accept the amendment, then of course, I'm clearly not going to vote for the bill. And I just want everybody to know that when St. Patrick's day comes, we'll have to say for city in the state, we'll welcome many tourists and visitors to come to our city. We're not the wild, wild west out there. So I would just encourage us to be modern and what we're talking about, my city only designed to create an ordinance to protect its citizens and its residents and to ensure that we had responsible gun ownership. That's it, Mr. President. You weren't going to jail. The fire was up to just only $1,000 and you can go to the recorders' court and they probably dismiss it for you as long as it wasn't a pattern of practice. But we don't know who's a habitual line stuff at Mr. President because guess what? If you had done this five times and you keep leaving the gun and you're caught for it to get stolen and you have fire on insurance, maybe you would actually commit an insurance fraud. But you know what? We don't track it so we don't know. So I'm just going to ask you to vote no on the bill. But I left the deal on the table, Mr. President, with that a year of the well. Did you say that in one breath? No. No. That was impressive. Really was. All right, we got one later on having a amendment. And we've already had a motion to close debate. So we're going to read the amendment, let the author close the bait, and then we're going to vote on this thing. So Secretary, read the amendment. Mr. President, Senator Albers of 56 and others off the following amendment, 1A to amend amendment 1 to the Senate Committee substitute, the Senate bill 163 by replacing lines 1 through 13 with the following by inserting between lines 7 and 8 the following. The General Assembly recognizes the importance of securing firearms for lawful purposes, section 2. Mr. President, that completes the order. So Senator, we've already closed the bait. So we're just going to call the Senator from the 53rd. But obviously your amendment is noted, and hopefully the Senator will speak to it, whether or not he's forward or he isn't. Senator from the 53rd, close the bait. All right, Mr. President. I know we've got a lot of other good bills to get to, so I'm going to be brief and short. You know, what the Senator from the second was referring to as Minority Report and what his mayor had done is illegal. All right, it's already against the law. And this, my piece of legislation 163, all it does is provide a means of enforcement of what is already illegal. And that is adopting ordinances that violate the supremacy of the Georgia General Assembly. And to the Senator from the 44th, as she articulated her opinion about safe storage, I would ask her and others to Google. The story of Merced, California, where a 16-year-old watched her family brutally murdered because she couldn't access a firearm in the safe as an intruder came in. Ultimately, a firearm and a safe is about as valuable as a hammer. You can't use it to protect your family or yourself. Senators, ask that you vote favorably to Senate Bill 163 and vote against the amendments. Thank you, Mr. President. Senators Yellen, and closed the bait. All right, now it's time for us to take up the two amendments. One authored by the Chair of Public Safety, Senator from the 56th, Amendment 1A. Question's only, Dr. Shem, Amendment 1A is their objection. There is objection. All those in favor of Amendment 1A will vote ye. Oh, I'm sorry. Senator from Tantut, for the purpose of your eyes. Mr. President, considering the fact that the bait had closed and you allowed this late arrive in the amendment, doesn't it defeat the purpose of this body where we can't even discuss this amendment 1A? Yeah, we've already closed the bait, Senator. We're in the posture right now. We're voting on it. So you see they're voted up or down at this point in time. Parliamentary requirements, Mr. President. State Department. Possibility of us having any kind of discussion whatsoever regarding this amendment. Not this point, Senator. Not this point, Senator. We've discussed this enough. Senator from the 37th. Parliamentary Commissioner President. The State's requiring. In the opinion of the Chair, what is the effect of Amendment 1A? Amendment 1A would basically gut Amendment 1. That answer your questions. Thank you, Mr. President. All those in favor of Amendment 1A will vote ye. All opposed nay, Secretary-in-Lawton machine. Senator from the 53rd vote, Prop. G. rise. Parliamentary requirement. State's requiring. Wouldn't be wise to vote green on Amendment 1A. Here's Senator from Tuesday. How they'd like to vote. Here's her vote. Senator from the 41st, what purpose you rise. Parliamentary inquiry. State's inquiry. Isn't it true that a red light will allow us to move forward and vote on safe storage? Isn't it true that red will help us vote on safe storage? Senator's passionate about what she speaks. All the adoption of Amendment 1A by the Senate from the 76th. The A's are 33 and the A's are 23 and Amendment 1A is adopted. All right. Now the question is on Amendment 1 as amended by the Senate from the 44th. Is there objection to this? Without objection, Amendment 1 as amended is adopted. Questions on the adoption of the Committee's substitute as amended. Is there objection to the adoption of the Committee's substitute as amended? Hearing none of the Committee's substitute as amended is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the Florida Committee, which is faithful to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The Florida Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of the bill will vote. Yay. Opposed nay. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. All in the passes of the bill. The A's are 33 and the A's are 23. This bill has received. The rest of the Constitution was already there for pass by substitute. Congratulations, Senator. All right. Moving on to Senate Bill 255. Secretary, read the caption. Senate Bill 255, Senator Couser, or the 46, the bill's been elected. Chapter 1 on the title 28 of the Fish and the Georgia Anitya, related to general provisions regarding the General Assembly.

So we're on bill number 15 right now, ladies and gentlemen. And I'll just remind you that the longer these things get debated, the quicker the day will be, and the fewer bills that will get out of here. So, recognize the Senator from the 46. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll heed your advice and keep this snappy. It won't take long at all. This bill does one thing. It just codifies our legislative authority to investigate issues, to receive sworn testimony, to compel testimony via subpoena and the subpoena documents, records, and papers to help us do our job, pass unanimously in the Judiciary Committee. All members present agreed with it, and I would appreciate your support. Glad to take questions if anybody has any. Yeah, no questions, Senator. Thank you. I yield the will.

Mr. President, Senate Committee and Health and Human Services are following substitute to Senate bill 233. Bill to be done elect to amend Article 6 of Chapter 1 of Title 37. I think it's going to George Inetated related to the Behavioral Health Reform and Innovation Commission.

Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to ask Senator from the six. Thank you, Mr. President. A colleague, this bill simply takes the Behavioral Health Reform and Innovation Commission at six spots. Two extra appointments for the governor, two extra for the lieutenant governor, and two extra for the speaker. I yield the well. Does any other Senator wish before against the measure?

Mr. President, that completes the order. We're going to have the senator from the 19th, speak to the bill. Mr. President, thank you, members of the Senate. Mr. President, the title calls it the Freedom of Speech and Belief Act. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right.

Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. Mr. President, I think you're right. times, but he was devanked from a community bank that he had used for decades, all because he expressed an opinion they didn't like. But we have other examples locally too. In the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from a Georgia business owner who owns a gun manufacturer, Marty Daniel, Daniel Defense. He said that here in Georgia, all he does is sells guns. He came up with a part one time that he made, started selling it, turned into a contract with others to sell guns and eventually ended up with a large manufacturer of weapons, of guns. That's protected under the Second Amendment. Yet Marty was devanked, not once in Georgia, but twice. For the crime that he had, he made firearms. All the examples I've given you, none of them are examples of terrorists, of drug dealers, or criminals. They're just regular citizens relying on the promises that were made to them under the Constitution of the United States.

hit the banking part hard and first because it's what we're hearing the most about. But this bill addresses a heck of a lot more than banking. Senate Bill 57 says in its meet on lines 46 and 40, sorry, on lines 98 through 103, that an essential services provider shall not discriminate in the provision of essential services against a person that has an established business relationship with such provider. Well, what does that mean? Let's break that down. An essential services provider. Who would those be? Well, this bill defines it. It defines it on line 44. 43 and 44, sorry. They're folks that are giving power, electricity. But folks who are giving water, sewer, your utilities. And we think it's also important to include banks because now in the current environment, if you don't have a banking relationship or a credit card or some type of cash out mobile app, you can't buy things at all. If your essential services provider under this bill, you can't discriminate in the provision of essential services against someone who has a business relationship with you. Well, what does it mean to discriminate in the provision of essential services? Well, we define that too. We don't want to leave it ambiguity. It's on line 38. Discriminating in the provision of essential services means directly or indirectly restricting or terminating the provision of essential services to a person based on their social credit score or based on such person's exercise of any constitutional right protected by the first 10 amendments for the United States Constitution. And we spell out, including and without limitation, such person's speech, their association, their religious exercise, and their ownership of firearms. You've heard a lot of talk today about banks. And it's about banks, but it's about essential services overall. And those essential services, as I've already told you, include more than banks. They include power, water, sewer. When we started talking about this bill, I talked to the banks. I talked to the power companies too. Carried them a copy of this bill as well. Ask them, hey, do you have any trouble at all with anything that's in this bill? And they said, no, man, we don't do this. There's a couple of power companies, right? You have Miaggs, you have EMCs, Georgia Power. Carried it to the other power companies. Said, hey, do you have a problem with anything I'm doing in this bill? No, Senator, we're don't do this. We don't de-utilitize people. I thought it's some of the private water companies. Hey, does this hurt you? No, Senator, you're a Senate bill 57 isn't even on our radar. The only group that has had an issue with this, as well as become, become called the debanking bill, have been the banks. And I present to you that the reason that they've had an issue with it is because of the examples that I just gave you. Turn to page 170. Read about it. Read about it for a lady. Read about it for her son. Read about it for other people that we've mentioned. But maybe you don't like reading. Then all you had to do is go to our Senate Judiciary hearing and hear it from a Georgian themselves. It happened to him. It happened twice. And both times it happened, it cost him over a million dollars. Senators, I present to you that you're not getting text from other entities that are covered by this bill. They don't do it. They don't debank their electricity customers. They don't debank their water customers. We have tangible examples here in our country and here in our state where we know it happens here. Some of the questions that have come up have been about enforcement of this bill. You see, we can stand up here and pass a bill through the House, through the Senate. Get it signed by the governor and give citizens no remedy to enforce that right. And at those times we've given them nothing. We've given them paper they can hang on their wall to say, yeah, you got shafted. That's not what this bill does. This bill says, if an essential services provider doesn't provide you the service discriminates against you, then you have the ability to bring a case under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act. And that act I believe allows you to recover like $150,000 per instance and some other things. That's, we tried to go below that here. You see online 112, if someone was debanked or deutilitized, they could bring an action to recover. They have to prove that it happened to them. They have to prove that it happened for a reason that was protected by the first 10 amendments to the US Constitution. And if they're able to prove that, they can recover their actual damages. In other words, in Mr. Daniel's case, the million dollars it took him to move accounts in higher attorneys to make that move happen. They also can recover $50,000. That's the penalty. In this case, some folks have said that these things can stack up on each other. That could be more than $50,000. That's right. If you cancel more than one person, you could end up paying more than $50,000. My hope is though, that a penalty such as this gets someone's attention to actually pay attention to realize that association speech, selling something that's otherwise legal. Well, that's not a reason to cancel somebody. At least not a reason to cancel somebody on something as significant as the utilities they need to operate in everyday life and run a business. There are a lot of amendments that have been proposed. Well, before I get to the amendments, I do want to talk about the other steps of the bill. It's a Senate committee sub. And those of you who've been in the Senate for more than four hours know that a Senate committee sub means somebody took changes, right? I didn't walk in here with my bill and try to shove it down everybody's throat and say, this is what it's going to be. I shared it with folks. Again, I told you the power companies, the water companies, those folks, you sewer companies, they didn't have any issue. The banks did have an issue. And their concern was if you have someone who's applying to me for a loan for the first time and they're simply not credit worthy. And I turned them down. Senator, can they now sue me using your bill as protection? And therefore, force me to offer them a loan. I should not offer them otherwise. Well, a couple of things there. The bill clearly says, clearly says that you can continue to do the things you need to do to evaluate whether an account is you should be having an account or a loan to begin with. But further, I went further. I said, hey, listen, I'm not trying to go after the people coming to your bank for the first time. I'm trying to go after the people who are already your customers, who you already have an established business relationship with, who because of a change in sides based on culture, you've decided that they should be tossed to the side. Those are the folks I think we should protect. Not trying to make you make any association to begin with. But once you choose to make that association, then you can't cancel them because they're exercising their constitutional rights as well. And that's where the Senate Committee sub comes in. If you look at lines 46 and 47, we had to add a definition. And that definition is the established business relationship definition. It's done for utilities and for banks. We don't want a power company, somebody saying, hey, the reason that I can't provide you power and the reason that, you know, Georgia power is not providing power to the Senator from the fifth is because, you know, X, Y, or Z, and that's Senator X, Y, or Z, or Senator from the fifth says, well, X, Y, or Z is a protected reason. We didn't want that to come up. But we did say if the Senator from the fifth is already getting power from Georgia power, it's already getting his bank, banking from truest bank. Well, the Senator from the fifth accounts can't be closed simply because of his speech, his association, his religious exercise, him on in a firearm. The Senate Committee sub took in the thoughts of others and tried to incorporate them. There are a lot of other amendments now. And there are a lot of folks who are for and or against this. I know the, you're getting the text, I'm getting the tweets too. I present to you that the folks in the hall who are against the bill are against the bill because of its protections, I believe, for the second amendment. You have to make hard decisions in this building every day. And I know this one will be a hard one for some. But it's not going to be a hard one for me. If someone has an established business relationship, they shouldn't be canceled because of their, them exercising a right that's protected otherwise in the Constitution of the United States. I ask your favorable consideration senators of Senate Bill 57 as it came out of the Judiciary Committee with the amendment that we took from the banking community on essential services. There was also another tweak in there that I didn't point out to you as a tweak on the definition of broadband, the folks who do broadband ask for that. And then otherwise we're okay with our amendment or with our bill. The amendments that have come out, I'm going to go ahead and speak to now if I think that saves time later on. Amendment number one, purports to take the threshold amount of a bank that would be covered by this bill from 1 billion to 100 billion. Let's talk about why that matters. In Georgia, I think there are more than 250 banks. That's just a Google search. I'm dealing with these amendments as they come across the desk too. The move to set the threshold at $1 billion according to the testimony in the Senate committee covers 61 banks. That's it. That's it. Roughly 25%. If we take it to 100 billion, quick Google search will show you, it covers one. My suggestion would be if we want to pass amendment one, we should just pull out the dollar amount altogether and name the one bank that we think ought not do this. I would ask you to oppose amendment one. Amendment number two, it takes the one billion out and replaces it with 25 billion. I do not know how many banks will be covered at 25 billion. I know that again 61 banks are larger than one billion. I believe the testimony was that four banks are larger than 10 billion. At 25 billion, you're going to be somewhere between one and four. I would ask you to oppose amendment number two. Amendment number three does substantially more. Amendment number three takes the private ride of action and strips it out. In the testimony in the Senate committee, Mr. Daniel Satin said when he was debanked not once but twice, he carried the matter to the Attorney General's office and he was told those times they could not proceed with a case on his behalf. I've been asked subsequently did they present it to him in the Attorney General in writing? Did they send him an email? Send him a text message or a smoke signal? I do not know. I can tell you that the testimony in the Senate committee from a guy that I believe was telling the truth was that he presented this his debanked issues to the office of the Attorney General and they were not able to help him with those. That's why we crafted Senate Bill 57 to allow a private ride of action in that case. So amendment three takes out that private ride of action and says instead you have to go back to the Attorney General and the Attorney General can bring this claim if you think you've been denied essential services based on the reasons we discussed before. It also raises the civil penalties considerably. I'm not going to get into the debating of that but I'm going to offer you a proposal. You see you'll see a amendment three A and three B. Three A is my handwriting. Three B is the exact same thing cleaned up by legislative counsel. So three A will probably fall off and you'll deal with three B but three A and three B say the same thing. It amends amendment three. The proposal from the senators in amendment three to allow the Attorney General to be the sole and exclusive remedy to enforcing this action. Amendment three A comes in that and says maybe we can work a middle ground here. So we're willing to let the Attorney General bring the action first. Amendment three also says that if the Attorney General doesn't bring the action he has to give some type of a written report. Until why? Amendment three A says hey if the Attorney General doesn't bring that action or doesn't file that report within 90 days then the private calls of action the right for that individual to go higher his or her own attorney and bring the action themselves well that comes back into play. If amendment three A passes I will support amendment three. Amendment four goes back to the issue we talked about earlier about moving dollars and threshold amounts for banks that are covered. I know many of you may have got calls from your home community banks. The $1 billion threshold again is set to only affect 61 banks. Why 61? Why would you not cover them all? The majority leader the senator from the 51st in committee actually asked that question why would we not just take that threshold out completely. And that's fair if someone wants to offer that amendment I will accept it as friendly. But the bill I drafted the deal I thought that I made with the Senate Judiciary Committee was at one billion. The cover 61 if you go and accept the amendment number four at 10 billion you're now only going to cover four banks. I ask you not to accept amendments one two are four because if we stick at least at the one billion level we know that's roughly one per every three counties banks are centralized it's not going to cover it's not going to really be one per every three counties of Georgia but if we take some more to talk about if the senator from the eight doesn't mind we're just going to rename this the trees act. The $10 billion threshold again would only cover four banks if we stick at the one billion dollar threshold we cover 61 banks it allows for a geographic spread that I think is a little bit better than going to these much higher numbers. Amendment number one a takes the 100 billion on amendment one and changes it to two billion I could accept two billion I want somebody while the rest of you are speaking to help me search and see how many that would cover that may be accepted as friendly. And then amendment five also takes and replaces the one billion with two billion so they essentially do the exact same thing. With the amendments flying around I know this is going to get confusing. My request of you would be this don't defame the bill if we're going to pass a bill let's let it have substance let's not put the threshold at so high of an amount that no one really can get coverage. Let's not take out the rights of action that allow folks to proceed should the attorney general's office not proceed on a case. And lastly let's not table this bill. I know when things get confusing that's a move that some people in this building want to take. I hope I've earned from you the right for just an up or down vote. If you need to oppose it I understand you have different reasons and different constituencies back home that may require that. What I'm asking for at the end is an up or down vote on a bill that at the most has a two billion dollar threshold that has a way that if the government doesn't take its actions and proceed against folks that are violating other folks constitutional rights that you can seek out your own attorney with your own money and seek that remedy yourself. And it gives us an opportunity to vote yes or no on whether we think that policy should be supported in this state. Mr. President thank you for the time members thank you for allowing me to go ahead and address the amendments and if there are no questions I'll yield the well. You do have a few questions center from 10th. Thank you Mr. President. Would you send it a yield? Yes sir. To our appropriations chair chairman I am really trying to understand this bill but I'm having a problem with some of the definitions in it. On the line 38 you mentioned financial services. What institutions is it limited only to banks or is it credit unions or other type of lenders to include finance departments financial institutions that just loan direct to customers I'm trying to understand what's included in those certain financial services. It's on 48 you may own the Senate committee substitute. Financial institution means a bank or credit union that has more than one billion in assets in any affiliate or subsidiary of such bank or credit union or the payment process process or credit card company etc. Yeah those are the reasons we had that happen when there was a protest in Canada about places not the United States and what we saw is that a lot of folks from the United States thought that that protest was worth going to. When they went up there they found out that their debit cards were cancelled. We found out also that they started looking out to see where the donations to support those groups who were going to have that what again otherwise was a legal peaceful assembly even in Canada and those donations that come from California they come from New York they come from state of Washington and we then started going after those people that's not right just because folks were exercising a right they had under the Constitution you should be worried about their debit card getting cancelled. Senator further you? Yes sir. Senator how do you define social credit score? I couldn't hear your... How do you define social credit score? Yes sir it's actually defined in this bill as well. Did you do? Yeah I saw the definition of it but I'm not sure I understand the definition that's listed in here. Remember at a period of time it was invoked in this country to develop ratings based on folks about exercise of their constitutional rights of their inclusion and other programs that may exist. Also at one point in time it went heavy after the ag industry it said hey listen the methane that comes from cows, flatulence is contributing to CEO, the CO2 and that is further dropping someone's social credit score. I don't think that that's things we should look at when we're deciding whether or not we should be giving out an ag loan. Senator further you? I said understand what could potentially impact the social credit score. I'm just trying to understand what is and how do I determine what my as an example of social credit score would be. Yes sir if a company is developing a rating that's based on the things that appear in line 61 through 69, Siri, don't a little bit further. Through 71, sorry 75 then that would be the definition of social credit. Senator further you? Yes sir. Is there a range of social credit scores that a numerical value or is it something that's just qualitative? I think it's something that you'd have to ask the companies that were employing it but if they were employing that you know saying hey you're using we want you to use electric leaf blowers not gas leaf blowers they were using that to say whether or not the long care companies social credit score was high enough to be chosen for that contract. I guess they can do it for the contract but we don't think they should be able to do it for utility services. As Senator you have one final question. I'm still confused about how do you calculate a social credit score and how does it be in use in this particular legislation? I don't know if it's quantitative, I don't know if it's qualitative. I mean I understand a regular person and I'm not hurt to turn social credit score before so I'm trying to understand it. I think different companies were doing it different ways. Again the state of Georgia does not have a social credit score and I think that's a good thing. I think that's something that the emergency spotty would support but I think we had companies that were employing a social credit score for determining whether or not they were going to offer services. Thank you, Senator. Thank you. Senator, I got a red light. You want me to leave or stay? No, you got one more question. You can take. Recognize the pro-tam. Thank you, Mr. President. Is the Senator yield? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thanks. I want to follow up. I had two like the Senator from the tent have some questions. So first of all the social credit score, that phraseology, where did you come up with that? Yeah, it came up originally with a Senator Todd Jones bill that passed last year that came over this chamber. Didn't have enough time to get through. So that language originally came from that draft of that bill is where it originally came. We adopted it in this bill for the reasons that you may ask me. Go ahead. And do I understand that bill did not pass? Is that what you said? It passed the House. It did not come over before. I don't think it came over before crossover. Okay. Senator, further yield? Yes, sir. Do you know where that House member got social credit score? I think that he got it and the discusses with him about things relating to farming, ag, and the attacks on using combustion engines. We had at the time, may or may not remember there were some companies who said, hey, we want you to only use electric stoves, not natural gas stoves. We had a bill in this chamber about only using electric not being forced to only use electric leaf blowers. I think it was carried by the Senator from the 48. That's where the social credit score number came in. And so, sort of to the questions that Senator from the 10th was asking. So it sounds like if the source of social credit score was a bill that came from the House, that we didn't pass, then without specific reference to the source of how this phraseology even came from, the definition of social credit score has to be only what you've got in this bill. Agreed? It is what's defined in this bill, yes? Right. But there's not some other source that we can look to that's generally accepted as social credit score is define this way or means X. You've defined it in here. Yes, sir, we did define it in here. Okay. I don't think that's the meat of the bill. No, I understand that, but it's important because of this. So, as I read line 59, social credit score means a score or rating determined by an analysis or evaluation of one or more of the following. And it talks about the exercise of constitutional rights, a person's failure or refusal to do certain things, a person's failure or refusal to facilitate and assist employees. My question is, who makes that analysis? The analysis is made by the company. So, the company that's deciding they do not want to offer the service. If they're saying we don't want to offer the service to you, based upon your exercise of your constitutional rights, that would go into a social credit score. You're not willing to discuss or limit your emissions of greenhouse gases, that would go to your social credit score. Your failure or refusal to engage in any racial diversity or gender audit that would go to your social credit score. Your failure to facilitate or assist employees in obtaining abortions, that would go to the social credit score. So, are you assuming that the company that was engaged in this conduct is going to write all this down and document it so that it can later be determined or that they are maintaining somebody's social credit score internally? Is that the assumption that you baked into this? Senator, that would be the assumption based into this, but it's not just assumption, it's actually known. You can see without a quick Google search that companies were deciding that they did not want to associate with other companies simply because those companies said, hey, we don't think abortions should be considered illegal in our business. I appreciate that. That's not my question. My question is not whether or not it happens. My question is how does someone later on determine the analysis and evaluation that the company did or did not engage in to produce a social credit score because it strikes me that no company is going to say, hey, let's have a social credit score file on customer X, especially under the light of the way you say this has come to light. That's one of the concerns I have bootstrapping off the center from the 10th of who's going to make that determination and analysis or evaluation? Well, Senator, I'll tell you that we did have companies that were saying, here's your social credit score, but the cool thing about it, which should possibly put your mind at ease, is that if a company is not that deliberate in the new environment that I think we've faced since the election in 2024, then they have no reason to potentially or no ability to run a file of that one's legislation or that language. That assumes that someone would look at it in retrospect and they would be no such determination or evaluation, right? Which gets me back to my question, who's making the determination and evaluation in retrospect of how the company behaved? The company's making that decision at the front end. We had companies at the front end who were saying

your social credit score, your failure and refusal to engage in DEI practices, your failure or refusal to otherwise curb your greenhouse gases. We are no longer going to thank you. We are no longer going to provide essential services to you. Okay, thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you, my time has inspired members of the Senate. Thank you so much for here today and appreciate you indulging me and letting me go ahead and talk about the amendments. You'll be up. All right, we have a number of amendments. But before I go through the amendments, I see our former leader, this is a glory butler here today. Now everybody, give them a round of applause. Send the butler there. It is good to see you, Senator. Good to see you looking well in retirement. Looking well in retirement. Great to have you here today. All right, we have several amendments here. The Secretary needs to read a few lateriving amendments. Secretary, read the amendments that we have not read already. Mr. President, Senator Hatchett, the 50th and Shrek, and the 42nd, offer the following amendment. And win the Senate. First, please elect the Secretary read the amendments, so we have not read already. Mr. President, Senator Hatchett, the 50th and Shrek, and the 42nd, offer the following amendment. Number 5 to amend the Senate Committee Subtuat of Senate Bill 57 by replacing 1 billion on lines 49 and 52 with 2 billion. Mr. President, Senator Hatchett, the 50th and Shrek, and the 42nd offering the following amendment 1A to amend amendment 1 to the Senate Committee Subtuat of Senate, billion on line two with two billion. Mr. President, I complete the order. Senator from 13 to would you like to speak to your amendment? Thank you, Mr. President. Well, once again, I come to here and ask you. Is anybody here confused? I am. And I'm really confused about one thing. And one thing really bothers me. How many times do we hear the word banking used in this bill? How many times do you hear the word bank? Bank, banking, banking, banking, banking, banking. How many times? Almost every two or three words. This bill did not come to my committee. And I'm chairman of the banks and banking the financial institutions. This bill would certainly have had a committee sub had it come to my committee. Now, I wonder why I didn't come to my committee? It's about banking. I'm just concerned about that. However, let me explain to you what I've done. Since it didn't come to my committee, I thought, well, I'm going to find out what's going on in this bill a little bit. And I cannot tell you the things that Senator McKnighton said one way or the other. I know he's very prepared. Does a great job. I understand he has motivation for making sure things are done correctly. But I want to make sure they're done correctly too. I want to tell you something about why these bills. When you get more amendments than pages on the bill, something's wrong. Can I get any of them in? More amendments than the other bill. Something's wrong. Okay. Now, having said that, let's talk about that for just a minute. Now, I put in the memo now. My amendment is very, very, very simple. And it uses a big, big, big number called a hundred billion. No, I'm not Warren Buffett and I'm not Elon Musk. We're talking a hundred billion dollars. Why did I put a hundred billion on that on that? I'll tell you why. First up, I want you to understand this. There's several amendments here. One for two billion, one for ten billion, one for twenty five billion. And of course, my bill for a hundred, my amendment for a hundred billion. Now, why did I put a hundred billion out there? Because Florida and Tennessee who are our neighboring states and contiguous to us all have a hundred million dollars on their on their bill, on their thing, a hundred million dollars. Now, if you say it real fast, a hundred billion, they know money. But let me tell you what happens. If you pass this bill, the way it is written without these amendments, without making a hundred billion dollars, your local banks are not going to make your loans, in my opinion. They're going to drop on the loans. They're going to be scared to have to make a loan because they're going to get sued if they turn somebody down. Now, I want to make something else clear. I check with banks. I want to make sure I make sure I tell things right, because I like to try to be as accurate as humanly possible. And I'll check that it says if a if a account is closed for a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, a bank is prohibited from telling the customer why. And that would be considered an illegal or illicit activity. So the bank doesn't have a lot of choice in this. But I'm going to give you the numbers here to make sure we are on the same shitty music that I have gotten exactly from the banks of how this bill would affect. 61 banks, as the Senate from the 19th says, 61 banks are currently in Georgia covered by the 1 billion asset. Well, here's the way it breaks down. 46 of those banks are state chartered banks, our banks, Georgia banks. 15 of them are federally chartered banks. 9 of those 61 banks have 100 billion of assets or more. 9 have 100 billion of assets or more. 5 banks have 50 billion to 100 billion of assets or more. 7 banks have 25 billion to 50 billion of assets or more. 5 banks have a 10 billion to a 25 billion total assets or more. And 35 banks have an asset between 1 billion and 10 billion dollars. Now I called my local banker whom I'm proud to say I don't know any money. So it is a very, very, you know, when I solicit his information, I used to pay money. I don't own any money anymore. But I asked you point blank about this bill. He said, I would be afraid to loan people money because if I turn them down or if they walked in my office for any reason for some wild scheme or some kind of deal and I didn't bank them, I didn't bank them, they would immediately be able to sue me. And I said, I don't know if I understand that, but I believe you understand it. And so the reality here is folks is we've got a lot of amendments on the table. You want to pass this thing? You put 100 billion dollars out there like Florida and Tennessee has and you secure our banks and we do not throw our banks under the bus and we dang sure don't back the bus over them when we throw them under the bus. Once again, had this bill come through banks and banking would it have a different bill? I'll assure you. Mr. President, I want to talk about the rest of the amendments and I want him go into the bill. I want people to know where we at on exactly our banks and how much our banks are charged and how much our 46 state charter banks mean to Georgia. Thank you, Mr. President. I get a will. All right, Senator. Senator Yeilded. So what we're going to do right now, I know there's people signed up to talk, but we're going to go with the folks who have offered amendments and let them speak for their amendments. Senator from the 50 year up, but you say you you pass your wave. Okay. Senator from the 46, we'd like to speak to your amendment. Senator from the 46 is Arthur amendment 2. Thank you, Mr. President of ladies and gentlemen. Senator, I support amendment 1 that limits it to institutions over 100 billion. That is the nine major national banks that are all doing business in Georgia. They have the economic power to fund these large businesses to shut them down to give them loans to open or close their checking accounts. When I look at the other banks though, you are attacking your own community banks here. If you go with 1A and you apply this to 1 or 2 billion dollar banks, you're knocking out our lifeblood of our local community that fears so badly all these lawsuits. They're already under enormous rules and regulations, federal rules and regulations as to privacy, et cetera. They're going to be put in between violating those or violating our law. I offered amendment 2 as an alternative because we don't know yet where about to make this policy decision what amount of money does the financial institution have to qualify to be sued basically. Is it 1 billion? Is it 2 billion? Is it 100 billion? I support 1 at 100 billion, but I've offered an alternative. Amendment 2 puts that level at 25 billion. That would exempt 40 of our 61 banks and still leave 21 banks subject to this law. The 21 largest that have over 25 billion in assets. But I wanted to point one other thing out while I had an opportunity. Sometimes when you've been here a while, you have a little historical recollection or historical knowledge and we have been through gun bills on and off over the years and made some very tough votes, some very strong votes to support the second amendment. We agreed to allow guns to be carried on campus. We did away essentially with the requirement to have a carry permit and allow anybody constitutional carry just last year. Back in 2017 as this was evolving, we fought this same battle here in the legislature. There was a house bill, I actually pulled up a copy of it, House Bill 292, which dealt with where you could carry firearms. In this case, it was if you had a carry permit. There were other provisions in the bill. It was pretty comprehensive. It was an 11 page bill went through a lot. But on the second page of the bill, we passed. This is in the law today, the Georgia Firearms Industry Non-Discrimination Act. It is in our code. Banks are prohibited from doing what this bill attempts to attack. All this bill does is it gives new remedies that subject banks to much harsher financial penalties, civil lawsuits, attorneys-fays-definitum, and minimum penalties of $50,000 per violation. Back in 2017, the current law that is in place that passed directly applied to financial services, including any service or product offered to the consumers or business market by a bank, any loan, any checking accounts, any of these services. It made it an unlawful discrimination to discriminate based on whether somebody produced firearms or ammunition products. It gave the enforcement remedy to the attorney general of the state of Georgia and gave him the power if anybody made a written request to him or own his own initiative to investigate this type of discrimination. He could obtain a declaratory judgment. He could enjoy any act or practice that violated this and he can recover civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation. I think that's inadequate remedy. It's in the law today. We have protected gun manufacturers and ammunition manufacturers through this bill. I don't think we have to go farther. If we do, please consider a amendment too so that you can protect your community banks and only attack the large financial institutions doing business here. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the bill well. Thank you, Senator.
