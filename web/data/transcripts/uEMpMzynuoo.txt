----------
Good morning, all members will please come to the floor. All members, please come to the floor. And having arrived, all members, all members, please take your seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? Well, good morning. We're going to have the morning row call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted? All members voted. All members voted. All members voted this, so Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? No more keepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain today will be introduced by the gentleman from the 15th House District, Representative Matthew Gamble. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, it's good to be with you this morning and be able to introduce my pastor, Dr. Patrick Latham, from Tabernacle Baptist Church in Carter'sville. He's the husband of Laura and he has three children, Julienne Will and Levi. And he came to us in January of 2020. So I want you to stop and think about any pastor that takes the church in January of 2020. And then the world changed in March. And we had to go through everything that Y'all know, we went through with COVID. But he has managed that so well for us in position, our church there in Carter'sville. And so I'm proud to have him today. I also want y'all to be mindful of us. We both have teenagers in our house. And our teenagers like to talk back a lot to us and we have to have great patience. But they're a little mad at us right now because we have a bill that's going to ban cell phones and schools. And I've told them we're going to vote for it. So anyway, y'all say a prayer for us and would you please welcome Dr. Patrick Latham. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Gamble. Thank you, Speaker. It's an honor and a privilege to be with you this morning. I want to speak to you on the subject of wisdom. Out of all of the abilities and commodities that a leader or a representative would need, wisdom is perhaps chief of all. It's like a bedrock upon which strong decisions, relevant initiatives, and transformational work and communities are built. And the Solomon of Israel has often been dubbed the wisest man who ever lived. Before his death, he created a codex of wise sayings to leave behind for his royal heirs who would follow in his footsteps. Those wise sayings are contained in a book found in the Hebrew scriptures and in the Christian Bible known as the Proverbs. And now, if you're using his sons who would follow in his stead, Solomon gave these words and Proverbs 4, 7, and 8. The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom and whatever you get, get insight. Prize her highly and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. So out of all of the things that Solomon knew his sons needed, he knew they needed wisdom most of all. Leaders and decision makers need wisdom even more than they need talents, resources, and workers. The problem is, is that possessing wisdom can be difficult. This is true, first of all, because many don't know the true nature of wisdom. They confuse wisdom with just mere knowledge. But wisdom is more than knowledge. It's often been said that wisdom is knowledge in action. Wisdom isn't just information. You can think of wisdom as involving information, but as being more than information. Wisdom is the ability to take information and to apply it rightly to a situation. Wisdom is the application of information to a situation. Now, we greatly need wisdom in life. And wisdom is more than information. Wisdom is knowing the right thing to do in the right way at the right time. Now the question is, how can we gain wisdom? After we know what wisdom is, how do we gain it? Solomon recommended things like education, Proverbs 1-8, listen to wisdom. He also recommended life experience. The more you go through in life, you hopefully gain wisdom, Proverbs 14-15. Solomon also recommended consulting experts. In the multitude of counselors there is safety, he would say, in Proverbs 11-14. So education, experience, and experts can help. But the Bible gives us a special promise in regard to wisdom. In James 1-5, often called the Proverbs of the New Testament, we read this great promise. If any of you likes wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. So prayer is a pathway to wisdom. In ways unbeknownst and unseen to us when we humble ourselves and ask the all wise creator for wisdom, he gives it liberally and generously. In 1 Kings 3, 7-8, tells of how Solomon himself, though a wise man, though a powerful man, though a rich man and a esteem man, he humbled himself and prayed, oh Lord, I feel like a little child and I'm unable to lead this great people, would you grant me wisdom? And the Lord graciously answered that prayer. So though there are practical measures we can take to gain wisdom, prayer is often the best means and method for availing ourselves of the wisdom we need. Do you ever feel at a loss as to what to do when it comes to a path forward in life or a decision? Does the path forward sometimes seem unclear? Pray and ask God to guide you. The Bible promises he will hear and answer. And the unseen place of your mind and soul, he will enlighten you with his wisdom. What a great promise. Let's stand for prayer. Dear God in heaven, we recognize you, the creator, possess all wisdom. Your wisdom is on display in nature all around us. And we recognize that we are often insufficient for the task and responsibilities before us. We pray with Solomon, please give us wisdom so that we might...

Manage the affairs of our lives, our families, our communities, and our state in a way that pleases you and blesses and benefits others. And we pray today for Mr. Terry England, we ask for great healing, help, and strength. And I pray all these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. And now for the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands my nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, I appreciate it. We'll go to stand right there a minute. And we'll go to follow those just a little minute. Dr. Latham, thank you for that message. We appreciate you being here. Doorkeepers, you can unlock the doors. You may join Dr. Latham, that South Andy Room, and express your thanks for him being here today. And get a photo if you so like. Members, our doctor of the day comes to us by the invitation of Representative Stacy Evans of the 57th thought of Florence LaCraw, LaCraw MD. She is downstairs in the eight station. If you need her, call on her. Go down and say hello and thank her for serving us today. Thank you for being here. Chair recognizes Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and Artists, Chairman Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your Committee on Information and Honours. Despite all the distractions from our cell phone, we read the journal of the previous legislative day and we found it to be correct. You need to put that cell phone up and put it on the table. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to say about that. Chairman Hilton, the chair of the Committee on Information and Artists, reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct. Is there any objection to spends with the reading of the journal? Here in none, the reading of the journal is dispensed with. Is there any objection to confirmation of the journal?

But a couple of weeks ago I had the great opportunity to go to Washington to the White House and join President Trump and Congressman Collins, who was sponsor of the Lake and Raleigh Bill, the Lake and Raleigh Act, who is already having great impact on protecting the citizens of this state and this country from criminal illegal aliens that are here amongst us. We know that the impact is being felt already. Your work there does not go unnoticed. I know you started on it last year and you completed it this year. We want to thank you for your service.

You know where it is. Thank you. Thank you. Representative Kennesaw. I'll tell you even more about that. I've received my masters in business from Kennesaw State a few years ago. It's just a fantastic organization. By the way, it is just about I think it's pretty close to being the second largest university in our state right behind Georgia. It's a larger than the University of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this fall KSU welcomed the largest freshman class in the state with a rollment of 48,000 total students. So as part of Kennesaw State Day of the Capitol, we're also focusing on Kennesaw having 150,000 alumni worldwide with 89%. And that, get that 89% of our graduates choosing to stay in Georgia to build their lives and their careers right here in our great state.

Who do you have, Mr. Speaker? Good to have y'all. One of our great institutions of higher learning Kennesaw State. Congratulations on the great success that y'all are having there. Cheerlead Cooper, you're recognized for a morning order. Let's get a little bit of a lady will just hold up just for a minute. I bet all of y'all would like to have folks pay attention to your morning orders. I invite you to extend that same courtesy to the member in the well. Cheerlead Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning everybody. Today is co-responder day at the Capitol. And you may be asking yourself what is a co-responder and what kind of program do they have? You may have forgotten that as we work to improve care of our mentally ill across our state, we came up with a program that puts co-responders, it puts mental health professionals with our law enforcement. And when a 911 call goes out and comes in and it's a mental health or somebody's acting iratically and or setting suicide, with the police, a mental health professional will go out with a responding officer. This has been transformative in how we do our mental health when it comes to public safety. And they have made great strides. They have saved lives with people that were threatening to suicide and right at the moment of fixing to complete the act. And so they have really been a great help to our state. And I would like to thank them for going out in very difficult situations, very emotional, very toxic situations, and coming them down and saving unnecessary trips to the hospital, getting more appropriate care for people in crisis, and making sure that we're not arresting people that have mental health problems. So thank you to any co-responders if you're there, stand up. Stand thank you for all that you do for us. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield well. Thank you Chairman Jones as well. Welcome to the People's House. Thank you for what you guys are doing for so many Georgians. I appreciate it. Representative Herring and other friends from Macon.

Today I rise with great pride to introduce House Resolution 183, honoring the Macon Violence Prevention MVP program, a groundbreaking initiative that is changing lives and making our community safer. Macon Bibb County, like many areas across our state, has faced heartbreaking realities of violent crimes. But rather than accept the status quo, our community took action. Through a series of neighborhood meetings and extensive community input, residents voice their concerns, share their lived experiences, and help shape the solution that truly reflects the needs of most affected. MVP was born under the leadership of our mayor, Lester Miller, Sheriff David Davis, District Attorney Anita Howard, and a collision coalition of law enforcement, public health experts, nonprofits, and community advocates, a bold comprehensive approach to preventing violent crimes in Macon, Georgia. Today we have our MVP recipients in our galley here and we also have our mayor, Lester Miller. Please welcome them to the Capitol today. If you would please stand. Thank you for all your work to making sure our communities are safe and make it Bibb County. We appreciate you. Thank you Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you for your work.

The gentleman is yielded the will because he has no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered.

So, it was required notification of the country of origin of seafood items. This bill then referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends the Dispill Dupasse by Committee substitute. The gentleman from the coast is recognized to present the bill, representative p-tree. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you House Bill 117. This bill very simply. It's a spend just for me. This is a Florida bill. This bill means a lot to coastal Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a consumer transparency bill. My friends and what it does very simply, and I will tell you why at a moment, what it does very simply is required that food service restaurants, food service establishments that are commercial on their menu or in a conspicuous location in that restaurant identify if the shrimp they're serving are imported. So, let me tell you why this is necessary. Folks, the number one most consumed seafood in our country are shrimp. We consume over 1.3 billion pounds of shrimp a year. That's over six pounds per person. 94% of the shrimp consumed in this country are imported. Sadly, when we have the safest cleanest fishery in the world, where are they coming from? Primarily India, China, Ecuador, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. And those countries simply do not adhere to our health standards. There's no way around that. I can't get into the detail, but I will tell you this, the FDA.

Inspecs 0.7% of foreign imported shrimp, 0.7% and that which they do inspect has dramatically higher failure rates. Last year alone, 81 lines shipments of imported shrimp were returned because they had antibiotics in them. A simple Google search will find you that particularly in the Indian Vietnam two of our leading importers are notorious for having antibiotics in their shrimp. Now you might ask why antibiotics? Well, I'm glad you asked because here's what we do in those countries importing shrimp. These shrimp never see an ocean, folks. We call them seafood. They live in man-made ponds. They swim in shallow ponds in their own feces. They get diseases and so what do we do? We feed them antibiotics. There is no comparison to domestic shrimp to imported shrimp and I'm going to give you a quote here and I'm going to move on. The FDA achieves less than 5% of congressionally mandated inspections on foreign food facilities. China doesn't even allow in many instances us to inspect their foreign food facilities but we continue to import from there. So what does this build do? Consumers can eat shrimp from anywhere they want. I believe in freedom. I want folks to eat shrimp from anywhere they want. And likely if you've been out at night here in the last few weeks you've been eating a shrimp it's imported. But I will tell you this here's what I want. I want consumers to know what they're eating. And so when you go in a restaurant and you're feeding your family or your children if that shrimp is imported I want you to know what that is. I believe that's right and just and that is what this measure does. Very simply Mr. Speaker and Mr. Speaker with that I'm glad to answer any question. You have a couple of questions representative Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized for question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does it gentlemen you yes ma'am are you. I want to clarify so you said that the majority of the shrimp that we consume comes from these other countries. And so my question my first question is are there a lot of people getting sick from this or is there something there's there a public health issue associated with this labeling. Good question representative so representative people continue to eat the seafood so I cannot say that anybody is getting sick. But I can tell you is there are there are things in imported shrimp that are not allowed in domestic shrimp. And that we don't allow in domestic products so we could say that about a lot of products but I can't tell you concretely that they're making people sick. No ma'am. Does the gentleman further yield yes ma'am you actually teed me up for my second question which is this bill is very specific for shrimp. But are there other foods that we are getting from other countries that maybe don't I guess align with the standards that you are speaking of. Representative I believe I believe the answer to that is yes this bill began as a bill that related to all seafood and menus that stated country of origin in the process in the committee process. This is what we produced which I stand by but yes I think there's a multitude of imports where countries have different health standards than we do in this country that should well be look that going forward. Thank you so much for answering my questions. Yes ma'am thank you for the gentleman yield. Yes Mr. Speaker. Representative Goddard inside y'all. Welcome Mr. Speaker. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield you mentioned countries like China India Indonesia. Do you know that your average consumer don't even care about where the shrimp come from when they look under menu and ordering food. The origin of the food or the shrimp is not deterring anyone from ordering isn't that true do you know that. I'm trying to understand is your question that people don't care where where where their shrimp is from. Yes asking me when you sit at a restaurant and you're looking at a food menu and you see the stream coming from China or Indonesia. Do you know that average consumer going to the restaurant don't even care about that. Well representative I guess we'll find out in a moment when we take this vote if if consumers care about that. I think we're talking about giving consumers the opportunity to know whether their shrimp is imported or domestic. And I can't answer as a consumer I would like to know that that's the only way I can answer that question. Any other questions Mr. Speaker. Yes sir you have a whole list of them. How about you have a question from someone else that has an interest from the coast. Oh yeah. Chairman Sains to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield. Is it not true that a lot of attention has been given to our north board and our south board but this is an attention to something very important to our to our east board which is a wild Georgia shrimp that hard work and shrimpers have caught and they know many of their consumers care about those products. Representative thank you for that that is correct our shrimp and fleet is 10% of what it was. It is almost gone we have a vestige of our shrimp fleet has been destroyed by foreign dumping of imports and I think that's sad but yeah this is hopefully will be helpful for consumers know what they're eating so maybe they can ask for other products if they so choose. Does the gentleman yield for one more question one more sir. Is it not true that a consumer report study in 2015 found that frozen shrimp from imported countries had 60% sampling of Salmonella and Lesteria and I would believe that every Georgia consumer would have a lot of interest in ensuring that their families their children are protected against such public health harms. I agree wholeheartedly thank you thank you. Thank you. General yield to the chairman of the committee from which this legislation came to gentleman yield. Yes sir I yield for one last. Chairman Dickey the chairman of the agriculture and consumer affairs committee has recognized. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yes sir Mr. Chairman. Isn't it true thank you for this good legislation isn't it true that our tax payer money foreign aid to some of these countries where this shrimp is being grown. It's been used for direct competition to our domestic shrimp industry leading to this oversupply and I appreciate this legislation to try to give our local customers a level play and fail to work on. Mr. Chairman thank you. It was recently discovered that our own foreign aid has been supporting Ecuador and Pondrae shrimp to compete against our own fisheries. Thank you for raising that great point. Mr. Speaker there are no further questions I believe I'll yield the way. You have a lot of questions and you have some other folks wanting to speak but that's up to the author if he's ready to yield. I'm ready to let him. Mr. Speaker I thank everybody knows we're trying to do here and I'll yield the well. Gentlemen's yield the well we have several people would like speak to the measure representative Carter has recognized a speak to House bill 117 give the lady in the will your attention please when then we have two more speakers after her. All right thank you Mr. Speaker first I want to say that I. I want to say that I will vote for this. Piece of legislation I did not vote for it in committee now I think some of the questions that were raised were things that are legitimate so as we talk about identifying whether shrimp is domestic affaren I think when we really get down to it the bigger issue is how is it. What was it produced was it in the farm. Was it wild and so what I would hope if we pass this piece of legislation when it goes over to the Senate that they add that caveat and I believe at the end of the day we do want to support our our strippers here in Georgia especially the wild shrimp but at the same time if this is really about health. It's not necessary in my opinion where it came from but it is a pun and if that's where we are identifying where the issue is then let's add that to this piece of legislation so we can go to a restaurant and see that it's is foreign. It came from a foreign country but it was if it was wild I think where the issue is not there and so in my opinion we also need to address whether or not it was upon raise because if we really do the research and study that's where the issue is but by no means so we said that's our interim they almost caught me in one of those meetings when they saw it getting it's getting explanations I told the chairman I said I think I found my favorite subject it was food. Seafood in particular but please if we're going to do this and it really is about health let's add the measures that's really count thank you I yield the well. Ladies yield to representative our Williams I think he lives down in coastal Georgia so I understand maybe in Liberty County I think I'm close representative Williams. Thank you the speaker some of you have been fortunate enough to enjoy shrimp most of your life I've been fortunate enough to catch shrimp most of my life I grew up casting for shrimp and picking oysters some of us who served in Vietnam saw the conditions that I had to make sure that I was in the water. The these shrimp came out of and it has not changed I've been assured there needs to be regulations as to what you're eating now every it was an old thing when I was growing up but don't kill you it'll make you fat. I didn't desire to die or get fat when you harvest shrimp that have that live in their natural environment where God intended them to live the oceans and into the inland where we catch them they have a natural filtering process that removes a lot of the food. There's a lot of the things that man will put into him once he corrals them and raises them my experiences being anything that God does and man tries to improve a bone is a failure shrimp a natural while life and I have a rule in my house and my wife instituted only. While caught shrimp Georgia shrimp preferably I'm an orc to lover and when I eat oysters here when possible if I'm at the ocean air I ask for mac and touch oysters because I know the people who harvest them. Let me tell you this folks we can debate this forever the fact is that it is better for you to eat while Georgia caught shrimp a lot of land lovers which they live closer to the ocean where you didn't even have to freeze those to get them to you. Let me continue by saying I've listened I've heard excuses but when you go in the supermarket or wherever you or the fish house you should know whether or not they're well caught Georgia shrimp if you live in Georgia then you make your choice. I don't want to find out too late that it made me sick on the front and let me air on the side of caution when I was running for the state house and I was elected 23 years ago when the first places I was invited was to a group of folks in browser Georgia and I stood up young and I talked about using a word it was not a bad word. I went to put a tariff on all foreign shrimp until the local shrimpers had exhausted everything they caught. Well I was lucky to get out there with my life and be able to be sworn in because many of the companies complained that this was the only place to get enough shrimp to serve that's always the excuse for let's use what we have first you don't have that excuse if you are not a provider if you're a consumer you ought to know what you're eating and you are sometimes photographed some things that go on. I'll get some videos and everything else is online I know it's online how they raise shrimp in India Vietnam and China don't look at it too close because you won't want to eat any shrimp anymore Georgia shrimp a safe but finally and I say finally but I'm a Baptist decan so I don't mean nothing. But finally I want you to remember that when I was a boy some of the best jobs on the coast were in the fishing industry I was an African American kid who saw African American captains of shrimp boats who owned their own shrimp boats who made a great living and hired people to work on these boats. The imports destroyed this industry and people who were making a great living were unemployed and guess what we help eat them into unemployment so whenever you see a former strip fisherman say I helped put him out of business because I ate all these imported shrimp that I have no idea what was in them. I want to see where the tomatoes were grown and believe me if they are not American grown I don't eat them because I don't know how they were handled and how they came into this country. I urge you to vote yes on this piece of legislation. If you enjoyed last night the Bronzwick Day that was the taste of real shrimp you understand when you go to reception and the big bowl sitting up there with all the pretty shrimp lining it if they are the same size within everything leave them alone because they are farm raised. Representative buddy Lotion I know what it means to eat real shrimp and anytime you tie a phone is come on down to the coast and we will treat you just some real shrimp. I yield for questions Mr. Speaker you had a couple oh well you have one more I thought you talked your way out of them I guess you didn't say. I know there are a little there is one gentleman you yield I yield. Dear ladies Smith has recognized for a question. Gentlemen you yield I yield. It may help this debate if we Georgia citizens understand the difference between gourmet and gourmand. A gourmet has discerning taste that's called grown in Georgia. A gourmet eats any white thing put in front of them. Would you like to come on up here because you. That's the little further explanation let's see we want to get a guy from middle Georgia. A little away from the coast. Representative Mac Jackson is recognized for a question. I'm not saying the speaker does gentleman yield. My friend of course. Is it not true that the water has to taste like cherry wine in order for the shrimp to taste that way. There stands a scholar and a gentleman. If they're not grown off the course of liberty Mac and touch Ryan or Camden they had no idea what it is to swim and live in cherry wine. I think the gentleman explained his position very well. Thank you Mrs. Figu with that I'll yield the well. That kind of laid it out there let's see we need a little more clarification on how important this bill is to we as consumers and the coastal Georgia. So let's hear from you champion to luch. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm going to try to boil this down and not take too much of your time. I watch those shrimp boats normally come by my dog on the Saplow River daily. I love the scene but I love those people that work those boats even more. These are people whose families have operated those boats for generations and generations six and seven generations. It's hard work. They leave early in the morning in the dark. They're on that water storms hot weather cold weather they're out there. I can tell you when those families are gone nobody else is going to go and do what they do. They do it because it's in their blood and that's what they've done all these years and I need to tell you that last year all of a sudden the boats weren't coming by my dog. And I went to the docks at Crezza where they buy those shrimp and the shrimpers were sitting on the docks and the boats were tied up. I sat on the end of the dock with them and they said the market has been flooded with foreign shrimp. That year they sent us more foreign, pung-grown, septic tank grown, whatever, shrimp and the total consumption of shrimp in this country. The price at the dock dropped below a dollar a pound. That gave them less than half the money it took to pay for the diesel fuel and the boats. There's no shortage of shrimp on the Georgia coast but when you flood the market with these foreign shrimp the price drops so low that they have to stop. And if we don't get them back pretty soon they're gone forever. Over half of those shrimpers live in my district. So let me say this. I think it's two issues. Number one, there is a health issue and to answer the question we had earlier about our people getting sick. I was told by a member of the medical profession my seat made a doctor and I have his permission to say this. Resistance to bacteria or resistance to those medicines that they put in there to save these shrimp from the bacteria. That resistance that builds up in your body happens over a period of time. It might be years before you even recognize the bacteria resistance. So health is one issue. The number two issue is do people in Georgia care enough about hard work in Georgia making a living to protect them from this far undupping? It's just that simple. Do Georgians have the right when they go to a restaurant to know what they're eating? If the answer to you is yes, then I hope you vote yes on this bill and Mr. Spake I'm on you all the well. The gentleman is you all the well. Thank you all for your perspectives on a very important issue to Georgians. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Here he none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none the report the committee has agreed to. This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? For what purpose is cheerleading camp rice? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Isn't it true that if I go to the grocery store and buy a bag of frozen shrimp it clearly states the origin the shrimp came from but if you go to a restaurant because that is under the department of public health, you're not really clear where your food came from so this bill just enables individuals to make choices regarding if they would like to eat Georgia called shrimp or any shrimp is domestically imported domestically here or imported shrimp. I'm sure the lady knows what she speaks. For what purpose is repositive rice, parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker isn't it true that when we travel to other countries, a wise traveler will look at travel advisories to learn what you should and should not do in these places and what you should and should not eat and shouldn't a reverse of that take impact to where when food is coming here from other locations, we should have the right to know where it comes from so that we can make the educated decision as to whether or not we want to consume it. The gentleman is really touched on something very logical there. Thank you for that inquiry for what purpose is repositive remand rise. What purpose lady ways for what purpose is represented Holly rise. Mr. Speaker isn't it true that while I'm voting in favor of this bill because I believe that it's right for situations where person if they get sick for their doctor to be aware of where that item came from that the vegetarian in me looks at this bill and wonders how we could ever think we couldn't get sick from eating the cousins of roaches. I'm going to let you take that up with all these guys from the coast. I'm not getting an argument. Let's be fair for what purpose is represented trend rise. Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker is it not true that many of these countries these farms are banned from selling shrimp to their own people but are allowed to sell it to us. That kind of sums it up right there. What purpose is represented McCullum rise. Parliamentary inquiry Mr. Speaker. Staying worried. Is it not true that you can prepare shrimp a bunch of different ways fried shrimp shrimp preo. The gentleman's shrimp preo. Barbecue shrimp. You look like bubble gum just a little bit. I tell you what. I'm not a smart man but I love Georgia's shrimp. I'm just a clerk with that list locked the machine. I think I had a long on the passage of House Bill 117 the years are 165 the days are seven. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Thank you for your comments on the bill. I don't expect that one. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption House Bill 148 148 House of 148 by rep. Carson of the 46th being taught on act to amend chapter three, total 43 the fish go to Georgia and say it related to the count. I think that's the right answer. I think that's the right answer. So it's a revised provisions relating to the education experience requirements of certified public account. This bill I refer to the committee unregulated industries that committee recommends a dispel do pass. Chairman Carson's I apologize. I didn't see that last. Probably me require you coming either. So you just have to deal with it from here. The chairs recognize represented Carson recognize to present the bill. I was telling my friend from Athens who was just right here. I don't know how to follow that. I'm kind of hungry for our shrimp basket right now. But the folks at House Bill 148 what this does is reform some of our education and mobility statutes in regard to public accountancy. We are facing a massive shortage a massive shortage of accountants. I would I've seen some reports that from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg stating that 75% of my brethren that are CPAs like my also my friend from Cobb County who was co-signer on the bill. 75% of us are within 10 years of retirement. And you think of all the bills that we pass that require audience city audits municipal counties and so forth. So we're going to be a major issue. What House Bill 148 does adds two new routes to license sure in order to be a CPA right now you need a five year college degree one year of experience passes the CPA exam. What this would do is allow you to do four years of college in accounting or tax two years of experience and obviously pass the exam in addition to a third way which is a master's degree under the regents. The second thing this does is updates our mobility practice requirements in Georgia. It updates it to what so much of the country is also doing right now for example if you're in North Georgia you could hire a CPA in Chattanooga to do your taxes and that's fine. If you had a business and say North Georgia and you wanted to have your CPA in Chattanooga audited could not happen because a CPA out of state cannot provide assurance or audit services for a client in Georgia. This will update it. I will say I've got a map of the United States in regard to all the various states that are doing this and I apologize I don't have this on the board but this is a map about 36 states. Apostle 37 are all doing what exactly what we're doing with House Bill 148 because of the workforce issues that we have.

It's stressing a different pathways for young people to become a CPA, but still be licensed and qualified as secondly To have an update to our mobility statute With that Mr. Speaker, I don't think I would have as many questions as a shrimp bill, but I'm happy to take a question If there is one you do have a question of the general wheel I think you have Question from someone in the profession representing Wilkerson that's recognized for a question to your left in the back Thank you Mr. Speaker. It is a gentleman yield. Yes, sir to my friend Thank you very much for bringing this bill is it not true that this is a result of many hours of work by CPAs across the state and across the country actually Absolutely it is my friend from Cobb County knows this to be true Absolutely does the gentleman yield for one more question? Yes, sir Is it not true that this would give the same path that myself and as well as others my age So with the four years and two years of work experience and we are some pretty decent CPAs Yes, that's true and actually I'm in that same group because I was grandfathered in before these rules were changed in 98 and we're changing this back Hey, Mr. Speaker, I just want to honor recognize the work of Mr. Boyd search He's the president CEO of the Society CPAs Paul Ziga across the street the state Board of Accountancy in really Farrell whose partner with P. Price Waterhouse Cooper's She is the chair of the state board of Accountancy and today we're also joined by Catherine Fletcher She's the chair of the Georgia Society CPAs right there in the in the gallery Mr. that with that Mr. Speaker I Would appreciate this body's favorable consideration. Yeah, I have further questions Okay, I'll take a question. No, you have no further question. Okay. I would ask through this body's favorable consideration and I yield to well Gentlemen's yield to the will I think you I think you're both are pretty well proven CPAs So we appreciate y'all's service to your communities into your clients Is there any objections to the previous previous question being ordered here in none the previous questions ordered is There an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee Which was favorable to the passage of the bill here in none the report the committee is agreed to Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed we'll vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machines? You Have all members voted All members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 148 the Yays are 172 the Nays are zero and this bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 162 162 House bill 162 by reps and of Hagen 156 and others being titled an act to amend chapter 3 a title 35 The fish go to George annotated relating the journal Georgia Bureau of investigation So it's to provide for the restriction and seal the first defender act sentences until such statuses are vote This bill I'm referring to the committee and judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute Representative Lisa Hagen is recognized to present the bill give the lady to wear your attention, please Thank you, mr. Speaker and colleagues I have here House bill 162 the first defender Modernization bill that we had in this chamber last year and we voted it out 155 to zero We brought it back this year for necessary reasons and It hasn't really changed this last year if you weren't here and you don't know Georgia's first offender act was put in place in the 1960s and it was done so to give people who Make an isolated very bad decision or not so bad decision as it might be the chance to Not have that conviction follow them the rest of their life We don't want anybody who has made a nice-align mistake to For the rest of their life not be able to find good housing get a good job to support their family any other reason why a person might not want to have a These court Documents available and actually in case you did not know this if someone please first offender and they successfully complete their sentence It's actually a non-conviction so we were talking about people who have not been convicted of a crime if they complete their Senate successfully So why do we need to update this bill? Well currently? anyone who Please first offender If they successfully complete their sentence the judge may Seal and restrict the records upon completion of the Senate We know that everything is on the internet now and so that has become a problem for a lot of people who think they're pleading for a defender and I'm gonna get us get that second chance But since their records are already out out in the cloud. It's not the second chance. They had been promised so this bill simply requires that the the records would be sealed at sentencing and then if the person who has used the first offender Please does not successfully complete their sentence then the judge will be able to unseal those records and we feel like that Retains the intended Purpose for the first offender act to begin with and that that would help give Georgians the second chance that that we're promising them in our law and Mr. Speaker that is the bill and if I have any questions I'd be happy to answer them But if I don't I'll be happy to yield the will I Was talking about health care. I'm sorry You have a couple of questions to Lady will yield I will Cheer lady seal Cox to your right in the back has a question ladies recognize do you yield I do Isn't it true that this will help a lot of people who have made a mistake as you said This will help them to be rehabilitated and to more easily get jobs and re-enter the and for the workforce without a record That's true. Thank you. Thank you for bringing the bill you're welcome lady you for a couple more. Yes, sir Representative Mac Jackson to your right Recognize for a question. Thank you miss speaker. Does the general lady yield one question? Does the federal government recognize Georgia's first offender? well, that's a good question and I don't know that the federal government would be involved with it It's been in place since the 1960s. So Not being an attorney. I don't know how to answer that question, but I Anybody want to help me out here? For person could miss a crime and they they're sentenced under the first offender act and then they commit another crime Can the fairs go back and unseal that first offender act? A state crime I Would I would assume so I've been advised that they can by a qualified person sitting in a Just trying to have said yes We're gonna ask these questions we get some help let's recognize someone I think making an offer some assistance here Represent Miller is recognized for a question. Thank you. Does the general lady I do yield is it not true that law enforcement can always Access criminal records even if they have been sealed by the court that is for public Purpose is a not for law enforcement purposes. It is true and thank you for that and we've made sure that that intent was was That was safe within this new language. Thank you You've done a great job on this you have one more question who's been waiting patiently That's represented Douglas to your right and the back Thank you, mr. Speaker. That's it. There's a general lady you I do I Love the bill. I have one Exciting question Does it go back and cover the people that's under that same first offender act going forward? If they were sentenced before July 1st of 2025 Then they can petition the judge to do exactly that they would have to go it wouldn't be automatic They would have to petition the judge for that, but yes, that's that's included in here. Thank you for this bill Well, I thought you were done, but you have another couple of legal Eagles that want to weigh in here, so Well, you have a whole lot of legal Eagles want to weigh in now. I'm gonna give a couple of my questions We're absolutely will lever it I can ask for a question with the chair with the chair lady yield. I will Is it not true that House bill 162 and no way to to the Minority chair lady's point it in no way hinders or impede any legitimate Criminal investigation. This is simply about Other access by other people to criminal records and such as unemployment search or something about nature That's absolutely true. We were very careful to make sure that anyone who needed access to these records were Specifically mentioned within the language so that they would have access if necessary Well, with Charlie if one other question. Yes, is it also not true? That this bill is very careful about ensuring the promise that we made to people who make one mistake Back in the 1960s when the bill was initially passed by making sure that even during the dependency of your first offender Program completion that that information is not also made public which is the main problem that motivated the The filing of the blood. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you miss bigger Lady has a couple more questions a few yield Which you like for me to yield or Your boss it's a good bill. Let's take one for one more the ribs in San to has a question to your left Right, I'm sorry. I got my day. We got more on fixed up. Thank you. Quick question. Does this bill also cover the first conditional discharge The first offender and the first conditional discharge to my understanding are used For different types of offenses, but they're used at the same level to prevent the first No, it's not understanding if they played first offender. They are they are just Use utilizing first offender My understanding. Thank you. I'm just becrime to yield the well. Thank you, and I ask for your favorable consideration of this bill Thank you.

Here here's none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the bill the passage of the bill We'll vote yes all those opposed we'll vote no and mr. Clerk. Were you unlocked the machine? I Have all members voted For what purpose is representative Al Williams rise Concrete station Is it not true, mr. Speaker that I would like for some of these law and legal minds to explain why one of my constituents Who doing a sorority prank was picked up for shoplifting under the first events act and Years later was designed denied a job as a teacher because it came up is it not true? I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks. I may have an answer now. Let's see. I'm not sure about that What purpose does whip barchette rise Parliamentary inquiry stay chain quarry Is it not true, mr. Speaker that what the bill seeks to do is Essentially what happens at the terminus of a first offender? Pleee in a first offender a plea the charge never Is a sticks to the individual if they they fulfill their program? That has been outlaid by the court now if they breach the program then the charge sticks and they have to abide by the rest of whatever the program is So what this bill will do isn't it true mr. Speaker is that upon? Making the plea then you will not be able to access that Record showing that you are currently under a plea for first offenders so that if you are applying for a job Right now and you are under in a first offenders. It doesn't show up currently right now. Isn't that true mr. Speaker? I'm sure the learning but it's clear as mud. I don't say that I'm sure the learner gentleman knows what he speaks. How about if we hear from the Majority leader leader frustration for what purpose of you rise? Parliamentary inquiry stay chain quarry mr. Speaker is not true that currently is your seeking employment for certain secured Employments such as elder care minor care things like that. There's a different what GCIC calls a purpose code that's used To the gentleman purpose code is used that then allow certain criminal history to be available Because of the sensitive nature of the employment. But what we're talking about here is Already under existing law you can ask the court at the time of sentencing to Issue in order restricting and sealing the record and this would just allow that to occur automatically So you wouldn't have the additional stage in there But but as far as the gentleman's question from earlier based upon certain sensitive types of employment certain criminal history may be available and certainly as the General lady said earlier for law enforcement and judicial searches that Entire criminal history is always going to be available through GCIC for that. Thank you Thank you, miss leader for providing that clarity. We do appreciate it. Have all members now voted All Members voted mr. Clerk where you lock the machines on The passage of house passage of house bill 162 the yeas are 172 the days are Zero this bill had received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed Mr. Clerk where you read the caption of house bill 17717 Hospital 177 by reps on a Cooper the 45th and others to be entitled back to a men title from 19 the physical to Georgia Annotated related domestic relations So to provide protection for household pets and both family violence and dating violence protective orders Let's feel happy for the committee on judiciary that committee recommends this bill do pass The general lady is recognized to present the bill charity Cooper you're recognized Thank you mr. Speaker lays in gentlemen the house. I bring you to you house bill 177 Unfortunately when people decide to break up a marriage or a relationship It is often often not very harmonious to say the least and One are the other of the people that are moving out or unhappy Will then often become violent or Abusing vocally threatening to try to get the other person to stay and What happens at that time one person will go and apply for a temporary protective order Which lets the judge say here the parameters you can't step on the property You're not allowed to Take the children from school and there's a list of things that they do and the one thing that's been missing and It's really terrible that we have to add pets but People who do not have good control themselves have found a way to terrorize The person that wants them to leave or that is leaving and that is by harming The family pet and so what this bill allows them to do is when they ask for a temporary protective order the judge can also tell The opposing person what parameters and what legal rights they have and so forth is rounding the pet So as to protect the pet nothing is worse Then a father and it's usually the father not always Threatening to kill in front of the children of family pet That's something that stays with the child for the rest of their life And he seems like we are getting a meter part of our Society that is using this type of threat more often So I would ask for your fable consideration of house bill 177 which simply adds allows the judges to protect family pets from abuse and harm and Mr. Speaker of their no questions. I will yield the well You do have a couple of questions for lady will you yield? Representative silcox to your right in the back Thank you, Mr. Speaker will the General play the yield please yes, I will Is it not true that house bill 177 simply extends the ability of protective orders to cover household pets Ensuring that survivors of domestic violence are not forced to leave their animals behind when seeking safety Yes, it does there are statistics that about 40% of all domestic violence victims where their pets were threatened With violence 40% and it's also one of the reasons that women Often will not leave a really bad relationship because they they cannot go to a shelter that will take a pad and they are afraid something will happen to the family pet Thank you for that question. Thank you for bringing the bill Lady has one more question Representing for now Representing for now is recognized for a question to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker would lady you Yes Thank you for this bill Isn't it also true that People will use their pets from elderly Relatives if they don't give them money that they will also threaten to harm their pet Thank you for bringing that up. I really wanted that added but it's in another part of the law on elders it is Frequently and more often becoming where elderly people are threatened that their pets will be taken away If they don't sign over their checkbook and their bank account to a nephew or a grandson on drugs and are that their pets will be harmed So we really need to look at that going forward because for elderly Their pets are often their main Comfort and support and so we do need to look at that Thank you for asking that question and Mr. Speaker.

Speaker So colleagues I am very disturbed by what I heard from this well yesterday about the future of section 504 Section 504 for more than half a century has guaranteed access to education and services for people with disabilities It is a program that so many Georgians rely on And our attorney general has joined a lawsuit asking the court to end it And yet we heard a member of this body yesterday Represent to the public and to the disability community that section 504 is not at risk Well to the public I say this you are being asked to not believe what you can see with your own eyes Because on the question of whether section 504 is being threatened by Georgia's own attorney general The answer is an unequivocal yes And you do not have to take my word for it Take the words directly from the attorney general's lawsuit The lawsuit he chose to join on behalf of the people of Georgia The lawsuit he is spending your tax dollars on the lawsuit he has signed Count three is explicit it election it alleges that section 504 is unconstitutional And it goes on for three pages explaining why The suit sums up count three with the following and I quote 239 because section 504 is coercive Untethered to the federal interest in disability and unfairly retroactive The rehabilitation act is not constitutional under the spending clause 240 the constitutional violation posed by invalid spending legislation can be remedied by injunctive relief That precludes relevant federal officials from withdrawing funds for in compliance That is legal speak stating that the state shouldn't have to comply with section 504 because it is unconstitutional And then you can go to the end of the lawsuit again. This is a publicly available document And go to the prayer for relief That's legal speak for the people who brought the lawsuit. It's what they're asking the court to do And clear as day when you go to point D the attorney general is asking the court To declare section 504 unconstitutional. It is in black and white

is uncontrovertible. So here's what I would ask of my colleagues. If they wanted to bait the wisdom of filing a lawsuit calling for the end of section 504, do not represent to the public that 504 is not at risk. It is. If the Attorney General doesn't want this lawsuit to go so far as to abolish 504, he should not have included that ask in his lawsuit. It is that simple. And do not call those of us who are sounding the alarm shameful and intellectually dishonest for doing so. Do not say that we are the ones fomenting fear, confusion, and misinformation for confirming to the public that their valid concerns are supported in fact. The fear and confusion are stemming from what the Attorney General from his signed complaint. From the fact, not from the fact that we are confirming that this lawsuit exists. You are gaslighting the public by telling them not to believe what they can see with their own eyes. And I would suggest that if we want to tell the public you are protecting section 504, Georgia should pull out from this lawsuit that is seeking its destruction. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Okay. I'm just going to just the chair forgotten to make a point. And I'm going to remind members, after an order for 10 minutes, and if you want to go up here and talk the whole time, so no one else can have a time, we're going to do that. But I'm going to limit after an order to 10 minutes, be respectful of the other members that would like to speak. Fair and simple. Chair, Dempsey and Hokeham are recognized and representing Scott Hokeham are recognized for an important afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon. I'll be very quick about this. On my desk, I have the wrongful Conviction Compensation Act. Many have been very familiar with this. I would like to offer anybody the opportunity to sign it and who would like to.
