You
All in the past so the bill yeas are 55 and the nays are one the bill on the local
percent calendar having receded registered constitutional majority is therefore half.
Moving on, House bill 14, Mr. Secretary.
House bill 14 by representative Carpenter of the fourth and others,
it builds me down on act to amend Article 3, Chapter 3 of Title 50.
The official go to Georgia and take away to other state symbols.
So as to designated Cormbread as the official state of Georgia,
to write legislative findings and declarations to our related matters to
be a long-completing laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate command rules were recommended this bill due passed by
Substitute Respect Police Minutes in a brass chairman.
Mr. President, the Senate command rules are following a substitute to House Bill 14
to build between Title IX and Title V, the Vistula of Georgia annotated.
What do you state government as to as to enact the Georgia music office and
music writing communities act and for other purposes?
Mr. President, that completes the order.
We're going to have the center from the fourth, 46, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Well, we've had a little bit of a contentious afternoon on some of these bills.
And I want everybody to know I still love you.
love you whether you've voted with me or against me and this is one of those types of bills
that we all come back to get you know it's been said by many that music is the universal
guess language of love and I will tell you right now I have zero musical ability can't carry a
tune can't play any kind of instrument in the world but there ain't anybody in this room
that loves music more than I do especially live music grew up in making Georgia
which is sort of the epicenter of much of the great R&B music in this
state as well as the birthplace of Southern Rock and Roll. We have many
fantastic musicians that come from the state of Georgia let me run through a few
I'll start in my hometown of Macon, where Little Richard first burst on the scene.
And Otis Redding, he was from just outside of Macon.
The first deer I ever killed was on the Redding Ranch out in Jones County, Georgia of their
state.
Of course, we've had the almond brothers and all the great acts of Capricorn music in
Jason Aldin these days with country music all coming out of making and after I got out
of law school I settled in Athens, Georgia and goodness it was right at the epicenter of
the explosion of new music coming out of Athens where we had the B-52s and REM and widespread
panic and many others from there.
We've got James Brown from Augusta, Georgia, the Godfather of Seoul, Ma Rainey from Columbus,
sort of the grandmother of the Blues.
We've got Christian Rock bands, third day and casting crowns, excuse me, from here in
the Atlanta area.
also has tremendous hip-hop and R&B music with usher, outcast, ludicrous, TLC,
silo green, all hailing from here, and recording here. Other great country acts in
Georgia, Alan Jackson, down in Noon in Georgia, Sugarland. We've got Luke
Brian Trissier-Yearwood out of Monticello, Travis Tritt, I could go on and on.
Now let me tell you something, I'll get all those names that I just told you.
I forgot the senator from the 26th.
Maybe he may not be as famous or made as much money at it, but he's recorded as a music festival every spring I'm invited to.
So let y'all in on a little secret about how weird I am, how eclectic I am, in high school,
grew up in Macon.
I went to the Macon Mall every weekend to Camelot Music, and the manager of fellow
name Lee, African American guy, and our good buddies, and he introduced me to so much music.
y'all will laugh at this.
I would buy an eight track tape almost every weekend in high school.
I was working at the YMCA and I'd save up my money to
put some gas in my old ragged out Mustang too.
And I'd get a new tape of some sort eventually
growing to cassette tapes and maybe having enough money
for the date on the weekend.
But I was exposed to all kind of music and I loved it all.
Every single musician I just named except for Maureenie
are now on Spotify playlist of mine.
Am I crazy or what?
That's a wide range of musical taste.
And one of my favorite days in here last year to ago
was when George Clinton, from Parliament and Funkadelic,
Senator 26th, you talk about Superfly.
He was dressed like Superfly when he came in
and I got my picture babe with him
because I remembered.
And high school going to make in Coliseum
and seeing Parliament, Funkadelic,
concert there where that spaceship came down on the stage
they let them out of there. So I like it all. I like it all. And it is a true asset of this state.
We've got music studios all over. Athens has them. Recording studios,
Macon has the old Capricorn studios is back recording these days. And it's open for the public.
We are spending all kind of money, tax benefits to promote the movie industry here in our state, and we are spending zero for the music industry.
It's all about the movies.
We've got our own home grown artist.
I just want us to have a chance to promote them.
And that is all we're doing with this bill, which is House Bill 14.
represented. Carpenter got it started over there and
sent it to us. We perfected it. It made it a little bit better.
But it just creates the Georgia Music Office
and Music Ready Communities Act.
It is no appropriation unless we decide to do it
and we think it will take extremely little money.
If we want to market our musicians,
promote our concerts, advertise, do public relations,
community relations to try to build these music industries in our state. We've
got it going on. We've got all the artists that you could ask for here but we
need to grow our music industry just like we do others and this is the cheapest
way I can think of just to set up a department and this may be just one or two
people for all we know under the Department of Economic Development let's get
going and trying to promote our musicians. Now we were sitting here fighting
earlier but this is a joint enterprise a bipartisan bill senator from the
39th asked me to help her with it and I said I'm all in this is not a
Democratic bill it is not a Republican bill this it in any kind of racial
bill at all it's got them all anybody that can promote music in the state of
Georgia, I'm behind them and I think it's an asset, a real talent base here, and would
ask you to please help me and let's get something going where we can have grants and promotions
and music and festivals, even the Senator from the 26th Festival down in making, we'll
try to promote that and get him some customers there.
Mr. President, I'm happy to yield the will or I'll take any questions that the crowd has
even about my musical taste.
You do have a question from probably the biggest music lover in here and the senator from eight
Little Elvis, thank you, Mr. President. The senator you I will be happy to
Senator, I just want to make sure that you're really up on your music knowledge
Can you tell the members of this body, sir? Don't make me sing. Well, I just want to ask this
I wonder if you could prove your knowledge by telling the members of this body who the greatest solo recording artists have all
All time was what I called him the king for a reason Elvis Presley Elvis airing for us. Thank you, Senator
I was born in Mississippi, so I got a connection to him as well
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the will
Senator's yielding
Very nice and from 39
I want to thank my friend from District 46 who has already laid out the reasons to vote
yes on this bill.
And I won't belabor the issue, but I do want to underscore just a few points.
As you well know, Georgia is a state that believes in economic development.
We focus on industries that create jobs, attract businesses, and drive growth.
And today, right now, we have the opportunity to do the same for one of our most powerful,
but often overlooked economic engines, music.
George's music industry is a $5 billion powerhouse supporting over 70,000 jobs across the
state. It fuels tourism, hospitality,
digital media, and small businesses. Our music
legacy, which spans hip hop, country, gospel, and rock,
has made Georgia a global cultural force, but culture alone
doesn't create jobs. Focus does and strategy does. This bill
builds on our economic momentum, ensuring that music has the
structure and the coordination to grow. We've seen what happens when Georgia
prioritizes industries like manufacturing, technology and logistics. Music
deserves the same deliberate approach. Other states, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, and just last year North Carolina had put targeted resources behind
their music industries and the result speak for themselves. Stronger small businesses, more
music tourism and better job pipelines for young people entering the industry. We have an existing
music ecosystem. We aren't starting from scratch. We've already got the foundation to be a natural
national leader, over 70 world class recording studios, music festivals like Savannah music festival,
music midtown and shaky knees bring millions in tourism dollars, cities like Macon, Athens,
and Savannah are already recognized as global music destinations. We have a workforce beyond the
stage, venue operators, sound engineers, event staff, music marketers, and small business owners,
all depend on a thriving music economy.
So understanding our existing assets, infrastructure,
and industry ecosystem is key to maximizing
this full economic potential.
Statewide Music Office is a win for local businesses.
It's a win for Georgia's workforce.
And it's a win for our state's economic development
because music is economic development.
At its heart, this bill is about jobs, business growth,
and keeping Georgia competitive.
Let's make sure we support this industry
that helps make Georgia thrive.
I urge your support for HB 14.
Thank you, unless there are questions,
I yield the well.
No question, Senator, and we appreciate all your hard work
on this subject matter.
Does any other Senator wish to speak for against measure?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair utilizar �ann Marie's question is ordered.
Question is on the adoption of the Committee substitute.
Is there objection to the adoption of the Committee substitute?
Hearing none of the Committee substitute is adopted.
Is there objection to agreeing to the report and community which is favorable to the
passes of the bill?
Chair here is none of the board committee is agreed to.
Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
Chair here is none.
the main question has ordered.
Questions on the passes of the bill?
All those in favor vote yay all opposed may secretary on not machine
You
All in the passes of the bill, the A's of 47, I'm still trying to look at who these
nine are. This bill has received
reexec constitutional majority is
therefore passed by substitute.
Must have been the cornbread in
there.
Secretary Reed House bill 233.
House bill 233.
Representative Townsend of 179.
I've been eligible to be in town and act to amend Article 3, Chapter 3, Title 50, the official code of Georgia annotated.
Related to other state symbols, those to designate Brunswick suit as the official state suits,
arrived for religious adverting, arrived for related matters to repealable looking laws and rather purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate Commandant of Wolves recommends that this bill do pass by sub-suicide submitted, Senator Brash, Chairman.
Mr. President, the Senate Commandant of Wolves offers the long sub-suicide to House Bill 233,
billed to be in town and act to amend Chapter 4, Title 1, and Title 50, the official code of Georgia annotated.
to hold these own services and state government respectively.
So it's designated the 4th Friday in November of each year
as National Sheriff Gaines here,
but they enjoyed it.
It's named Bredzo Xues, the official state stew.
It's designated as the Quornbred,
as the official state red,
to radical legislative findings,
to prohibit and further purposes, Mr. President,
that completes the order.
that
is
Mr. President, Mr. President, we are going to continue talking about some red-hot legislation
most important that we're going to do this year.
I bring you Senate.
We're going to go by the way.
going to go from Spotify to the kitchen table with Senate Bill 233, which is an amalgamation
of several other very important bills. Section one of this bill makes the fourth Friday
in November sugar cane syrup day in Georgia, and I can assure you I have had nothing on
my pancakes, but cane syrup since I was a little kid and won't have anything else.
to makes Brunswick stew, the official stew of Georgia. Brunswick stew certainly has historical
and economic significance, particularly to my hometown. It was born and raised in Brunswick
Georgia and there is absolutely no doubt, no debate whatsoever that Brunswick Georgia
is the origination point of Brunswick stew. And then finally, section three, not finally,
Section 3 designates cornbread as the official bread of Georgia, and I will tell you that
I like mine with sour cream and with kernel corn and with cream corn in it, best in the
world.
And then we added insignificantly section 4, which speaks to a foreign country of concern
will be ineligible to directly contract
with the state agency for good of services,
including but not limited to a contract for the procurement
or purchase of computers, printers, connecting tables,
or interoperable video conference and services
used in connection with an office environment
in a country of concern is defined a country of concern
or scrutinized country means any company,
owned or operated by a foreign country
of concern or country in which the government
of a foreign country of concern has an ownership state.
Little background here in 2022,
Governor Kemp signed legislation that we pass
prohibiting Chinese owned or operated companies
from bidding on state contracts.
This language in section 4.1 is a tweet
in House Bill 113, which passed the Senate last week
unanimously.
Section 4.1 of House Bill 233 specifies certain technology
products such as computers, printers, and video
comparison equipment, and closes a loophole
that would allow these companies to bid on state contracts
through third-party vendors.
We obviously have concerns about Chinese computers,
which include the possibility of espionage,
cyber attacks, and unfair trade practices.
And according to the China tech threat folks,
the state of Georgia has spent 47,259,946 dollars
between 2020 and 2022 on several Chinese back companies
back companies, and this bill would pro-scribe that.
Finally, let me tell you that what we're going to do here is we're going to sit down to
our table, to a dinner table, a brunswick stew, cornbread, cane syrup.
And unlike our lunch today, there will be no Chinese food.
a large favorable consideration will answer any questions if there are any.
Senator from the 50th.
I have a quick question about Cain's syrup.
Is it not true that Waffle House doesn't serve Cain syrup?
What?
Waffle House does not serve Cain syrup.
That's why I don't buy Waffles at Waffle House.
Well that was going to be my next question with the popularity of Waffle House this year.
Did you consider speaking to the Waffle House lobbyist before introducing this bill?
I will be more than glad to, because again, I do not put anything but Cain syrup on my waffle.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Recognize the senator from the 41st.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, do you, you, I'm over here.
Over here.
Yes, ma'am, I will you.
I thank you.
Senator, do you know what company makes the state issue laptops
that we all have?
No, but I think I'm about to find out.
Yes, isn't it true that our laptops are all a novo laptops
that are manufactured and made in Japan?
I'm sure the senator knows of what she speaks.
Isn't it true that we also just got brand new laptops?
I'm sure the senator knows of what she speaks.
So is there a fiscal note associated with this portion
of your bill?
I know it has many, many parts on the table.
But the portion of your bill that talks about not being
able to purchase things from foreign adversaries.
Is there a fiscal note associated?
No, ma'am, there is no fiscal note.
Senator, I just want to say isn't it true
that I have great concern about the fiscal costs
that would come with this.
And lighted the fact that 56 of us just received
new laptops from China, 180 across the hall,
along with our admins.
And so I just have grave concern
about the fiscal impact of having to change out
our laptops in such a short period of time.
Senator, I don't think the bill says anything
about sending anything back.
I think it speaks to future contracts.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, would you yield, please?
Certainly will.
In a true, I appreciate you bringing this great legislation.
I like cornbread in my brains with Steve.
Would that be okay if this bill passed?
again you like cornbread I like to crumble a cornbread in my
friends with you you know what's the difference you you know it gets in your
stomach and it says would that be all right same way anyway that would be
absolutely but I don't have to put cane syrup in there no I would not advise it
okay thank you you're welcome all right the senator from 16 the birthday man
today sir thank you senator yield I will and happy birthday senator does this
bill protect us from syrup coming from China. I guess that it does if the state
buys it. How about our bronze extinguisher? Can it come from China? I don't think that
that's possible. You don't think that's possible. It would not be bronze
extinguisher. I don't think there's a bronze with China. I may be wrong but and if
there is it's nothing like the bronze with Georgia that I grew up in. Very good
Thank you, sir. You're more than welcome.
All right, Senator, you have a new home.
Well, Mr. President, we have a late arriving amendment and secretary read the amendment.
Mr. President, Senator Tillery and the 19th and others offer the following amendment number
one to amend the Senate Committee's subzoot of House Bill 233 by Shriken Secretary of Commerce
on line 90 and replacing it with treasurer, Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you Mr. President. I appreciate the time that we're going to spend on this really
important amendment. I actually, one of our colleagues wanted to file this and wasn't
brave enough to do so themselves, so they asked me to do it. I don't want to call them
out at all of who that might be. But the truth is, I don't know the Secretary of Commerce.
I hear he's a really good person, really good man. And when we're looking at fighting against
foreign adversaries like China, I don't know that I trust someone that I don't know to
make the decision of who those foreign adversaries should be. But I do know somebody I trust
to make that decision.
And that's why I propose this amendment
at the urging of the Senator from the 21st,
because I know that if I have to have someone
who has America first, America's interest first,
wants to fight for America first,
there is nobody other.
I can't say his name, but Mr. President,
the Senate rules do not bar me from saying his initials.
You know who that would be.
If you want someone who will stand up for America,
Who would that be?
Nobody other than B-L-B.
Urge your favorable consideration of the amendment, Mr. President,
I yield the well.
Unless, of course, there are questions.
Darn.
Oh, thank you, I can't.
I can't.
Actually, you do have a later, like,
robbing question, right, quick.
You said Senator from the second.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, do you, you?
Always, to my friend from the second.
And Senator, I think the treasurer, the gentleman from the 21st and his
infinite wisdom and all of his illustriousness, Senator, do you agree that the
incoming treasurer would ensure that I-16 would have all the proper and
necessary resources to defend itself against all adversaries, especially
those that may arise from China and have the proper money to fund such endeavors.
Would you not agree that that would be an accurate statement?
four and end domestic senator yes uh absolutely senator and is it not
further the true that the gentleman from the 21st is of
Cajun descent and that means that that that individual is a true fighter
I think the senator knows of what he speaks thank you so much senator
well senator i do think further he's told me that that third line of i-16
will be paved and gold i don't know where he's getting it from
but i've heard it might be paved and go this president there
He'll just turn on the print and presses up there's all he'll do
Recognize soon from the 27th thing is presence chairman you
Chairman if you ever had the opportunity to discuss with the senator from the 21st his very specific and
motivational morning routine
I've not discussed it with him, but I have heard it. Yes, sir
Would it would you mind you recall the specific words at the center speaks to himself every morning and would you like to
recite those with me and the members of this chamber at this time.
Yes, sir. It's a poem. Are we ready for that?
I'm ready. I think it starts with I. You ready?
I look in the mirror and what do I see?
A good looking stud named B L B. Yes, sir.
So what I've heard.
Chairman, do you further yield?
Yes, sir. And I do want to say that if anyone wants to add that, I would consider that
to be a friendly amendment to the amendment.
are you aware that the senator from the 21st wife
has her own version of that song
senator i'm not
would it would you like for me to
i would love to hear it but first i must tell you and if the sergeant of
our needs to read to read it to you remember that we do have rules of the
column in this body understood rules against disparaging another member of
the senate
is it isn't not true that based on the rules of the senate going to
Allow the senator privately to share the words of
Stead Sala. Well, that I that may be true, but senator
Since I can't ask him a quote or can't respond to him directly
I can't remind him that if he matches his blue button
He could ask a question that did tell us what his wife might say
Recognize senator from the 20th
Thank you, Mr. President with the senator to yield and this is the best part of my business
Senator, is it not true that I think I've sat by the senator from the 21st, 10 sessions?
Yes, so your sentence is soon over.
I usually am confused to hear most of the time, but I'm quite confused senator and maybe you can clarify this for me.
This is a great amendment, but it's not signed by the senator from the 21st
He was busy signing dollar bills. Yes, sir
Well, he's not wanting to shy away from self-promotion. I figured he was
busy doing something. Thank you
Senator from the eight
Does the senator you always yield to my friend from bracing?
I just have to ask a question. I have a amendment here on my desk that is signed by you and
the senator from the 18th of senator from the 50th of the senator from the 42nd. And this
amendment says that the blackberry shall be the official fruit berry of Georgia. Am I the
only person that has this amendment on their desk? No, sir. That was also from the senator
from the 21st, if you want to challenge him, I mean, this isn't a real amendment, is
it?
Yeah.
That's for each and every member to decipher himself.
Thank you, Mr. President.
There are no further questions.
I yield the well and urge your favorable consideration of this extremely important amendment.
All right, the senator is yielding.
Does any other senator wish to speak for against the manager?
Chair, here's none.
Senator from the third.
Would you like to close his debate?
I understand that the duties of the Treasurer are many, and I know that our senator from
the 21st, when he's not senator from the 21st anymore, will be spending all day signing
those dollar bills as they come off the printing press, and counting the gold bars at Fort
Nox and I wonder what other duties that President Trump will be giving to the new
Treasury. And I'm wondering if among those new duties will be the ability to
designate a foreign adversary. Do you know that? That's a question for the senator
from the 21st. You do not know that. Okay. All right. Well, I would suggest that until
such time as President Trump bestows upon his new treasure, the ability to designate for
other countries of concern that we disregard the amendment, but we don't disregard our
love for the senator. I yield the well.
That was a real nice way of saying that, Senator.
That was just sweetest cornbread.
All right, the question is on the amendment number one authored by the senator from 19th.
Is there objection to amendment number one?
I have an objection. All those in favor of amendment number one will vote high. I'll oppose. No secretary in line of the machine.
You
Mr. Treasurer, you remember who those 17 are now.
On the adoption of Amendment No. 1 and the A's are 17 and the NA's are 36 and the field
tripped the fort knocks just got fewer folks on it didn't it all right questions on the
The adoption of the committee's substitute is the adoption of the adoption of the committee's substitute.
Hearing none of the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill?
Chair here is none.
The board of the committee has agreed to.
Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
Chair here is none.
The main question is ordered.
The question is on the passes of the bill.
By substitute, all those in favor of the bill will vote.
Yay, I'll oppose nay.
Secretary, unlock the machine.
Senator from the 27th, what purpose do you rise?
Parliamentary inquiries, President.
Station inquiring.
I know the United States treasurer is an extremely
prestigious position.
Are you aware of the academic requirements
to fulfill such a role?
You know, I'm not sure the requirements.
I know it's a very distinguished group
of Ivy League and economists have hailed those position.
But I would say the senator from the 21st,
It was very, it was very useful when he was at LSU.
He was probably part of that bottom third
that made the top two-thirds possible, you know?
So, so he's always been a team player.
All in the past of the bill, the yeas are 52 and the days are won.
This bill, having received directs of constitutional majority, is therefore passed by substitute.
Secretary reads House bill 586.
House bill 586 by Representative Williamson, the 112th, and others, bill 229 to amend Article
3, Chapter 6, the Title 40, the Fish Code of Georgia, and Tade, which intangible recorded
taxes to revise the notes for which such taxes imposed, were out for procedures to revise
definitions to read for related matters to repeal convolcing laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President and the Senate Committee on Finance recommends that this bill do pass by sub-stuers by place minutes on a house statler chairman
Mr. President and Senate Committee on Finance offers the long substitute to House Bill 586 to build between 10 and 9 to men
Article 3H, Chapter 6 of the Title 48 of the U of S should go to George annotated
We'll need to intangible recording taxes to revise the notes for which such tax is imposed right for procedures to rise the definitions to
provide for late manners to the people
Completing laws and further purposes, Mr. President that completes the order
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is a banking bill and as bet to the best of my knowledge, it has absolutely nothing
to do with the treasure of the United States.
This is, I bring it, House Bill 586.
The purpose of the bill is to redefine the time frame of a long-term note secured by real estate
to more than 62 months for more than 36 months when any principal the note falls due.
By extending this time frame, House Bill 586 extends the period when the intangible recording
tax is not applied to such long.
This is a bank and bill, but it's not four banks.
It's for consumers and it's for small business owners.
Lengthening the definition of a long-term note secured by real estate from 36 to 62 months
will be beneficial to borrowers of residential and commercial loans held with banks of all
sizes.
On the residential side, in particular, banks that serve low-to-moderate income areas
of the state would be better positioned to tailor mortgage products that would benefit
borrowers, especially those who do not qualify for a traditional, conventional 30-year mortgage
loans. The term could be longer than 36 months while retaining the benefit of keeping closing
costs lower since the intangible recording tax would not be applicable. This could help
promote affordable housing. Currently, many banks have 35-month residential loan programs
to keep initial closing costs as low as possible. Longer duration loan would give these homeowners
more time to consider other options when the initial loan matures increasing the likelihood
of housing stability. For small business owners such, those small business owners financing
the purchase of their operating buildings with 35 month loans, would similarly benefit
longer duration loan with lower closing costs, give those borrowers more time to consider
options when the original loan maturers.
And then finally, additionally, Reg Z, Regulation Z, Truth and Lending Act contains requirements
to assure that balloon payment mortgage loans meet certain consumer protection standards.
One of those requirements is that the balloon payment was come due at least five years after
the first payment is due on the mortgage, which obviously would be 61 or 62 months from
the loans' origination.
So 62 month duration is needed in this bill to allow banks to comply with the consumer
protection requirement.
And this federal requirement was established, balloon payment, mortgage loans.
This happened before the intangible recording tax was established.
So I can tell you that in the time that I was a banker, if I had a dime for every time
I did a 35-month loan with a balloon on it, I would be a very rich man.
So I ask favourable consideration, would be glad to answer any questions.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
Does any other senator wish to speak for, I guess, measure?
Is there objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
Previous question is ordered.
The question is on the adoption of the committee's substitute.
Is there objection to the adoption of the committee's substitute?
the committee's substitute is adopted.
Here's their objection to agreeing to the
Board of Committee, which is favorable to the
passes of the bill.
Chair here is an unimportant committee as agreed to.
Questions on the passes of the bill?
My substitute, all those in favor of vote,
yay, I'll pose nay, secretary, and london machine.
You
All the passes to the bill, Yez, are 55. The Nays are won. This bill, him and receive the
requisite constitution. Majority is there for pass by substitute.
Secretary Reed, House bill 645.
Classable 645, Barbara, Senator Lohoodle, 175th and others.
It will be titled next to a men article 17, title 31,
of the official go to Georgia, annotated,
what will be the regulation of hospitals
and the latest institution says to repeal certain provisions
requiring COVID-19 testing of staff members
and long-term care facilities to rifle data matters,
to repeal conflicting laws and further purposes.
Mr. President, standing coming down,
helping you, Mr. Services,
recommends that this bill do pass,
respectfully submit it to Senator Watson and Chairman.
Mr. President, Senator Watson,
for the first, offers the following amendment number one
to amend House Bill 645, replacing line 3 with the following,
we're hiring COVID-19 testing
as you authorize the influence of vaccinations
to provide for by inserting
between lines 11 and 12 of the following.
Cid articles further amend in code section 31-7-18,
we'll add to vaccinations for inch 1-0,
and we'll add items for our placing 50 with 18
and subsection A, second three,
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you, Mr. President, so during the peak of COVID in the spring of 2020, we enacted
legislation that required assisted living, skill nursing facilities to test all the
residents for COVID and all the new hires. And indeed that did save lives. But now according to
I will tell you personally I review all the our weekend care and urgent care in that
blue here recently is far outpaced COVID and as you know COVID is about multiple mutations is
not lethal as it was. It's a matter of fact hospitalization rates from nursing home residents
is three times more likely to have flu a couple months ago during our peak season,
which many of us here had flu.
So that what we're doing in this bill, if you'll look specifically,
we are repealing the testing of residents and staff in long-term care facilities.
And my amendment actually updates the influenza vaccination
that's being offered to discharge on patients in the hospital.
A current guidelines has changed that from age 50 down to age 18 from that standpoint.
So it's not available, it's not offered, and it is offered and not mandated.
With that, Mr. President, I'll be happy to answer any questions.
Yeah, no questions.
Thank you.
Ask for your final consideration.
Does any other senator wish to speak for against measure?
Questions only dops
Yeah, no other centers like speak to the amendment. I mean to the underlying bill

Secretary House bill 582.
House bill 582, where I present the 8th and others, the bill is being denied to amend.
Title 1617 and 24, the push of Georgia annotated, the way to crimes and offenses, criminal procedure
and evidence respectively, so as to provide for defendants
to support adressification defense,
while offering evidence of family violence,
dating grounds, and child abuse committed
by the alleged victim, to provide for a privilege
for participation of victims in our programs
and victim offender dialogues,
to provide for definitions, to provide for limitations,
to provide for civil immunity, for facilities
and circumstances, to provide for a short title,
to provide for a later matter,
for a physical and looking laws,
and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Judiciary
recommends that this bill do pass by a sub-sue,
or slightly submitted, Senator Strickland Chairman.
Mr. President of the St. Camino and Judiciary Office,
along substitute to House Bill 582,
builds a mental act to amend Title 1617 and 24,
the OCGA, what you crimes and offenses,
criminal procedure, and evidence respect lose
that's required for dependence
to support justification defense,
while offering evidence of family violence,
daily violence, or trial abuse committed
by the alleged victim and for other purposes.
Mr. President of the St. Camino and the 42nd,
others offered the following amendment number one
to amend the Sunday Committee on Judiciary
substitute to House Bill 582,
while replacing lines one and two with the following,
to amend Title 1617, 24 and 45,
the official Georgia Ant Aid,
what you crimes and offenses,
criminal procedure, evidence,
and public officers and employees respectively,
so as to provide for defendants,
by inserting before and for other purposes,
Mr. President, they complete the order.
We're going to send it from the 50th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today to bring you a more serious matter than we've had in the last couple of bills.
I know we've had some fun today.
But if you would just give me your attention, this is called the Georgia Survivor Justice
Act.
And as most of you know, in the state of Georgia, according to the CDC, one in four women
will experience physical abuse from their intimate partner at some time, at some time
during their lifetime.
As the father of four daughters, that hits pretty close to home.
What House Bill 582 does is it gives those who are victims a second chance, those who
of our victims who have been found guilty of another crime, a second chance.
Between 74 and 95 percent women who are incarcerated have experienced domestic violence or sexual
violence.
House Bill 582 would prevent survivors from serving long sentences for conduct needed for
their own survival.
House Bill 582 would allow Georgia's criminal law to catch up with society's modern understanding
of domestic violence dynamics, it would enable the criminal justice system to better consider
the circumstances and contacts of the defendant survivors by doing the following.
Section 2 would recognize self-defense.
Traditional self-defense requires an immediate threat of death or serious injury.
However, for victims of domestic violence, when violence in the threat of violence has
has been constant or has been escalated over time.
Assess risk is based on a history of abuse.
Section two of HP 582 allows survivors the ability
to present self-defense by offering
the full context of an abusive history.
Section three acknowledges coercion.
Coercive control is a power and control dynamic.
Abusers use against their victims.
For victims of domestic violence,
The ongoing threat of harm, terror, and manipulation can lead to them being coerced into actions
against their will, dynamics not currently considered under Georgia law.
Section 4 creates a path for survivors in prison.
Many survivors are currently in prison for taking actions needed for their survival.
This section provides them with a mechanism to request resinnancing under our evolved
understanding of domestic violence. Section 5 deals with proportionate
synancing for survivors. Even in cases where a conviction is imposed,
mitigating factors, paying a fuller picture for synancing. Current law has not
been adequate in ensuring survivors do not receive overly harsh synances for
conduct in which abuse was a significant contributing factor to their
And lastly, Section 6 and 7 enable victim-centered programs.
Crime survivors regularly report needing a diverse set of tools to address and repair harm.
Enabling victim-centered programs will respond to this need while helping survivors heal.
This is a good bill.
It prevents those who have been accused of a crime from having to serve sentences when
And they were faced with the decision of whether to protect themselves or commit a crime,
whether to stand up to their abusers or commit a crime.
And when someone makes those choices, I don't think they should be punished as harshly.
And at least they should have the opportunity to paint the full picture.
With that, Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions concerning this bill.
You have no questions.
Thank you, Mr. President.
There is an amendment, and I consider it a friendly amendment.
The author and the house considers it a friendly amendment,
and I think my friend from the 42nd will be talking about that too.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Senator.
We're going to have a senator from the 42nd to speak to his amendment.
Thank you Mr. President.
Amendment one is actually what was House Bill 384
that passed unanimously in the House,
was unanimous in a senate judiciary committee
sticking on the floor today.
But it's an important bill, and as you'll see,
it clarifies the fact that no public officer,
and in particular, including peace officers,
can be prosecuted for violating the oath of office,
unless there's underlying crime they committed
that's a high-negribated misdemeanor or a felony.
That's important because you look at the existing law,
the punishment for someone being prosecuted
about in the north of office rises at that level from one to five.
And so we have a little hole in the law.
We need to clarify here to make certain that
someone's going to be prosecuted that's a law enforcement
officer or any other public officer that there actually
is an underlying offense they committed at the same time.
It also in section nine, well, the way they're
mimicking section nine of the bill will include the park
that standardizes what the oath is for our peace officers
as well.
It comes with requests for a law enforcement community.
I can answer any questions.
Thank you.
Is any other senator would speak for or against the measure?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
Questions on the adoption of amendment number one,
authored by the senator from the 42nd.
Is there objection to amendment number one?
as amended, Mr. Thank you.
Without objection in amendment number one is adopted.
The question is on the adoption of the committee on the
subc remotely as amended is there is an assumption of the
committee substitute as amended, he is none the committee
substitute as amended as adopt it.
Is the objection
to agree to
and to agree to which is favorable if the pass to the bill...
Chair has none.
on the past of the bill, all those in favor vote, yay.
All opposed, nay, secretary, I'm not the machine.
You
All the patches of the bill, the A's are 53 of the NA, it's one.
This bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed by substitute.
Secretary House bill 567.
House bill 567.
We're going to send them to you.
The 13th and others.
The bill is being sent to Man Article 2, Chapter 11, Title 43, the official go to Georgia
Anti-Aid.
We're going to licenses for the practice of dentistry, so as to authorize and regulate
tele dentistry by licensing dentists in the state, to record definitions for exemptions
and conditions to write for authorized practices to provide for dentists, to write for ownership
of documents, to write for a limited number of dental hygienists to perform teledoms
to treat or certain conditions, to write for rules and regulations to amend Article 1
of Chapter 24, Title 33, the official code of the Georgia Ant Aid.
Only two general provisions of insurance, so I'll allow for coverage of dental services
provided through teledoms to treat, to write for a lay to manage, to write for effective
dates for real public and lots, and for other purposes, Mr. President of the St.
Qway and the Health and Human Services recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute
certainly submitted, Senator Watson-Chairman.
Mr. President, the same committee and health and human
services are responding substitute to House Bill of
House degrees 7, to be able to maintain an act to amend
Article 2, Chapter 11, Title 43, those
that you are able to license for the practice of
dentistry, so as to authorize and regulate
tele dentistry, by instance, dentists in this state.
It's a right for definitions and for the purposes,
Mr. President, I complete the order.
We're going to add a center from the 48.
Thank you, Mr. President and colleagues, I bring you House Bill 567, all of the dentistry.
You may recall this bill from last year, it passed this chamber, it passed the House,
But unfortunately, it had a billing error that caused our
wonderful governor to have to veto it.
So we've made a couple of minor changes.
And I think everybody's on board.
HP 5607 will authorize and regulate the practice of
teledenistry by Georgia License Dennis and Hyde Dennis.
Via the Georgia Board of Dentistry to ensure patient safety
remains the priority.
While maintaining a continuous standard of care and
sustaining the Georgia License Dennis is the leader of
the oral health care team.
It allows patients without a dental home
to establish care with a dental provider
in order to receive a consultation
and direct appropriate care.
It allows dentists to use teledenistry
to use hygienists to perform specific hygiene functions,
permitted under general supervision and accordance
with existing law.
It requires the patient dentists both be physically located
in Georgia with the dentists verifying
the patient's location, identity,
in obtaining patient consent.
What it does not do, it does not create unreasonable scope
expansions, it does not replace the need for in-person
dental exams and procedures.
It does not require patients to sign waivers
releasing provider supply ability in any time.
It does not change what is currently allowed
under any part of the general supervision code.
It does not negatively impact oral health care,
currently allowed in Title I schools,
preschools, long-term care facilities and nursing homes,
and it does not mandate insurance coverage
of teledenistry.
That was the key from last year.
It's a pretty simple straightforward bill.
Most of you have seen this before.
Happy answering questions.
I ask your federal consideration for HB 567.
I yield the one.
Does any of the senator wish to speak?
Or I guess the measure.
Is there a Jackson previous question being ordered?
Chair has not a previous question as a word.
Question is on the adoption of the committee.
Substitute is there objection to adoption of the committee?
Substitute.
Hearing none of the committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there objection to agreeing to the 40 committee,
which is favorable to the passes of the bill?
Chair, here's none of the important committee is agreed to.
Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
Chair, here's none of the main question is ordered.
Question is on the passes of the bill.
My substitute, all those in favor of the bill will vote.
Yay.
Opposed, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not in the machine.

All in the passage of the bill, the A's are 52 and the A's are 1, this bill hasn't received
a rickston.
Constitution Majority is there for pass by safety.
Secretary Reed, House Bill 36.
House Bill 36.
With the V6, 5% of the lever at the 123rd and others, we will turn on the act to amend the file 29 of those DGA by 2 Guardian Awards as the revised list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult, the modification and termination of such guardianship and the appointment of emergency guardian to revise the list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for appointment of a conveyor for an adult to the modification and the termination of such conveyor ship and the appointment of the emergency conservator to provide for limitations of the powers and defeats
of certain emergency conservators to arise and provide for definitions to
arrive for later matters to build and looking laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President of the St.
Committee on Judiciary recommends that this bill do pass by substitute
type of its minutes in a Strickland chairman.
Mr. President of the St.
Committee on Judiciary Office of Law and Substitute to House Bill 36,
the bill to maintain an act to amend Title 29 of the CJA,
which regarding the award test provides the list of providers that were authorized
to participate in the processes for appointment of a guardian for an adult,
the modification and termination of such guardianship and the appointment of an emergency guardian
to rise the list of providers who are authorized to participate in the processes for the appointment of a conservative for an adult and for other purposes.
Mr. President, Senator Eccles of 49th and other drop of the following amendment number one to amend House Bill 86 by deleting marriage and family therapists or each time it occurs by deleting marriage and therapy therapists, each time it occurs.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
We're going to sit in front of the first.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I bring you House Bill 36.
This is originally brought by the probate court judges and the House represented to basically
because of the logjam or delays that they're experiencing when it comes to appointing
a guardian or a conservative ship.
So they wanted to expand the folks who can do this related to that.
The currently only physician psychologist and licensed clinical social workers are
authorized to do the evaluation and this is on folks with developmental disabilities.
So it adds physician's assistance nurse practitioners and clinical nurse
specialists with special training in psychiatric and mental health. Marriage
of family therapists and professional counselors but in agreement with the
probate judges and with the author in the house you'll see the amendment that
that the senator from the 49th who's well versed in developmental disability issues, removes
and strikes and deletes marriage and family therapist.
So that is an amendment that certainly I'm in agreement with that he sponsored and I
signed it and the author is in the house as an agreement with it and the probate judges
are in agreement with it.
So basically for an evaluation to perform this evaluation, this will be for PAs, Physicians
Assistance, Nurse Bright Testors, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Psychiatric Mental Health,
and Licensed Professional Counselors, and all those with training, their training includes
developmental disability.
But let me just say that you'll see in Section 12 of the bill that an adult should not
be presumed to be in need of a conservative solely based on the findings of
adult one or more developmental disabilities as defined in the paragraph so
that is will not be any of the criteria for those with developmental
disabilities when it comes to hearing towards our conservative issue and that's
what it does. Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions thank you
to ask for your favourable consideration.
Does any other senator wish to speak for against measure?
Here's none is there objection to the previous question being ordered

Secretary House Bill 148.
House Bill 148, Representative Carson, the 46th and others, bill is being counted like
to mention.
Chapter 3, title 43.
The official got to Georgia annotated with two accounts, and so as the revised provisions
related to education experience requirements
of certified public accountants.
To revise provisions related to licensure,
affirmous practicing public accountancy.
To revise provisions related to reciprocity,
to conform terminology to a men article one
on chapter 81 on title 36 of the official Georgia entity,
related to local government budget and audit.
So it's to conform a cross reverence
to the right related matters.
Right from the back to date,
you'll be able to be looking at laws
and for other purposes.
Most of the President of the Senate
can land right in the streets and utilities.
Recommends that this bill do pass
respectfully, it's minutes in our councillor chairman.
Second, please do it from Mr. President.
I recognize the senator from the fourth.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I would first of all get into this bill.
I'd like to thank some people that
works so hard on this bill.
And that's Vice President of Legislative Fears,
Don Cook, Board, Search, who is the Executive Director
of Georgia Science CPAs, and Miss Catherine Flescher,
who is the current Chairman of the Board
of Georgia Science CPA.
This provides a new pathways for people
to receive their CPA license.
And just like all other professions that I know of
and I talked to, we all have shortage of qualified people
in our profession.
And this provides two other pathways
in addition to what we have now.
So Georgia currently has a structure that has been in place
since 1998, but President does not meet the needs
of our profession.
Currently, the Georgia Public Accounting Act
requires CPA candidates, sorry, currently Georgia Public
Accounting Act requires CPA candidates to pass all parts
to CPA exam, to bleed 150 hours of credit hours,
qualify an education, and gain one year
of relevant work experience before becoming
life of CPA. This house bill does not change that at all. In fact, it has two more ways to it.
But this is an attempt to address the profession's demands and some of the challenges in getting
to life. House bill 148 proposes to add two other ways to become a Georgia life of CPA,
as well as establish and practice privilege requirements for out of state CPAs to practice
in Georgia. So let's talk about the pathways that pathways all three of them existed in two
So under this bill beginning January 1, 2026, the Georgia State Board of
County will be able to license a person to the CPA, first one is what we already
have, completes 150 credit hours of qualifying education, has at least one year of
real-world work experience and passes the CPA exam. Number two, and that's why I
failed under, I was licensed under, I had a bachelor degree with the
I had to leave two years of experience and I had to pass the CP exam and it did take me
five times to pass them.
Also the third measure is that you have a master's degree with emphasis in accounting
as established by a state board and it leaves one year experience and pass the CP exam.
So this is loud enough to go for one way to become a CPA to actually three ways and
And in no way does it diminish our credibility of our profession.
In many places, our profession is held esteem among all other professions.
So these pathways are being looked at by many other states.
So let me just tell you in conclusion, House Bill 148 provides Georgia with two new routes
to the CPI-Losher as well as practice privilege requirements that will make it more efficient
We're all out of state CPAs to provide audit services in Georgia.
This bill is backed by the Georgia Society of CPAs,
Georgia State Board of Accountancy, and the National County Plurms.
This bill passed a house 172-0 and passed the Senate Committee 8-0.
Mr. President, I yield a will.
Does any of the Senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Is there objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair here is not in previous question as ordered.
Is there objection to agreeing to the committee report of the committee,
which is favor to the passes of the bill?
Chair here is not in before the committee is agreed to.
Is there objection to the main question being ordered?
Chair here's none and the main question is ordered.
Question is on the passes of the bill,
all those in favor vote gay or pose day,
sector and lot of machine.
You
On the passes of the bill, yeas are 52, nays are zero.
This bill has received requisite constitutional majority zero for a pass.
Mr. President, I move the Senate table, the remaining legislation on the Senate rules calendar.
All right, it's objection, out objection, they are tabled.
All right, so what we're going to do, we're going to, we're going to stand at ease for dinner.
Another pro chance got dinner for the chamber and everything.
So we're going to, we're going to stand at ease.
It's in the secretary's break room is where the dinner will be.
And we'll try to reconvene by 72730, I guess.
I was trying to get us out of here, y'all.
I was trying to get us out of here, but they overruled me.
All right, everybody go have dinner.
Enjoy it with Cennetees.
