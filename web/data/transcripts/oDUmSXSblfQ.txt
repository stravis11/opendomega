appreciative for y'all making the Trek
up here hopefully the traffic wasn't too
bad I think you're normally going the
right way with traffic coming up here
but um we've got a a number of speakers
today and what this uh study committee
is going to do is we'll first start off
with this meeting kind of taking a broad
approach identifying some issues that
we're seeing across the state in rural
areas and um I guess trying to pinpoint
things that this committee believes the
state can help with and then as we move
forward we'll take a more
surgical approach no pun intended with
some issues that we identify that we're
particularly interested in I know we
have set our second meeting for October
24th at Medical College of Georgia I
want to thank Megan brass for helping us
with that and then we'll have a third
meeting in
November or December we're looking at
some availability with the committee
members but
um
I will before we turn it over to our
speakers I just want to give the
committee members a chance to introduce
yourself so we'll start
down here with Senator Kirkpatrick hi
I'm Kay Kirkpatrick Senate District 32
which is common Cherokee counties I'm a
retired orthopedic surgeon and vice
chair of the health committee
hi I'm Kim Jackson I represent District
41 which is in Dekalb in Gwinnett
counties and I am really glad to be on
here I also serve on HHS as well
good morning good to be with you I'm Nan
orok uh in the Senate from representing
voters in Atlanta and the Tri-Cities
area hateville East Point College Park
and I've served on the health committee
in the house for decades and now I've
been on the health committee in the in
the senate for decades
we've got important issues facing us I
really appreciate our chairs leadership
on convening this effort
thank you
good morning again Larry Walker I
represent Senate District 20 I live in
Houston County but represent eight
counties across Middle Georgia uh chair
of the Senate Insurance committee
insurance and labor I'm also on the
Senate Health and Human Services
committee and glad to be with you all
this morning
all right thank you very much
um
today we're going to kick it off with a
former colleague of ours Dean Burke uh
with DCH
Dean if you want to come up and there's
a microphone right there and we've got a
list of speakers here today we'll open
it up to public comment at later
meetings but uh
Dean we'll turn it over to you good
morning thank you for having us here uh
first off I appreciate the opportunity
to speak I want to give you greeting
from our brand new commissioner Russell
Carlson and Russell lepin taking on that
role uh
gave me the the uh honor of uh
overseeing the our office of rural
Health out of cordial and those are the
folks that are going to be presenting
here today I'm going to let Brandi
introduce them but chairman Hatchett
gave me the permission to get off Target
for just a minute to just make an
announcement there's several people in
this room that are on my list to call
and remind there's a process called
revalidation that it that the state has
to do for anybody that's a Medicaid
provider and revalidation basically
means you're telling CMS and the state
that you still want to participate in
the Medicaid Program and that you
haven't committed a felony since the the
last time you were validating that
you're still eligible to be a Medicaid
provider and and it's a just one of
those nuisance things if you're a
physician working in a hospital and
we've got a few around here
you're Dan somewhere there he is uh you
know even though we've been in the same
place for for 30 years every three years
we have to fill out paperwork and remind
people that we still want to participate
in in the in the hospital
world and sign all of those affidavits
saying that you're you're still eligible
to be a hospital member so it's not not
an unusual process but
as of the first of August there were
still 70 000 providers in Georgia that
had not done their revalidation so some
of those are multiple practice sites so
each site has to be revalidated on its
own you can't do it one time
and we just want to remind everybody
that deadline is September 15th and if
you don't revalidate and you Bill
Medicaid that claim will be denied so
you know there is a financial
cost to this if you don't take that 15
minutes to go in the system and and
revalidate so just wanted to anybody
that has contacts in that provider World
make sure you get the word out that that
needs to be accomplished in that the the
deadlines quickly approaching so
um but go into the to the subject matter
of today uh obviously you know my career
uh in in medical practice was in rural
part of Georgia and then my service in
the Senate that was always a primary
passion of mine and so this subject
matters dear to my heart and I I really
do appreciate your taking on this this
uh very very challenging uh role this is
not a simple solution uh Workforce
issues are broad around the country in
all Fields but obviously in health care
it's got particular ramifications that
maybe others don't so thank you all for
that and with that I'm going to
introduce Brandy our government
relations director and let her introduce
our speakers
see their presentation even okay
thank you Dr Burke thank you chairman
Hatchett members of the committee as Dr
Burke said my name is Brandi Sylvan I
serve as the government the government
relations director at the Department of
Community Health we certainly appreciate
you guys taking some time to dive into
this topic it's an issue that we hear
from our providers and our members on a
consistent basis as being a challenge
as you were all familiar Governor Kemp
you know kind of emphasized his priority
prioritization of this topic when he
established the healthcare Workforce
Commission last year
our DCH commissioner at the time Kaylee
noggles served as the chair of that
committee Anita will talk a little bit
about some of the recommendations that
came out of that Commission
so Anita Hamm is serves as our senior
director over at the State Office of
rural Health uh the the government the
federal government requires that every
state have a State Office of rural
health so ours is in Cordele Georgia
and a needle will give you a little bit
of an overview about that office as well
in their role thank you for having us
and we'll be happy to answer any
questions you have afterwards
thank you thank you I'm so happy to be
here to be able to present information
to you from the perspective of the State
Office of rural health so I just wanted
to give you a little bit of information
about our office
we are the State Office of rural Health
which is a division of the Department of
Community Health and as Brandi mentioned
this is a requirement of the federal we
were funded by a federal program there's
a State Office of rural Health in all 50
states and our office was established in
2000 and as she mentioned we are
positioned appropriately in cordial
which is in rural Crisp County we have
four program sections in the soar office
that's the primary care office the
farmworker health program Hospital
services and the soar program we're a
small office we're a staff of of 10
people and we manage six hersa grants
for which DCH and soar are actually the
grantee and we those grants provide
funding for the office management and
for salaries for our staff and for other
programs okay but our overarching
responsibility at the soar office is to
effectively and efficiently administer
Federal and state-funded Grant programs
that are intended to increase access to
Quality Health Care improve the quality
of health services and promote the
health and well-being of our rural
residents and so our funding every year
fluctuates a little bit but in fiscal
year 23 we actually managed a little
over 27 million dollars in our office
for Grant funded programs and you can
see that it's broken down into a little
over 9 million of federal dollars and we
had about 17.7 and some change in State
dollars and we're quite a busy little
group I did a account of the active
grants we had as we actually went into
fiscal year 24 and as a July 21st we had
76 active grants and 18 active contracts
that were distributed between and
managed among our four program sections
so just to give you a little uh history
about or a little visual rather on Rural
Georgia and this is one of my favorite
Maps because it's a great visual that
actually shows just exactly how rural
Georgia is so as you know we have 159
counties and 120 of those are defined as
rural having a population of less than
50 000 but out of all the people that
lived in Georgia there's only about 26
percent of Georgia residents that live
outside of our Urban centers and every
year our rural populations continue to
decline however we have a higher uh
death rates and death rates for heart
disease and stroke and cancer in motor
vehicle accidents and certainly an
increased prevalence of chronic
conditions so this is my second favorite
map which gives you a little visual on
our rural hospitals so in our 120 rural
counties we actually have 67 small Rural
and critical access hospitals and those
are broken down into 37 rural PPS
hospitals and 30 critical access
Hospitals now one of those critical
access hospitals actually does reside in
a county that's not defined as rural
that's Effingham County and it has a
population greater than 50 000 but we
still include that hospital because of
its cost status now this map also shows
that we have 54 counties that do not
have hospitals at all so I realize the
map's a little bit busy but our rural
hospitals are identified in green and
purple and then the counties with the
red X have no hospital and the reason I
wanted to point this out is because we
have clusters of counties that have no
hospital anywhere in sight so if you
notice toward the
the Western sort of central area you can
see large clusters of counties with no
hospitals and then in the bottom of the
state in the in the uh Southwestern
quadrant there we have a rural Hospital
in every County so having clusters with
no County no hospitals and clusters of
counties with a hospital in every County
actually creates its own challenges for
both Workforce and Health Care access
so just to to talk a little bit about
the workforce as Brandi mentioned I'm
going to lean in a little bit into the
report that was provided by the
workforce commission and as she
mentioned this was a established the
commission was established last year by
Governor Kemp there were 15 members and
it was chaired by our former
commissioner Kaylee noggle so I believe
they met each month from July through
December working on this report and what
I'm actually going to focus on and refer
back to from time to time is the part of
the report that's actually the
commission recommendations so as I get
ready to talk about that I do want to
tell you a little bit more about what
the soar office does already to address
Workforce issues so as I mentioned one
of our offices is the primary care
office and I actually have the director
of the primary care office came with me
Beth Walker is in the back of the room
and in the handouts that we've provided
there's a lot more information about
what they do they actually have a lot of
responsibility in the PCO office and I'm
just going to hit on a few things that
they manage but one of the things that
the PCO office is responsible for is
help professional shortage area
designations a few other things they
deal with is the National Health Service
Corps program the hersa Georgia state
loan repayment program they manage the
Conrad 30 J-1 Visa waiver program and
then the PCO the soar PCO is actually
the designated State administrator for
the 3rnet program which is the rural
Recruitment and Retention Network
so just to give you a little bit of
information about hipsa or health
professional shortage areas so the
definition by hersa is a shortage of
primary care mental health and dental
health providers in a geographic area
population group or facility and their
specific criteria scoring criteria in
which they calculate these scores and
the scoring criteria includes population
to provide a ratio the percentage of
population that it's a hundred percent
poverty level infant Health index based
on infant mortality rate and low birth
rates and then travel time to the
nearest source of care so just to give
you a quick look at one of our Maps this
is actually the hipsa score for Rural
primary care and this map is rural
specific it's awfully colorful but if
you'll notice uh sort of focus on the
tan and the yellow areas so scoring is
required by hersa every three years and
it's the responsibility of our office to
update those hipsa scores every three
years the higher the score the higher
the need so this map actually indicates
that 88 of our 120 rural counties
actually scored in the high levels
between 15 and 25. so you may Wonder
well what's the purpose of the hipsa
scores why is that so relevant but those
scores are actually the nucleus of all
of these uh Federal programs so some of
them I've already mentioned and I'll
speak to just in a minute J-1 visa and
the National Health Service Corps but
it's also
the hips of score is or the Medicare
bonus incentive program is dependent on
the hips of score as well as the federal
qualified Health Centers and Rural
health clinics so one of the programs
that we manage that I just referenced
I'll just speak to quickly and that's
National Health Service Corps and this
program is really focused on Recruitment
and Retention so I've divided it into
those two sections to kind of explain
this map but specific to recruitment if
a site in the state wants to become
approved an approved National Health
Service course site they work with Beth
in our office to complete the
applications and she makes sure that
they're complete and then they submit
them for approval and when they're
approved this actually becomes a
marketing tool for that site because the
other half of this nhsc program are loan
repayments and scholarship programs and
if a provider applies for those and is
successful in getting loan repayment for
instance then they have to commit to one
of those approved sites and they have to
practice in that site for at least two
years and so what's great about nhsc is
they have to commit minimum of two years
but they can commit a little longer to
continue that loan repayment program but
what the data coming out of nhsc says
that if they stay in that area for two
years or longer you're looking at
retention rates of those providers of 80
to 85 percent so that's really important
to to look at another program that we're
managing which is also loan repayment is
a new program it's a hersa program that
is a state-specific loan repayment
program RAM and the providers that are
eligible for this of course are
Physicians advanced practice providers
licensed clinical social workers and
professional counselors as well as
registered nurses now this is not rural
specific but
um
uh if they apply for those loan
repayment programs then they have to
commit to a particular practice location
so the practice location for those are
federally qualified Health Centers rural
health clinics critical access hospitals
and then private practices now this is
new this program hasn't fleshed out as
much as some of our others so we don't
have a lot of participation yet in that
program we only have nine rural counties
in which we have some of those loan
repayment participants and then four
counties in which we have participants
are Urban
another program that we manage is the
Conrad 30 J1 Visa waiver program this
program actually allows International
medical school graduates who are here in
our country on J-1 visa to to waive
their two-year home requirement for
three years of service in the country in
in the states So currently in Georgia we
have 90 Physicians that are
participating in the J-1 Visa waiver
program unfortunately only 18 of those
Physicians are primary care the other 72
are Specialists and I say unfortunately
because we typically don't attract a lot
of Specialists into the rural
communities so we have 19 counties in
which these 90 Physicians are hosted and
again the majority of them are
Specialists so they are located more in
the urban areas than in the rural
counties
now our office offers a lot more than
just loan repayment and and uh
scholarship programs we actually have as
I mentioned when we started FY 24 we had
76 active grants and those grants if we
were to look at all of those grants and
kind of divide them into buckets we
support our rural Health Care basically
in these six ways so some of those
programs are dedicated to financial and
operational Improvement which is
certainly beneficial for our health care
facilities quality improvement
initiatives continuing education
initiatives service line expansion for
Hospitals and Clinics telemedicine
programs and addition of primary care
clinics in rural areas all of which are
very important and the column on the
right basis basically is some examples
of those programs that fit into one of
those six buckets so we have Revenue
integrity and solutions programs Wing
bed management program patient-centered
medical homes we also fund the area
health education center which is really
the Statewide wide pipeline for getting
folks out of interested in Healthcare
careers as they're in middle school and
high school and then we have some unique
programs like the electronic Intensive
Care Program in which we have
rural hospital icus that are directly
connected through
electronic means with Emory University
and have access immediately with
Critical Care Specialists so we're
really proud of all of our programs and
there's one more program that I want to
mention and that is our rural Hospital
stabilization grant program and I want
to bring this up not so much to talk
about the program but to talk about a
lot of the information that we get from
our hospitals who are participating in
this program so just to give you a
little back story on the program it's a
legislatively directive program that we
started in fiscal year
2016. we're actually in our eighth year
of funding and to date we've had 35
rural hospitals that have participated
in the program so that's a little over
half of all of our rural hospitals that
have been involved in the stabilization
program and some of our hospitals have
actually participated multiple years
so far we've invested a little more than
45 million dollars in that program and
those Hospital leaderships many of them
will tell you that that funding during
that funding period actually made the
difference between the hospital being
able to stay open so we're very proud of
that program and currently the
participants in the program grantees are
selected through a standardized
application process and one thing I want
to mention about that program is that it
has very specific goals objectives and
guidelines so as the hospitals submit
their applications for the program
before those grants are executed they
present their proposals their use of
funds proposals to our office we review
what they're proposing to ensure that
they meet those guidelines and uh and
then during the funding period which is
typically about one year per funding
cycle there is a lot of technical
assistance in interaction with those
hospitals so they are all brought
together at the beginning when the
grants are executed I uh meet with the
project managers every quarter I provide
a huge amount of technical assistance
individually to those hospitals
throughout the funding period and then
at the end of the funding period we
bring them all back together and they
get to present their uh projects to each
other and talk about some of those
successes as well as challenges and
share some of the things that worked for
them so that other hospitals can
consider some of those initiatives
themselves so I bring this up because I
wanted to mention some of the benefits
that we have found not so much about the
funding itself but about some of the
things this program has taught us so the
benefit to the grantee is that we
recognize the uniqueness of each rural
community and if I've learned nothing in
the 10 years that I have been at the
State Office of rural health is that no
two communities are alike they may be
very similar through demographics or in
their geographical location patient but
they're all very very different and
solutions to their problems are usually
very individualized also one of the
other requirements for this grant
program is that they are required to
have Community engagement in order to
take the funds they have to engage their
communities in the early years of the
program it was a little bit
uncomfortable because our hospitals were
very used to working in silos but once
they were required to get out into their
community and to re-establish
relationships and sometimes repair some
some reputations and actually get
involved with the community and let the
community have a voice in how those
funds are used the the difference has
been enormous and many of our hospitals
say that that particular piece of this
program the community engagement and the
reconnection with their communities has
really been very very successful
Hospital leaders one of the other things
that this program has proven is the
hospital leadership really is best to
determine the prioritization in the
direction of their funding based on
their individual needs so again when
they apply for the program they have to
provide us with data and stats and they
have to explain to us what internal
resources they use to make the decision
on how they wanted to use their funding
so we actually have a little Glimpse as
to what their decision-making process is
but we leave a lot of those decisions up
to the hospital of how best those funds
would be used now the benefit to our
office in the last eight years during
this program has been enormous because
what we have done through this program
has established some really really
strong relationships with these
hospitals and their communities so we
have gotten to see the struggles and to
see their needs through their eyes by
being so connected with them through
this program
it also has engaged our staff in rural
Health Care problem identification and
recognition and it encourages a very
forward-thinking solutions-based
approach to new initiatives that may be
offered through our office especially
when we have new funding and we can look
at what those hospitals need and direct
those fund that funding into appropriate
ways so it really helps keep us in the
know
foreign
a couple of things I wanted to mention
about two meetings that I've had with
our hospitals over the last couple of
years in May of 2022 we were ending we
were getting close to the end of what I
refer to as phase six the sixth cohort
of grantees that we had in the program
and that year was unique because we had
the largest number of hospitals
participating in the program to date we
actually had 16 hospitals participating
and you can they're identified on the
map so you can see we had a good
scattering of hospitals across the state
north to south and as we were getting
ready to bring them back together we
thought we've got a really unique
opportunity here because we've got
almost a quarter of all of our rural
hospitals participating in this phase so
when we bring them back together we can
really do a deep dive and collect a lot
of information from those Hospital
leaders as we bring them into a very
intense two-day workshop locking the
doors so they couldn't leave and we
could take make the best use of of their
time time so we decided this would be
great opportunity for us to offer a very
detailed survey as well as break them
into small groups and Mercer staff as
well as drafted and Tucker accounting
firm worked with us to develop the
workshop so we partnered with Mercer to
design our survey and they also ensured
that it was valid survey there was a
total of 127 questions that were divided
between 12 categories and the number of
questions per category ranged from 4 to
32 they were presented randomly so we
were not driving anyone's
responses in any direction presented in
a likert scale and it was all real time
so as they sat there for a hundred and
twenty seven survey questions they were
able to see the questions as a group and
then respond to the questions as a group
and see where their responses fell so we
had about 45 leaders that were all in
the room at the same time CEO CFOs cnos
project Managers from representing those
16 house hospitals and what we really
wanted to know at the end of that the
survey and through those small group
discussions is what are the top five
things that our rural Hospital needs and
so from their mouths to you these are
what they said were their priorities and
their challenges for the uh for these
rural hospitals so number one is just
cash cash flow cash on hand cash
reserves it was just cash and then the
next three bullet points are all focused
on Staffing so it was finding them and
keeping them and keeping the costs down
because in 22 we were coming off the
heels of covid and so many of our
hospitals were financially stressed
during that period just trying to pay
the high costs of Staffing services so
um and then at the the fifth bullet
point there is keeping and increasing
their market share because that's what's
important to those rural communities
that's why the community engagement
piece was so important you want to keep
those rural residents come coming to
their local hospitals for their care and
prevent the out migration where they're
going two or three counties over so we
wanted to make sure that they have the
money to keep their doors open and that
they have the staff to serve their
patients because they certainly want to
make sure that their communities are
using their Hospitals now in July of
2023 not too long ago we brought in the
seventh group of 10 different hospitals
and we basically had the same response
the only difference for that group is
that those hospitals during 2023 had
begun to wean themselves off of those
high-cost Staffing Services they were
beginning to get a little bit stable in
that respect but that was still weaning
off of those high cost Services was
still as a result of very very
aggressive Recruitment and Retention
efforts so that's what the hospitals
have brought up to us and certainly
recruitment is one of the Recruitment
and Retention is one of their big issues
so now I'm going to lean back against
the Workforce Commission
document a couple of things that I had
found in that document that I thought
was very interesting George's growing
demands for health care services are
primarily driven by overall population
growth but remember that's not the case
in our rural areas because that
populations in the rural areas are
declining every year and then the Aging
population so residents over uh the age
of 65 are growing faster in Georgia than
in any other state and certainly the
large majority of our residents in rural
areas are greater than 65 and then of
course this leads to the increase of
disease burden which certainly speaks to
the need for higher engagement of those
Health Care Professionals a couple of
other interesting things that were
pointed out in the workforce is that the
workforce itself is trained largely by
public and private post-secondary
institutions and 50 percent of our
health care are actually being trained
of the healthcare graduates are actually
coming out of 20 institutions enjoy
Georgia only retains a little more than
half of those Health Care graduates so
we're losing 3.7 workers each year by
not that are not replaced by those
graduates so when you look at the
information that's provided in that
Workforce report and then you go back to
the information that we're collecting
from our hospitals as they sit with us
around the table and talk about their
struggles one of the things we talked
about is their current Workforce status
so these are the folks that are
currently working for them two things
one is that that Workforce does want
market analysis salary adjustments and
competitive hourly rates they see the
Recruitment and recruitment efforts to
bring in new staff with
sign-on bonuses and all of the dollars
that they're throwing at getting new
staff and so you've got your loyal staff
that are sitting there saying what about
us we want fair market rates and we want
retention bonuses we stuck with you
through kovid so we want to be rewarded
in that some some way so again in trying
to balance that out it's causing
Financial stress on the hospitals and
there's still the coast povid postcovid
burnout
we were never at fully staffed in
especially in our rural areas prior to
covid but certainly after covid those
Staffing struggles have continued to
increase and the workloads are intense
there's just the physical and emotional
toll because everybody's just very tired
and another interesting point to make is
that 20 percent of our current Workforce
are greater than 55 years old so even if
they stick with their jobs in those
rural hospitals until they decide to
retire we're going to lose a lot of
folks just from through retirement now
when we talk about the younger Workforce
and that was definitely a popular
conversation in our Hospital meetings
because the younger Workforce is very is
motivated very differently than my
generation and they are more interested
in the highest hour relate hourly rate
possible and not so much interested in
benefits packages and they're not
usually coming to work for you because
they're looking forward to that
retirement dinner in the gold watch so
they're not going to stick around nearly
as long as they used to our hospitals
tell us that they feel very fortunate if
they get a new uh incoming employee that
stays with them for a couple of years
which may mean at some point in the near
future we need to redefine our
definition of retention and start
working toward new retention initiatives
with a different expectation so they're
also very very interested in flexible
schedules they really focus more on
their work like work life balance so
they're very interested in kind of
tailor-made schedules that we'll work
with their personal lives and they are
interested in continuing education so
they're very much want to expand their
fund of knowledge and skill set but keep
in mind continuing education provided to
them makes them much more appealing when
they decide to go look for another job
at another Hospital
so they did tell us though that employee
satisfaction is not always about
salaries that definitely some of the
information they've gotten back during
satisfaction surveys and in talking with
their staff is that the quality of
supervision and management is extremely
important and they really want updated
facilities and Equipment they want to
feel like they work for a facility that
has uh that is equal to those larger
hospitals in the urban areas so they
love having updated facilities and
Equipment Cutting Edge
environment they want positive
environments to work in comfortable
break areas and for those that are
planning to stick around for a while
they're also seeking promotion
opportunities within the hospital and
again flexible schedules is very
important to them so they feel that
personal satisfaction professional
satisfaction in working with those
hospitals is really about feeling valued
and respected by the leadership they
want to be involved in the decision
making and as our hospitals got their
stabilization grants they often involved
their staff and their uh their
supervisors in making decisions about
how to use those funds
so going back to some commission
recommendations now that we've sort of
uh spoken on behalf of the hospitals as
far as what they're needing
recommendations by the um the workforce
study is specific to optimizing the
um current Healthcare education system
because if we're looking for new staff
that's where they are they're going to
be educated somewhere and that's who
we're going to be tapping into or those
folks who are not yet in those programs
or in the programs with the potential to
grab graduate pretty quickly so looking
at Quick Start programs for Health Care
is certainly an option exploring earn to
learn programs looking at faculty
incentives and then as far as attracting
new workers optimizing marketing and
dual enrollment opportunities for
healthcare fields for high school
students and then creating additional
scholarship programs other than what we
already have on the table for health
care
so again when you go back and look at
the conversations that are going on with
the hospitals they agree with all that
they realize that their Workforce is
right there in their community in high
school or in their local educational
institutions and the technical college
system is very widespread especially in
the rural areas the Techno colleges are
pretty easy access and they value those
Technical College Programs the nurses
that are coming out of the LPN programs
and the two-year RN programs are just as
valuable to them not to devalue
four-year programs or
um or any graduate programs but they
need Workforce quickly and they
recognize that that's where their
Workforce is they're in the high schools
in their own community and those
technical colleges produce a wide
variety of other Allied Health programs
and they need that staff too
so they also agree that it's important
for them as a community to support those
quick start Pathways such as the work
based learning College and Career
academies which are part of the
technical colleges are very popular in
some of our areas and that's really
where they're building strong
relationships dual enrollment programs
now you can tell I'm not I'm not a
youngin so sometimes I get a little
nervous that we've got kids coming right
out of high school that have LPN license
and are going right into the hospital to
start practicing and but that's what we
need we've got to get people into the
hospital as quick as possible so they
recognize that they have to grow their
own and because they've developed these
Community these relationships with their
communities and when their schools these
Local Schools they're getting out and
being visible they're having Community
engagement initiatives they recognize
that they've got to get engaged they've
got to
set up community events that are going
to bring these young folks in they need
to go be present in the high schools
arrange Hospital tours we've got some
pictures the the folks that are all in
their ppe's up there in the top are all
high school students that were at one of
our hospitals for a tour and then the
health fairs is another way but
hospitals recognize they've got to be
creative they've got to keep up with
these young folks and they've got to get
them interested in health care there's a
lot of other competing professions for
our young Workforce so we've got to make
Health Care sexy so that they're going
to want to be part of the healthcare
Workforce Now I know this is a broader
picture than just health care so to give
you a list of some of the things our
office always deals with that are
barriers to health care in rural
communities there's the ongoing
conversations about Transportation
challenges and I'm not talking about
just Emergency Medical Services
Transportation challenges that's a whole
other conversation but this is just
transportation to and from a doctor's
appointment or someone that gets
discharged from the hospital and then
doesn't have a way home so certainly
those are huge barriers in being able to
keep our rural residents healthy
broadband and connectivity is another
challenge we still have pockets in rural
areas where connectivity is very poor
and as we lean more and more toward
solving some of our health care problems
in rural areas with telemedicine it's so
important that broadband and
connectivity be accessible and available
and that we can continue to provide
those connections with specialist
Physicians or Physicians that are not
within a community through telemedicine
so we need some work in our connectivity
in rural areas and then just in general
lack of business and industry growth as
our rural communities dwindle and the
businesses dwindle it's really difficult
to attract new providers into rural
areas and to attract young families into
rural areas and that's really what we
need and of course nutrition is very
poor we have lots of food deserts in our
rural communities so all of this of
course contributes to our problems with
um
Quality Health Care in rural areas and
our shrinking rural population certainly
doesn't help
so in summary what I would like to say
to all of you is that our rural
communities are really resilient and
resourceful and our rural Health Care
leaders especially in the last decade
have really gotten skilled at
prioritizing needs and dollars and they
are having to play the Shell Games
sometimes they've got more needs than
they have dollars but they have to
figure out what is the best use of those
funds and what we've really learned is
that a lot of the solutions to these
challenges are very Community specific
so the recommendations have been
provided not just by the Workforce
Commission but by a lot of other
research and other reports that are out
there the communities just need to take
these recommendations and develop action
plans but we know that if they're given
funding and objectives and guidelines
these rural hospitals in these rural
communities very often can figure it out
so just to personalize this a little bit
I've got a couple of pictures of some of
our rural Hospital leaders in some
recent meetings that we had in the last
few in the last several months so they
are all ready and willing to take on the
challenge and as hard as it is they keep
showing up every day and going at it
again
next slide
so that is it for the State Office of
rural health and I want to tell you
again how much I appreciate this
opportunity on my behalf as well as Beth
Walker my partner in crime in the back
of the room who is the director of the
primary care office and does a lot of
that work that I had mentioned at the
beginning of the presentation so thank
you very much well thank you for that
presentation and I want to open up
questions I know Senator Patrick may
have one thank you very much for your
presentation very thorough and much
appreciated my question has to do with
something that always bothers me about
state government ever since I got here
and that is the silos that we work in
and so I'm the question that came to my
mind while you were speaking is how does
hersa grant funding fit together with
the healthcare Workforce board which of
course is a separate
entity than the healthcare Workforce
Commission I just want to make sure
everybody's working together and was
curious about how you're making sure
that it happens
right and I am not sure how many hersa
funded programs the workforce board
actually
um manages but you are correct we have
to get together so that we can see what
we're doing and not duplicate or
replicate uh uh initiatives that are out
there and our goal in the near future is
to break down these silos Dr Burke and I
have been talking about that in the last
several months because we don't need to
be tugging on opposite end of the Rope
we need to look at this as a relay race
so that we're all running in the same
direction for the same reasons so yes we
do we are are and Beth can probably
speak to that a little better than I can
she has more re um working of a working
relationship with the healthcare
Workforce but we are definitely planning
to work with them so that we can compare
notes as we move forward with these help
Workforce initiatives
chair thanks for your Folsom
presentation uh and all the
documentation I I had some kind of small
questions and maybe some overarching
ones
um
I guess I'll start with the the hips
hips of scores 88 of 120 rural counties
score between 15 and 25 but what's
what's the larger picture what the score
what's the table of scoring and what
what does 25 mean in the in the world is
these score scores 25 is the highest
based on that scoring calculation that I
had mentioned earlier so that would be
the highest need for Primary Care
Providers uh of the highest need not the
not the highest performing correct the
highest need so those 88 counties that
are scoring between 15 and 25 are
demonstrating the highest need for
physicians in those areas
thank you that's helpful
um the National Health Service Corps how
competitive is that approval process you
described working with with hospitals to
get get get the applications completed
and uh do a lot of them get declined
does we get 100 acceptance or uh
how are we standing with working with
that program National Health Service
Corps well Beth is actually the um the
director over that program so if you
don't mind I'm going to let her address
that particular question thank you
yes we work very closely with all you
will you pass through the microphone so
that we can because we're streaming
thank you now is that better that's
better thank you okay we work very
closely my office does especially myself
we work with the uh sites to get them
National Health Service Corps approved
slides and I would say in Georgia 85 to
90 percent get approved and then when
the next application cycle rolls around
they can reapply for approval if they
don't get in the first time and
um then the funding for National Health
Service Corps
we take what the federal government
gives the recipients and we score from
the highest knee down so they start with
a 25 which is your primary care and then
they fund those programs till the funds
are exhausted but they usually confined
down to about a 14 hips a score for
anybody that's interested in loan
repayment
and and and so
what's the out the final result in any
given year I mean how many nhsc uh
people are in our state working in these
settings right now we have over 200
recipients in rural counties that are
receiving National Health Service Corps
loan repayment
and total funding for National Health
Service Corps for um
2022 was over 14 million dollars Federal
Federal funding that's correct Federal
funding uh-huh
and and you pointed out that the people
commit beyond the two years they're uh
putting down Roots typically and and you
can count on a good retention rate
uh when they learn the charms of small
town Americans right
um but that that is there more
opportunity there for us is that is that
a place that that we can see growth if
we've leaned in on it absolutely we sure
can and the
and my goal is to get the word out to
these eligible sites like critical
access hospitals to take advantage of
this program and we also have the nurse
Corps uh program that's federally funded
and RNs and aprns can apply for loan
repayment so I want more critical access
hospitals to take advantage of the
National Health Service Corps so that
they can benefit from this recruitment
program
so that would be a place for us to look
for ways to help drive that
participation rate up yes ma'am uh
nothing nothing spins as good as Federal
money that not eating entire
um and
the rural Hospital stabilization grant
program
thank you so much for your
now now this is this is where
contributions get made why don't you
break that down a little bit on the
stabilization grant program how that so
that's State dollars that's right and
um so exactly and so we look at the
dollar amount uh that we get every year
which does fluctuate a little bit and
what we've learned in the first five
years of the program where our fundings
dollar amount per hospital
um sort of went up and down is that uh
the The Sweet Spot so to speak of
funding for hospitals to be able to do
something really productive with the
funding is somewhere between 750 and 900
000 per hospital so depending on the
amount of funding we look at how if we
stayed in that range how many hospitals
could we support and then every year we
determine the number of awards based on
the total number of funding
um and breaking it down dividing it up
into the number of hospitals that would
give them somewhere in the 750 or 800
000 what are we putting in annually
it fluctuates when we had the 16
hospitals in phase six we had 15 million
that had gone into that funding for that
year it dropped to 9 million the next
year and we're currently for FY 23 funds
which is what we've just opened up we're
at seven million dollars and then I
think in FY 24 we've dropped down to two
million dollars in the in the budget so
the programs so the program is not
working is it if we keep on cutting the
money are we is the money being you
didn't cut the money I know there are
people that we all know who cut the
money but
but it was is that a measure of it being
an ineffective program therefore uh the
money's reduced or I would maybe want to
look at Dr Burke to speak to that a
little bit he does have a knowledge of
that
uh well you know
I think there was a lot of
I wouldn't say confusion but the the
DPP program that that came in this year
it was one of those kind of we're giving
money from this this hand so maybe we'll
we'll lower a little bit from this other
hand so uh I don't think there's any
doubt that the the hospital
stabilization money goes to good use and
that it's been a very very successful
program
uh it's just a matter of
priorities and in making sure that that
uh
the
I don't think anybody wants to uh
give money where it's not needed
uh but but I don't think the the rural
hospital system is
is there yet I mean they're they're not
fresh yeah
right so that again that's so that
that's something to make to highlight of
looking at uh you know reinvesting uh in
that area and and
helping us connect the dots on how that
how that addresses retention and new new
blood and so on and so forth uh would be
helpful uh it's the other question I had
is that
the 45 leaders from 16 hospitals that
you convened and
locked in a room congratulations
uh
cash was their number one
did any of them connect the dots about
that there's all this Federal money if
we expanded medicaid that would come
down into our state coffers and into our
health system
it was part of the discussion
um that uh that two-day workshop had
some very specific focus on uh in the
small group discussions and that really
was not one of the topics that had been
brought to the group to discuss so I
really can't answer whether that was on
the minds of those folks it just wasn't
something we discussed during that
particular Workshop
well there's a lot of money on the table
up there and other states are getting
our tax dollars uh uh finally and I'll
stop thank you Mr chair
but you gave us a lot to think about and
and a lot to drill down on
did this does the certificate of need
uh
yes she said it there's a certificate of
need debate
um come into play here
um
this whole thing of retaining your
retaining your patient base and
delivering services to the the folks uh
you know in your locality
um and
has that has that surfaced in terms of
the plight of rural hospitals the
challenges that they're facing
the soar office really doesn't have
we're not really engaged with
conversations related to that that those
conversations go on in other areas of
DCH so that's not something that's
really on the radar screen in our office
so it's not something that we we
actively discussed yeah yeah and I don't
I'm asking a question that I don't know
the answer to you know how real or how
imaginary is that uh is that issue for
these hospitals and finally uh Georgia
retains 58 percent of Health Care
graduates that's really worth drilling
down on and and under where are they
going they're leaving the state
I mean that would be a fascinating focus
group wouldn't it if you could ever
get people to look back over their
shoulder long enough to tell you or
absolutely or as they as they leave and
people believe for all about you know
changing their address in their state
for all kinds of reasons but that would
seem to be a really important and sweet
spot to write what I did not see in the
report was if there was a a line drawn
between out-of-state students who may
have come into Georgia for their
education and then left to go back to
their home States I did not see that
actually outlined in the in the study so
that may actually play a a role in why
we lose so many Health Care graduates we
didn't talk about this later because
I've had more than my share of the time
but ahac whether you know how that how
that's going because that's a real
effort that's been underway for some
time I think Senator Jackson has one
question in there I'm going to lay this
microphone down thank you so much
yeah we we're going to try to stay on
schedule here
um with the number of people that we
have we've allotted up roughly 30
minutes for each presentation so I'm
going to let Center Jackson and then
Senator Walker and then we'll move on to
the next presentation
thank you Mr chairman thank you for this
um really comprehensive presentation uh
just briefly in our packet you have a
map here about Mental Health Access but
you didn't really speak to that and so
I'm curious can you talk about our
Workforce needs in rural areas as it
relates to mental health I will I'm
going to pass the torch back to Beth and
uh yes for sake of time I didn't address
all of those maps that we had in there
but there is some additional information
so Beth maybe you just want to come up
here
it's all green that's what I'm like it
is that's uh and it's very
in your face as far as the green too so
you can definitely see the need in the
state I know this is a very complex
question here with the mental health
issues we're facing and I hate to say it
but as as briefly as you can address
this issue right now we have others that
need to present and we're already a
little bit behind schedule so I got to
keep this train on the tracks here okay
well as you can see in the state
presently
94.97 of the state is in a mental health
hipsa so we are very underserved as far
as mental health providers
so that's the reason we're trying to
press with the National Health Service
Corps and with our state loan repayment
program for Recruitment and Retention of
these providers because we are in such a
need for health care providers
thank you
Walker
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
director Hamm for all the good work you
do in this the real good presentation
you've made you touch a lot of areas I
think we would all agree that access to
health care is a key determining factor
in economic development in any part of
our state
in addition to the you know the
well-being of the of the citizens and
the quality of life but
um
the economic development if you don't
have access to health care it's hard for
me to see how you're going to be able to
attract industry I think the number one
issue driving economic development in my
mind is quality education system uh I
think that's where some areas have a
competitive advantage over others and
then I think number two is is health
care and they're you know you could
argue one over the other but uh and and
touching on the con issue that's my
biggest concern with uh CEO eliminating
con I think there's room for
improvements and streamlining and and
modifications and but these these rural
hospitals if we were to lose more rural
hospitals I think we would see a further
decline in those areas as far as
population and economic development and
and that's that's my biggest concern is
that we don't miss we don't go too far
with that and impact that the J-1 Visa
waiver program
I have had a number of calls over the
last really just a couple years about
Physicians coming from other countries
that can't get licensed
to practice in Georgia is this a
composite Medical Board issue is this is
it the do you have any idea why that
would be the case if we do have this
program
I would I would say
um you know would be with the composite
Medical Board because when we accept the
applications they have to provide their
license to practice in Georgia I mean
that's part of it or either where they
have applied for a license
I just said I've had a number of calls
about that and I'll try to dig into that
a little bit further and I was just
going to say not to say it's a problem
with the medical board but that would be
a question we would need to pose to them
and certainly happy to make that
Outreach and kind of get a little bit of
clarification on what those requirements
would be I'm gonna have that opportunity
later and okay I'm sure I've got a study
committee on licensing going on
um but thank you uh what is the average
do you or do you know the average amount
of the rural Hospital stabilization
grants
it didn't look like a ton of money to me
when you divide it by 35 hospitals and
we're like a lot of work for not a big
girl definitely and as I mentioned in
the early I will I will agree it's a lot
of work but in the early years the
funding fluctuated
um it had originally started at 750 per
hospital
um uh so 750 000 awarded per hospital
and then we had a couple of years where
it dipped down to 250 or another year
was 300 000 so we recognized when we
dipped down to those numbers that um
they were not able to be as effective uh
as they were when they were in the
higher range so on average I'm not good
at math but 45 divided by 30 uh six I
think hospitals we said
um would be what the average is but
we're trying to stay in that sweet bot
Sweet Spot range of about 750 800
000 now so I would think you would have
to be there or higher to make it worth
absolutely I mean 300 000 for a hospital
is nothing really
we have seen some impressive projects we
money that definitely they are very
appreciative the hospitals are very
appreciative of the funding they
recognize that there are so many things
they would have not been able to do had
it not been that funding and a lot of it
is speaks to the employee satisfaction
above and beyond just Recruitment and
Retention bonuses or efforts directly
related to Recruitment and Retention and
Workforce but also some of those
improvements uh upgraded equipment those
kind of things that have certainly
increased status employee satisfaction
and have been beneficial hugely
beneficial for attracting their
residents back into their hospitals for
their care
um you we I keep hearing about A Renewed
interest in the nursing field which is
encouraging a lot of new students
applying and wanting to get into it uh
despite you know the covered situation
and everything
but the the bottleneck seems to be the
shortage of instructors I hear that over
and over and over
what can we do to address that
absolutely and I am not sure I would be
the most appropriate person to address
that but it's definitely something that
we see what we talk about more with the
rural hospitals is uh preceptors inside
the hospital for the students but the um
some of the there are some incentive
programs for nursing staff to be
auxiliary instructors or adjunct
instructors for the schools but I'm
probably not the best to address that
particular question
just very quickly the the commission
that that wrote that report had a pretty
good in-depth recommendations for the
the
barriers for
Educational Systems so I would urge
y'all to to look into that that's that's
kind of out of our Governor's commission
yeah okay
I would appreciate that thank you thank
you uh just I'm sorry chairman
um
so aheg I was disappointed I worked with
uh Miss Juliana on trying to identify
where our nurses are our licensed nurses
where they live
um and I would have thought that was a
basic thing we would have had at easy
access to and ahec did not have it and
apparently it wasn't a requirement when
they renewed their life to got their
license I think we passed legislation to
address that is that right
character but
um I'd like to learn more about ahec and
what they're doing and and they're you
know how much worse we how much it costs
the state for ahec and and I I would
hope they would have a maybe some
suggestions on these nursing instructors
and then one real quick on the
percentage of Health Care graduates uh
58 your is your statistic I was recently
at a public university that has a
medical school and there for doctors
there uh in-state percentage was 40
percent and they thought that was very
good I thought it was not so good
um I just I think we need to figure out
why we are investing the kind of dollars
in these public institutions for to
train a doctor which is extremely
expensive uh and not keeping them in our
state so thank you
thank you
thank you all for that presentation
thank you appreciate it
next we have Zachary Taylor
foreign
and just for reference John I'm going to
get you to keep the 30 minute timer we
didn't do it on the first one or Miss
Bernita will keep that
I'll try and catch you up on everything
I'm Dr Zachary Taylor of the District
Health director for District Two their
state is divided into 18 different uh
Health districts regarding Public Health
I also cover the district just west of
us west of my district which goes from
Cherokee County up through Whitfield
County
um
can you go to the next slide
okay
so uh each County in Georgia has a
public health program
and they're really two parts to that
public health program the first is the
health department the health department
obviously provides clinical and
preventive services and does activities
related to communicable disease control
and then there's Environmental Health in
each County also they're responsible for
installation of septic systems
restaurant inspections tourist
accommodations they do activities
related to rabies control
and to now body art which was uh just
passed by the legislature so I'm going
to talk about two types of employees
that we have one or public health nurses
the other are environmentalists we also
have obviously
um
clerical people we hire LPNs we have
often in our rural counties we have
aprns that travel to different counties
to provide services that are beyond the
scope of care for our Public Health
nurses
so our Public Health nurses are are
unique they're what we call expanded
role nurses
a nursing graduate who comes out of
nursing school or even a nurse who has
worked in a hospital for several years
is not ready to be a public health nurse
because of the expanded role that they
have which involves essentially
assessing patients and providing
treatment based on protocols that are
developed and that they have to have
training for so we don't really have a
public health nurse until she's been
with us for nine months to one year and
as I said they assess and provide
treatment they make referrals they give
vaccinations and they follow these
protocols or they contact me and I give
them directions on treatment or
assessment or the patient or further
referral for that patient
or primaries you know go back
I'm sorry our primary service Services
involve Women's Health we do a lot of
activities related to Women's Health
that includes reproductive Health
Services
Family Planning we also provide cancer
screening for breast and cervical
cancers for low-income women
uh we do communicable disease control as
I said that's primarily the treatment
assessment and treatment of sexually
transmitted diseases as well as
tuberculosis we provide immunizations to
all ages in the population we provide
services for children's health and that
can range from uh hearing and hearing
and dental that they require for
attendance at school
are scoliosis screening that's required
for certain age groups and then some of
our health departments have additional
services but the first four I listed
would be the primary Services provided
in our rural Health departments
in addition our health departments work
with our schools we work with senior
centers jails and prisons Social
Services organizations and drug
treatment centers to make sure that the
persons in those in those institutions
have all the services that they need
that we can provide for them
primarily if you could take what was
said in the last presentation and apply
it to our our needs which are primarily
Staffing that's that's the difficulty we
uh we Face we do have good benefits
there are the same benefits state
employees and joy that includes medical
dental vision 13 holidays uh paid annual
and sick leave and a 401 k match program
and even a pension if you if you work
for us long enough but again as was
emphasized earlier younger people aren't
really concerned with those things so
attracting and hiring a younger
Workforce is uh struggle that we have
the other struggle we have is our pay so
we start out nurses at 49 000 to 51 000
we go up to 63 to 66 000 for nurses who
have been with us longer and who have
completed all of the training that's
required to become a public health nurse
I'll point out that that 66
000 figure that's generally around what
a hospital would start a new nurse at a
new nurse out of
uh out of nursing school so our pay is
lower than what nurses can earn in the
public sector in the public sector I
mean the private sector sorry
next slide please
so we have several challenges in hiring
Public Health nurses as I mentioned the
salary and competition with the private
sector
believe it or not a lot of nurses and
younger people like the flexibility of
shift work you know I don't understand
that particular attraction but
they like that flexibility we obviously
have set office hours five days a week
so that's not as attractive to some of
them
we don't have tuition reimbursement
programs specific to Public Health we
can in some instances access the hersa
programs that were mentioned for tuition
reimbursement to pay for their schooling
but we don't really have a most of our
nurses that we hire have are not coming
directly from school and that's less of
an issue for them
uh since we are talking about rural
counties many of our nurses may live in
another County than the county that they
work in so their commute may be long and
if they have an opportunity to work
closer to home they'll take it we had a
real problem when gas prices were so
much higher last year and we lost
several people because of the cost of
their commute
we have some part-time workers but they
don't receive any benefits
and we don't have a cola or on an annual
or routine basis
but the legislature has been very
generous lately in providing increases
in our in our pay scales
and then while we evaluate all of our
employees yearly there's no monetary
value associated with that with their
evaluation so high scores don't get
anything extra out of that
I'm going to jump to the environmental
health which is a totally different
group of employees and these are
these are persons that have to have
completed a bachelor's degree from an
accredited University and they have to
have a certain number of semester hours
related to to laboratory and science
um
just as with our nurses when we hire
that person out of college they are not
ready to be an environmentalist they
have to they have to be trained and we
have to train them to be an
environmentalist so they have to learn
how to do they don't teach people how to
do on-site sewage Management in schools
they have to know about soils so they
have to know what this is related to the
septic systems how how different soils
percolate they have to know how to
inspect a restaurant
they have to know how to deal with
making sure animals that are suspected
of being rabid are
treated to be sent to the laboratory
that requires that those persons be
vaccinated against rabies
um they have to know about vector
control we do some activities related
around mosquitoes they have to learn how
to inspect pools and tourist
accommodations and now they have to know
how to deal with the body art they have
to take the same
certification that a body artist that's
a tattoo artist
yes sorry
they have to take this they have to take
the same classes at the uh that the body
artist quote unquote also does they also
are heavily involved in emergency
response training with what happened
recently in south Georgia with the
hurricane we have teams across the state
of environmentalists if they're needed
they go to that area to help them get
the the businesses back online so that
they can provide continue to provide
services in their community so if the
electricity goes off
Food Service establishment if they don't
have backup generators they lose a lot
of food because of the refrigerate loss
of refrigeration so they have to go back
in and make sure they have water
appropriate Refrigeration things like
that so that they can open back up and
their owners can continue to earn income
and provide the food for their community
and then
customer service is a big issue with
this group of people because
you know I'll get into this briefly
because they're also a regulatory group
so they approve or disapprove someone's
application to install a septic system
obviously they go into restaurants and
depending on the grade they give the
restaurant is able to open and close
so no one likes Regulators so they have
to learn how to deal with people who are
angry or frustrated with what's going on
and and how to serve those people in a
manner that we should expect the public
to be served by employees of our
government
next
so they have the same types of benefits
as you can see the entry level salary is
even lower it's about forty two thousand
dollars for someone coming out of
college I don't know if you have
children family friends who are just
graduating from college but most of them
expect to make more than forty two
thousand dollars a year in their first
job the national average is around forty
seven thousand dollars we do have a
career ladder it goes from uh
one two three four five again it's based
on their years of experience it's about
a year to go from one level to the next
level
and also their ability to be certified
for a different
um if they complete everything they need
to know how to do land use or septic
systems Food Service
Etc
and then in each County we have a eh
County manager which is a little higher
level
and oftentimes they move on to
the district or to the state office
which is a little bit
a better job depending on whether where
they live and what their family is doing
so next slide
so sort of the same challenges salary is
the biggest one I'd say for us
these people also work in different
environments
um if you know they're uh when it was 95
99 degrees out they're out there
examining septic systems which is not
the most Pleasant thing to do or they're
in kitchens in other areas which
are not always Pleasant also and it and
then again they do their Regulators in
that sense so they often deal with
unhappy people who are frustrated and
they have to tell them that they have to
do something additional to be approved
for their systems we don't have a
tuition reimbursement program for them
and there's no increase in pay so if one
of our environmentalists goes back to
school gets a master's degree there's no
increase in Pay associated with that
we also don't have benefits for
part-time positions in the same as
before there's no Cola on an annual
basis and no monetary value attached to
their yearly evaluation
so I do appreciate the the opportunity
to speak to you and I I'll be glad to
answer any of your questions
thank you for your presentation my
question and I may have just missed this
is there any contribution from the
counties
towards the uh salaries and so on yeah I
mentioned I I failed to mention that so
the way our public health programs are
funding there really are
um three sources of funding first they
get a grant aid from the state so that
includes both State dollars or federal
dollars that are passed through the
State Department of Public Health
uh they can also apply directly for some
some grants which increase
the funding and then the county provides
the counties required by law to to
provide uh funding to the health
department now what they're required to
provide is a small amount almost all of
our counties provide more than that
amount for for the public health program
and then finally there are fees and
charges for services so if someone comes
in and applies for a permit for a septic
system there's a fee for that if someone
comes to our health department to
receive Services
we charge
their insurance or if they don't have
insurance we have a sliding fee scale
but I will say no one's turned away
because they can't pay and we don't have
a collection agency so if they don't pay
we're not going to go after them for
that for that charge
one of the questions that I had is you
you brought up
um
nurses that get a master's degree there
is no increase in pay for them is that
because we don't have our the positions
that they're in is a master's degree not
needed or do we not have those or could
you could you explain that a little bit
more as to why that is the when I
mentioned that that was referring to our
environmentalist okay so not our nurses
so most of our nurses we don't really
have any let's say they go and get a
masters of Public Health
we might consider that in promoting them
to the next is if they're a phn3 I mean
two they might be promoted to a phn3 but
there's not a there's not a really a big
ladder
for increases just based on that
educational component now if they become
if they get a master's in nursing that
allows them to be an advanced practice
nurse then obviously that's a different
salary scale than just a regular RM but
as I said we don't really have
advanced practice nurses assigned to
individual rural Health departments we
have several in our larger Metropolitan
Health departments
um but we do have advanced practice
nurses that travel to the different
Health departments so that they can
provide some of our reproductive Health
Services thank you
Senator Jackson
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
presentation
um can you tell us what is this is there
a shortage um how many counties are
missing nurses or broadly speaking do
you know kind of where we are on on this
issue
so right now so for instance for our
district then just talking about our
rural counties we have about four open
positions
in say a county like Habersham we have
three nurses Public Health nurses in
Habersham some of our smaller counties
we may only have two Public Health
nurses we try to have more than one
obviously because if they're sick or if
they're on vacation then there's no
coverage at all
but it's a constant churn it's not just
those particular openings we next week
we may have more in fact I know we just
had a uh resignation in Raven County so
we'll be that'll add to the number that
we have
and the problem in our rural counties is
different than the problem in our
Metropolitan counties there's if we go
to Hall County we always have four or
five openings in Hall County but they're
com we're competing against a very large
hospital system
[Laughter]
so so so there's a different challenge
there most of our nurses in our rural
counties they they live in those
counties are in rural counties nearby
they they enjoy their work they want to
be part of their community so we
actually retain nurses in our rural
County slightly better than we do in our
larger
guys
yes
any more questions
thank you for your presentation thank
you today Dr Taylor I really appreciate
it
all right next we have uh Liz Atkins
executive director of Georgia trauma
Commission
foreign
good morning good morning and thank you
so much uh Senator Hatchet for the
invite to talk about this and as I
looked at the resolution that created
the study committee and saw that you
were about Surgical and surgical
subspecialties trauma is a surgical
disease and so this is very germane to
to what we do so we are grateful for the
opportunity to have a few moments of
your time and I bring you greetings from
our chairman who's in Australia right
now and is texting me with beautiful
pictures at 4am
so that's been fun
um so and you can
advance advance advance we'll get all
the bullet points up there there we go
so I just wanted to start out with
giving you all a little bit more reason
for why you're here and why the work
that you're doing as this committee is
so important
and a a well-organized trauma system
saves lives it's very well documented
and this is the story of an 18 year old
this happened not very far from where
we're sitting
and this story plays out all over rural
Georgia every day
but this is an 18 year old I know
sometimes in the news we hear a lot
about firearm injuries and those things
tend to attract a lot of attention but
this is really the nuts and bolts of a
lot of what we see but this was um
a young man just weeks away from his
high school graduation and he was out on
a motorcycle
and unfortunately
came around a wet corner and lost it a
little bit there and slid out and the
vehicle you can actually see on the
bottom
left there or sort of in the middle that
truck was equipped with front and rear
cameras and that is the view right
before that young boy is hit by that
truck and he couldn't do anything to
avoid him because the bike was still
sliding the top picture is actually
after the truck hit him the boy is still
in the road and you can see what's
headed right towards him is a big tanker
so um really devastating
um the when EMS responded on scene they
were actually closer to a non-trauma
center but they knew based on his
injuries he was still conscious and
alert thankfully his he hadn't been head
injured they knew he needed to get to a
Trauma Center so they took him to what
was a level two at that time it's now a
level one and part of the Northeast
Georgia Health Care system which we are
at today
um and that young man was in the
operating room within 32 minutes of
arrival he had very complex
intra-abdominal and Orthopedic injuries
he had multiple surgeries over the next
couple months and even though that was
right before his high school graduation
you see him there months later not only
did he survive but he's under the Arches
at his orientation to his freshman year
so these are the things that we like to
celebrate this is the reason you are all
here and we thank you for for bringing
this attention forward so next slide
so I have to give you a little bit of an
overview just so you can kind of for
context purposes and next slide
so what's the difference right why
what's the difference between for
example a center that we're sitting in
right now and a trauma center and really
the Trauma Centers deal with most of the
the most severe injuries
they are equipped to stabilize and
transfer in in the more rural Trauma
Centers such as the level three and
level four and we'll go over that in a
second and then emergency departments
more commonly treat
uh you know less serious broken uh
broken bones maybe loss of consciousness
heart attack stroke we hear lots about
heart attack and stroke uh you know
gastrointestinal illness the shortness
of breath sort of the medical things
that you think of in next line
so in Georgia similar to what the
national Norms are we have four levels
of Trauma Center
level one centers provide Total Care and
that's really from prevention through
Rehabilitation and these are what we
think of you think of an Atlanta Grady
hospital now as I mentioned Northeast
Georgia hospital we have five level ones
in Georgia they have teaching programs
and they teach medical residents
surgical residents and they are really
doing the research that drives trauma
care and how we how we manage trauma
patients the level two trauma centers
are very clinically similar to level one
centers however they most commonly do
not have the teaching component
and they typically treat both adults and
children we have two level two pediatric
Trauma Centers one is in Augusta one is
in Atlanta Scottish Rite
and we have one level one Pediatric
Center at Eggleston level three Trauma
Centers are smaller than a level one or
level two
but they can still provide prompt
surgical intervention and some
sub-specialty care so it's important for
you to remember one's twos and threes
are surgically driven
now when we get down to the level fours
which you commonly see in the rural
areas
and underserved areas they really are
more emergency medicine driven so that's
why the emergency medicine specialty is
really critical in these areas
and most of these patients that arrive
to level four Trauma Centers will be
their primary goals to begin rapid
resuscitation we'll talk about some of
the challenges this is associated with
that and then transfer to higher level
of care so next slide please
so who writes the rules for all of these
different levels and we'll you'll hear
me mention this again but the American
College of Surgeons that little gray
book that you see there on the left were
suffering through a a transition now
these are the new so-called criteria
that were just released and go into
effect in fact this month
so
um unfortunately the American College of
Surgeons left out level four criteria in
this iteration of their book they
recognized that that was a major uh
shortfall so they were going back to the
drawing board thankfully they Dr
Kirkpatrick is very familiar with this
as an orthopedic surgeon you know this
better than anyone
um they actually developed a rural
committee that's actually comprised of
rural trauma surgeons instead of being
Urban surgeons who are kind of dictating
what's happening in the rural
environment so this is very encouraging
to see so we will see currently we're
using the old guidelines right now
that's what the college has recommended
but they are developing new guidelines
so we look forward to that as well sorry
if you could back up one minute on the
right we'll talk about this in a little
bit too
um
the American College of Surgeons also
has
standards around what optimal trauma
systems look like and that's mostly what
the Georgia trauma commission is really
involved in the next slide
so what's a Trauma Center you see there
in the in the middle sort of all the
different roles and as you've heard the
presenters before me
talk about these different positions and
how hard they are to fill and the
recruitment issues and the whole reason
why this study committee was assembled
right if we don't have people to fill
those positions we don't have trauma
teams so we most commonly uh if you can
look at that NASCAR picture on the
bottom I think everybody understands how
quick that team they don't even talk to
each other right they just they know
what they're they're going to do you can
see them ready before the car even pulls
in and that's what we we like to think
about the well-functioning trauma team
functions a lot like a NASCAR pit crew a
next slide please
so just a brief background on our trauma
system so we've been about 41 years in
the making we always say but who's
counting we keep we keep chipping away
at it right it's never perfect
um our first Trauma Center was
designated about 42 years ago and again
we've made significant progress but when
we talk about some of the challenges in
the rural trauma care environment we're
not we're not quite where we need to be
yet and next slide
so
not unlike we're all here right now the
Georgia trauma commission was created
out of a study a senate study committee
uh sorry both House and Senate study
committee which was created during the
2006 legislative session it was five
members on the house side and five
members on the Senate side and they
heard testimony from all over the state
from State and National trauma experts
there were five Regional public meetings
the next slide
and you can keep uh yeah there you go
thanks and these were some of the key
findings so our death rate at that time
was 20 percent worse than the national
average I have some I have some slides
on this that'll show you where we are
now only 30 percent of traumatic
injuries were actually treated as
designated Trauma Centers it's not
uncommon that injuries are treated at
non-trauma centers but we want to make
sure that the most critical patients are
going to Trauma Centers and we have some
information to share with you on that
too traumatic death rates in rural
Georgia were much higher than urban
areas and annually at the time Georgia's
trauma care providers and this is the
hospitals the surgeons and EMS we're
delivering about 250 million dollars in
uncompensated trauma care so people were
fleeing the system there was really no
incentive to participate in the trauma
system next time
so this shows you again where we were
right before this Senate study committee
and if I can show you if you can see
where um
I-75 is sort of the red line
that goes down through the middle of the
state and you can see where you get
um somewhere around Macon where we start
kind of outlining the counties that
Traverse I-75
and a number of those counties are quite
a distance from a Trauma Center or were
quite a distance from a Trauma Center at
that time and at that time this was Data
compiled by Dr Pat O'Neill who many of
you may know who served for a while at
the state and the death rate in these
areas was almost twice what the death
rate was for the for the entire state
so unfortunately I-75 became known as
The Carter of death and you know many
people travel through I-75 even coming
through other states to go through
Georgia
and so without funding retention was a
problem so we already had an issue where
we didn't have enough and then people
were leaving next slide please
so this at our first ACS visit in a
system consult visit in 09 became coined
as the islands of excellence in a sea of
chaos right we had centers who were
holding on they were trying to do
everything they could to deliver really
good patient care but there just was no
good coordination between them and next
slide
so this led to the formation of the
Georgia trauma commission so this was
sb60 in the 07 legislative session later
becoming known as official Georgia Code
31-11 100 to 103 which established a
nine-member Georgia trauma Care Network
Commission
uh right now we're administratively
attached to Department of Public Health
there's three other full-time folks plus
myself so we're a very small But Mighty
team of four and our annual budget is
about about 23 to 21 million that
primarily comes from the super speeder
funding as well as a small portion of
the fireworks excise tax
um through that it sounds like a lot of
money but when you got 35 Trauma Centers
and I'm proud to say that every single
Trauma Center in Georgia right now is
funded if you're designated unless you
came in after the start of the fiscal
year or after we submitted our budget
which I think is just one Center but
we'll add them next year everybody is
funded in addition we do funding for EMS
and that is legislatively mandated for
centers and EMS where we do a portion of
Readiness and uncompensated care
and then we have a number of initiatives
to support trauma system development and
so next slide
and so this kind of shows you where we
are now in terms of the Distribution on
the right and I do have uh the map on
the left kind of depicts where the EMS
regions are so um I think neatest map
showed this really well too if you look
at regions eight and nine and you
remember her map we have a lot of rural
a ground to cover down there and
particularly in Region 8 and South and
region seven we have a lot of areas
where we don't even have any hospitals
so EMS transport times are very
protracted in those areas so patients
May travel a long distance in those
areas to get to a Trauma Center
next slide please
and so just to highlight some of our
rural care initiatives and programs the
next slide
probably the biggest thing that we were
able to accomplish this year and and it
took us at least a year in planning is
that we had remember I showed you the
slide where the American College of
Surgeons is the one that sort of writes
the rules for Trauma Centers as well as
essential elements for trauma systems we
had an American College of Surgeons
trauma system consult and we added on we
asked them we were the first state to
ever do this and they're going to use us
as a template moving forward we ask them
to come look at our world trauma system
we said hey we've got issues here we
don't really know how to deal with them
can you guys send us some rural experts
and that's what they did they sent us a
team of seven folks from across the
country primarily rural a couple folks
that were from larger City areas
and um we had about 130 140 people in
attendance it was amazing just like this
it would be great if we could meet more
often to kind of brainstorm about some
of these issues
and so that was early this year just
before the or right on the uh beginning
of the legislative session and next
slide
so I've given you the link for the full
report I think the full report has a
very good
um
overview executive summary as well as
the full rural focused piece and I think
it's very worthwhile looking at
system-wide there were 14 priority
recommendations 89 total overall
recommendations from the rural Focus
there were eight priority
recommendations in 29 overall rural
recommendations we have the exit summary
that was videotaped because we did it by
Zoom the team was there for a full five
days they had three stakeholder visits
across the country but they stayed
sequestered so they could actually do
our report and then give us a really
nice meaningful exit summary on the last
day and next slide please
so I'm just going to hit the highlights
of what the priority rural
recommendations are because it's very
germane to the work that you're doing
here and the first one was to perform a
comprehensive resource needs assessment
including funding for the rural trauma
system
emphasizing obviously the rural aspect
of EMS and the trauma hospitals and then
a rural capacity needs assessment to
identify gaps which included again EMS
the trauma hospitals and transfer
capabilities because just because the
patients make it to the hospital now we
have the conundrum of how do we get them
from the world Trauma Center to the
tertiary Care Center when they need to
because our EMS colleagues are certainly
not flush with staff and then exactly
what you're here for Recruitment and
Retention primarily focusing on trauma
providers nursing and EMS and next slide
please
so and then you can hit it again so one
of the things we wanted to understand
our group has published quite a bit on a
number of things not only access but
what does it cost and we've published
twice on the level one and level two
cost that's been out there for a while
that's pretty well known but we never
had a sight line into what does it cost
to run a level three or a level four
Trauma Center so this was the first data
in the country of its kind this went
crazy on social media when Dr Ashley
presented this at the Double AST
American Association for the surgery of
trauma because everybody wanted to know
how much it cost so we could actually
put a number on it for the first time
so the average cost for a level three
Trauma Center this is Readiness this is
kind of what it costs to keep the lights
on before the first patient ever comes
through the door was about 1.7 million
and the highest cost not inconsistent
with what you've heard already is the
clinical medical staff right because
everybody gets call pay now nobody's
even going to come to the table to talk
to you unless you have some sort of
mechanism to provide them with call pay
so if we're on call if I have an
orthopedic surgeon and I say you need to
be at the hospital within 30 minutes if
we call you we're gonna he's gonna want
call pay or she
and then level four Trauma Centers
that eighty one thousand dollars is
extremely conservative we know it's
higher than that we just could not get
the information out of them this was
really hard to get out of them we do
want to repeat this because we think
we've figured out some ways to help them
kind of quantify the cost of that
emergency medicine coverage because
that's primarily what they're having to
cover
um and and they reported their highest
cost category was the administrative
cost category so
next slide
primarily I think because they couldn't
quantify that medical staff coverage
from New York we think we have a formula
to help them help them with that next
time
so what are we doing about some of these
things we're really proud we couldn't do
the work that we do with a staff of four
without partnering with many of the
people even in this room and one of the
folks that we partner with is a Georgia
Emergency Medical Services Association
they do a lot of
Education professional and initial
licensure education so EMT EMR classes
as well as continuing education classes
last year they delivered over 189 000
contact hours in education which is a
feat among itself but knowing the gaps
that we have in Recruitment and
Retention they were also funded to do a
public service announcement which should
be airing very shortly we just got the
final approval on that so
again I think you've already heard some
of the challenges with Recruitment and
Retention this is a little bit of a
different era when I you know looked at
that and that's the sort of the opening
uh
seen on the PSA is you know what do you
want to do with your life you want to
make a difference well we have to talk
about you know pay and flexible
scheduling and things like that it's
just not enough to say I really want to
help people anymore we really need to
make it a little bit more attractive
um and I think that Recruitment and
Retention for EMS has been a perennial
challenge right you've already heard
about environmental health I mean
there are not many people who want to
like lay on their stomach in a ditch and
try to intubate someone on the side of
the road and in my previous life I was a
flight nurse so I've experienced some of
that myself and it's just not it's just
hard and you're not gonna you're not
gonna keep them in the field for long
I'm also married into EMS so I feel like
I live eat sleep and drink recruitment
challenges and Health Care challenges so
next slide please
and then the next priority
recommendation was to ensure involvement
and participation of the rural trauma
hospitals and EMS in an inclusive
Statewide trauma system plan
I have to say we had our colleagues at
dph years ago
we had a beautiful trauma system plan
but nobody knew where it was
and nobody really we didn't really look
at it we didn't regularly visit it and
say are we doing these things that we
say are optimal things
so we need more than to just check a box
we need to actually write the plan the
way that and have metrics that we go
back and revisit it and when we talk
about an inclusive
Statewide system you know we we tend to
focus on those real critical injuries
but a lot of these rural hospitals
what's going to keep them alive are some
of those minor injuries that we
shouldn't necessarily bypass the center
to go to a higher level of care because
those injuries can be managed at that
facility and it's actually good business
for them to keep those patients where
they need to be and not far away from
their loved ones so next slide
and then the next two recommendations
standardized trauma care in rural
Georgia utilizing educational programs
and increase rural emergency medicine
providers and resources to provide
capability to manage dramatically
injured patients
one of the biggest educational programs
out there for um
trauma care
for providers is advanced Trauma Life
Support very hard to take that course on
the road Senator Patrick you know about
this this course was actually by an
orthopedic surgeon who was in a horrible
accident
and you know found that his experience
was that people in rural areas don't
understand how to save lives trauma care
is different than Cardiac Care it's
different than stroke care and sadly
it's not very cookbook because traumatic
injuries don't follow any specific path
so next slide please
so one of the things we like to do at
the commission is when we can't figure
something out we phone a friend so we
looked at some other states who had
similar Geographic distributions such as
ours and Pockets where there were maybe
no rural Trauma Centers and how do you
tap into that how do you make sure it's
bad enough these people can't keep the
lights on and take care of the patients
they have how do we tell them oh by the
way you also have to evaluate the care
you're providing you have to figure out
where the opportunities are so we look
to Pennsylvania we actually looked at
Pennsylvania and Texas but Pennsylvania
was actually able to do this for us so
they sent a team they have a very
structured program for level four
centers and they have requirements that
are above and beyond what the American
college sets out so they came and they
visited five of our level four centers
they sent two teams of three reviewers
each
and the best part was they had emergency
medicine physicians so these weren't
Urban surgeons coming in telling the
rural providers how to do it these folks
had experience in the rural areas
themselves
so the reason we did this we wanted them
to evaluate what our level four
Readiness to take care of injured
patients really you know tell us the
down and dirty we want to know all of it
and then we wanted them to share we know
you guys have some really high
functioning level for us could you share
those best practices and then we wanted
them to come to the commission meeting
and present their aggregate findings and
next slide please
some of these I'm honestly were a little
bit hard to hear
not unlike what you've heard earlier the
community commitment was incredible
these folks are very engaged with what
they do in their communities and they
want to do a good job they simply don't
have the resources to do it and despite
their limited resources many of them
were actively engaged in injury
prevention and Outreach which was some
of the things we have we struggled with
the level ones and the level twos who
are much better resourced many of them
had very adequate facilities lovely
facilities as a matter of fact they had
great access to equipment and strong
Hospital leadership support they wanted
to do the right thing unfortunately the
trauma program managers might have also
been the emergency department manager
and the stroke coordinator and the
quality improvement person and you know
whatever else they were wearing too many
hats to be able to do the role that they
needed to do and the same thing with the
medical director
um so really just a lack of time and
really financial support for education
so we heard this loud and clear at the
commission level and in fact we've
doubled the amount of money Readiness
funds that it's still not enough and we
know we need to measure it as I
mentioned
um we also didn't really have one things
that Pennsylvania does really well is
they have a really good formalized
mentorship program so they compare some
of the rural centers up with some other
colleagues at the level ones and twos
and provide that support and that helps
even with the patient throughput and
transfer process right if you know the
other person that you're speaking to on
the other side of the phone it makes it
much better
um and then nobody and I mean almost
nobody had a standardized or structured
process Improvement plan they just don't
have time to look into the care it's
hard right next slide
and so this was sort of our own homemade
course if you will that we're really
proud of one of our commission members
Courtney to williger led the way and if
you want to talk about engagement here
it is right here
um and that the bigger picture there on
the left Alicia register you probably
can't see it there is about nine and a
half months pregnant I think she
delivered the week after that picture
was taken but that was our inaugural
March pause course now March pause is a
military mnemonic stands for massive
Hemorrhage Airway respiration
circulation head injury hypothermia pain
antibiotics wounds and splinting and
it's basically a down and dirty here's
what we do when the patient arrives
here's the things we have to do we we
initially called it five things to save
a life and that wasn't sexy enough I
guess so we decided we'd go with March
pause since that was the mnemonic that
we were teaching because as you know
senator they don't have time to sit for
a two-day TLS class right so we got to
get in in there for two to four hours
and and just come back year after year
so this is kind of how this was designed
and this was our Pilot Course which
happened just a couple months ago at the
State Office of rural health so we're so
happy to partner with our colleagues I
think the Partnerships in Georgia are
working that's that's something loud and
clear to hear today and then on the top
right that's Greg Patterson he's the
trauma surgeon and medical director at
Archibald who's one of our level three
uh Trauma Centers down there on the
border in Thomasville and then according
to villager down the bottom and next
slide
so two more of the rural Focus priority
recommendations improve scene response
Times by bolstering existing Mutual Aid
agreements and addressing Staffing
shortages so here we go again right
you're seeing I'm certainly adding fuel
to your fire from this ACS report
but I think the scene time piece is not
necessarily when we're talking about
what time EMS gets the call to what time
they arrive on scene but again what we
found that most of our challenge is
getting the patients out of the rural
hospital to the um to the level one and
level two care environment and then
developing a process this is something
we're really excited to start looking at
now
um develop a process for what what's
known as rescue stops and accelerated
transfer so what we mean by rescue stops
and are we're working with the folks our
neighbors in Alabama who do this really
well where
um instead of EMS coming bringing you
similar to the scenario that I started
with
that patient to a rural hospital and
then okay we leave call us when you need
us to transfer no they stay there with
the patient the patient has Auto
Acceptance to a higher level of care the
patient stabilized starting blood fluids
whatever and then we're on we're on the
road We're Not Gonna because then by the
time I leave
I gotta come yeah exactly exactly and we
may be on another call some of the
contracts require that a 9-1-1 ambulance
always stay available so they can't do
an inner facility so this really helps
put the patient at the center next slide
please
and then next recommendation provide
education and collaboration for Rural
facilities to achieve proficiency
regarding data entry and validity again
this becomes so low on the priority list
when you're just trying to take care of
patients every day right they don't have
the expertise to do this
and then provide rural trauma program
managers process Improvement training
along with mentorship and support from
other facilities and next slide
so we have one of our programs within
the Georgia trauma commission is what we
call a Georgia quality improvement
program or gquip as we refer to it
and so that group consists of the trauma
program managers and the trauma medical
directors from all of the Trauma Centers
across the state they meet in person
twice annually
we just in reinstituted what we're
calling the closed peer review meetings
and this was this was almost like an act
of God to sort of get this done we had
to work with the AG's office to get a
special attorney who specializes in peer
review which I know you're familiar with
as well
to write a resolution to get us to be
able to do this and so what this does
for the rural centers where they might
not have another physician who can
review care and say Hey you know did we
do the best we could what opportunities
exist here this gives them the benefit
of having the 34 other centers in the
state be able to say hey let's take a
look at this and I got to admit we were
we were a little nervous when we did
this because we weren't sure how this
would be received but um it was amazing
there was so much great discussion we
had really three really good media cases
that we talked about here and I was
writing notes like crazy on some of the
opportunities that we at the commission
could potentially fund and some of it is
that I didn't realize that you know we
preach that we want them to initiate
resuscitation and do it correctly
however it is cost prohibitive for
Senate for Rural centers to get
platelets because they're so expensive
they don't use them they're throwing
them away
so we're now looking at other states
that have programs where they can rotate
blood supplies so that maybe we can um
you know and maybe we can get more blood
there's actually up in this area our
colleagues at Northeast Georgia have led
a pre-hospital blood actually plasma
program and it would be great to to do
something like that throughout the state
um yes sir
that's and I want the community to have
time to ask questions so does anybody
have any questions right now
thank you you're definitely preaching to
the choir here because this is I live
eat breathe and sleep this stuff too I'm
married to an ER doc so that makes it
even worse I I have to give a shout out
to former Center Cecil Staton who really
started this ball rolling based on a
personal trauma experience that he had
and the concept and the goal was the
golden hour of trauma to have everybody
be within an hour of a Trauma Center
because that can determine living or
dying and so I congratulate you in what
you've done so far it sounds like you've
got a lot of really exciting things
going on I'm particularly interested in
the pause program that just seems like a
great
um stop gap for hospitals that don't
have the resources and you talked about
mentorship so I'm hoping that you guys
have great Partnerships with the various
Hospital associations the GHA and the
gaca and whoever else there is to work
with because they really are at the
Grassroots in terms of getting the word
out so my question is is that how you're
operating is that yes communicating so
it's almost like you teamed me up for
that question because we just
participated with gha's rural committee
they invited us to come at their meeting
in Saint Simons to talk with that group
about what um similar to what Nita
showed you know the feedback and we said
like we need to hear it unfiltered you
know tell us what it is you need to do
and how can we help you we know not
every Center is going to be a trauma
center but how do we how do we get you
the things you need to take care of in
your patients how can we have this
inclusive system so yes we're partnered
with the right I think we're we could
always have more Partnerships but I
think we have the right people at the
table
Center Jackson
thank you so much for the work that you
do um so full disclosure I worked as an
EMT for a very brief period of time
because it's stressful
and I'd rather care for Souls than
bodies but nonetheless I I am curious
are there I mean we we know we have ENT
shortage across the state do you know do
we have good recruitment mechanisms in
the high schools to move young people
into that field and then thinking
specifically about rural needs are our
EMTs being trained at a higher level do
they have more equipment given the long
distance I mean you know I worked in
Dekalb it's five minutes to the hospital
right um but I would I would need a lot
more equipment I feel like if I'm in a
30 minute or an hour long Transportation
situation so yeah is there is there
additional training are they having
better equipment what's happening there
and then do we have some good programs
for recruitment at the high school
levels in our rural areas to train up
EMTs excellent questions and uh I think
you have a speaker later today Chad
Black from gemsa who is probably going
to address some of those things one of
the things I did want to bring up though
is um at the opening session at the last
legislative session
I was so impressed by the work of gdac
and the healthcare Workforce dashboards
that they developed but I was really
disappointed to not see pre-hospital on
there so I just checked last night in
preparation for this presentation
because
the dph office of EMS and Trauma is
working with gdac to get EMS data up on
that dashboard because one of the things
that they think they might be able to do
we know we lose a lot of EMS Personnel
not necessarily to the Georgia General
Assembly like we do but um but to
nursing because they can get paid for
you know more money right
so
we think that between the nursing
database there might be a way to look at
what is the migration path out of EMS to
nursing so we can figure out you know
that can help inform some of your
Solutions potentially but I do think
you'll hear from Chad later today on
some of the recruitment strategies
because it is it is important but to the
transportation piece that is so critical
because yes they will spend a lot longer
in ambulances one of the major
challenges is getting some of the
clinical experience because you know
there's only so many
clinical sites that you can get
experiences you know one of the
life-saving things that pre-hospital
folks can do is intubate someone provide
you know and take over mechanical
respiration but
um if there's no sites for them to be
able to do that and then and the
opportunity doesn't present itself but a
couple times a year how proficient can
you really be at that I'm going to put
you on the spot a little bit
um and it was
when you're the math with the Trauma
Centers and where they're located in the
state and then we obviously went into
the the EMS piece of this in your
opinion do we need to focus resources
more on EMS and quicker Transportation
or do we need to focus on putting Trauma
Centers in new locations
I would say we do have a Trauma Center
recruitment opportunity but I think we
need to figure out
how to get the patients where they need
to go in the most rapid manner I I was
surprised in preparation for that ACS
system consult that we had one of the
things we had to do is inventory where
the air service providers reside and I
was shocked to know that we have 29 air
bases throughout Georgia and South
Georgia has a very good presence of air
Medical Transport somehow and I know
because I was in the business for
several years
and even sitting in my helicopter in
Atlanta at Children's Healthcare of
Atlanta you know the pilots would say
well I can get you down there to the
sick kid but I can't get you back
because we have weather coming in
there's foggy conditions down there
there's all kinds of phenomena on white
can't fly in south Georgia why can't we
leverage some of those air bases I've
had conversations with them they're
interested in this they just don't we
have to have the right conversations and
figure out how we do this or even just
try a pilot that's one of the things
that we talked about let's
maybe pilot it maybe it's you know it
can be successful or how do we deploy
again from the big academic centers
could we send somebody out to backfill
your Zone if you can't leave your county
uncovered you know many of these
counties the sickest patient is probably
the one in the ER not the call that you
won't have for the next 48 hours right
for your excellent presentation
I know there's more to share at the time
allowed uh and look forward to
we're very fortunate to have you in that
position in my opinion and it's just
been excellent
um number one and this is right on
following your your question what about
investing in more Medevac helicopters
would that be a good thing to do with
some Surplus State funds
I think the air medical community would
love to hear you say that but I'm not
sure that more is always better as you
guys are probably hearing from the
discussion here sometimes there's no
amount of money you can throw at
something that's going to fix the
problem because again sometimes in the
air in the areas where we need them the
most they simply can't fly I think what
we need is the expertise of the people
who are on them to somehow you know
deploy them to the areas where they're
needed to where they may be able to
transport them by truck and they don't
can't necessarily you know when I was
grounded for weather I got on a truck
and we would drive wherever we needed to
drive to get to get this
um
I'm under the impression and clear this
up for me that we are woefully
short of Trauma Centers compared to our
adjoining States I heard haven't fact
checked it that the City of Charleston
has four
level one Trauma Centers
and you may or may not know that but I I
there are dozens more Trauma Centers in
other states that are similarly
populated can you go
um
back up I just think we need to be
really in the real world on this back
again
I'm back before so you know I put this
here because yeah that's my district
this made you know obviously this made
headlines nationally really yeah you
know and it underscored what a scarce
resource it is but if you go to the next
slide we've had centers leaving the
system for a long time now when Dr
Ashley and I were asked you know to
comment on the closure of Atlanta
Medical Center
it tended to be more
are thought of as more of an
atlanta-centric event but what people
didn't understand right was that that
created a backlog of patients who were
waiting to get out of their Rural Center
and get to definitive care right because
definitive care centers are so crowded
right now so really definitive Care
Centers need to be at the table for some
of the discussions because if the
patients can't get out again this is
where the rural Health
Providers you know I mean what a
daunting task to to have you know a
patient you can't care for so we are
aren't we relatively population and
geography how do we compare with our
southern states around us yeah it's it's
a great question even some states have
added level five trauma right and so
what's the answer I'm not sure I because
we are growing we have designated in the
past couple years more centers than we
ever have and we have at least a half a
dozen in
process right now so we're really
encouraged by that the other piece is I
think we have to balance over
proliferation and make sure that again
we're delivering that that high quality
care so I think we're positioned well
for but could you get the numbers for us
the states around us because I think we
need to take a look at some Stark
realities about what we're we've been
hammering on this trauma system and you
brought a new whole level of uh put the
spotlight on these level fours which is
what we need to really pay attention to
uh you know in terms of addressing the
rural needs but uh getting those numbers
for us would be very helpful and and
you're really a resource absolutely
thank you thank you thank you sir
all right next we have Amy Reeves with
the Georgia Board of healthcare
Workforce
and what I'd like to do is we have um
Amy Reeves now then Jimmy Lewis and then
we're going to take a quick break for
lunch
and I was thinking about a 30 minute
break uh for lunch
what do you saying
and then yeah
so thank you very much
that's right at least we're in a
hospital if anybody needs that's right
good morning I think I'll be the last
one to say good morning right that's
right Mr chairman members of the
committee thank you for allowing us to
be with you today it's a real privilege
my name is Sheila humberstone I'm with
Stonebridge Consulting and I'm here
today with Amy Reeves who wears a
multitude of hats and I'll let her tell
you her story but my relationship with
Amy started because she is the
legislative and reimbursement chair for
gapa the Georgia Association of
physician assistants and so we're here
to talk to you about health care
Workforce from the PA perspective so I'm
going to turn it over to Amy
hi everyone and so um thank you for
having us
um I just wanted to tell you a little
bit about being a PA and like what what
it takes to be a pa
um so I did four years of undergrad I
actually did it in nursing and then I
worked for four years as a nurse and
then went to PA school I looked at both
options of nurse practitioner and Pa and
for me it was just the PA school was
what I wanted to do and then I've been
working as a PA since 2006 whenever I
graduated in past board so you have to
graduate from a
graduate program and before you get in
you have to have at least 2 000 of 2000
hours clinical hours
and then you also you do rotation so
it's basically like you're on the same
rotations as medical students like it's
required you know to be on the rotations
and get asked questions and reports and
all that stuff so it's two years at
least two years of PA school and then
after graduation you take boards and
then you have to re-certify every 10
years and you have to keep up your
continuing medical education every two
years which is 100 hours 50 of those are
category one which are usually from
conference hours and stuff
we work as part of a we work with a
supervising physician and as part of a
healthcare team we have we can have our
own patients you know I've worked in
many different roles I've worked in the
NICU and been on like high-risk
deliveries I've worked in pediatric
pulmonology where that is you know
inpatient and outpatient I've done
pediatric ENT which can be as easy as
like ear tubes in clinic and tonsils and
adenoid follow-ups to tracheostomies on
NICU babies or you know children who
have maybe had some sort of accident
um and now I work in general Pediatrics
and I love it I love every second of
being a PA like it's a wonderful career
I get to see all the patients I get to
be a part of a healthcare team where I'm
valued and I enjoy it so much
um
so as far as I just wanted to kind of go
over like
um the report from the 2020 Board of
healthcare Workforce so I do sit on that
board but it's this I'm not representing
them today I'm just kind of speaking of
it
um so the PA's partner with supervising
Physicians to practice medicine
supervising Physicians can delegate
medic medical duties to Pas Pas perform
a vital service to Rural and underserved
areas of Georgia where there is a
shortage of practicing physicians in
doing so Pas increase the quality and
quantity of medical services in the
state so I've heard this multiple times
like you know especially whenever I
worked at showa there would be you know
the Physicians would be scrubbed into
the operating room doing sometimes
four-hour cases if it's a cochlear
implant or you know whatever whatever
that surgery entailed neck Mass sections
and we would be on the floor you know
seeing the patient evaluating patients
and Reporting back to them so they
they're really like we couldn't see all
these patients without you guys so
they're very appreciative
um we have
um as far as the last report we had
which was 2020 data we have 4484 Pas
currently licensed and working in
Georgia so
um
at our one of our last meetings with the
healthcare Workforce board we talked
about why we only had 248 Pas that were
newly licensed in the state of Georgia
in the 2019-2020
um cycle and we're actually working on
getting a survey to figure out more of
why we are not getting these PAs to stay
in Georgia it's going to be modeled very
similar to like medical students and why
you know why would why would you choose
you know did you is there a significant
other in another state
um whatever those questions are to try
to figure out a little bit more so we
are working on that with goals for the
December 2023 graduates so we are
working on a survey to try to help us
understand like why do we have eight PA
schools and only 248 of those
um
and that's that also counts people that
move to Georgia and get those are newly
licensed so that's not only just the
graduates but that's also
um that's also to me that was a stunning
statistic to think that we have eight PA
schools and 250 ish people that came in
and that's not just the new grads like
Amy said that's new grads as well as
folks that might be matriculating to
Georgia from other states
um
it did it did I mean that you know
that's that's a piece of it but but
Healthcare you know occupations
obviously didn't close and there's a if
only an an increased need despite what's
going on
um with any particular infectious
disease at the time
I think Senator Senator Jackson was
asking yeah I was asking how many
students are they graduating so like
what percent what percentage does 258
equal are we talking about 10 stay 20
say so each PA school has um a cohort
group of about 50 to 60. 60 is usually
the maximum and we have eight PA schools
currently with other schools that are in
their pre-pa planning process two more
on the horizon so
um
we can do better
we can always do better so
um and
foreign
and we so the so one of the things that
we think that um you know Pas and we've
seen numerous work Workforce reports
over the past couple years like senate
committee reports and
um workforce commission reports where
they say like you have to utilize your
folks at the top of their
um at the top of their level at the top
of their training level like we have to
get them out there working and
um you know like we are trying to get
um the hb557 addressed it where we were
trying to get some schedule twos where
we would be able to write for that when
it's necessary like we obviously
practice medicine on our supervising
physician so um so like the people who
need it the most like there are Pas in
rural Georgia where there is not a
physician in the emergency room like
it's not an option for them to sign a
prescription so they are having to admit
patients to for pain management where
otherwise they'd be able to send them
home with a prescription
that you know and there's there's other
instances too you know and of course we
would follow the the pdmp the
prescription drug monitoring program
um we it always goes with your
supervising physician so like on
Pediatrics I don't really need
hydrocodone there's not really patience
if my if a patient of mine in general
Pediatrics needs that much pain control
they're you know they're getting
evaluated in an emergency room setting
um it is an issue for
um where I practice we do have some ADHD
patients and I've seen numerous patients
that need their medications refilled and
these are psychologist tested ADHD
patients these are not I think I have
ADHD I want to trial it or whatever so
these are these are definitely issues
that affect us where it's like you know
in in 40 something other states if I was
practicing and seeing my patients I'd be
able to prescribe that but for right now
and my doctor's out on maternity leave
so I'm relying on a locums to help me um
so I just send her what the prescription
I need and what the patient's name is so
it does create more of work load for
that but we hear this time and time
again especially in like
um in the rural places specifically
where there is
um you know the doctor may not be in the
office that day or I hear it from like
patients who are in oncology that they
can't get their pain medicine refilled
um so it's it's definitely an issue in
metro Atlanta I know whenever I worked
in a hospital
um this was whenever we were very full
and like on diversion and my doctors
were scrubbed into the operating room so
they couldn't sign a prescription and
like literally they were like you are
backing up at us admitting patients to
the ER because you will not send this
patient home and I'm like well I can't
send them home they don't have their
pain medicine prescription you know so
it's just the the backlog of how um of
you know what how it's not just one
thing that it affects it's it's multiple
things that it puts into play
um
so anyways I don't think I have any
other
um comments if you guys have any
questions the only thing I will say is
you know um not to to bring up a more
challenging study committee but the con
committee that met last week there was a
cardiologist who said something
um I thought really why is he and I'm
gonna roughly quote him it's a rough
quote so so let me know on camera let's
I'm not quoting him directly but he said
you know
that he is losing recruits right out of
college
right out of their training because
quality people require quality
opportunity
we lose applicants to states where there
is greater opportunity and I think
that's sort of the piece of it is how do
we make Georgia attractive for those PA
students to want to stay and work and so
certainly part of that is making sure
that that we're looking at our rules and
regulations to make sure that if if
they're afforded the opportunity to
practice in a certain way in 48 other
states then that probably warrants a
significant conversation we don't we
know Georgia is not going to be out
leading the charge and out in front on
stuff but when 48 other states do
something there's certainly an argument
and and you guys heard that and I
appreciate I think there was only one no
vote on the Senate side this past
session on that bill so we really
appreciate we really appreciate your
work and your effort on that I think the
other thing and Amy could probably
address the the multitude of emails that
we got particularly in and around
December of last year but it happens
whenever we have a cohort of students
that graduate that the the challenges of
getting licensed and then getting their
job description approved because as Amy
said you know and I'm going to say this
with no disrespect to the Pas or the
Physicians but I like to think simply
and and try to distill things a PA works
for a physician right they're they're in
a collaborative relationship so the PA
is licensed by the composite medical
board so by virtue of having a license
that deems you to have met the minimum
qualifications and be ready to practice
whether it's law or you know Road
building or whatnot once you've got a
license that sort of says that you've
met the minimum requirements The
Physician is licensed by that same
composite medical board but for us to
work together for PA humberston to work
for Dr Reeves we've got to go back to
that composite Medical Board and get the
job description signed off at the board
level and that takes a whole lot of time
if PA humberstone and you'd think these
job descriptions or robust and flowy
they're not they're very simple forms
but if PA humberstone leaves and goes to
a different facility and they get
another new grad who has the exact same
you know capabilities the same school
they're going to do the exact same work
then we have to go back to the board and
got to stop seeing patients go back to
that board in order to be able to start
work and we had I mean I have
30 some odd Plus
desperate emails from graduates from our
programs that were petrified because
they were graduating in December they
had practiced that you know they had set
for their boards and passed their boards
some of them had fellowships at
phenomenal hospitals in Georgia
lined up but they couldn't start their
Fellowship because of you know
potentially a two-month lag at the
composite Medical Board to get to get
that
job description and that license
approved we know we have to be licensed
that's not a question but we've got to
be creative about finding ways to
expedite that process because if when I
went to graduate school and I graduated
with medical debt it was nothing like
medical school debt or PA school debt
the thought of not being able to start
work on that first day that I have a job
offer and instead have to sit for two
months
means that if I heard that from my peers
I'm probably not going to look at
Georgia I'm going to look at one of the
states where I can start work and start
paying those loans back fast and I will
say again thank you for your work on on
the legislation this past year does seek
to make some tweaks in that area as well
and there were some additional funding
for the composite Medical Board that no
doubt will make a difference and so we
we appreciate you but Amy's the expert
on how all of this works so I guess
we'll turn it over to any questions you
might have
thank you for your Insight that
information Senator Patrick
um yeah my question has to do with the
survey and uh you know we we've tried to
expand the
um requiring the information for all
Healthcare Personnel when they renew
their licenses because we don't know
what's going on out there if we don't do
that so I guess my question for you is
have you talked with the workforce board
is that can some of that be done by rule
does that have to have legislation
so I don't think that's going to be in
the legislation in terms of the
surveying because we're trying to maybe
a misunderstood we already mandate a lot
of professionals when they renew their
licenses to give us the information on
how many hours they work are they going
to quit in the next five years do they
take Medicaid et cetera et cetera et
cetera so I'm just wondering because we
hit some roadblocks with getting that
bill passed last year if any of that can
be done by rule that's my question I
think for medical schools it is going to
be done because it's going to be tied
into funds like not as a punishment but
as an incentive like you're getting
funds from us so we have to have this
information because I think HB 1013
addresses it and says we have to have
that information for medical schools the
PA stuff is
on that requirement on that list but we
they're like we've got to figure out why
we can't have Pas and I think part of
what we're trying to figure out is not
just at licensure but why is somebody
not getting licensed in Georgia so how
do we figure out why P.A Smith who
graduated from Emory is never talking to
the composite Medical Board never going
through licensure because they've chosen
to work I get that part but if we don't
even have the information to begin with
about who's even out there that's right
then you can't get to that next level
absolutely
thank you all very much thank you for
bringing that to us
all right next up we have Jimmy Lewis
CEO of Hometown health
and then after uh Mr Lewis we're going
to take a quick lunch break I'm thinking
30 minutes and then we'll start back up
with a Dr Thomas Hatchett
[Music]
foreign
good morning thank you for being here
you've got a microphone right there as
well just so the people that um very
good thank you my name is Jimmy Lewis
I'm CEO of Hometown health
you might wonder who is Hometown help so
I'll give you a briefly of who Hometown
is and then I'll give you some
information I think you'll find very uh
very factual uh Hometown health is an
organization it's a self-funded
organization that was formed in about
1999.
for the soul and specific purpose of
doing whatever it takes to save rural
hospitals from closing we've been at it
from then until now we started with one
we went to two and currently we have
about 20 ftes and they're not ftes they
are super Specialists and those 20
people have 400 years experience in
health care and assorted aspects of of
Health Care the function that we provide
is that of a resource of many facets in
the many facets include anything
non-clinical we don't get involved in
the clinical side of the house because
that's a little over our figure eight so
we don't do that rather what we do is we
out we we deal with all of the
operational reimbursement Financial
sides of what what goes on and again the
effort is to do whatever we can to
prevent one of these hospitals from
closing next slide
that's what we want to prevent uh that's
the first 12 and there's at least six
more that could close on any given day
depending upon what happens with the
particular operation in the uh in the
hospital we've had many occasions to
talk how these things operate uh we
average about uh uh four to six events a
year to make payroll
and when you're doing that to make
payroll of three to five hundred
thousand dollars a pop and you come up
on Monday and can't make payroll on
Thursday that's a real problem this is
what we're trying to prevent next slide
we got a bumpy ride and I want to give
you some information to the facts of
what goes on in the marketplace and then
if you want to discuss them we can do so
we've talked today about Workforce
shortage of the workforce short
shortages beyond anything we can imagine
when we go into coven and we've got
people in the ER that are dying because
we can't get enough people to staff the
bids that's a real problem
uh physician shortages whether this be
eight thousand whatever the number I did
a Google on that and came up with eight
thousand we're seriously short with
respective positions throughout the
state of Georgia and the further you get
into rural Georgia the more pronounced
it it becomes
Georgia's unemployment percentage is 3.2
percent that has a translation that's
extremely important for us to understand
in that at three point two percent those
people that are unemployable are
structurally unemployable
what that really means is they ain't
going to do nothing they can't do any
they don't have a skill set they don't
have a mental set and that's the real
problem that's particularly a problem in
rural hospitals because if that's the
case we we don't have a pool to go to
draw from and that's a real that's a
real problem Financial stress from the
covet and the pandemic uh out of the
covid we on the day of the covet when it
was announced we ran into a situation
where we had hospitals that couldn't
make payroll and we were struggling to
it the federal government came down and
gave us a lot of money uh when they gave
us a lot of money that was really good
for the time that it lasted and then we
found out they wanted it back and when
they wanted it back it's hard to take
back money from an operation that is so
uh difficult to deal with so from a
financial stress standpoint we then had
and today now have many hospitals
operating with less than two days to ten
days cash and if you're running a 20
million operation with 10 days cash I
don't have to tell you what kind of pain
that is that's a real well that's a real
problem we have another item here that
I'll come back to artificial
intelligence transition I'll talk to
that in a minute the next point to be
made is inflation inflation at whatever
it is and then depending upon the
specific item that you're dealing with
can range from four to six to ten to
twelve percent that's particularly
problematic when you're dealing with
contracts that are fixed if you've got
fixed contracts that you don't have the
opportunity to negotiate a higher rate
and inflation is going up at 10 and you
can't get another two percent in the
next five years and you're automatically
putting yourself out of out of business
the next one is an interesting one and
there are 10 State initiatives going on
simultaneously right now that are
killing the entire industry but
specifically in that of Rural and these
10 initiatives include things like the
CMOS the rfps the Medicaid unwinding
Pathways provider uh credentialing what
we were just talking about here and for
these hospitals that are already
resource limited and to have to do this
kind of work we don't have the resources
to do it and we can't find the resources
to do it nor could we teach them on a
timely enough fashion to make that work
I say the next one is an economy
consuming labor when UPS announces
they're paying 21 a pop and Walmart's
taking that same situation they're
consuming everything that we've got to
provide care with the next subject is
paramix and paramix is how we get paid
Medicare Medicaid self-pay commercial
and such it's kind of interesting to see
that we have gone from a a Medicare to a
Medicare Advantage population and that
Medicare Advantage population one could
make the case that the federal
government has used using that to cut
rates and and what is happening is in
the rural communities uh we'll find that
they'll get those people will get posted
at the front door of Walmart so they can
make sure that they take all of the new
people coming in and convert them to
Medicare Advantage from Medicare and
that's really a problem on the
particular pair mix that we're dealing
with you may or may not hear about this
next one it's the 340b the 340b is a
drug program it's designed to help rural
hospitals and it does a very good job
but there's a tremendous amount of
pressure on them to solve this problem
and eliminate actually and then the last
one is transport issues and we've got
situations now where we have hospitals
that have to pay to have the patient
brought to the hospital that's a real
problem but the one I want to mention is
artificial intelligence transition and I
drive my people nuts on this uh this
artificial intelligence intelligence
transition if I can stress anything to
you that's going to have influence over
any and everything of what you do I do
we do and healthcare does it's going to
be artificial intelligence this is and
will transform every aspect of our lives
and it will be beyond anything we can
imagine and the reason that's so
important in rural communities we've got
to learn how to do it and with the
already stretch situation that we got
learning how to do it is a real uh is a
real problematic situation next slide
uh overall Workforce considerations we
talked about an aging employee base
aging general population tight pipelines
of where to get people in employment
apathy uh and turn over amongst the the
current employment next line
this is kind of an interesting one but
employee turnover uh I this came to my
attention on occasion about 10 years ago
when I suddenly did an analysis on CEO
turnover CEO turnover typically runs 25
to 30 percent per year think about it
when the leadership is turning that fast
and doing what it does with that kind of
turn then what happens is the ability to
have continuity of strategy is zero and
that that leads to major problems both
at the board level and the hospital
level and those kind of things and this
is just some of the turnovers that we
experienced and we've heard all the
morning about training these people as
they turn over it's just virtually
impossible to do so next slide
okay the problems that are exacerbated
in rural we've talked about them and I
won't get in all of this being let's go
to the next one
the next one is where we start if we got
all these problems where are the
solutions well I'll give you some
solutions okay now you won't lack of
solutions but I'm going to give you the
solutions because they're known to work
but they're challenging the first
solution is cash it's all about cash we
can talk about every other thing that we
want to talk about but if we don't talk
about cash we don't talk about nothing
it's all about cash we'd like to think
that we clinically are solvent and all
this kind of stuff but that's not true
we are cash insolvent and we're cashing
solvent because we're turning away all
sorts of services that we should be
dealing with so we're going to deal with
it we need a couple of policy changes
the first policy changes we here goes
uh the first policy changes we need to
implement Medicaid expansion
I said we we need to implement Medicaid
expansion and we've come a long way on
that subject but if we don't do that
we're leaving cash on the table that
otherwise could go into the community
and provide a a growth of the service
level of Medicaid and all of the health
care programs that we've got I'll leave
that one alone the next one's even more
hot than this one we've got 159 counties
and with 159 counties we got to find a
way to do some kind of Municipal
consolidation of A Sort period I mean
it's just it that's just what we got to
do if we don't do that we will leave all
of that money on the table that we can't
get to and that that whole consolidation
subject is the consolidation of counties
the consolidation of area Services of
the collaboration of local services and
to consolidate local area contracts such
as health care insurance property and
you say well how in the world are you
talking about all this stuff I can tell
you that last week I carried part of our
team to the field and we went to eight
hospitals 400 miles in two days and
talked to all eight boards
that's what they said next slide
both of those things all of it next line
probably casualty I don't smell too good
sometimes
so the the next Solutions are kind of
interesting because these are all proven
Solutions these are not what is these
are these are things that work
telemedicine telemedicine is the key to
what we do when it comes to the delivery
of The Clinical Services we got a great
program over at Augusta that goes out to
13 to 15 hospitals they have access to
health care in the ER at the patient
level in the hospital and we can keep
the patient in the hospital and provide
services at home and not have to carry
them to the to the uh to the trauma
center the next one is hello we need to
do scope expansion and do all the
research pertaining the scope expansion
of services I mean if we are short of
nurses and we got or whatever and we've
got some way to expand the scope of
services this is the thing in the time
now that we need to be doing that the
next one is kind of an interesting we
can go back on the history of it but the
fact of the matter is we need to
increase the hospital tax credit to 150
million dollars for this reason that is
the cleanest most direct infusion of
cash that I've seen in my 25 years of
trying to figure out how to get money
into the to the communities and for as
much as we can do that that puts the
ownership of Health Care back into the
local community Through the donors that
make the money work in the local level
it's working doing really good we just
need to do more of it to make it work
that much better
replenish the fund State Office of real
health
this is an opinion
it's totally Unthinkable that we would
cut the State Office of rural Health to
less than three million dollars after
we'd got the known proven programs that
were I mean it's just crazy and and
we're trying to figure out how to save
rural hospitals and we're cutting the
way that these folks back here know how
to do it and they do it extremely well
and the next one is kind of an
interesting one as well we need to
subsidize OB
and you said that's crazy we don't need
to do that well we closed 14 OBS because
we couldn't pay for them you know why we
couldn't pay for them because we were
losing a million dollars a year on each
one of them when we do that we impute
the poor quality of maternal care into
the community by doing and this is real
simple the reason most of those closed
is because they were losing one million
dollars a year if we were to subsidize
14 hospitals at a million a piece that's
14 million dollars on a 30 billion
dollar operation for a budget is is that
peanuts or what we need to figure out
how to do this because for the reason
that we closed the OB units as we did we
did it just on the numbers but the real
numbers are the loss of economic
development that occurs shortly after
you get rid of the OB because it just it
wipes everything out so what we have is
a consolidation of uh those kind of
services and the losses just eat them
alive and then the last one was kind of
interesting we need to figure out how to
create a rural stopping for Physicians
to keep them in rural communities fifty
thousand a pop or whatever but we say we
can't do that well we can't do that so
we'll just train them and let them go to
another state and we look at the dollars
and cents associated with senator the
state it ain't real smart next slide
there you have it
so a couple of things of interest that
we have learned
again we got 20 people we're virtual we
don't have an office our office is an
email address it's been that way from
day one we don't sink a bunch of money
into excess overheads whatsoever we put
our money into people and smarts and
software and things that work uh we
operate with the most advanced software
from an operational standpoint we focus
on several things one of which is
reimbursement we have developed
reimbursement programs and we've got 700
courses I think 700 courses that we've
developed we have 20 000 students online
Across the Nation and they're dealing
with reimbursement and how to how to
file claims better and make sure you get
paid for what you get uh for what you're
operating on we we do this extensively
and it works and we've got hospitals all
over the nation uh that are that have
proven the success of it Georgia is very
very powerfully successful in doing this
and State Office of real Health we work
directly with them and and using this
kind of networking uh networking
operation the next thing we do is we
capitalize on technology from our
business partners we have 70 business
partners that help us fund all this
project okay I mean it's truly a wild
crazy project but it's been fairly
successful and the 70 business partners
that we have started out being the
fundamental business partners and I say
fundamental because that was a little
bit about accounting and a little bit
about painting and a little bit we have
moved far beyond that in that our
business partners now are technology
advanced to lead us into artificial uh
techno the whole artificial intelligence
program and those 70 business partners
join us twice a year and and they fund
the program but they help us twice a
year and we have 200 people that attend
for the purpose of understanding what
they know great job we use the the best
technology and Advanced Communications
we've done over 100 webinars thus far
this year teaching these people what
goes on with Medicaid and Medicare and
all of those kind of things so it works
I share all that with you to say if we
don't do this we got six more that we
can lose tomorrow and after that we're
creating a third world nation far beyond
anything we've seen and on the OB Side
of the house it's important to note that
that translates into a desert below I-20
that makes South Georgia Yonder city
thank you
thank you if you have any questions I
know Senator Patrick sorry I always have
no you're good this is what we're here
for so I just I don't want to throw the
state of Georgia under the bus on some
of the things that you talked about
because a lot of these are federal
programs so we have to do the Medicaid
and winding is federal the revalidation
is federal so we're doing the best we
can in Georgia to try to deal with that
and so the federal government we're
doing everything
we're doing everything we can to assist
in the training to help in that
particular situation but sometimes the
feds aren't as Cooperative as they could
be got it and we also have done some
things in Georgia that have been
beneficial and I have to give
commissioner former commissioner Kelly
noggle some credit for getting the
directive payment program going make no
mistake about it it ain't the whole
thing but it's a very good program
excellent we work directly with them and
that that is clearly a very good program
money left on the table for years for no
apparent reason we also have a pretty
robust service cancelable Loan program
for Rural Physicians already so um I
just want George to get some credit for
some of the good things we've done but I
do have a question for you I was not
familiar with having to prepay for
transports yeah we got hospitals that
are doing that dig into that a little
bit more it's just very simple we got
we got transport that says you pay us
we'll bring them
for emergency
services
not emergency but transport I'll just
say transport I qualify that
you go into that a little bit more what
kind of are we talking about like we're
talking about getting a patient to the
hospital okay what's your typical
patient that they would call a hospital
for are they picking them up from their
house are they taking them from One
hospital to another hospital there are a
lot of different scenarios that patients
are transported in rural communities
I'll just leave it at that
you go in for treatments you go in for
emergency you're going for candy bars
no you don't but
um
do you have a follow-up Center capacity
let me ask you this one of the solutions
you mentioned was telemedicine yeah sure
what can we do as a state to help with
the telemedicine or is that something
that's already there that needs to be
it's already there
it needs to continue to be upgraded in
payments and use of system
uh all of this is about cash
if there ain't cash to follow it it
ain't gonna happen and that's what we
have to do with with telemedicines
continue to pump cash into it to provide
users the interesting thing and you know
a lot of this is controversial what I'm
telling you but this won't be any
different okay so the situation with
telemedicine is uh we have two uses of
telemedicine we have some senior users
of telemedicine we have some not senior
users of telemedicine and the younger
people come out played with video games
and they're all about tell them us and
we still are struggling on some
occasions with older Physicians who just
don't want to get into telemedicine
telemedicine is clearly without a shadow
of a doubt proven remote patient
monitoring is the name of the game
period That's is it and there's no real
reason to talk about that I'll you
didn't ask this question but but I have
a question to answer for you uh yes
that's that whole subject of certificate
of need with respect I fought all sides
of certificate of need but I can tell
you that the threat to the certificate
of need for a rural community is the
loss of Imaging and what goes with it
when there's an Imaging Center put up in
the neck closest town and it sucks all
of the patients out of the rural
communities the other problem that goes
with that also is we've got a situation
with insurance companies where we have a
we have an occasion where uh
the patient gets prescribed a need and
before that patient can get on the
insurance companies call to get them to
transfer their care to another another
unit somewhere out of the local
community that's what will happen I mean
we could we could have situations where
we could suck up rural hospitals in a
heartbeat like that
yes sir
um
one thing that you mentioned that I had
not heard is that the CEO turnover is 30
percent per year in Georgia did you say
did you say it's range from 20 to 31 or
two you can find that in Beckers ex can
you go into that a little bit as to why
you think that turnover is occurring and
I guess what we could do
first and foremost is burnout it's
killing them I mean there's there's just
there's just insufficient backup we do
strategic plans and we do succession
planning and all that kind of stuff
there isn't a succession plan there
ain't no backup there's there's just
there's just no inventory of people
coming along and as a result of people
that are there they go they just burn
out and when they burn out it's kind of
like you know big tree of fire it just
Falls over and that's it is it a
is it something that could be addressed
at the college level with programs in
the state of Georgia that would prepare
people to become CEOs of hospitals is it
a hospital management course or or I
guess curriculum uh first of all it's
about education but more importantly and
all that's about the money
if enough people are paid enough money
to get into the program then they will
able to educate themselves and go work
in the rural hospitals but the problem
is you got to have people
that have a A literacy level that can
support what's required to go into uh
going to hospital and and and make no
mistake CEO work at a large hospital is
work hard work CEO work at a small rural
hospital is unimaginable because that's
the one where you got to go tear out the
garbage and clean out the toilets and do
all of that stuff just to be the CEO to
help the nurses on the floor
you just had to have been there to see
what it's like when
that happens and then the last solution
that I was going to ask about is the
scope expansion could you go into that a
little bit with the crnas LPNs RNs
what's their role in rural hospitals how
do you think that they're
um I guess scope expansion can help
dope expansion can help
by allowing certain services to do more
things under their license than they
currently do
now I'm going to give you an example
that's not the proper example but it was
an example I grew up in a little town I
mean Cordele and when court is a little
town now but Cordell was a little town
when I grew up in it the thing that was
most interesting about expansion of
services was the second best doctor in
town was the doctor's brother who was a
pharmacist
and he did his own expansion of services
yeah and in a rural community
we need to look at how that works we
need we need to find better ways you had
a question
do you have several questions
um so one I'm curious about your
incentives for Physicians to practice
full-time in rural communities we heard
earlier that there's already an 85
retention rate if we can get them there
then they will stay there so why do you
feel like we need to offer them
additional money we got to get them
there to get them there yeah so what if
we had a one-time settlement fee instead
of a a yearly whatever it takes to get
cash there okay and then my other
question
um back to kind of scope of care and you
may not be the best person to answer
this but are there
um are there rules and regulations that
are preventing people from practicing at
the top of their scope already so we
heard that previously about Pas in my
experience as an EMT there were rules
and regulations that prevented me from
operating at the top level have we
evaluated that to make sure that people
within their already trained so instead
of expanding scope of care they're
already being trained to do certain
things about our rules and regulations
are preventing them from operating at
the very top I'm not the proper person
answer that that's that's what I figured
um
God
absolutely
their rules and regulations in Georgia
that's why 48 states
allow Advanced nurses to do to practice
at their full training George is one of
two that doesn't and we fought this
battle every year since I've been in the
Senate eight years and it's uh
you know mag fights us on it every time
it's not just advanced practice nurses
but that it's across the field that we
have a number of Allied Services or a
number of places where people are not
working at the top of their scope is my
sense I'll mention this very quickly in
Jefferson the chairman over here that is
we've had many many conversations about
what goes on in the rule because he's
rural now the important part about that
is the fact that he is in communication
with rural on a daily basis
y'all need to be in communication with a
rule on a daily basis just to see what
it's about if you hadn't and see what
goes on there because he and I have many
conversations about what's going on in
the rural community and some of them are
Unthinkable but they're real and you as
legislators are are there to make the
changes or adhere to the changes or
whatever but you got to be there and you
got to hear it you got to listen to it
it's
everybody in this Healthcare field
understood what you understand about
Medicaid expansion
it's all about money
money it is Cash dollars it is money and
you used to oppose it and you changed
your mind
and now you're outspoken about it and
and we have a Hospital Association in
Alabama that that loudly
proclaimed the need for Medicaid
expansion it's all about the cash that's
that's what it is it's money it's money
and it's and it's the jobs and the
infrastructure funding that that money
will do will do you know what the
greatest will ever you know what the
greatest in my opinion the greatest
leverage to deal with the redirection of
money is
the CMO contract
the state CMO contract
if we figured out how to properly
negotiate those contracts on behalf of
the state
and follow the money
there it is
well Mr Lewis we appreciate you being
thank you for listening while we think
we may have all the answers to all the
problems in the state this is uh uh you
did bring us some good solutions for
Rural health care and you know I think
as we continue through this process
we're going to see that the needs of
rural Health Care versus the needs of
Urban Healthcare are very different and
people fighting
well people fighting for the hang on a
second please people fighting for the
best of their patience
they have different interests in rural
versus urban areas we're here for Rural
and I really appreciate you coming
coming today thank you very much so
we're going to take a quick break we
have lunch for everyone
um in in the adjoining room uh let's say
it's 11 58 now let's start back at uh
12 30
um with Dr Hatchet and y'all
Miss Bernita is telling me to direct
y'all through the double doors please
thank y'all
foreign
all the members are back we're gonna get
started uh next up we have Dr Hatchet
yeah
my dad
uh my name is Tommy hatch and I'm an OB
GYN I've practiced here for
30 years and um
my goal today is to try not to embarrass
my son
um
today I wanted to just kind of tell a
story of the Habersham County experience
what we've gone through with our rural
hospital and the challenges that we've
faced over the last 70 years basically
and uh
to share some of the things that we
we did well some of the things we didn't
do so well and then to talk about
physician recruitment I had the honor of
working on the Georgia Board for
physician Workforce for a dozen years
with Senator Kirkpatrick for a while and
we did our best to make a difference
there and um
so
that's what we're doing today
um so this hospital was prior to in the
late late 40s and early 50s if I'm an OB
GYN so some of my comments may be in
that direction but if you were going to
have a baby in Habersham County and not
have it at home you would have it at the
charm house which is a beautiful Annie
Bella mansion in Clarksville up here
they still have a room upstairs with a
glass window and that was the nursery
but in 1953 this hospital was built and
there were 53 beds and that's basically
what it's been since then
in 1991 there was a large addition
that was undertaken and it was at this
time that I actually got to see this
facility it was still under construction
I was a third year resident and that's
when I decided to come to this area I
attended the State Medical fair in
Atlanta
and decided to come to Habersham County
to raise raise our kids and um
we decided why not come to a place that
some people like to vacation and live so
um so that that happened in 1991 then in
2008 we had another large addition and
that's that's the facility that you're
in currently
um it was a 36 million Edition and
refinancing of the the county bonds
and uh and then just earlier this year
the facility was purchased we finally
completed a an agreement and uh it was
purchased by North Northeast Georgia
Health System so that's that's where we
are today
now during that time the regional
hospital there were only about five
three to five Physicians that were here
that started this that was started with
the hospital
and that in 1978 the hospital kind of
gotten some financial trouble
one of the themes of our history
and like many other hospitals and uh so
they we brought in
a management team from Quorum our HCA
and that was required by the that was a
requirement placed on the hospital
Authority by the county and so that led
us up to 1991 in 1991 there was
approximately 25 Physicians here and I'm
going to refer to them as community
physicians they lived here they worked
here they had privileges at the hospital
um
over the next uh
let's see 17 17 years or so that 2025 is
a mistake I apologize for that but over
the next 20 or 17 years or so the number
of community-based active staff
Physicians remained at 25.
but unlike some other rural areas
Habersham County continued to grow in
1991 the population was approximately 30
33 000. now it's uh it's getting close
to 50 000. we're up around 47 000. so
we've had a pretty pretty uh stable
growth throughout this whole time
fortunately however our our medical
staff did not grow
that asterisk up there is mainly the the
way we were able to accommodate the
increased growth and increased number of
patients was with nurse practitioners
and PAs
and during while I was on the healthcare
board that was a really hard thing to
track we tracked we could track
physician licenses and physician surveys
so I I hope that with the with the name
change and the and the able to maybe
assimilate some of the nursing data and
the PA data that we were able to get
better numbers so we could really tell
what was happening as far as Workforce
in the in the various counties in
Georgia
um so that was you know that that was
kind of the
Beginning of the End uh
we had this great facility in 2008
um you might compare it to an airline
that had maybe a couple of dozen brand
new
737s or triple sevens we had had all the
facilities but we didn't have the pilots
to fly the planes
um and I'm not trying to to over
emphasize Physicians but you have to
there that's part of the solution along
with nurses I mean there's we have to
have personnel
so from 2008 to 2023 the number of
full-time Physicians
living in our community you know calling
this their home that were on active
staff here dropped it's from 25 to about
10.
um
now we were able to run the hospital
because we had doctors that came in
doctors that staffed our hospitalist
service doctors that staffed our our ER
in that same time period from 1991 to
the present we went from approximately
10 surgeons that were
fighting for space and three ORS to two
surgeons two to three surgeons that were
working out of five ORS and that's
um if you're spending that many millions
of dollars and you're building a 24 bed
outpatient surgery unit that's not a
that's not a way to to make your
investment work
so um that's that was one of the one of
the many contributors to uh what led to
the dire financial times that we
experienced in the last year to where we
were down to
less than one day's cash on hand
the huge threat of the of the facility
closing
so fortunately that didn't happen we
were able to to work with Northeast
Georgia Health Systems and we
we are on our way up again
um so now there's a lot of benefits to
practicing in rural rural areas and I
just wanted to touch on some of those
you can make a meaningful impact in your
patients lives you get to see and
interact with them on a daily basis it
really it really gives you
accountability
um my wife likes to joke about how many
patients I see when we go to Walmart and
uh
um being a ob gyn sometimes those
conversations are not
probably not for Walmart so but
um
it's I feel like in a rural area it's
easier to have a better life work
balance to be able to raise if you know
raise your family do the things you like
to do to your hobbies to do Recreation
uh outside
when I one of the first weeks I was here
of a doctor who had been here a younger
doctor he later became the mayor of
Clarksville he took me to go fishing and
here I am
practicing OB GYN in a small area
I'm on call and we drive up about 10
minutes from here and we wade into the
Waters of the sequoi river
and we're fly fishing in a deer walks
across the stream right when I caught a
fish and it was just kind of
surreal that you can do this and be on
call it's maybe a little more
challenging to do that if you're in
metro Atlanta
well you don't have to but the
Chattahoochee is a lot bigger down there
um we have less less traffic less crime
I have a five minute commute to work
through three stop signs
um and uh I was thinking about it a lot
of people probably practicing in Atlanta
have
um
a 30-minute commute from where they live
to where they where they work in the
hospitals and that by Atlanta standards
that's not really bad but uh you if you
look at an that's 30 minutes each way or
an hour hour a day that's five hours a
week or 250 hours
a year that's almost six weeks
that you're in the car
and so I like I like my five minute
commute
um I mentioned the recreational
activities and also part an opportunity
to become really part of your community
to do the things that that are your
passion and to have a meaningful impact
um as far as recruitment there are
various levels that
you can focus on
um Dr Burke this morning shared with me
a great story about how his community
hospital basically paid for locals local
students to go to medical school and
that student came back and was able to
pay back that debt by by working so
that's a local opportunity that that
communities have to
affect their physician Workforce
so the community can be involved in
recruiting
individuals
who have relationships with the
hospitals the hospital can involve them
when they're interviewing doctors
especially board members when I was here
the the board members that was that was
what they do they took doctor
prospective doctors out to to dinner and
told them about their
about their Community what it was like
to live here local businesses should get
involved to the Chamber of Commerce
Banks and Realtors certainly have a very
vested interest in in recruiting
Physicians to come practice in a
community
at the state level
and this is where a lot of thought was
placed especially on the workforce board
there are many things that can do and
they a lot of them involve money but
others don't the tax credits I I think
there are tax credits available to to
Physicians who practice in rural areas I
don't know how effective those are loan
repayments are huge I think that's a
better way to focus when we were on the
physician Workforce board there were a
lot of scholarships that people were
given when they first start to medical
school and they may think they're going
to medical school to be a primary care
doctor or work in a rural area but they
may want to be a specialist and you
don't know until you get there
so if you took a loan to
to go to a rural area but you know
Habersham County or Eastman Georgia or
Bainbridge don't need neurosurgeons so
you're you're kind of out of luck and if
you don't repay those loans you're you
have to pay triple triple damages but
those
um we've kind of phased those out and
that's that's uh been an improvement but
loan repayments everybody has student
loans and so that's the way that the
state can help to recruit Physicians to
rural areas in 2005 around that time the
malpractice environment in Georgia was
was very bad we only had two two
companies that were that were basically
ensuring Physicians here but through
some meaningful tort reform that we got
done at that time we were able to
make it a better environment here and we
because of that many other companies
were able to come into Georgia and help
ensure
Physicians and uh and in doing so the
the rates the malpractice insurance
rates dropped which that was a good
thing and that's something that can be
done at the state level
and then Medicaid reimbursement
you know it the Medicare reimbursement
rates for Georgia should you know should
be compared to this definitely the
surrounding states and other states in
the South and if you want doctors to
come practice in Georgia you should try
to make Georgia the most attractive
state in the country to practice and you
can do that with some of these things
that's a you know that's that's just a a
goal that when you're looking at
Staffing Georgia and Staffing the rural
areas that's one one kind of test to to
see if it's going to be if it's going to
work is it going to make Georgia more
attractive than other places to practice
medical schools have a have a a big role
in recruiting doctors to rural areas
encouraging primary care I think Mercer
medical school is a great example of
that they do an incredible job and
students coming in there know that
that's kind of the the route rural
scholarships are helpful and also
getting the getting the students out
into rural areas to work with community
physicians so they can learn what it's
really like to practice in these areas
can be very effective in in helping to
recruit to rural areas
pme or graduate medical education is
probably the biggest opportunity
we surveyed doctors when they were
leaving residency
about where they were going to practice
and where they did their residency was
one of the was basically more important
than where they went to medical school
and even where they were from so we're
so getting those graduate programs into
Regional areas is a huge step so we've
you know it used to be Augusta and
Atlanta with only places you could train
in Georgia now we've got Macon and we've
got Savannah and we've got Gainesville
and a lot of other I think I believe
Rome and Albany so lots and even
Colquitt County and and they've done
really done a good job in trying to get
those residents educated in the rural
areas so there'd be more likely to stay
there I'm really excited in Gainesville
which is about 30 minutes down the road
we've got
several residency programs especially
family practice emergency medicine
general surgery which is greatly needed
throughout the rural areas so hopefully
some of those graduates are going to be
coming to the rural areas
so in in uh in conclusion uh
communities and hospitals need to
identify the doctors that they can bring
to their areas but those doctors also
need to know that that's where they want
to go to so you can't put a round peg in
a square hole we can't sell Habersham
counties Atlanta and Atlanta can't try
to
to
serve up a position that really wants to
be in a rural area too
and there's lots of ways to do that it's
I
if we can maybe tear down some of those
silos that were mentioned
and and get other agencies to work
together all for the common goal it
would be a great way to
for everyone to work on the same page
and everyone to to run the relay race
the first Speaker this morning did a
great job she presented so much
information and I hope I haven't been to
redundant so any any questions I could
answer
Senator compassion thank you for what
you do in the trenches every day it
matters a lot and I didn't realize until
you said you'd been in practice 30 years
which is how long I was in practice
before I retired that I'm old enough to
be his mother but
but what I was gonna I was gonna second
what you said about graduate medical
education I think that's a key piece of
the puzzle that we can do more with
because medical school's one thing but
where you do your residency matters a
lot in terms of whether you stay or go
one question I had as you the number of
doctors that the attrition over the
years was
very startling to see on a slide
was that just people edging out or was
there something else going on it was
some aging out some moving moving to
other locations just not getting the
support they needed
um
but yeah that that was basically it we
um I don't know it's a number a number
of factors that went into that
but it was it was a fact in that again
you can't
you can't have a great facility unless
you have the Personnel to to to work in
and you have to what all boils down to
the patients the patients you have to
have patience if you want a successful
facility you have to have patience and
uh
and without without the Physicians to
bring those patients to the hospital
it's uh it's it's you're not getting
your return on your investment um the
in addressing the other
your point
um in the Medical College of Georgia OB
GYN program
um residency began sending doctors to
Rome Georgia to do rotations there
um because they're they're just not
getting the number of cases that they
need to to satisfy their residency
requirements and I've been also able to
have those residents come rotate with me
and operate with me just to to get those
and that's a they they've been effective
in Rome and in helping in basically
retaining some of those residents they
get to see what it's like to practice in
Rome Georgia and some of those those
graduates have gone to Rome to practice
so we've started that here and hopefully
we'll see those same fruits of our labor
any other questions
Senator Walker
uh daughter Hatchet thank you for your
presentation and uh it's great to see
you again
I have recently visited in Dublin at
Fairview Park hospital with the uh CEO
over there Don Avery and his senior
staff and chairman had the other
chairman Hatchet uh uh Matt Hatchett and
I met with them and they've made a real
concerted effort for really decades now
on physician Recruitment and just from
the outside looking in it appears to me
that well they've been successful doing
it first of all but it appears to me
that it's been a real Community effort
over there and that the community
recognizes the value of bringing in
Physicians and how it impacts their
quality of life their health care but
also their economy and so the whole
community's got behind it so I think
that's a real valid point that you made
on the on the community part I do want
to I'm not are you familiar with the
program the rural physician program that
Mercer University has I think Governor
Deal started it but they they also have
a rural physician scholarship program
that's that's been successful well do
you know about that or
yeah a certain brother of mine works
kind of for Mercer too and he may or may
not have made a phone call to me about a
graduating resident who in OB GYN who
had the Nathan Deal scholarship and uh
so I may or may not have made contact
with this President and she may not have
or she delivered uh two she did two
C-sections this morning while we were
meetings she she joined uh basically
um I I my practice I had this I had my
practice here for 30 years and it just
became necessary
for one thing to recruit other doctors
so by joining with Northeast Georgia
Medical Center I was able to recruit Dr
Howard to join us so I think that's a
great a great program and Dr Howard has
been a has been a godsend so uh that at
Super and it's it's ironic that both she
and I live in the Clarksville area only
about five or ten minutes from Governor
deals so we're I'm trying to arrange a
breakfast so we can all get together
well thank you
yeah thank you so much and uh great to
meet you for the first time we've been
enjoy working with your son and your
brother I take it in the house
um
what's what's the impact of uh over and
over doctors that deliver babies are
going out of the business
and um
how does that impact the whole you know
where does where does that play in the
dynamic of keeping a hospital in a
medical Community Bible with Services
it's you know a vital fundamental
service that we're going to need babies
are going to keep coming yeah yeah I
mean you're looking at the start of life
and um
I I can't I'm not a hospital
administrator and I don't run hospitals
but uh you know I heard it from previous
administrators that if you can take care
of a mother who's having her baby and
you do a good job of doing that then
she's going to bring her baby back to
this hospital if the baby gets sick or
if she gets sick and then she's gonna if
her husband needs medical care she's
going to bring her husband here because
the women often are control the health
care in the family and then they're
going to bring then she's going to bring
her parents or her in-laws to take to
here so if you can start with that
initial you know labor and delivery in
the emergency department are usually the
first the two doors that most people get
their first experience in a hospital so
if you can do a good job delivering
babies
as well as the emergency department
you know you're more likely to have a
patient for for life that will will um
patronize your hospital so that's it's
very very important and it saddens me
the hospital in Stevens County which is
only 20 20 minutes from here their labor
and delivery was forced to close uh
within the last year or two
um
and the farther a woman has to go from
her home to deliver a baby the more
likely she is to have a a an adverse
outcome if you're less than 45 minutes
you've got a pretty good good chance if
you're over 45 minutes which we have
patients in Northern Raven County that
there's we're the basically the closest
hospital to them and some of them have
have
you know
are high-risk pregnancies so we we're we
can still take care of them and I'm I'm
hopefully that this practice is going to
continue to grow and we'll be able to do
that um but I don't I don't think they
should have to travel two hours to the
main campus in Gainesville or even to
Atlanta for care
because bad things will you know bad
things can happen that's that's another
opportunity for telemedicine
telemedicine has some really there's
some things that does not so good but
some things that can do very well and
and allowing women to have consults with
um higher perinatologists high-risk
pregnancy doctors or for babies in Us in
rural areas to be able to use
telemedicine for them to get the the
recommendations from neonatologists uh
it's huge it's a huge opportunity
especially and how is how has that
played out in this hospital setting uh
the
what you just described well we have we
had that service the the telemedicine
where we had a physician in Atlanta that
was providing that service and the
patients instead of having to go to
Atlanta or Gainesville they would just
come here to the hospital just right
across the hall and they would see a
sonographer and and have an ultrasound
and the physician could look in and see
that live and then have an interaction
with that patient there so it saved many
people like three hours commuting to to
see a physician
um
the I'm I'm keep I'm trying to be the
squeaky wheel to to keep that service
going as well as to just to begin the
neonatal uh the neonatal telemedicine I
just think that's a great opportunity
with a nurse practitioner here in our
Nursery we could have a conference with
a neonatologist in Gainesville or
anywhere and take care of a baby because
it's not always that Hands-On that you
need you need the expertise on what to
do with the current situation what the
current condition and just you need
guidance and that's where the
telemedicine can really be helpful
foreign
thank you very much I'm available
afterwards to tell stories about the
chairman when he was growing up
thanks Dave
all right next is uh
Diane with uh the chief human resource
officer at Northeast Georgia Health
System
yeah come on up
and thank y'all for hosting us today
I'm sorry you want us to we're good okay
um we have a third member and it's Diane
Poirot so uh I didn't want to butcher
your last name if you are an Agatha
Christie fan and you like her kill poiro
it's the same last name so uh either
people butchered or they were like are
you related to Hercule and I'm like uh
that's a fictional character so
so no I'm not and I've got my colleagues
here Melissa and Nicholas and they'll
introduce themselves
um I have we got the Powerpoint ready
and while she's pulling that up I just
want to say as you know Northeast
Georgia Health System has two rural
hospitals Lumpkin and now Haversham and
they are very much critical to our
overall plan for the area a lot of
people a lot of the healthcare
organizations are looking at smaller
critical access hospitals so they can
have referral patterns for you know
specialty care that's really not part of
what we are doing we already have about
85 percent of the market in the
Gainesville area and we don't need more
business to come to Gainesville we just
need these services to be provided
closer to home and quite frankly we
wouldn't be able to our emergency room
is packed as you know we're always
packed in the hospital we've already
done semis so we are we're doing two
beds in one room which is very unusual
we have not gone on diversion at all in
the last year or so again having the
rural hospitals is critical to being
able to serve our service area so we are
very about ensuring that hospitals like
these not only survive but Thrive I am
going to talk a little bit about nursing
and the state of nursing right now and a
little bit about that do you need I do
have a
okay I was gonna say I brought a thumb
drive Okay so
um I do like I'm prepared um I'll talk a
little bit about the state of the
workforce right now in Georgia so you
know what we're what we're dealing with
then Melissa is going to talk about some
of the initiatives that we've done at
nghs and then my colleague Nicholas will
follow it up he's the director of
physician recruitment so he's going to
talk and elaborate more on what Dr
Hackett was speaking about and some of
the efforts there and I only wish we had
brought John Dalzell who was over our
gme program I think you would love to
hear from him so if you
you got it okay you can go to the next
one and so just to kind of look at
Georgia nursing by the numbers
um first of all there's one thousand one
hundred and one thousand four hundred
sixty five RNs and LPNs um currently
employed in the state of Georgia and
only a 1.2 percent nursing unemployment
and that assumes that that 1.2 actually
wants to work in nursing we've seen a
lot of people that have left
um that have left the uh the profession
especially we saw an accelerated leaving
of working for health care providers um
during covid because it was very very
difficult in 2010 there was 6914 nursing
jobs posted in the state of Georgia and
that's when we thought we had a crisis
okay last year thirty four thousand five
hundred and one's jobs posted nursing
jobs posted in the state of Georgia and
of course we can't fill those so again
assuming the 1.2 percent want to work
that's only about 1200 nurses it
certainly will not fill the 34
000 and then over the next several years
the next decade Georgia schools predict
to graduate 705 RNs and 228 LPNs but it
still will not fill the need just over
those next 10 years we'll be short 133
RNs every year and we'll be sure short
22 LPNs and that assumes LPNs are going
to be not at the bedside what we've seen
is LPNs were doing team-based nursing
about what 5 10 15 years ago you saw an
exodus of LPNs from the bedside from the
hospital going to our toward an RN model
now we're reestablishing team-based
nursing but we just don't have the LPNs
to be able to do that so a lot of what
we have are contract LPNs that are
coming in from outside the state which
of course we're paying good money for I
mean a lot of money for that a lot of
money for that and but if that's what we
need to do to take care of our patients
of course that's what we're going to do
and then going to the next slide um
talking about the top five concerns so
this is the top five so it's not going
to add up to 100 because it's the top
five so the market shortage of qualified
RNs that's the nursing leaders top the
top one of the top five concerns again
we're not going to have we thought we
had a shortage now we know we have a
shortage and we're working through that
a big one now is the abuse directed at
nurses and I'll give you a little bit
more data on that but we see that I am
reporting out on employee injuries
almost every day to leadership and I'm
usually reporting out on physical
assaults verbal assaults gesture
assaults even sexual assaults increase
in nursing labor costs and again we've
seen that because of having to bring
agency in agency typically if you were
paying a nurse about 40 to 50 dollars
agency would be maybe 65 to 75 dollars
we saw prices go as high as 225 dollars
an hour during covid and we still have
not gotten down to pre-covered numbers
so a lot of people they just want to
travel so that they can keep getting
that higher amount of money
um unresolved RN burnout we we know
there's physician burnout we're doing a
lot for that but there's also RN burnout
it's been really really difficult over
the last three years and so again
getting people the time off that they
need to go and take care of themselves
it's really difficult when you don't
have the staff there that you need to
take care of the patient so we really
have to get quite creative with that
we've been trying uh different
strategies and not just to develop but
for um for Staffing and for scheduling
and I'm happy to answer any questions
about that I can get real geeky about
that so I'll warn you that now
again I just talked to you about the
academic pipeline will not meet the
projected demand and that is not just
for nurses that is for Respiratory
therapists it's for Diagnostic Imaging
it's for all the clinicians and Allied
health professionals that are going to
be needed to take care of the patient
population and then further nurses are
worried about recruitment of the
unlicensed Workforce too okay so if you
don't have somebody to clean that room
if you're not if you don't have somebody
to cook the food and pass the tray and
right now because we saw unemployment go
so low that's becoming really really
difficult to get people to take those
food nutrition services it used to be we
paid more than than fast food and we
offered benefits and everything well now
fast food is doing you know 15 17 18 an
hour and a lot a lot more flexible
schedules and so again making sure that
we have that Staffing to cover the
non-licens is just as important
and so um again I wanted to give you
some uh some data about workplace
violence because this is a Hot Topic
right now in healthcare and it's a Hot
Topic with the people that work for us
um this this comes from a premier
Workforce um survey that was done this
year February April and the percentage
of Workforce directly involved in a
workplace violent violence incident in
the last two years 40 of the 669 people
that took the survey reported that they
had experienced a workplace violence
event and then you can see nurses got a
little bit more of the brunt of it so
out of that 669 people
um 43 we experience violence non-nursing
but 65 percent of the nursing in that
group said they experience violence 47
of the um all respondents said you know
yes emotional verbal abuse 34 said yes
it was nurses and then again 53 percent
physical or sexual abuse 66 percent of
nurses felt that and there's a lot of
reasons that I'm sure my nurse colleague
here could talk to you about there's
patients that but you know they they may
be a correctional patient they may be a
social patient that right now there's
there's not a place to put them and so
nurses are still dealing with these
folks even though they may not need to
be in the hospital anymore
and then I if you want to go ahead so
there was another data there um with
prescany and press Gainey actually
surveys hospitals they don't survey all
of them but out of the 483 Hospital
Systems in their um in their database
they collected data for just three
months of last year and over 5 000
nurses in that time period had stated
that they were in some type of workplace
violence assault and again in this
particular one it was forcible unwanted
physical or sexual contact whether or
not there's intent to harm that's not
being yelled at that's not you know
gestures and we we look at all that
because we consider all of that assault
and so the question becomes is how can
we take all of these facts addressing
our landscape in healthcare right now
and really not just provide for the big
hospitals but also the critical access
hospitals and so forth because this
stuff is happening everywhere and so we
have to be cognizant that the the nurses
that are coming into the workforce the
doctors that are coming into the
workforce the non-certified people
they're all worried about this and so
what can we do to address this obviously
we can't just wait for nursing schools
to submit more nurses or or we have to
be proactive and start doing some of
these things and so with that I'm going
to turn this over to Melissa Rouse my
colleague and she's going to talk to you
about some of the things that we've done
at Northeast Georgia to address this and
again these things will also impact
rural hospitals
I'm gonna just pause for just a second I
think Senator Patrick has uh just one
thing I just wanted to point out is that
we had a study committee on violence
against health care workers when we did
pass legislation on it this year yes so
we are doing something yeah and and let
me say that I do appreciate it because
we did get to offer some feedback on
that legislation and I appreciate that
there were some things that might have
been onerous to report and you listened
to us and we really appreciated that we
want to take active steps to make sure
we're addressing workplace violence but
not necessarily
um
more reporting that that takes up
resources and we want to be able to
report the app apt amount of report but
we don't want to be so onerous that it
gets to be difficult to manage so really
appreciate you taking our feedback on
that
thank you so good afternoon I'm Melissa
Rouse I'm the executive director of
nursing excellence and research so
Recruitment and Retention has always
been an issue right we've always been
concerned about that and I've always had
plans on how we're going to meet the
workforce needs but more significantly
over the last couple of years it has
just grown and grown into those
statistics that Diane just shared so in
early 2022 our chief executive officer
kind of called a group together and said
hey we've got to have a plan like a
really strategic plan over these next
five years of how we're going to tackle
this and so we had multi-faceted plan
related to that but one of the things
that I was tasked with was pipeline they
said Melissa go be creative and figure
out how you're going to do this and so I
went to my partner schools University of
North Georgia is one of our partner
universities we have come alongside them
and have committed funding for the next
five years for them to create an
accelerated BSN program so that's a
program where if you have a bachelor's
degree you can become an RN in 15 months
so it's like a second degree program to
become a nurse and so we partnered with
them to hire faculty to get that program
up and running and now are hoping to
recruit all of those folks into
Northeast Georgia Health System I also
met with our technical colleges and and
we really put our thinking caps on
around how can we get workforce out
quicker and they had a summer program
for their CNAs it was an eight-week
summer program and that was the quickest
route to get a CNA and so I said what if
we offered that over and over and over
throughout the year could we do that
could we create a pipeline in that
regard and so we started it it was a hit
and we've been doing that since 2022.
um North Georgia Tech then said hey what
about us we want to do this too and so
now they're offering that eight-week
accelerated CNA program and then North
Georgia Tech really has been a great
partner in listening to where our needs
are not only for nurses but also for
LPNs and so we've got a a program
running with both linear attack and
North Georgia to get LPNs in a quick
fashion in a one-year program they are
ready to come to work for us
then as you think about pipeline the
LPNs are saying well what about us where
is our career growth and so North
Georgia Tech recently you may be aware
recently got approved for a LPN to RN
bridge program and so they'll soon be
accepting their first class and that
will get us a nurse quicker so lots of
creative opportunities in really
partnering with our schools to say how
can we help you help us to get this
pipeline moving and create nurses that
we can hire and then Bernal University
who sits right in our backyard in our
Gainesville Campus has really come
forward and said what about us we want
to be part of this too and so we're
looking at some Innovative programs
right now to be able to partner with
them
so um next slide please
in looking at our pipeline we also kind
of just got together and said okay any
idea is a good idea let's just throw
ideas out there and let's just
brainstorm and as we were talking about
the competition of where people are
going you know they're going to work in
fast food and they're going to work in
all of these other areas other than
health care and we said what if we lower
the hiring age to 16.
imagine that like people are like whoa
wait a second six with 16 year olds
running around the hospital that can't
be but we said no no we can do this we
can create a safe environment for them
we can train them to do the things that
they need to do and give them that
entree into the Health Care system and
so we do have a lowered hiring age now
I'm excited to say we have a nice
training program for 16 year olds you
know many of them if you have 16 year
olds they need life skills
um and so we've done a really nice job
of getting them into the health system
in whatever capacity they're interested
in and now they have career
opportunities to grow with us at
Northeast Georgia the advancement
programs that are listed there are the
ones that I spoke of a minute ago so
that PCT and LPN program we partner with
linear attack in North Georgia Tech
through the generosity of our foundation
as well as the funding that we have
budgeted through Northeast Georgia
Health System we are sending these folks
to school we're paying for their tuition
their books their uniforms their fees
everything
it's a game changer and it had just such
powerful stories from these folks about
how this has changed their lives
um so in eight weeks they can become a
patient care Tech they sign a contract
to stay for two years with us and our
hope is to continue them on the pipeline
so we have the PCT advancement program
for a non-licensed person so if you work
in our Hospital in dietary services or
environmental services and you think you
might want to get into Health Care this
is a program that can help you get that
start we also recruit from the outside
so you know we didn't want to just be
robbing Peter to pay Paul from within we
want to bring new people into the
organization and so we've hired folks
into these positions as well
our LPN advancement program we require
that they have a CNA so that they can
work part-time while they're going to
school so same program where we pay
tuition books fees everything and they
work part-time and then are paid a
full-time salary so that they're paid
for the time that they're studying and
doing clinicals and things of that sort
so in one year we have an LPN out of
that program we just had our first one
graduate we're very excited and we have
seven that just started this fall that
will be going through the program
and then the next step of that is our
PCT to RN program we're getting ready to
launch that for the fall we're putting
all of our publicity together right now
to start recruiting for that so that
program will be similar to the others
and that will pay for all of those
things
um we're going to partner with our Tech
schools because we can get an RN quicker
so instead of going to a four-year
program they'll they'll go through the
two-year program and so linear attack
and North Georgia Tech are very excited
to partner with us in that and then the
LPN to RN program that's the bridge
program that was just approved at North
Georgia Tech so we have students
applying for that right now so I'm very
proud of those programs and then a
couple of other creative programs that
we have the compass PCT program is a
program for nursing students who want to
come work in the hospital over the
summer so it's a 12-week program they
come in they get paid full-time hours
and they function like a CNA or a
patient care Tech and get real-life
Hospital experience we rotate them
through the department so they can find
Department that they're really
passionate about whether it's the
emergency department or oncology or
Pediatrics and then at the end of that
12-week program we hope that they'll
stay on PRN or per diem so that they can
continue going to nursing school and
then we'll hire them into our Residency
program on graduation
and then the two new programs that we
started this year that we're excited
about the PCT immersion program
is a hybrid of that Compass PCT so this
was the fifth year running our Compass
PCT program so we did this offshoot
where you work for us for those 12 weeks
but you work two shifts each week as a
patient care tag and one shift partnered
with an RN so now we're moving them into
the RN world they're in nursing school
already they have competencies they've
been signed off on so they get to start
getting some of that real word world
practice and we rotate them through
departments as well so it's that same
opportunity to really find their passion
and the unit that they want to be hired
into
and then in partnership with University
of North Georgia we started a Nurse
extern Program actually I'm sorry let me
back up to the PCT immersion that's the
partnership with the University of North
Georgia so while they're in the RN role
partnered with an RN they're getting
school credit for that so it's a really
nice opportunity for them to continue
getting credits for school over the
summer time while they're here getting
all of that experience as well Bernal is
very excited about partnering with us
for that for next year so I'm hoping to
take that on the road and get more
schools involved in doing that the nurse
extern program is a program where we are
taking nursing students we'll bring them
in in the summer as well as in the
Christmas break time frame that winter
break so that they can spend an extended
period of time with us to get oriented
and then their commitment will be one
shift every other week so that they can
stay connected to us while they finish
nursing school and then hopefully hire
into our nurse Residency program so all
different opportunities not one size
fits all but lots lots of different
opportunities for people to get into our
health system find out who we are and
really become acclimated to the
Northeast Georgia Health System and find
their career path did you want to add
just want to first of all commend my
colleague here because she's really been
involved in a lot of these programs and
we can but I do want to give one little
um so you're going to ask does do these
work
and so I will tell you I I've only been
here for a year we had 9456 employees
last year we have over 11 000 employees
now this year now 400 of those are came
from Haversham but we are still a
thousand employees to the good we have
reduced our our contract labor by half
from 157 million to about 70 million so
again these programs are working and
kudos to first of all Northeast Georgia
Health System for funding some also our
auxiliary for funding some our
foundation for funding some but these
are great programs that are already
tried and true and if there's any
funding out there that would be great
absolutely I will say that we just put
our budget together for fiscal year 24
and I had to figure out where do I want
to invest in these programs where is
where are we going to get the most bang
for our buck which of course is the RN
programs right because that's where our
greatest need is but it's hard to make
those decisions and so I applied for a
Department of Labor Grant didn't get it
but we'll try again and we'll try to
find more funding it was Federal a
federal department of labor Grant to
partner with all these schools let me
stop and ask you about the RN program
that you're referring to was is it just
the PCT to RN or the LPN to RN which
which one of those is is most successful
do you think so we haven't started those
yet those are starting this fall
um the patient care to RN is a two-year
program so that would be a quick way to
get a registered nurse the LPN to RN is
a 17-month program so they're already a
licensed practical nurse they just need
to get the registered nurse education so
17 months we'll have that one so trying
to figure out you know which which one
do we want to put our most the most
effort into to try to get an RN as
quickly as possible one of the things
that Diane mentioned do you have a
question Senator Kirkpatrick I just um
so I'm sitting here thinking about I
couldn't get 16 year olds out of my head
but but I was thinking about so we're
we're pushing people through these
programs so we can have bodies on the
floor to take care of the pay patients
what do you have ongoing to continue
their education because they're going to
be green when they come out how are you
setting up for mentorship and for
ongoing education because that
experience is uh you know that's what
causes burnout but it also is the people
that you want taking care of you if
you're a patient so how are you Humanity
thank you for asking I couldn't plan
that better so we started an LPN
Residency program so for these folks
that are coming out as LPNs we we've had
a registered nurse Residency program
which is a one-year program to really
support them transition to practice we
started one for our LPNs and so we're
heavily recruiting new grad LPNs into
our organization right now and
supporting them that way those that go
through these programs have a connection
with the coordinators that will continue
to support them so they're out rounding
on the units while they're through
orientation and then we want to move
them through all of these career
Pathways so continuous development we
have Under My Umbrella we have all the
the nursing education and so we do an
annual needs assessment survey with our
staff to see what are you interest
interested in you know what classes do
you want we have very generous programs
to be able to send people to conferences
to give them all kinds of upskilling so
that's definitely on our mind is to make
sure that not only do we get them out
the door and out taking care of patients
but that we continue to give them
development opportunities yeah really
great question the last thing that I'll
touch on on that side is work based
learning and so as we were thinking
about our 16 year olds that we needed to
get into the health system I was invited
to a middle school fair and I went out
and talked to them and in middle school
as you guys know in the state of Georgia
they're declaring this pathway that they
want and so I had all of these kids that
thought they might be interested in a
healthcare career and when I went I went
with the idea of recruiting for
Northeast Georgia overall not everyone
wants to be a nurse but if you're in I.T
you know if you like techy things we've
got I.T positions if you want to be an
engineer come work for facilities if you
want to be in Food Service come work for
our dietary so really talking to them
about all the opportunities that we have
in our health system and so we created a
Workforce Development coordinator
position so our leadership said okay I
see where you're going with this let's
see what this looks like and so we've
hired this person and she goes out to
the middle school she goes out to the
high schools she's recruiting for all of
our positions not just nursing all
positions and linking these folks into
our organization we bring them in they
do rotations through different
departments we take our simulation bus
out and get them exposed to things in
health care so that has really created a
lot of energy and excitement for folks
to come into the healthcare setting we
have hired many of the patients or the
students from work based learning so
they've come in in high school and then
we've hired them into positions because
remember we hire at 16 so it's the
perfect way
it's a perfect way to get them in
um I will say too that you know we have
so many great opportunities for high
school students right now to go to a CNA
program while they're in high school and
so they're finishing and and they are
CNAs in their Junior and senior years of
high school but they didn't have
opportunities to go work in a health
system so we said let's do flexible
schedules let's take them for whatever
hours they'll give us so we have four
hours six hours and eight hour shifts
that we can bring these kids into if
they work after school or if they can
only work on the weekends you know some
of them have modified schedules so we've
really had to get creative around how we
create opportunities to recruit folks
into our organization so those are the
programs that we have going right now
they are just hitting the tip of the of
the the spear in in what we need of
course but at least you know we're
getting some momentum and getting things
moving if you can move to the next slide
um this is just a little bit about
retaining our employees and some some of
the things we've talked about Senator
Kirkpatrick asked about those career
Pathways we have a lot of leadership
initiatives about connecting with your
employees and making sure that they are
happy that they're adjusting that it's a
right fit for them you know having those
30-day 60-day 90-day check-ins and then
those monthly or quarterly check-ins to
see where our employees are and we're
having conversations with them about how
do I help you get to that next step what
is it that you want in your career path
and how can we find that for you in
Northeast Georgia
pay Diane talked about pay a bit we've
come up with some creative programs for
people to work PRN or per DM and so we
have four levels now so they can pick
the level that they want to work at
based on how much commitment they want
to give us for hours and the pay
increases with the amount of commitment
so again flexible way to really help
people with work-life balance to really
meet the needs of their families
hour increases yes foreign
yes exactly so let's say you commit to
three shifts of pay period you make a
certain dollar amount but if you if you
agree to six shifts per pay period you
make more money and if you agree to
eight shifts for pay period you make
even more money and then 12 shifts so it
goes up as as the different levels go up
so that's appealing for people you know
if you've got kids in school and you
can't work a full-time schedule but you
you still want to commit to the
organization
and then that first dot Point uh Crisis
Prevention Institute you know Diane
talked a bit about the the violence that
our employees are facing we are our
staff has said we don't feel safe we
need things put into place to make us
feel safe and so we've offered this
Crisis Prevention Institute we put
almost a thousand employees through that
last year and we're on target to bring
500 through this year
um they've asked for increased security
and so we're trying to increase security
presence we've put some things into
place around
um a a badge that you can push a button
on for a panic button and it's got some
rtls so we can find you you know
security knows where you are in the
building so lots of things being put
into place to help increase the
workplace safety
next slide
this is the voluntary turnovers all the
work that we've been doing around
Pipeline and retention really it's a
constant cycle right so if you're short
staffed it's hard to keep your staff
because they're exhausted and so they
leave but as you hire more staff you get
happier staff because they have peers
they have people there with them and so
it's all interrelated and so this is our
voluntary turnover you can see that the
national Benchmark is 18.8 percent we
started at 16 and we really were not
happy with that and have worked very
hard to get it down to 12.9 turnover for
a full-time and part-time staff that's
overall staff in the organization and
then the next slide is our nursing
turnover so as we're talking about our
nursing staff you can see the Benchmark
at the top there is 18.2 we were at 16
in October of 22 and we are now at 11.3
so we've really done a lot of work to
um to recruit and retain thank you it's
been a a yeoman's effort for sure lots
of good work around that yes it is and
and I think it's just proof that these
programs speak volumes right and so even
if we're only putting
seven people through LPN school everyone
sees that and they're like wow they're
trying they're trying to do things to
help be creative and and create some new
processes for us to get staff in here
and then my final slide this next slide
is just some opportunities you know I
was thinking about what what can the
state do to help what are some ideas to
really help support the programs that
we're starting and the programs that we
need to continue with increasing that
workplace safety is at the top because
that is first and foremost what we hear
from our staff I know a lot of work has
been done and thank you for that around
protecting the identity of the injured
you know staff is sometimes hesitant to
file that police report because it's
public record right and that bad guy can
find your your address and and come to
your house and so we've heard stories of
those types of things and so staff it
goes around and people talk right and so
then they're afraid harsher penalties
are certainly something that our staff
is asking for and then funding for
increase security you know just like
every Department Security is challenged
as well and so we need to make that
enticing so that security officers want
to come work in the health system to be
there to help protect our staff and then
ways to attract to the Northeast Georgia
region you know to Georgia overall but
certainly to the Northeast Georgia
region where our hospitals are you know
incentivizing and I think Dr Hatchett
spoke to some of these things so it's
nice to see the same themes right so
student loan payback whether they go to
school here or we recruit them in from
outside being able to help pay those
loans back state tax incentives I have
lived in California Florida Texas and
now here and my husband is a retired
veteran and a disabled veteran and so
state taxes are something that are quite
appealing As you move from state to
state and benefits around things like
the toll road any of those types of
things that make a difference in that
monthly income car registration breaks
are an idea you know housing incentives
I think just anything that makes it more
appealing to come to this area
and then I think Dr Hatchet touched on
um just really selling the beauty of
Georgia I I've been here for almost two
years I did not know where Gainesville
Georgia was when I was recruited out
here but I said let's go check it out
and I got here and I was just in love I
absolutely love this it's my favorite
place that we've ever lived and my
husband has started a business here and
we are planted and so we are committed
to making this the best place possible
and bringing as many people as we can
here I'm recruiting like crazy
thank you Melissa my name is Nicholas
Benton the director of physician
recruitment for Northeast Georgia
Physicians Group and Georgia Heart
Institute so both of the two employed
medical groups at Northeast Georgia and
I wanted to
um I guess build on surgical recruitment
I know that that was a focus of this
committee and so I kind of wanted to
double click on some of the challenges
what the landscape looks like as we go
out to recruit a surgeon keeping in mind
that we're recruiting on a national
stage when we're recruiting a surgeon
we're not recruiting locally so I pulled
some data from the American College of
Surgeons and per capita supply of U.S
general surgeons declined 18
from 6.4 per 100
000 population to 5.2 100 000 population
between 2020 excuse me 2001 and 2019.
rural areas declined 29.1 percent and
small and isolated rural communities
declined 32.6 percent so that's very
dramatic as it affects rural communities
in addition 48.8 percent of urban
general surgeons are over 50 years of
age compared to 55 percent in large
rural areas and 59 percent in small
rural areas
in 2019 60.1 of non-metropolitan
counties have no active general surgeon
approximately a thousand general
surgeons graduate each year
less than 20 percent of those actually
go into general surgery most of them go
on to do fellowships to do something
more specialized
and an estimated of the 20 that go into
general surgery about 12 graduates a
year end up in rule in a rural setting
nationally we're talking about the
national stage and to give you an idea
of the number of openings for those 12
graduates they're 1700 job openings
enroll the rural U.S
so that's um just wanted to kind of
paint a little bit of a picture of what
we're working with when we're talking
about recruitment of a general surgeon
and this is not unique to General
Surgery I'm just highlighting this
particular specialty and
next slide please
so a little bit to build on kind of what
Dr Hatchet had mentioned thank you Dr
Hatchett how we recruit to rural
communities and the things that my team
focuses on and the um incentives that we
try to promote that are available to us
so one of the things is we try to
utilize the rural Health Care
initiatives to include both the state
loan repayment plan the lrp and we also
focus in on the J-1 waiver program
as in addition to that we incentivize
our physicians through signing bonuses
loan repayments I think Dr Hatchett had
mentioned sometimes if we have someone
that's interested in practicing and
they're going into a fellowship and
they're from Habersham let's say we'll
go ahead and sign them really early and
we'll provide them an income stipend
while in Fellowship to go ahead and get
them to make a commitment
so it's just some unique things that we
try to help lock in those Physicians
that want to come back and practice and
Rule areas
we also really focus on the positive so
some of the things that Dr Hatchet had
mentioned the lower cost of living the
idea of the hometown hero so he's at the
Walmart he everyone recognizes him
everyone's asking him questions these
Physicians are very valued in the
community and then that is really
something that is something that we try
to sell right you're going to make a
huge impact you're not going to be one
of 500 Physicians you're going to be one
of a very small community
in addition to that we also highlight
your professional Independence a lot of
times as a general surgeon you can
practice a more full scope versus if
you're in a large metropolitan area
you're going to be very limited you're
going to be doing very limited
procedures whereas in
some rural areas you can practice a more
full scope
um obviously highlighting it's a great
place to raise a family and then of
course the excuse me
I need some water yeah the Abundant
recreational activities
um
another really important piece is the
current physician involvement
thank you sorry
mm-hmm
people are already so the people that
are already here so there's nothing more
difficult than recruiting your first
physician to a community
um so if you do have a medical community
we try to make those connections a lot
of times we're making connections with
board members with local government the
mayor sometimes I mean I've recruited in
some really rural areas where we are
hosting physician dinners at the mayor's
house or at a physician's house because
we may not always have
um you know a lot of places to take
someone out to meet colleagues and
things like that which is a part of that
whole onboarding and recruitment process
keeping in mind we're also recruiting
the family it's not all about the
surgeon we're recruiting the spouse and
the family so we've got to talk about
schools we've got to talk about cost of
living we've got to talk about housing
we've got to really focus on a lot of
different aspects to that physician to
sell the position and this is not a lot
different than what we do in more of our
Urban environments but we just have to
focus a lot more on the community and
all the attributes that are available to
those Physicians within rural practices
the next slide
so some of the things that my department
utilizes as I've mentioned previously is
the state loan repayment programs
so these are not without limitations and
where I thought that we could
potentially talk about some
opportunities where we could have
potentially some expansion or or
otherwise but one of the first one is
the Physicians for Rural Aries
assistance program this is a loan
repayment program that is available and
I can offer this as an option there's a
very limited window that you can apply
for this
but it's available I think it depends on
the funding and I think from the website
it was under 35 at least was what was
last reported and that number may not be
completely accurate but I did pull it
from the State website I think the last
time it was updated was 2017 so that
number may be a little bit more or less
um in addition to that not only is that
not a lot for the whole entire state of
Georgia but in addition to that we do
have the Georgia physician loan
repayment program but it's limited to
those Specialties in Family Medicine
Internal Medicine Pediatrics OB GYN
geriatrics and Psychiatry all of those
are considered your primary care
practices and a lot of the programs that
we have are focused around primary care
and Primary Care is extremely important
but equally as important as some of the
sub-specialties and surgeons that would
not be eligible for that particular
program so in thinking about that having
an expansion of the types of individuals
that could apply for that loan repayment
program could be a nice incentive when
we talk about attracting Physicians to
rural communities
the other area that we deal with is
related to the J-1 waiver program as
Georgia has two or at least what's
available to me within the Northeast
region are two programs for J1 waivers
the first is the Conrad 30 that's the
national program Georgia has adopted the
national program and that basically
grants 30 waivers in the entire state of
Georgia each year for Physicians
practicing again in Primary Care
um
excuse me primary care and the rural
environment Urban environment and
Specialists but they're prioritized
there's only 30 of those waivers that go
around the application opens up in the
fall it's usually closed very rapidly
like within days because obviously it's
a very popular program where we're
trying to bring in International Medical
graduates into rural environments to
help them plant roots and establish
relationships it's just a pathway it's
not our only pathway but it is a pathway
but the way that this program is
prioritized is that it all goes it's
focused around primary care and Rural
environments so it's prioritized for
rule first then primary care for the
urban environment and then potentially
Specialists if there's anything left
over but there's only 30. so a lot of
times those get used up the other
program that we do have available in
this area is the Appalachian Regional
Commission or the art program and that
opens up the additional ability for us
to bring J1 candidates into rural
markets but again it's very it's very
specific and focused around Family
Practice General Pediatrics obstetrics
internal medicine and Psychiatry so
those Primary Care practices there is a
pathway within that program that you can
apply for a waiver but it's an extra
Step Beyond what's what the program was
designed for and so each of those
programs although very important and we
do utilize those and we do sell them
have their limitations as it relates to
specialist and general surgery
the next slide I know it's kind of small
but I just wanted to show highlight on
3rnet annual report over last year how
that really plays out when we're looking
at the J1 waiver program this is not a
reflection of the entire U.S but the
3rnet as I understand it partners with a
tremendous amount of healthcare
organizations in rural uh in the U.S
across the U.S so under their program
there was
397 J-1 placements
and of those seven were for general
surgery
and then for physician Replacements
um just position placements within so
this sorry I should back up a little bit
the 3rn app helps Place Physicians that
have a job board they have resources
that they provide to all Physicians
looking for a work and rule in rural
areas
but of that they only place 14 general
surgeons within the rural areas of those
397 only seven of those were available
through the J-1 program
I will double click a little bit on the
J-1 program in that it'll it basically
allows the physician to have ties and a
commitment to the rural area for
approximately at least five years and
we're thinking by that point they'll
have established roots that will have
made community community connections and
will want to stay within that community
and so that's just one of the pathways
that we're utilizing I don't want to
stop you because this is a lot of really
good information but we're running short
on time because we have the three
o'clock but I was going to see if we
could get a copy of your presentation
absolutely
um and just thank you all once again for
hosting
yeah let's let's let okay
yeah just uh I used to run a big
Orthopedic Group and one of the trends
that we saw with the Millennials and
below is that they look at life a
different way and when they're in
medical training they tend to specialize
and narrow their focus and they so we'd
recruit an orthopedic surgeon he would
only want to do spine or would only want
to do fill in the blank so they care
more about quality of life and how many
nights they're on ER call than they do
about anything else so I think the
trauma angle might be worth exploring
for general surgery connecting with a
trauma Commission on that that might be
a good selling point because you're
fighting these societal trends that I
don't have an answer for but I think
your brainstorming needs to take that
into account not questions
anyone else
well there's so much to react to the
that and our time is limited so I know
we try to fit a lot into one meeting and
we really appreciate it
information and great Innovative
approaches I mean I
well thank you all very much
next we have Lisa jellum
dean of Atrium Health Floyds school of
health sciences at Georgia Highlands
College
thank you for hanging in there with us
throughout the whole day
you know I'm in education so I'm
slightly worried you guys are going to
say that I plagiarized my entire thing
but we know that it came out yesterday
but I Echo the room
and I'm done right
but so all right
okay so I'll go ahead and introduce
myself I'm Dr Lisa jellum I am the dean
of Atrium Health Floyd school of health
sciences I serve out of Georgia
Highlands College in Rome Georgia so
we've alluded to you know that rural
Workforce kind of coming to fruition I
get to see before my eyes I've been
there now for 16 years so I've grown up
in in rural education I am going to tell
you I am a product of Georgia
recruitment I came from Gillette Wyoming
probably one of the smallest places on
Earth
um
in efforts to get my doctoral degree a
terminal degree in education and I came
here specifically because of the tuition
assistance program that Georgia offers
so these programs do work and so you
know I've had a lot of uh you know we'll
call it the rubber meeting the road as
far as Education and Leadership and
seeing some of these programs actually
create you know people that are going to
root within Georgia
so today I'm wearing multiple hats I
actually am the vice president of the
Georgia Association of nursing Deans and
directors and so because of that the
Georgia nursing leadership Coalition is
a collaborative effort of just in insert
all of the acronyms you see up there if
you need any of those to to tease apart
I can help you and it's really just a
joint effort of all of these nursing
places so we are really trying to take
those silos and really break those down
because when I first became Dean I
thought it was innate to take all of the
community involvement and get out into
the community I took a hundred meetings
outside of my office and my first six
months of taking Dean ship because I
felt like you know that's the way you do
things where I come from in Wyoming you
go and look people in the eyes and you
shake their hands and you ask them you
know what is it that we're doing right
and what is it that we're doing wrong
and don't worry I can take the criticism
and I'm going to take that back and so I
was really really excited to be a part
of some kind of Coalition like this
to start to actually unify the front
between all of us just redundantly for
you know seven or eight hours telling
you the exact same thing over and over
again
so I'm going to give you a little bit of
the background of you know where Georgia
nursing is by the numbers I know in my
previous uh the previous slides was
looking at those that are employed I
would like to bring your attention to
about a 40 000 person disparity between
active licensure and those that are
actually employed in the state of
Georgia so we do see about 1 169 000
active licenses between the LPN and RN
communities
and what's really important for you to
know is in the next slide
when you're looking at capturing those
that are employed in RN settings about
60 percent a little uh closer to
two-thirds are looking at some form of
hospital setting so when you're looking
at the shortage and the effect of which
the RN specific shortage is going to
affect the most you are seeing the
hospitals specifically in the rural
areas
so if you needed more slides to you know
help you look at whether or not this
shortage actually occurs we have 2010 in
comparison to 2021 and so you can see
that the RN job postings over time have
exponentially grown in the state of
Georgia in the last 12 years I know that
that's not a secret to you but in the
next slide I think that you can paint a
better picture of where you're truly
seeing the disparity so in the previous
slide you saw the Metropolitan um
uh location expressed which took you
know 28 000 of those job postings so it
looks really large as far as the job
postings but when you tease out the
metropolitan area and you're only
looking at the Central Northeast
Northwest Southwest and in southeast
you're going to see where the disparity
truly lies and so when you're looking at
what the effect is in rural Georgia when
an RN isn't at the bedside that kind of
rolls down the hill and so I'm coming
from an education perspective of you
know in nursing education we are seeing
this just as much as they do at the
bedside when a Dean is taking out the
trash and you have your RN you know
educator is doing something besides
educating RNs you end up with
disparities like this because if I can't
fit that Workforce demand you know
you're going to see a shortage over time
and so we are now seeing what we thought
we were going to see about 10 years ago
when I started this conversation in the
Health Sciences that we are eventually
going to see nursing education come to a
big disparity in creating nursing
licensure and sure enough we're here
so there's a couple causes of the
shortage in rural nurses one of which
you know and I'm speaking in the behalf
of what I would call a geographically
um
unique area because people that are
getting licenses in Northwest Georgia
can easily commute to the metropolitan
area and if you're looking at the
disparity between Northwest Georgia and
the Metropolitan wage Gap a little over
ten thousand dollars if you're talking a
brand new graduate you know graduating
in Rome Georgia easily can take an hour
commute to hit the metropolitan area and
take that ten thousand dollar Gap so
that's already causing a geographical
problem for that shortage if there's
also a real lack of incentive to keep
our nurses in the rural areas and so
when I first became Dean I would tell
you that we had a lot of we'll call them
clinical Partners we were putting them
everywhere and I am a I am not a nurse I
am a teacher education major by trade
and I'm going to tell you where I
student taught I would have given my
left arm to be employed because I knew
who the janitor was I knew where to you
know get the food I knew if I parked in
the wrong spot that you know Johnny that
was going to drive by would give me the
head nod and I could move my car
our nurses and our Hospital workers work
the same way so where they're at and
where we're immersing them in it matters
because if I'm immersing 90 of my
clinical hours in a rural area you're
going to see our students have less
arousal levels when you're getting as
far as into an actual profession and
that's leading to some of the burnout
and so I don't have specific data
leading me towards that up but I'm going
to tell you anecdotally when my nursing
students look calm and then they get
nursing licenses and they're employed in
these hospitals you're going to see less
rates of burnout because they don't go
frantically into the workforce worried
about the things that you and I you know
as working adults we don't worry about
parking spots and little things that my
nursing students are worried about
because because that's one of the you
know what we'll call barriers for
success
so in our recommendations for the
Georgia
nursing leadership Coalition is
a page student loan forgiveness so
forgive portioning of the nursing
student debt if they commit to live and
work in rural Georgia that's one way
that we can incentivize our students for
staying out in the rural areas I don't
think that needs to be long-term a
long-term commitment as you said I think
it could be an upfront cost and I'm
going to tell you that I'm going to
piggyback upon that recommendation and
to tell you that
I serve a community that is 44 at
Georgia Highlands Pell Grant
um
that's a big deal because you're talking
I get a phone call once a month from a
student that's telling me I'm going to
quit nursing school because of a 50 bill
and so I'm always like wait a second
like how much are we talking here you
know is it hundreds of thousands we're
talking 60 bucks and so last year we
saved a student with a 300 bill that was
just very very confidently telling me
it's okay Dr jellum I'm gonna go ahead
and pause my nursing career I'll come
back next spring one full calendar year
they're going to pause their career
because of a 300 Bill and so it's not
just the loan forgiveness at the end
that is going to capture some of our
rural health care workers it's in time
funding it's access to funding that is
on top of the Pell grant that is on top
of the student loan that can incentivize
the worker to stay there
on top of at the end possibly doing some
form of forgiveness
for on the education side you know if
you're looking at ways for me to pass
through funding tax incentives for our
pre-licensure to have some ability to
have the um we won't call them
preceptorship but having my clinical
rotations have some form of tax
incentive for those clinical
practitioners to take on my clinicals so
we have this argument I would say once a
month in the Georgia Association of
nursing Deans and directors of what is
your capacity so if I look around the
room and I say you know what is your
capacity and I'm talking South Georgia
they're going to say it is I do not have
capacity based on clinical placements
you move to the next school and they're
going to tell you its physical capacity
you move to the next school they're
going to tell you it's nursing Educators
in fact they'll all tell you it's
nursing Educators let's not we'll go
that's a standard answer
but when you look at true capacity there
is 19 to 20 different Dynamic
possibilities that I have to take into
place before I say my capacity is 400 in
the program at Georgia Highlands because
I am responsible for getting 400
students from the start to the end and I
don't want it to get halfway through and
me decide well there are no clinical
placements for 200 students and I have
to tell these students to move to a
different place so there's a lot riding
on me falling on the capacity number
so when you talk
um ways for me to pass through funding
and open up actual capacity in nursing
education we have talked about investing
in a structured nurse Residency program
so when you're talking investing into
the hospital I think that's one of the
best recommendations that you know the
nursing Coalition has come up with
because not only are the nurse residency
programs showed higher retention rates
we know that the clinical confidence is
significantly higher we see a decrease
in Burnout in improved patient outcomes
but you're also going to see in the next
slide that we also ask that there is
some form of an incentive for exactly
what the previous presenters said and so
when these collaborative Partnerships
between the schools of Nursing and
health care providers are in place
you're going to see that this is a
reciprocity agreement between the
educational institution and the hospital
itself and a lot of these things you are
going to see will instantaneously
increase the probability that that
person Works within that hospital system
and so when that investment is made
that it also comes with some risk and so
in the next slide
the reason they asked me to talk is that
I have recently become the atrium Health
Floyd school of health sciences that
investment was made over the next five
years it's a multi-year partnership that
Atrium Health Floyd and Georgia
Highlands went into to increase my
nursing capacity
um 50 and so last year I was at a
capacity of about 200 percent in 2028 I
should be at 300 on paper
and I'm going to tell you that it came
with a multi-pronged of benefits and
like I said I serve a population of
people that Georgia Highlands was well
known as an access institution a
two-year Institution for many many years
our first uh we'll call it run at a
baccalaureate degree was the RN to BSN
it's highly popular it's a very very
prominent program and it was one way for
us to capture all of those RNs that we
had created at the two-year degree
program and get them into four-year
Baccalaureate programs right there in
Rome while they're working and that has
become very fruitful for us
give you a little bit of glance of why
it is that the hospital program picks
somebody like me I have a thousand
students right now that are
pre-professional in our Health
Professions associate degree which means
to me that all 1000 of those students
are prospective nursing students and
that means to the hospital that there
are a thousand students in the pipeline
that could become nurses
there's a caveat to this though is
everything that we've said about health
and all of the things you can't take
into account all of the things that
students and adult Learners in life will
bring to the table
and so because of that creativity is
going to be our best friend for the next
five to seven years in actually
performing a Workforce pipeline surgery
per se because we have three what I'll
call bottlenecks number one is at the
College and Career Academy at the high
school level getting those students into
proper courses in the dual enrollment
pathway that lead to quicker access to
nursing that's one of the bigger things
that we have worked in recruitment of
the K-12 is making sure that those
students are actually taking Anatomy 1
Anatomy 2 micro courses that are leading
towards actual admission into the
nursing program the CNA and the
phlebotomy all the things are super
great because our students can work as
they go to school that's super important
for an access institution but I'm going
to tell you that if a student takes
biology 1010 or chemistry 10-12 at the
college level that puts them six months
ahead of any other applicant at Georgia
Highlands currently to get into the
nursing program so it advising becomes
really important the other thing is that
the creation of the back the
baccalaureate degree in Health Sciences
has become what we thought was going to
be kind of the bullpen for nurses who
didn't get into our highly competitive
program they could stay they would gain
credits towards their BSN so no time is
lost no you know hope is wasted no
tuition none of that it's all a really
good thing and they on attempt two then
can get into the nursing program
we thought this is the third year of our
Bachelor of Health Science we thought 60
by now would be great as of this morning
I have 298 students in The Bachelor of
Science and health science
it is awesome because it's not just
nurses it has now become I raise my hand
I want to be a PA I want to be a doctor
I want to be a this I want to be a that
and we are now creating a very
affordable offer in Northwest Georgia
for students to not take on heavy
student loan payments we've created
relationships with the Medical College
of Georgia I serve on their Advisory
Board getting our Bachelor of health
science students into things like Grand
rounds and things right there where
those students don't have to you know be
completely online they can come and do
the things that a typical student we've
had high success rates of getting into
medical school and so that is something
that Georgia Highlands was very very and
the university system was very very
smart in creation to make sure that
those students had a way to not just
onboard into nursing but also offward if
something was to go wrong
so because of that Atrium Health Floyd
recognized all of the Innovative things
that we've been doing we have an LPN to
RN bridge program we have our RN program
that has 52 years of proof of concept
and so they are offering every student
in our um
in our nursing program so my line of
research comes in open educational
research or resources so that's just a
fancy way to say free textbooks and so
my dissertation was written on what
would happen if you took a free textbook
and you insert it into about 1200
students and what we found was that
under represented bodies of people
specifically at access institutions
would score higher than those that did
not and you can think of all the logical
reasons they have access to stuff on day
one they don't have to wait for their
student loans to hit
and the withdrawal withdrawal rate
specifically for those that are over 25
drop by 50 percent and why I'm saying
that that's so important is my average
nursing student is 24.5 and so one of
the things I went to the hospital to say
is my nursing textbook book group thing
is very expensive and I see it as a big
barrier and my job is to reduce barriers
could we for every student in Georgia
Highlands go ahead pay for that textbook
and the answer was yes and so on top of
that they offer a tuition assistance
program and scholarships that that do
have a work requirement because once
again there has to be some form of
reciprocity in this agreement and that's
one way for the hospital to go ahead and
try to bridge that gap between them
graduating and them deciding they're
going to you know see the world but you
may need to spend a little time at
Adrian Hill Floyd contractually
and that's a good thing for everyone
because you know like I said you we are
serving a very diverse group of people
that don't all need to see the travel
nurse World they just really need to
immerse themselves into the practice and
get all of the barriers uh for a few
years
um some of the bigger things that I I
once again this is only a month old but
I'm going to tell you that antidotally
this is the first time I've heard this
in 14 years
they gave funds for faculty retention
okay and with that faculty retention not
only is a bonus uh we won't call it a
bonus it is an actual Market adjustment
of salary from the state appropriated to
the market rate
this is the first time in 14 years I've
heard a nursing instructor tell me or
look to the Future like in the next
three or four years I'm gonna do X
that is the first time in 14 years as
being a part of the Health Sciences I
have heard a nursing faculty look
towards the future it's been very you
know short-lived and so things like
tuition reimbursement and tap and all of
those things are great for nursing
education but really getting market rate
to what it would be comparative to those
around us and I'm going to tell you that
nursing education comes at you really
really fast and so it takes three to
five years until I have a very rooted
nursing instructor that is pumping out
very good nursing students and so if I
have high turnover that once again leads
to the dean doing the director's job the
director is doing the instructor's job
and my instructor's scrambling around
trying to figure out what Nursing
education is and so that was one of the
big selling points that I found it
really is going to lead to not only you
know long-term growth for Georgia
Highlands but actually trying to fix the
workforce
and then I have any questions
this is very informative
oh it makes it makes such a difference
the investment that was being made
that's the door opener you know George
is one of two states in the nation that
does not have a broad
um
needs-based scholarship for
post-secondary training
Georgia and New Hampshire go figure
and what we've heard all day is that
when you infuse the system and remove
Financial barriers as someone testified
earlier it's all about the cash when you
do that people can can move forward and
and aspire to their dreams
and feel invested in feel valued you
know so I just think that's that's to me
is one of the the big neon signs from
today and you've just supported
uh your your account has just supported
that I will add one more thing to this
today I had in my head
um many many times is we have signed a
matriculation agreement with West
Georgia and so remember my my pipeline
had three
blockages number three is my nursing
education on the top side so
when I saw that you know the hospital is
really out of Masters prepared nurse
Educators my first thought was why don't
I try to make a way for my RN to BSN to
get into an MSN quicker find ways to
fund them I am actually now growing my
own nurse Educators which strengths and
strengthens my ability to do clinicals
and so West Georgia and myself we have
opened a matriculation agreement that
allows our RN to BSN students six
credits sooner to the MSN so they can
exchange six of their BSN credits
towards the MSN and you know we've
thought of a lot of creative Department
of Labor grants and all of those things
are on the table now that we have this
true pipeline of actually growing our
own in the area because that's super
important it's a quick follow-up
yeah this is short we heard stories this
year the session of
nurse Educators those who train uh
nurses or people to be nurses are
leaving because they're getting paid
less than what they would earn being a
nurse
how do you how are you addressing that
um with the slide before that with
Atrium Health Floyd coming to the table
and bridging that gap between what I
could offer as an average faculty salary
um you know I'm I'm at a lower end of
tuition so 95 a credit hour was super
lucrative for recruiting students but
simple math would prove that 95 a credit
hour doesn't allow me to keep up with
Market adjustments such as in nursing
education so
um you know
I was a little kid with a lemonade stand
once and I was told no over here so I
just went ahead and said I'm gonna walk
over to the hospital and see if somebody
will bridge the gap between X and Y and
they said absolutely because they see
the value in not only making Market
adjustments to that level because it
will help me recruit eventually but it's
going to help me retain and that's
that's the long-term play for me is to
also make sure that this is sustainable
so that's my next venture is to worry
about what 2028 Georgia Highlands looks
like and so that's you know what we're
trying to do here is to make sure that
you know those people are recognized
that are really trying to fix those
types of things that really are Unified
no matter what part of the state you're
in
Center Jackson thank you Mr chairman I I
commend the work that you all are doing
my mother taught nursing at a university
setting for 30 years
and and made the salary Choice um to do
that because of a commitment to nursing
so I appreciate that others won't have
to do that
um my question is you know we heard that
for physician training only 58 of them
are staying in state or I don't know
we've heard different numbers but a lot
of people are coming and getting
educated here in Georgia and and then
taking that education elsewhere
what is that looking like for your
nursing program are you raising
homegrown girls and and Men boys you
know are you and they staying at home
um or or are they going off to other
states so the university system just uh
invested heavily in a data program
called stepping blocks and according to
Stepping blocks Georgia Highlands 87
percent of those that are graduating are
staying within the Northwest footprint
and so one of the five counties that we
serve so I don't have Universal Georgia
data but I have off the top of my head
Georgia Highlands data which I feel as
though although you can't assume all of
this could be recreated and replicated
but I I you know I've been in education
long enough to know that you know a lot
of our problems are really synonymous
throughout the state and we have echoed
each other multiple multiple times as
far as I'm educating the person that I
see 20 years from now at the Applebee's
and you know they're they're right here
they're you know calling me and waving
me down when I'm kayaking on Lake
Allatoona and you know I know that
they're staying exactly where we
educated them
okay thank you
anybody else
well thank you very much I don't know
why I use Applebee's I haven't been down
yes thank you that was just great that's
really incredible
and last but not least we've got Chad
Black
who's the chairman of Georgia Emergency
Medical Services Association
thank you
[Music]
first of all thank you for letting me
come and speak on behalf of Ems for the
state I'll be brief today a lot of what
you've heard from from everyone else
the workforce issues the funding and
everything else is it folds right over
into Emergency Medical Services
back in 2007 Senator Mullis and I told
you did a Workforce study you probably
remember that and
a lot of that
um
has come to fruition even worse today
now some things have been
solidified some some of my friend lives
with a trauma commission and the work
they've done in cooperating with us in
our partnership we've done a lot on
education but we're still struggling
and and this was way before
again before covet hit which just
exacerbated everything for for everyone
in the Health Community but um you can
go to the next one
of the biggest challenges that we have
is the same again as nurses is Dr
Hatchett talked about is finding people
who want to come into the profession and
then keeping them in the profession
we're seeing more and more in one of our
and this is nothing against the
hospitals but one of our biggest
challenges now is with a nursing
shortage
the hospitals have gotten smart they
realize paramedics can work in place a
lot of places in the cath labs and
stroke labs in place of a nurse and
they're able to pay them more for Less
hours and we're losing the cream of the
crop in paramedics to the hospital
setting
I don't it's hard when I was a fire
chief before I retired it's hard when
somebody comes in says Chief I don't
want to leave but uh I'm gonna make ten
twelve thousand dollars more and work 20
hours less a week and be home with my
family every night
can't argue with that
um
you can go now and be a licensed nurse
and about the same time it takes to go
to EMT school whether it's MTB or a and
then after that go to paramedic school
come out and make double right off and
you know shortly you'll be making a
hundred thousand dollars a year where
the paramedics not going to do that so
we face that and again I talked about
the hospital issue
um the technical colleges we've got a
lot that it talked about in there some
of those and the urban areas are no
longer doing EMT and paramedic programs
I was told I've not confirmed it but
North Georgia Tech here who has a
program could not even do their
Paramedic program this time because they
didn't have enough to enroll to
sufficiently to start the class
next slide
some of the other challenges Public
Safety retirements in Georgia you got to
Georgia firefighters pension fund that
I'm I'm drawing from it's a great great
benefit being a firefighter retired a
Georgia police officers have the annuity
and benefit fund George Sheriff's
Association has their retirement fund
EMS nothing and one of the issues with
that is is you know the sheriffs and
police are local and County governments
EMS we have local and County government
funded EMS but we also have private and
we have Hospital based in the state now
most I'm not I believe all the
hospital-based none of those currently
operate under an authority anymore so
there basically would be considered
private also so that creates challenges
for us trying we've been trying for 20
years to do a supplemental retirement
for EMS only
like the firefighters and law
enforcement has but we're struggling
and a lot of this is going to be looked
at at the federal level we were going to
hire a group out of DC to try to get
there's no one pension that covers City
County government private and Hospital
based
but they were looking at changing
federal law to do that they wanted a
hundred thousand dollars from Jim's to
study and couldn't guarantee us that
they could get it pushed through and
there's no way we could afford that that
amount of money for that next slide
again some of the challenges from a
national level you've got a national
fire chief through the National Fire
Academy at the U.S fire Administration
you got to chief law enforcement officer
that's the United States Attorney
General
they get a lot of benefits from Grants
and stuff on the federal level fire I
got a lot when I was at Hall County and
a lot when we were at Habersham very
fortunate because we were fire-based EMS
National there is no National EMS Chief
or director that actually falls under
the U.S Department of Transportation and
the transportation secretary and you
know you I've never in my four-year
career heard her
Secretary of Transportation mentioned
EMS one time it's Planes Trains and
Automobiles so
this is a major issue that that is
occurring um this is something I chose
not to do but mandatory overtime you got
people working I'll take this County
where I left and retired completely back
in January of 2022
we didn't do mandatory overtime but
there's truck two ambulances here out of
the six that they run that averages
eight to ten calls per truck a shift
most of those transports go out of
County
now with Northeast Georgia here I think
things are going to get better they're
going to be able to keep more patients
and not send out so many of the
non-acuity but that's that's a two-hour
call so you run 10 calls you pretty much
taken that up stats show that 18 hours
of No Sleep is the same as registering
.08 intoxicated on that's right it is so
mandatory overtime in a lot of these
departments forcing people they've been
working 24.
they work the next 24 and now they're
running eight to ten calls again
you want that person coming to you or
your family after the back end of a 48
hour shift at five o'clock in the
morning plus accidents are up
um
but again we're going to have to have
them up with Congressman Clyde and
looking at some federal things you know
I don't know what we're going to do but
the Staffing issue started back in 07
and you'll see in that report next slide
um
back then in 07 the estimated cost was
and that was right about a half a
million dollars per ambulance for EMT in
paramedic
for a 24 hour or for three shifts 24 on
48 off but staff one ambulance was half
a million dollars that is in excess of a
hundred thousand dollars after coven an
ambulance it was a hundred and sixty
thousand dollars just two and a half
years ago was 325 to 340 000 today
it's increased that much over double to
buy an ambulance now the smaller Vans if
you're Firebase DMS you've got to have
the boxes to be able to put the gear in
the sides the turnout gear and things
like that you can get the Vans a little
cheaper for services that run that don't
participate in fire also but still your
Staffing that's still up here around
three quarters of a million dollars even
with that or more
um
GAO reported you see the average cost
per ambulance transport was 415 dollars
today Medicare Medicaid reimbursement
rates are still low and about that same
it's really we've not had really an
increase
in many many years in Medicaid or
Medicare yes ma'am
we did and that was part of of this that
was hampering us you're right we brought
that to you and thank you for doing that
where that saved Habersham County
citizens from having to pay about
eighteen thousand dollars a year to
license all the ambulances in the county
um Cobb County where you're from it
saved him about a half a million dollars
doing that
um so that was listening you are no no
some things like that and some of the
things and that's what I was going to
point out as I said earlier some of the
things in this report that was one of
them we got that accomplished this year
16 years later uh the trauma
the trauma commission again with Liz and
them I can't say enough about what
they've done in their cooperation and
working with us in Partnership we offer
uh through gemsa
about a hundred and eighty thousand
contact hours a year of EMS education
that is free that comes through the
super speeder funds with the money that
we get from the trauma commission most
we're the only state in the nation that
we know of that offers this we have a
lot of States calling us I know what it
is they do about how are y'all doing
this and it's that partnership there
so I'll if anybody in the room has got a
super speed or final simply say thank
you but slow down please
okay uh yes ma'am
I'm scared to read the paper anymore sir
yeah
uh yes sir you're right
a big time Big Time next slide we'll get
us back on the rails here yeah go ahead
oh also back in that report you'll see
that uh ambulance is provide more
uncompensated care than any other major
health care provider back then it was up
as high as 16 and a half percent today I
worked with Pete and some of us putting
some numbers together that's about 25 so
you take that
um we cannot deny transport we're pretty
much obligated to transport if they want
to go but we brought off anywhere from
40 to 60 percent and then if you've got
contractual allowances that you've got
with providers or anything like that
that can be up to 40 percent so it's
it's a non-money it's a losing game
um it's it's at a critical stage now
back reports are showing that 2020 2021
when covid was at its peak we lost one
third of the workforce in EMS Nationwide
and a lot of them's just getting out of
it um next slide
um this is a summary from the governor's
Health Care Workforce I was able to go I
believe we were in Albany and testified
on that last year early last year
um that report came out but um we are
Supply constrained from the workforce
like everyone else
um
commissioner members reported challenges
in recruiting U.S new EMS workers due to
discouraging exam Pass rates and we do
have discouraging Pass rates in Georgia
um
those are not anywhere where they need
to be and again that's on a multitude of
factors it's not just one particular
thing but
um
commission interviews back then are
still the lack of access and I know Leo
has talked about that earlier the access
to level one Trauma Centers and died on
Transportation times hamper the delivery
of care we've still got major wall time
issues at a lot of hospitals where an
ambulance transports and you see all the
time communities complaining that their
response times are up
those ambulances can't respond to a call
when they're sitting in the ER or the
patient in the ER can't take them down
in the Columbus area wall times can be
three to five hours waiting to take a
patient off the stretcher
that excessive so when you've got in the
you know 911 calls don't stop coming in
and then that also for services like
here at Haversham that also does the
discharges or transfers from here to
another facility
if they can't transfer the patient out
with throughput to be able to get beds
open to get them out of the ER doesn't
exist so that that's a major problem
that we're running into capacities at
hospitals they're full ambulances are
having to wait that means 9-1-1 calls
are waiting I was in going to Atlanta
not long ago
um dialed 9-1-1 in Gwinnett County to
report a wreck with injuries and I got
you have reached Gwinnett County 9-1-1
please remain on the line all operators
are busy now can you imagine if that's a
loved one and their families in Cardiac
Arrest or their house is on fire and
they get put on hold it happens every
day because of the backup and everything
not only that 911 operators are
experiencing the same thing we are next
slide
I talked a little bit about the reduced
funding the consolidation of the tech
colleges Augusta and Dublin they don't
no longer offer EMS education programs
there and while it helps the economy of
scale for the schools it's devastating
when students have to travel 100 plus
miles just to go to the interior
paramedic school
um
it's remained stagnant the average Pass
rates for the EMT and advanced EMT for
over a decade now and you know and we're
in an industry we just can't maintain a
35 waste factor and remain viable
anymore
um this is just from EMS education this
is just things that the technical
schools could do
um train capacity have an expanded
capacity to train EMS workers hybrid
course options connected to rural areas
that's not at the main campus and some
of the areas here that they do that in
some areas
um
trying to find more instructors for EMS
education is just a multi-faceted
problem
but um
reforms in education it could promote
decreased ambulance response times
increase in recruiting and retention and
higher Pass rates so again we're having
problems at the educational level here
at Haversham before I left they're still
doing it we had to revert to doing our
own EMT school in-house Pete's had to do
that with Metro he's been doing the fire
department itself Emergency Services we
had to go out and fortunately we had
some of our employees that were EMT
instructors so we're able to do that
in-house but that comes at a great cost
we do around the state with gems to
offer through again the trauma
commission funding we offer EMT and EMR
programs that can be done free a cost in
the rural communities we've seen a
little bit of a decrease in that
actually over the past few years still
doing it but but still a decrease but
the rural communities if you know
they've taught or Dr Hatchet talked
about it um
if you can't ambulate or drive yourself
to the hospital you got to have an
ambulance and a lot of times there's no
ambulances out there to take you people
are waiting they're waiting to be
transferred out into tertiary Center
it's it was nothing when I was here to
have all six ounces all tied up and on a
call and having to rely on a surrounding
County to come into our County to
respond to that call the next one that
came in
next slide that's it
why do we see all the time uh I'm
Atlanta downtown Atlanta in town heart
of Atlanta
and uh but constantly I think this is
true everywhere uh when a 911 call comes
in we'll have a fire truck two
ambulances
what is going on I mean I do not I said
this board just all like to come out of
here you know to the latest thing I
can't figure it out I can explain that
we've been doing we actually had a we've
been doing Town Hall EMS meetings all
across the state cooperation with Gams
also VMS and Trauma trauma Commission
and uh listening to the pmts and
paramedics but also talking about issues
and one of the things I said and I've
upset some fire chiefs but as a fire
chief I can say that we are sending fire
apparatus on calls they don't need to be
going on they don't need to be going to
the doctor's office uh for an elevated
troponin that needs to go up the road to
the hospital for tests we have taken
9-1-1 that was created in Alabama many
many years ago and we have turned it
into 4-1-1 on steroids but if I come to
this ER with an earache
I'm probably gonna wait two or three
hours maybe if they're busy before I see
a doctor and that's okay but if I call
911
to come get me almost immediately and we
have created this monster that we're
going to have to start looking at
you know
yes
thank you very much for your
presentation 9-1-1 started in my
hometown in Haleyville Alabama that's
right FYI thank you the first red phone
Smithsonian now
um
so uh I this is much appreciated for you
to have brought us the old study
committee report what would also be
really helpful is if you could go
through the old report and kind of tell
the committee what's still needs to be
done and what's already been checked off
because not all of us were there in
2007.
the Staffing issue a retention not only
or retention but attracting and
retaining is still a major issue now we
have what's compared to back then
the number of EMTs and paramedics in the
state is a lot more than what it is in
this report it was at about 12 or 13 000
we're about 24 25 000 now but we've
grown as a state rapidly over that year
again back then Habersham was running
two ambulances they're running six now
so you know you had to have increased
Staffing so the Staffing and retention
the education is an issue I know Liz has
talked about still in the rural areas
here we are very fortunate with
Northeast Georgia a great Trauma Center
stroke center and cardiac center but you
get down below Atlanta and getting some
areas
if if it's not a pretty day and you
can't be flown
and you're an acute trauma it could be
two hours before you get to that Trauma
Center
um so those are the major ones is
Staffing as far as attracting and
retaining same thing that the nurses
industry the Physicians are going
through our education we've got to get
it spread around the state on the
technical level better than what it is
today
um and then we've got to look at some
kind of retirement plan that we can do
that's a carrot to it it's not going to
benefit anybody like me or people that's
been in a long time but we've got to
find something that's a supplemental
retirement like law enforcement and
firefighters have for EMS and that's
probably going to have to come from the
federal level or some help from them if
I remember Mr chairman one follow-up I'm
concerned about the test uh failure rate
that you talked about I'm serving The
Joint Defense commissioner and the
military has run into the same thing
with their testing they've either got
people who can't pass for whatever
reason or they can't pass a drug test or
have some other disqualifying thing
obesity or whatever and I imagine
that the same people that are thinking
about being an EMT or paramedic are also
thinking about other Health Sciences so
what's the difference between the
testing and how can we address that
that's a good question
um I know also VMS and Trauma has worked
on some things and looking at different
things on on the education level and
what the problems have been there's been
some data put out but I don't have
access to that data that would need to
come from Michael Johnson who's the oems
and Trauma director in his office
um
but some of the issues you talked about
are some of the same ones faced in that
too absolutely
yeah let me jump in real quick so we had
the
executive director for the Georgia
trauma commission here earlier this
morning
and she was testifying earlier and I
asked her
um specifically in regards to South
Georgia and the time it takes for a
patient who is injured on I-75 for
example to get to a Trauma Center Oscar
should we focus on
building new Trauma Centers in more I
guess strategic locations in South
Georgia or focus on
bettering the transportation
for trauma patients to get to the Care
Centers and she said transportation and
more focus on EMS do you agree with that
and if you do what do you think we could
do as a state to help specifically in
south Georgia where you know North
Georgia we're closer to Atlanta than we
are and we've got Greenville and we've
got Chattanooga but in south Georgia
there's places where you're two two and
a half hours right and most East correct
and most of those and I totally agree
with Leo's on that
um and the other thing that people most
of those rural areas are small rural
communities that doesn't have a hospital
or they've got a small hospital so when
they leave with that ambulance that may
be the only ambulance that Community has
so now they're gone on a two-hour
transport and that's two hours back so
four or five hours they're gone and no
coverage or backup maybe in that but if
it's a major accident they're all gone
there's no coverage in that county so
that's another issue
um again we run into because we have
private services that provide great
service that's you know if a county
chooses a private provider uh to to be
their Zone provider that is what they
chose and and that's okay
uh as Jim so we represent the privates
and and County Cities Hospital law we
don't differentiate between any of them
but um that does create issues when it
comes to talking about retirement or
state funds going to help something like
that when you've got private providers
in it but they have we've got to find a
way to include them we can't exclude
them because most of your County
Services overall the gwinnetts and halls
and large ones they don't do the
transfers from hospital a to hospital B
they don't do the patient discharges you
have to have those private providers
that do the majority of that
and and if we don't it would completely
collapse the system so we've got to find
a way to help get salaries up we've got
to find a way to get better education
and we've got to find a way to keep
people want to do the job I mean we're
you know we've been hearing law
enforcement bad and they've got a huge
issue too but we're in the same boat
doctors or doctors nurses EMS
um
Senator Jackson
I have a few questions
um one last year we heard a presentation
from somebody down at Mercer about
um those who people who are incarcerated
who were trained as firefighters in the
ways that they are saving lives in rural
Georgia because they're firefighters
what can we do to get those folks
cross-trained as EMTs as well uh we I've
addressed that uh Georgia we we you go
through EMT school paramedic school and
then Georgia back when I took years ago
had their own tests through the
composite State Board of medical
examiners now it is through the National
Registry of EMTs and um if you they're
not going to allow that um one of the
girls and I'll that Alto here the the
ladies prison here provides fire
Services backed us up those ladies were
phenomenal uh going to Tallulah Gorge
with us on Gorge rescues uh one of them
I couldn't hire at the time but we
helped get her a job in White County she
has made a tremendous turnaround and
we've just helped her to get a complete
pardon in National Registry acceptance
Pastor EMT and she's working here in
Haversham part-time too so that I wanted
to go down to the prison at that time
and be able to put them through EMT
school that was part of the fire
department so when they got out they was
ready for a job but National Registry
does not allow that
and so that glutes back to us no longer
having our own certification system
which
maybe we should look at that there's
there's
being nationally nationally awarded is
really important for those who can be
boarded but if we want to expand our
pool that might be an option secondarily
I'm also interested I know that a lot of
fire service is provided across the
rural Georgia through volunteer
firefighters is there an effort to
recruit them to be cross-trained as EMTs
as well a lot of them are in those areas
they're at least medical First
Responders and some of them are EMTs but
um
and and those are vital those first
responder programs were vital especially
in the rural areas and that's a lot of
what you see Senator is the fire going
out you know as I said EMS that has the
zone to provide 9-1-1 they have a duty
and an obligation to respond fire
departments that do not run EMS they
have a desire to First respond and
that's the right desire but we're going
on a lot too many calls we're sending
those fire apparatus on calls that
probably sometimes an animals really
shouldn't even be going on and we're
going to have to look at you know
throwing all these resources we're going
to have to look at a tiered EMS system
some places are doing it Grady does it
Clayton County Fire where you match the
9-1-1 call through EMD at the 911 Center
you triage it there and you send the
appropriate level of care to the call
you don't send a paramedic in reality a
paramedic probably needs to go on
less than 15 20 of the 911 calls that
come in and then one one final question
so I know in a lot of our high schools
we've created programs where you can get
licensed as a cosmetologists as a CNA
there are all these Pathways
um how how do we get ENT we did part of
that right before I retired we started
that in Haversham and chief Adams is
taking it they should get their first
class out through cooperation with North
Georgia Tech and be EMT firefighters
when they're if they're 18 and they've
been able to take their exam of course
of course but don't
and and the thing I hope and I want to
come back and see it is that when they
get their high school diploma Chief
Adams is waiting at the bottom of the
job application form and keep them you
know we kind of called it homegrown so
working with Habersham Central and and
that program is active here now Clayton
County has a very robust program down
there Chief Merchants did a great job
starting that that's great
through Clinton County Fire yeah Chief
markison started he's in County
Administration now but they he's at the
bottom of the stage or was and was
offering job applications and they knew
who was going to work so when they
graduated they were going right into the
fire and EMS
so we're looking at there's some things
that's been worked on like that that's
but only a few areas are doing that so
and it's a heavy lift to try to do all
that and provide the service too
but you know we're looking at all
options so again I appreciate the time
you've heard a lot of infusing uh uh the
the situation addressing the situation
with with uh paid scholarship paying for
the training it's investing in the
students and how much of that are you
seeing happening uh well a lot of the
younger ones can get hope which is a
great thing for this state to go to EMT
but paramedic school but once the
problem is once they go through Mt
school and they some of them exhaust all
of their funds and they can't get it to
go into that that post-education if they
want to get their degree or anything
like that they use all of that for EMT
and some of paramedics so a lot of that
is being used now for older ones that
want to get in you know there's people
that's wanting to get into the business
um sometimes they're not eligible to
receive that or somebody that started
one career
as far as using their money for that and
then decides to change so it is it's
it's a cost issue too it's very
expensive to to send it to school
but that it turns out that's what's
working oh yeah yeah absolutely so
pursuing that approach
thank you
thank you Chad thank you all for coming
today I think this has been very
productive uh you know y'all are here
because you care there's a lot of smart
people in the room I would encourage you
if if someone in another area came and
testified today that you you know may
have heard something that you think
could work I would encourage y'all to
collaborate reach out to each other if
you need someone's contact information
please reach out to John or Bernita and
send us those ideas as we move along in
this process we're going to limit what
we're looking at moving forward but if
there's anything that really stands out
that you think hey we could we could
make a difference here please don't be
shy this is why we invited you here and
this is why you're in the room so just
thank you again Northeast Georgia
Medical Center thank you for the
committee members Bernita John y'all did
a great job and thank you everyone for
attending I I think this has been very
successful and I technically got us out
13 minutes early so thank you guys
thank you
