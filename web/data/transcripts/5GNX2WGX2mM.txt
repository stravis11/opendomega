TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to look now at legislation
to help protect women through the court
systems. Joining us is Republican
Representative Lisa Hagen of Lions. She
is chair of the House Rural Development
Committee. Her other committees include
Appropriations, Agriculture, and
Consumer Affairs, and Transportation.
Also here is Democratic Representative
Stacy Evans of Atlanta. Some of her
House committees include Appropriations,
Judiciary, Retirement, and Rules.
Welcome to lawmakers to both of you.
Thanks for being here. All right,
Chairman Hagen, you have HB 1142. It
would tighten how Georgia handles
domestic um violence offenders, the
offenders in particular. How did you
come up with the need for this bill?
Well, actually for me it was a young
lady that that I worked with at the
capital who first brought the idea to me
and we also heard that there is a young
woman down in Savannah who started a
petition because she uh heard about the
bill that just went to effect, the law
that just went to effect in Tennessee in
January. So it's the first in the
country like it. And so if we can
accomplish this here in Georgia, we
would be the second. And so it just
seems like something that is timely.
We're concerned with public safety.
We're concerned about families, women in
particular, and their children. And so
it just seems like um something that
makes good sense and is it's the right
time for it.
>> Okay. We'll dig into it a little bit
more. Representative Evans, you're
co-sponsor on HP460, and that would ex
uh exclude from evidence certain
communications made between attorney and
clients with the client when the client
is in prison. So, tell us how you got
involved in that one.
>> Sure. So, House Bill 460, I think,
really sets the record straight to how
most people thought it was. Um, when you
ask most folks uh about this bill and
they say, "What does it do?" And we say,
"Well, it protects conversations between
folks that are in prison and their
lawyers." And most people look shocked
and say, "I can't believe that's not
already the law." So Esther Panic is the
lead sponsor on this. It's bipartisan.
Uh chairman Tyler Paul Smith is also a
co-signer. And this just sets back what
we think is probably the policy that the
legislature always meant it to be that
whether you're incarcerated or not, your
conversations with your lawyer are
confidential. And so it would create um
an unrecorded line because right now all
the calls that are um going in and out
of the prison are recorded. Um, and this
would set up a system where you have a
special line for conversations with your
attorney.
>> So, it's bipartisan.
>> Bipartisan.
>> Okay. We'll talk a little bit more. Our
Chairman Hagen, the uh bill would link
diversion programs um to future
accountability. Explain what the
diversion programs would be all about.
>> Sure. Well, currently a prosecuting
attorney can agree that someone who is
charged with domestic violence offenses
could go into a diversion program and
upon completion of that program um he or
she would be um it would not be a
conviction. However, um in the current
language of this bill, that would be
included as a first offense. The way the
the language is written currently is you
would not appear on this domestic
violence offender registry until your
second offense. However, the exception
is made for someone who's who's been
through the diversion program that that
it's not a it's not a conviction, but
that that second encounter would would
require them to appear on the registry.
>> So, talk let's talk about the registry
then. What exactly would it be?
>> Sure. This this bill would create a
persistent domestic violence offender
registry that would be maintained by GBI
and
upon the second conviction or the
exception you just spoke of, a person
would appear on the registry. And the
goal is just to create uh another
resource for people as they make
decisions about who they want to
associate with and um who they want to
be in relationships with. I know that
there are people who have been in
domestic violence situations and then
they the person maybe is charged that
the person moves into a different
domestic violence situation and another
woman or man is affected by it. So
that's what you're trying to prevent.
>> Exactly. That's what we're trying to to
prevent.
>> Okay. All right. We'll get into that a
little bit more. Uh let's talk a little
bit about another bill. you're a signer
on um Representative Micaia McQueen's
bill, the Minstal Data Privacy and
Protection Act. What is the reason for
that legislation?
>> So, when Row versus Wade was when that
decision was overturned, obviously that
was an earthquake across the country and
rights that women thought were
fundamental, our privacy, our right to
make decisions, it rocked. And so across
the country, you've seen a couple of
states, Georgia is not one of them yet,
um that has passed bills to try to make
sure that um when women might want to uh
go across state lines where abortion
laws are less restrictive, that any kind
of uh period tracker, menstrual tracker,
ovulation tracker, that that information
wouldn't be used against them to
potentially be prosecuted in their home
states where there may be more
restrictive laws. So that's sort of why
it started. But I think there's also a
more fundamental maybe more simpler
thing to think about. We all use apps.
We all use technology and technology is
great till it's not. Uh and this is just
another way to make sure that technology
is useful to those who want to use it to
make their life easier but that it
doesn't become a weapon against them.
And so this bill also would say that um
uh apps and others that track this
information that they can't sell it and
that if you decide you want you want
that information wiped from the system
that they have to do that right away
that it wouldn't be subject to third
party subpoenas and things of that
nature. Just a a way to protect privacy
in a world where we feel like less and
less um is sacred and private. and um
very happy to support uh Representative
McQueen who's uh spearheading this
legislation this year and also
Representative Park Cannon who's um
spearheaded it in in prior sessions.
This is um something that has been
talked about for a couple of years now.
>> And so this the there are probably
people who don't recognize that the apps
that they may use for menstrual periods
and that kind of thing that people can
get your information if you're in
another state. there have there been any
people prosecuted or I guess I'm just
unfamiliar with it.
>> Well, there are only um a few states
that have passed laws like like the
menstrual data privacy act. Um and it
does have uh provisions in it for civil
monetary penalties, for example, for app
technology corporations that might
misuse the information that might sell
it. Um but as far as criminal
prosecutions for misusing folks
information, not so much. But it is it
is very real. Like right now there are
essentially bounties out on women who um
their suspicion that maybe they missed a
period and they went out of state to get
an abortion and and so much so that if
you are trying to serve a third party
subpoena right now in certain states uh
to get I mean it could be innocuous as
phone records um you have to and this
has happened in my law practice you have
to sign an affidavit that only in a few
states that have done this um that you
have to testify in an affidavit that you
are not seeking information to use
against a woman who might have been
seeking to um exercise her reproductive
freedom rights that might exist in other
states but may not exist in her home
state. So this is newer because Roie
Wade being overturned um is is still
it's been several years now but it's
still a new phenomenon and I think the
laws are trying to catch up to make sure
that as much as possible we are
protecting women in this new
environment. Okay, we'll keep up with
that bill. I want to ask you, U, Chair
Hagen, would would names stay on this
domestic violence registry forever?
>> No, they wouldn't. That's a good
question. Um, the way it is written
right now, upon multiple convictions or
additional convictions, that time would
would increase. But after a period of
time with no additional convictions for
domestic violence offenses, that person
could be eligible to roll off of the the
registry and be removed by uh GBI.
>> Yeah. So GBI would keep all the records
on all of this all over the state. So
>> that's right. Right. Upon a conviction,
the clerk in the county where the
conviction occurred would submit that
information to the GBI and they would
maintain that registry.
>> What kind of reaction are you getting? I
am getting very positive reactions to
people I from people um victims,
survivors, uh advocates, um directors of
domestic violence shelters and sexual
assault centers are have been very
supportive. Um my fellow colleagues in
the legislature have been very
supportive about it. Um it seems like
it's especially with the advent of
dating apps, things happening online, it
seems like it's the right time to take
care of that.
>> Well, I want to thank you both for being
here. We'll keep up with your bills.
