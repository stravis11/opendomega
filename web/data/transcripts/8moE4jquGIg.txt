TRANSCRIPT
----------
Banks have their own risk management policies and things that they follow, their own internal policies.
They've got state law, they have to follow. They've got state regs, state banking regs.
They've got federal regs that they have to follow. They've got bank secrecy acts that they have to
follow. They have to follow SER, suspicious activity reports. And they have to make judgment calls
all the time on these kind of accounts.
The problem is, one of the problems is,
passage of this bill puts banks in a horrible position.
Because as the bankers have said,
nine times out of 10 when they choose to either not bank somebody
or sever a relationship with a client,
they can't talk about under federal regulations
why they made the decision that they made.
So this puts them in a horrible position of not being able
to explain the decision that was made,
but yet leaves them fully exposed to being sued about it.
If you look at the need of the bill,
and it gets over to the portion involving lines 98 through 103,
and talks about essential providers.
And by the way, if you're wondering why this part
of the bill or the bill talks about entities and utility carriers and broadband providers
and your water service people and all these people that they off of the bill says they
don't have a problem with it, they're not engaged in it and there's not been any discussion
of it.
Well, it kind of makes you wonder why they're in here.
But it answers the question of why the banks are so concerned about the language and
here's why.
This was glossed over by the author
when he talked about the fines that could be $50,000.
No, if you read a close reading of the bill,
the damages that a plaintiff can obtain against a bank
or has actual damages or $50,000, whichever is greater,
not whichever is less, whichever is greater.
So what does that mean where the rubber meets a road?
And that means that a bank who engaged accidentally and unintentionally, because that's the unintentional portion,
and made a mistake in doing something that is construed as having violated this portion,
one incident, because if you look at how the definitions are run,
one violation of any aspect of this bill is a minimum $50,000 fine.
Now, how would you like to go to work every day and run your business knowing that an
unintentional, technical, minor violation of a law is a $50,000 fine.
And each time it's done, it's 50 more, 50 more, 50 more.
Now, if you look down to the intentional provisions, well, it's a lot more.
And philosophically, I don't have so much of a problem with that, making it the distinction,
but it's $150,000 for an intentional violation.
But you don't need to go beyond the $50,000 unintentional violation portion of this to realize
why this is a really bad bill.
It may be a good idea and the kind of conduct that the Senator from the 19th has talked
about trying to prohibit, listen.
I agree with that.
I agree that no company, let's talk about banks,
because that's what this is about,
should be engaged in the kind of behavior
that he's given a few instances of.
But the question is, how do we fashion a remedy here?
What do we say to the banks?
Well, what's the normal thing that we do
when you have a statute and you want to incentivize
the ability of someone to sue if you're gonna give them that?
Well, they get their attorneys fees.
Well, that's in here too.
They get attorneys fees.
There's also a provision that says
that they can get injunctive relief
to stop the bank from doing those things.
But folks, when you're talking about a $50,000 minimal fine
of something that small, that amount, of course,
that's why the banks are deeply concerned.
You know, we talked about the problems of social credit score, where does that come from?
How does one define it?
It's defined in the bill, but it doesn't say who at the time defines it.
Well, let me tell you the answer when I ask the author of the bill will tell me how that's
resolved.
Well, it would be resolved litigation, litigation, litigation.
The lawyers are going to fight over that.
or not? Did the company have a social credit score? Did they keep records? Well, if they
didn't keep records, maybe they knew that they were doing something wrong, and that's why
there's no records on the social credit score. So we're going to deconstruct it and just
impose, what do you impose? You impose your after-late-latent judgment and assumptions
about things that happened, again, just more problems, you know, lines 59 through 61, supposedly
would give us some guidance, but I would encourage you to read those lines and you'll realize
just as others that have that you really don't know how this would work other than, of course,
our Georgia-based businesses and our banks rather are concerned about a $50,000 minimum
fine for one instance of an unintentional act.
That's not reasonable.
So let's talk about amendment number three, which is what I have proposed.
What it does is it takes out the private cause of action so that it's not, let's call it,
what it would be, plaintiffs, lawyers, bananza to go sue banks all the time knowing they're
going to get their attorney's fees and they're going to get $50,000 for any and every time
there's a minor violation, it says no, wait a minute.
Let's handle this the way this is usually handled.
Which is you have the attorney general do it.
If you look at line 9 on amendment number 3, it says in an action brought pursuant to
this code section for a violation and I'm paraphrasing here, notwithstanding paragraph
3, the attorney general shall seek to recover $10,000 in civil penalties for the first violation,
$50,000 for the second and $250,000 for the third and subsequent violation.
But the Attorney General may also bring the action without providing notice to the party he's going after.
And may also refer the violator to the Department of Banking and Finance for further investigation.
That's the kind of mechanism we need that doesn't send a shockwave throughout our community banks of being worried
of yet this being another
tort lawsuit bananza giving
lawyers a chance to go make a
bunch of money on minor
violations because that's how
this is structured.
And here's the other reason that
I pose the bill the way it's
written. Again, the idea of
making sure that our businesses
ought not be discriminated against based on their political beliefs and the other things
set forth in the bill.
I agree with.
I told the author of the bill that very thing in the committee hearing.
But it's the mechanism that he's used of an elephant gun to go after an unintentional
violation in a way that clearly is not fair or appropriate.
And I think maybe we'll have someone else come up that will speak from a banking perspective
that will tell you, and this is also the reason I oppose the measure, not the measure
of I oppose the way the bill is written, because it is drafted in a way that really hurts
and could hurt and will hurt conservative businesses, and it's for this reason.
For those conservative businesses that want to have a relationship with a new bank, maybe
because for whatever reason, banks are going to be more concerned and less likely to bank
someone knowing that they're going to be subject to a lawsuit if they need to
sever the relationship for legitimate banking reasons, but they can't defend
themselves and talk about those legitimate banking reasons because of the
federal regulations. So it's going to have the opposite effect. Again, I'm going to
close here. I know it's late, but you know, when we've got this many amendments
floating around trying to figure out what this is about and correct it.
That lets us know, this measure needs a lot of work.
But I would tell you that if you think you want to vote for this bill at a minimum, vote
for the third amendment, I will speak to the others, I'm supportive, but I'll leave
that to those, the authors of those amendments that have already spoken, but this measure does
not address what it's supposed to be trying to fix, and with that Mr. President, I yield
the well.
All right, Senators yielded well, and now the Senate, we're going down the amendment
list here, and the author of the amendment 3B is the Senate from the 19th, the Senate
from the 19th, you want to speak to your amendment, you just want to wait till you close.
All right.
Good.
from the 14th, what purpose do you rise?
Say it's your inquiry.
There we go, parliament inquiry.
Is it not true the minority party finally understands
what it's like for the majority party during floor debate?
Is that not true, Mr. President?
Do you know what now, I'm sorry?
That the minority party finally understands
what the majority party feels like
during the average floor debate, Mr. President.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Senator, what do you speak?
All right, Senator from the author of the amendment.
Number four, Senator from the 31st.
Would you like to speak to your amendment?
the floor's yours, be brief, brother be brief, let's get home with this.
So just very briefly, it's the president alluded to, thank you Mr. President for the great
reminder, the one group of folks that has not been talked about are credit unions.
I don't know if the author knows, but there are 77 chartered credit unions in Georgia and
where I come from, credit unions, or usually the ones that are setting up, for example
me, my kids bank accounts at a young age, and at $1 billion, there's only eight covered.
I think the other thing just as a reminder is that whether you're a Daniel defense or
your Glock or those organizations, I'm not aware of a credit union that banks them.
And if that's factually not true, I'm sure somebody will talk about it or let me know.
The other thing, too, going back to the original intent of why debanking this highly political
is because of the work that Senator, U.S. Senator Tim Scott is doing in Washington leading
on this effort, my friend Tim, because of what we saw under Operation Chokepoint 2.0
under the Biden administration.
He and Senator Kramer introduced a bill that has 39 endorsers from the Republican Conference
in the US Senate, and I believe there's a bill also introduced in the US House from a
congressman from Kentucky whose threshold is $50 billion.
The fair access to banking at the Senator Kramer is doing is based on the President Trump's
fair access rule. So as we talk about $100 billion here, $200 billion there, $1 billion,
I advocate and ask that this body adopt $10 billion because what's going to happen,
through all this confusion that the senator from the 19th, no offense you've created,
The 10 billion number may be what gets passed in the law because our leaders in Washington
don't get much right, but I will give Senator Scott credit for leading on this effort.
The 10 billion is the right number and we don't harm those hardworking credit unions that
are in our blue collar communities setting up these smaller accounts helping our families.
10 billion is also, I know there is an NRA letter on the desk about this bill.
The NRA also endorsed $10 billion with the federal bill, so don't be misled by that.
And so I just ask you, friends, adopt amendment four unless you adopt one of the other ones
and in my amendment will probably be gone, but don't be fooled by the politics going
on.
Thank you, Mr. President.
All right.
Thank you, Senator.
Senators yielded well.
Now move to amendment number five.
Senator from the 50th.
Senator from the 50th.
Would you like you wave?
Okay.
Senator from 50th waves.
And that is all the amendments for right now.
Senator from 27th, what purpose do you rise?
Mr. President, I move the previous question.
Senator's move for the previous question.
Is there objection?
All right.
Now, it's time for the Center for the 19th,
closed debate.
Thank you so much for all the debate.
I do want to respond to a few things.
The comments about secrecy,
the comments about the Patriot Act,
the comments about banks can't tell you things.
Well, guess what?
That all deals with money laundering.
Turns out money laundering is not protected
in the US Constitution.
As far as I know, don't go in anybody.
Social credit score either.
That does not apply.
But let's proceed and just pretend that it did.
If it did, lines 82 through 87 say, hey, bank,
if you can't tell them why you canceled their account
for these reasons protected by federal law,
then you are fine.
You are okay.
There's a way to not get sued on this.
They said it's become the debanking bill
instead of the deutilizing bill.
That's probably true.
The way to stay protected?
Don't cancel somebody's account
because they're using something
that's further protected by their constitutional rights.
Those are comment about this as an attack on banks.
It's not an attack on banks.
It's a protection of constitutional rights.
Those are comment about why are other utilities in here?
If it's just about banks,
they're not complaining, begs the question,
why they're in here?
Because guess what?
The things were debating on this floor right now.
We did not think we would be debating 10, 5, 1 year ago.
We need to go ahead and protect those industries now and protect individuals who are exercising
their constitutional rights if they could potentially lose those vital resources that keep
their homes, their families, and their businesses operating.
The comments about this can be a $50,000 fine for an unintentional act.
Remember that $50,000 is a maximum that is reduced by the amount that somebody came out
of pocket because they got debanked in anyway.
They got moved.
Marty Daniel told you for him that was a million dollars.
And the reason why we can't simply set aside and let this matter go to the Attorney General's
office is because of the testimony of someone who already has a business in Georgia that
they did that and it did not work.
There's folks who are for this bill.
You already heard the NRA, the National Shooting Sports Foundation's for it.
Turning point something is for it.
The Georgia Chambers against it.
But they say it's because it would create confusion.
You know what's confusing?
What's confusing is being a company that's your power, your water, or God forbid, your
banking gets canceled because you were doing something that was already otherwise legal.
That's what's confusing.
When we vote on this bill today, I'm going to ask you to support Amendment 1A.
Amendment 1A.
I know this is going to be a Christmas tree for you, so get at your pencils. There's a lot of amendments.
I would ask you support Amendment 1A. If Amendment 1A passes, I would ask you support Amendment 1.
If Amendment 1 passes, I believe Amendment 2 fails because it now amends something that's no longer there, but we'll see.
If I'm on a amendment 3, there's a amendment 3a.
It says the attorney general should have a right in this.
They should have a place in this.
But if they don't take their step,
you should still be able to go higher your own lawyer
to take that step.
If a amendment 3a passes, I will ask you to vote favorably
for a amendment 3.
I ask you to vote favorably for a amendment 3a.
If a amendment 3a passes, I ask you vote favorably
for a amendment 3.
Ask you let all the other amendments die,
and then that you vote favorably on the bill.
because I know this will get confusing.
I will make points of order on how I think the bill should go,
and if you wish to vote with me,
I would really be thankful if you did.
So thank you so much for your time today.
Thank you for hearing me on what I think is an important issue
for not just affecting, not just protecting now
and Georgia businesses now,
but protecting Georgia businesses and Georgia families
and their constitutional rights in the future.
Mr. President, I yield the will.
All right, Senators Yeilden, and the Senate has now closed the
debate.
So we will take up the amendments at this point in time.
We'll start with amendment one A. Amendment one A. Is there
object?
There is objection.
Amendment one A is authored by the senator from the 50th.
We have objection from the senator from the 46.
So we'll go ahead and take up amendment one A. All those in
favor of amendment one A. We'll vote yay, all opposed.
So the amendment will vote nay.
Secretary-in-law of the machine.
On the adoption of amendment 1A, the Yays are 32 and the Nays are 22, so amendment 1A has
been adopted.
Now, with amendment 1A being adopted, it pretty much nullifies amendment 1, 2, 4, and 5.
is amended. Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. We need to take up one. I apologize. So amendment
one is there obviously and then amendment one will be attached to amendment one A objection.
All right. So all those in favor of amendment one will vote yay. All opposed will vote
Nay, 16 and a lot of machine.
All in the adoption of amendment one as amended the yeas of 49 and the nasa 7 and this amendment
has prevailed all right so now we're at the posture where with amendment one as amended
amendment two four and five are new so now we'll take up amendments three a well what
what we have left is 3A, B, and amendment 3.
So now we're on the amendment 3A.
Senator from the 19th, we'll go for a picture.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Due to a drafting error, I'd like to withdraw amendment 3A
as long as I'm assured that the vote will now be on 3B.
It is, okay.
And I would urge favorable consideration.
This is objection to Senator from the 19th.
All right, without objection, we'll withdraw.
Do you object?
We do have objection.
All right, now we're on to 3B, 3B from the senator from the 19th, is there objection 3B?
There is objection 3B. All those in favor of member at 3B will vote ye, all opposed.
Nice. Sector, you're a lot of machine.

to arrive for effective date to repeal public looking laws and further purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Public Safety recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respect this submitted, Senator Albert's chairman.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Public Safety, hours of falling substitute to Senate Bill 291,
a bill between 10 and 9 to men, code section 40, that's true, there's 86.1 of the official going to Georgia annotated.
I would like to specialize in this place, providing your sporting certain where the agencies, ones are going to provide corporations,
qualified motor vehicles or drivers with proceeds deposited into the general fund,
says to establish an American first specialty license plate and for other purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Bring in as the majority leader, speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senators, I'm going to bring another book to the chamber next week to present to the senator from the 19th.
It's called the art of the deal.
So I'll be bringing that to you next week.
It's not signed yet, but maybe we'll get it to you.
Senators this bill was a simple bill, we've seen it here before, we saw it last year.
It creates two license plates this year, not one, but two.
The first one is an image of the American flag.
If you're a patriot and you love America, you're going to want to vote for this bill.
And the second portion of the bill is language that you saw earlier this year from the senator from the 56th.
It is a organ donor license plate.
So my voting yes for this bill, you get to purchase either a license plate with the American
flag or a license plate with organ donors.
So Mr. President, I'm happy to take questions all year of the will.
I have one question, Senator.
Break it down, Senator, from the 14th.
Does the Senator yield?
Thanks, Mr. President.
I will for you.
Senator, last year you had a similar piece of legislation to this one, although you've
We've added some stuff this year.
I wanted to work with you in the off season
about maybe amending this legislation to make it better.
If I were to offer a friendly amendment today
to improve this legislation,
do you think you would be open to hearing it this year?
You know, we've just been through hours and hours
of debate on other things with lots of amendments.
Let's just get through this even
and we'll take this bill on over to the house
and we'll continue to perfect it
as we get through the fact that we're doing it.
Not the answer I was hoping for.
I'm still gonna try to appreciate your spirit
and your love for your country.
Thank you, Mr. Senator.
Yes, sir, thank you.
All right, we have a couple amendments.
Secretary, read the amendments.
Mr. President, Senator McLean of 14th
and others offer the following amendment one
to amend the Senate Committee Substue
to Senate Bill 291 by replacing America online 19
with Donald Trump and online four.
Mr. President, Senator McLean of 14th
offers the following amendment one A
to amend amendment one to the Senate Committee Substue
to Senate Bill 291 by adding J
between Donald and Trump on line three.
Mr. President, I can please the order.
All right, recognize Senator from the 14th,
speak to his amendment.
Hey everybody, I certainly don't wanna take
any more of your time today.
This is a very simple amendment.
It just replaces the word America in the legislation
with the words Donald Trump.
Now, when I drafted that amendment,
I forgot, unfortunately, that the way that the license plate, probably a lot of the voters
will want it to look, is to have a J in between Donald and Trump.
So I would ask your unanimous support of amendment 1A to add J between Donald and Trump.
And I would ask your support for amendment 1 to put Donald Trump the bill.
I'm very grateful to the two centers back here, the Rules Chairman and the Senate from
the 27th for joining me on this amendment.
We have very different reasons for signing the amendment, but the unity in our purpose
is this, that we think the bill should reflect its true purpose as clearly as possible.
And so in that spirit of bipartisan compromise, let's put the issue before the body that's
really at stake and let's vote on the true intent of the bill.
Are you going to have any questions or are you going to well, Ms. President?
You do have one question, Senator from Fidget first.
I will, if we were to pass this amendment,
would you consider this amendment a beautiful amendment?
Well, it is probably that there's,
many people are saying it's the best amendment,
and I will say that even though I don't support
the underlying legislation, I know other senators might,
that's really the beauty of bipartisan compromises
to agree where you can, Senator.
But this is your amendment, correct?
It is my amendment, and like I said,
two roads diverged in the wood, and I chose no.
See, there is, there is.
Well, I appreciate your spirit of cooperation
and bipartisanship for our country.
Thank you, Senator.
If there are no other questions, Mr. President,
I'll yield the well.
Yeah, there's no other questions.
He's coming around, yo.
He's coming around.
He couldn't even speak his name last year.
Now he's offering amendments for him.
All right.
Senator, you won't close the debate, you won't.
Yeah, okay, all right.
Now, I know some of you Democrats out there are confused
right now, you're wondering which way are we gonna vote
on this important piece of legislation.
But let me just clear this up.
America first is not about a person
and it's not about an entity or an organization.
It is about our country, it is about the love
our country. It's about those 11 million people in Georgia that have a choice. When they
go to buy their tag, do they want a standard tag, do they want a veteran's tag, do they
want an organ donor tag, or do they want an American first tag with our beautiful American
flag on it. So you decide how you want to vote on this. I'm going to vote no on the amendment
because I want to make this about America first, not some other person or another organization
first. You have the well. All right, let's go. Let's get rolling here. It is, we're going
to take up a amendment. Question is on amendment number 1a, amendment number 1a, which is just
a correction for amendment number 1, but amendment number 1a, is there objection of amendment
number 1a? There is objection. All right. All those in favor of amendment number 1a will
Yeah, I'll pose nay secretary on that machine.
So
a
sit
for
State
you and
Senator, Senator.
All the adoption of amendment 1A, the A's are 34 and the A's are 22, so this amendment
is adopted.
All right.
Question is on amendment 1, authored by the MAGA man himself from the 14th.
As amended, is there objection?
There is objection.
All right, on the adoption of the amendment,
those in favor of one is amended.
We'll vote ye, those opposed nay.
Secretary, I'm not in the machine.
We're going to have Senator from the 56.
Paul, I'm going to your inquire, Mr. President.
It isn't true.
It's important we vote no to keep America first and make sure we get an important
Oregon donation license plate for the state of Georgia to save lives.
The senator, the senator is wise beyond his years.
Senator from the 31st, what Parliamentary inquiring?
Statue of inquiring.
Is it not true that Vice President JD Vance would approve of the senator from the 14th amendment?
Senator knows what he speaks.
Recognize Senator from the 53rd, what?
Parliamentary inquiring.
Statue of inquiring.
Isn't it true as Donald Trump's floor leader I'll be voting no on this amendment because I believe in America first, not in all powerful key.
Senator, Senator has that right.
All the adoption amendment one as amended, the A's are 24 and the A's are 32 and so this
amendment has failed.
All right.
On to the underlying bill.
Question is on the adoption of the committee substitute.
Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute?
Hearing none, the committee substitute is adopted.
Is there objection to agreeing to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the passes of the bill?
Chair, here's none, the Board of Committee has agreed to.
Is there objection to the main question be in order?
Chair, here's none, the main question is ordered.
The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute.
All those in favor will vote, yay, all opposed, nay, secretary, on the machine.
Senator from the 47th, what purpose do you rise?
Mr. President, is it not true that everybody should have a really great sign to share?
So we can make America great again.
There you go, Mr. President.
Senators, nose-wee-speeds.
Rick and I, Senator, it's 27 of the Webberbs, you rise.
Parliamentary inquiry.
Secretary inquiry.
Mr. President, you said the senator from the 14th
wouldn't say his name last year, but suddenly has found his rebirth.
Isn't it true that a lot of members of our party wouldn't even say his name last year,
but suddenly seem to be big fans of President.
Senator has, has a strong opinion of himself.
Reagan has sent in from the 26th, wave it, I'm sorry.
All the passes of the bill, the A's are 33, the A's are 23.
33 this bill have received the requisite constitution was already there for pass by substitute
All right moving on Senate bill 293 secretary read the caption
Senate bill 293 by senator Anderson and 24th and others to build swing title neck to mend code section 4-2-85.1
The fishcutter Georgia annotated related to license plates are certain veterans first to increase the number of free license plates
Issue to certain veterans to ride for later matters to appear conflicting laws and further purposes
Mr. President, Senate Committee on Public Safety recommends that this bill do pass respectfully
some minutes on our Albert's Chairman that completes your order, Mr. President.
Mr. President, I bring you a Senate bill 93, 293.
This is a simple bill, but a good bill.
This is for the people that put their lives on the line for us to live in a free country.
Our veterans.
This bill, all it is, right now they can currently get one tag free.
This one makes it the way they can get up to four tags free.
I ask you to vote green, thank you.
You're the well.
All right, does any other center would speak for against the manager?
Chair here's none.
Is there objection of previous question being ordered?
Chair here's none, previous question is ordered.
Is there objection to the green to the border committee,

Reed captioned. Senate Bill 27 by Senator Alverson 56 and others built

Georgia annotated, really two stalking. So to provide for the offense of doxing, to
write for penalties, write for a protective order, to write for a civil action, to
to write for a venue, to write for definitions,
to write for statutory construction,
to write for a late matter,
to appeal conflicting laws and further purposes.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Judiciary recommends
that this bill do pass by substitute,
respectfully submitted, Senator Strickland-Cherman.
Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Judiciary
offers the long substitute to Senate Bill 27,
a bill between Title IX to amend,
Article 3, Chapter 11, Title 16,
the official bill to judge annotated,
related to invasion of privacy,
so that's provided for the offenses of doxing
and aggravated doxing, to write for penalties,
to write for definitions, to write for construction,
to write for a short title, to write for a related matter,
to write for an effective date and applicability,
to appeal to convicting laws and further purposes,
Ms. President, that completes the order.
All right, recognize Chairman and Public Safety,
Senator from 56.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senators, I stand before you with Senate Bill 27,
the Georgia Anti-Doxing Act.
Doxing is a contemporary and pernicious form of harassment,
involving publicizing private information
of individuals on the internet, usually with malicious intent.
It's a gross violation of your privacy,
resulting in emotional distress,
reputational damage, and in many cases physical harm.
With the increase of digitization in our of our lives,
we need to address this issue head on
as it becomes more urgent and necessary.
I want to thank the Senator from the 39
who worked on this bill for several years
has been a big part of it, as well as the senator from the 42nd Distinguished Chair
of the Judiciary Committee for helping us perfect this language.
The bill is going to combat doxing and create a criminal act for those that commit this
heinous act.
This legislation recognizes the punishment should fit the crime, but also assures that
we do not infringe on free speech, which specifically outlines 72 to 77.
This bill takes a step in the right direction towards securing the digital safety of all
Georgia citizens, and sends a clear message that Georgia will not tolerate online harassment
is committed to protecting the privacy of our citizens.
It also acknowledges the changing landscape of our digital age and takes robust steps
to protect and uphold privacy of our fellow citizens.
In conclusion, this is a comprehensive, balanced, and necessary piece of legislation to address
the pressing issue to our citizens.
It's a practical solution to a modern day problem.
I'd ask for your favourable consideration if you don't have questions I will yield the well.
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you.
We're going to ask Senator from 39th.
Let's speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President.
So I rise today in support of SB27 because no one, whether a public servant, private citizen or business owner,
to live in fear that their personal information will be weaponized against them.
As you heard, really, truly what sets doxing apart from existing cyber stalking laws
is the methodical collection of personal data and the calculated decision on what information
to release on which platform and through which means.
Once this sensitive information infiltrates public domains, it becomes nearly impossible
to retract it, and it leaves victims vulnerable and exposed.
Working with defense attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, this legislation strikes that
delicate balance of safeguarding freedom of speech while acknowledging the seriousness
of the crime and increases its offenses upon subsequent convictions.
This bill is one of those rare ones that has support from across the spectrum, including
the anti-definition league and front line.
I urge you to vote yes in support of it,
and I yield the vote.
Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure?
Chair, here's none.
Is there objection, pre-disquestion be in order?
Chair, here's none.

Chair, here's none, main question is ordered.
Questions on the passes of the bill,
by substitute all those in favor of vote,
yay all opposed, nay, secretary, unlock the machine.
You
are one this bill having to see the rest of the Constitution of Missouri is
therefore passed by substitute. All right we got one more bill we've got to do and
then we're going to break for dinner and so secretary read the capture in
Senate bill 82. Senate bill 82 by senator Dixon the 45th and others built
to me tell an act to men article 31 on chapter 2 title 20 of the
official going to Georgia annotated the Charter Schools Act of 1998 says to
enact the local charter school authorization to support act of 2025 to arrive
for the local boards of education to reconsider the denial of local charter school petitions to require the office of charter school compliance to prepare guidelines for local boards of education for the evaluation of charter school petitions to provide reporting to provide for legislative findings and intent to write for an effective date to appeal to the laws and for other purposes.
Mr. President, the senate committee on education and youth recommends that this bill do pass by substitute respect was submitted, Senator Hickman, Chairman.
Mr. President, Senate Committee on Education and Youth,
offers the following substitutes, Senate Bill 82.
I build to maintain an act to amend Title 20,
the official college of Georgia annotated,
related to education.
So as to enact the local charter school authorization,
it's Board Act of 2025 to provide for the State Charter
Schools Commission to establish a program
for the purposes of promoting and supporting,
we approve of new local charter school petitions
by local boards of education to provide incentive grants
to local boards of education that approve
new local charter school petitions
and for other purposes, Mr. President,
that completes the order.
I recognize the senator from the 45th.
Thank you, Mr. President. Senate Bill 82, colleagues, has to do with access to charter schools across our state.
Currently, there's 96 charter schools throughout the state of Georgia.
and with about 65,000 students that attend.
And what Senate Bill 82 does is it addresses
the state charter school access issue
by incentivizing local districts
to approve more charter schools.
And it also holds districts accountable
for repeatedly denying high quality charter school petitions.
This bill is needed because there are currently
21,000 students on charter school waiting lists
throughout Georgia, yet districts, local districts,
are not approving charter school petitions.
In the past five years, only one charter school
has been approved locally in the state of Georgia.
During that same time, the State Charter School Board
has approved over 30 charter schools,
which most of those were initially denied
by the local districts.
And what this bill does, as far as incentives,
there's two financial incentives for local school districts.
In section three, the district who acquire additional capital outlay entitlement credits
in the years that they approve a charter school.
In section five, this allows districts earned $250,000 per year for a period of three years
for every year that a new charter school has approved in their district.
As far as accountability, that would be in section four.
And for districts that enroll 10 to 60,000 students, if the district denies two charter
school petitions within that year and they are laterally approved by the state.
The district would be no longer eligible for it to renew its flexibility contract with
a state board of education.
And for districts that have over 60,000 students, it would be three denials before that
would happen.
Mr. President, be happy to answer any questions.
You have no questions, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield well.
of the 38th, do you like speak to the measure?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Colleagues, I rise today in support of Senate Bill 82.
Many folks would be surprised to learn that a Democrat, in fact,
was the president who started charter schools
in the United States.
President Clinton is the president
who signed the charter schools law
to make it allowable in the United States.
One thing that I wanted to share,
I was actually going to offer a friendly amendment
to this bill because I was receiving calls about fairness.
And I was able to check with the State Charter Schools Commission
and confirm that in fact the same petition
that is given to a local district
is given to the State Charter Schools Commission
and that is the decision,
that is what they will base their decision upon
to determine if they will approve that charter school.
Currently there are over 20,000 kids.
Many of home look like me
that are on waiting list for charter schools.
So that tells us that there is an issue in terms of the level
of the amount of approvals that are occurring across the state.
And so I believe that this bill strikes the right balance.
It gives some incentives to our local districts
to approve charter schools.
I am not only a former charter school principal,
but I'm also a dad of a former charter school student.
My son graduated from a local charter school.
He was actually a zoned for a very good local high school,
but that school was not working out for him.
And my son, as a result of attending that charter school,
got a full-ride scholarship and is now getting ready
to graduate from Tennessee State University.
So I strongly support Senate Bill 82
and encourage my colleagues to join me.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the well.
All right, sounds like we've got a school choice cast.
Recognize Senator for the 35th.
All right, come on, school board members, come on, school board members, let's go back.
Colleagues, I rise as a former school board member in support of SB 82.
I am a supporter of real school choice.
So I want to commend my colleagues in this chamber for talking about choice when it comes
to public schools because the reality is that 90% of children in Georgia attend public
schools.
So if you want to provide families with real options, if you want to provide families
with innovative programming for their students, then we should be focused on doing that in
our public schools, which is why I am in support of a bill like this. I want to remind you
though that the vast majority of parents want to see innovation in their schools, but
they also support their neighborhood schools. This strikes a good balance. I'm not a fan
of using a stick, using some of the penalties that are in this bill, but at the same time
I do appreciate the incentives that are in this bill.
And I also like the fact that we are informing parents
about what each school system is doing
around school choice, providing parents
with that type of information at their hands,
at their fingertips, is something that parents desire.
At the same time, there's a reason
we have to provide school districts within incentives.
As my colleague from 26 always reminds us,
It's all about the money.
And some districts are not approving charter schools
because of the money, the cost.
So I like to remind my colleagues that we have to update
the QBE formula, a formula that is 40 years old.
It relates to this very issue.
We haven't touched it in our school districts,
whether you're in rural Georgia or Metro, Atlanta,
school districts are feeling it.
So if we really want to continue this conversation
around school choice in our schools,
colleagues, let's talk about the money.
With that, Mr. President, I yield the well.
Senators yielding.
