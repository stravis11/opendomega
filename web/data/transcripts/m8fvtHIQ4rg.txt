TRANSCRIPT
----------
Riffer puts their first amendment right of free exercise on the same level of protection
as the first amendment rights of speech, assembly, and press by simply creating a judicial
balancing test to weigh out the facts and cases, to make sure that a person's right to
praxeter faith versus government powers is matched and balanced and brought together in the fairest way possible.
Lawmakers debated religious freedom versus freedom to discriminate for a second time at the Capitol after the Senate took up the Georgia
Religious Freedom Restoration Act today. A similar bill was passed a decade ago, only to be vetoed by then governor Nathan Deal.
Good evening and welcome to Lawmakers on Day 27 of the Georgia Legislative
Session. I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta. It may come as a surprise to some, but
kindergarten is not mandatory in Georgia. One Senator is trying to change that.
Also, the debate over tort reform has included arguments for insurance
reform in the state. Tonight, two lawmakers offer different views on that issue.
And we learn about a bill that passes in the Senate to protect vulnerable
homeowners who fall victim to scam artists after a natural disaster hits.
Let's start with the flurry of bills on the floor of both the chambers today
with Sarah Callis from today's Capitol Report. Hi, Donna, with Cross Over Day
looming, each chamber works late into the day passing a plethora of bills. The
issue of, and need for, religious freedom protections was debated in the
Senate today. SB 36, the Georgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act, is supposed to keep
the balance between state and local laws and and individuals' religious rights, mirroring
a federal law already on the books. After the federal referral law was passed, almost unanimously
in 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the federal refer only protected people
from unfair federal government intrusion and would not protect people from unfair state
and local government intrusion on their basic rights.
Since then, 39 of 50 states have adopted their own state rifer laws or seen their courts
adopt rifer level protections about judicial ruling to protect people from faith, people
who have faith from overreach by state and local governments.
For puts their First Amendment right to free exercise on the same level of protection
is the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, and press by simply creating a judicial
balancing test to weigh out the facts and cases, to make sure that a person's right to
practice their faith versus government powers is matched and balanced and brought together
in the fairest way possible.
But Democrats pushed back on the bill, first on a personal level.
After this bill, someone could deny me, my husband, my son, and my beautiful daughter service
at a business, and use their religion as a reason to do that.
So this isn't about politics for me.
It's about the ability for my family to live freely in this state.
As well as disputing the legal fairness of the bill.
Rifra at the federal level has changed dramatically since then.
It does not provide the same protections, and in fact, it is being used across the country
to discriminate against people.
It is also a fact that there are over 30 states that have referral laws in the books, but
the vast majority of those states have a civil rights statute in place to protect against
discrimination.
Georgia is one of the hands full of states that does not have a state level civil rights
law. But in the end, Democrats failed to sway any Republicans in the bill past 32 to 23
along party lines. Meanwhile, in the House, a bill that aims to help missing adults
with autism, HB 465 would allow law enforcement to send an emergency Maddie's call alert when
an adult with autism goes missing. Maddie's call alerts are currently used for adults
with dementia or other cognitive disabilities.
This bill is George's bill and saving lives because we can help others find their loved
ones and help law enforcement with the tools to find them quicker.
There are other states and cities such as Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois,
New York, Houston, Texas, and Phoenix that have established this law.
HB465 passed unanimously. The House also voted on a bipartisan bill that would prevent people with
intellectual disabilities from being sentenced to death. HB123 would bar the state from seeking or
imposing the death penalty on individuals found to have an intellectual disability by the court
during the pretrial process. Beyond the legal principles, legal laws of this, this bill reflects our
state's shared values and our belief in our state model of wisdom, justice, and moderation.
We must recognize that intellectual disability affects and individuals' ability to understand
those complex legal proceedings, not to mention their actions and the results thereof.
To put them to death is to punish them for a cognitive limitation that they did not choose.
and in essence, a part of their fundamental human identity.
We are not defined by how we treat the strongest among us,
but how we protect the most vulnerable.
The bill passed unanimously.
Also, the house approved HB79,
which would create a voluntary $300 tax credit
for safe gun storage devices like lock boxes,
firearm safes, or trigger locks.
The credit could also be used for gun safety courses.
Especially when you have children, or maybe neighborhood children come to visit that
weren't trained like maybe you train your own children, grandparents that may not think
about this.
And then, of course, we've got troubled teens that's almost redundant to say that, because
all of us were somewhat troubled when we were teenagers.
But it's a challenge, and it is, and occasionally gets to the level of a tragedy.
The bill was supported by representatives on both sides of the aisle.
but some Democrats say it does not do enough.
What if we passed a bill offering families vouchers for buying car seats?
But we did not also have a law requiring car seat use for babies and children.
What if we passed a bill instructing car insurance companies to offer lower premiums
for drivers with clean records, but we didn't also have speed limits or DUI laws?
But if we pass the bill offering tax credits for swimming lessons and water safety courses,
but did not also require safety fences around public and private swimming pools.
In those cases, I think we can recognize how, despite all the good intentions, incentives
alone do not work nearly as well as incentives coupled with regulation.
It passed 165-8.
Lawmakers return on Thursday for crossover day.
The last day, a bill can be passed in one chamber and moved to the other this session.
That's my Capitol report.
Donna?
Thanks, Sarah.
We're going to spend time looking at legislation to improve the insurance industry, protect
homeowners from scam artists, and make kindergarten mandatory in Georgia.
Let's start with insurance.
I spoke earlier today with Democratic Senator Derek Mallow about his bills, SB 155 and
156, the deal with reducing insurance premiums.
And then I talked to the Senate's Chair of Insurance and Labor, Republican Senator Larry
Walker III, to get his take on the legislation.
First, Senator Mallow says residents in his district came to him complaining about how tough
it is to find affordable insurance.
When I talked to my constituents and they were trying to figure out where they could shop
for insurance, how they could find it, I had to think about it and other than Google
insurance companies and you can pay for search engine optimization, they really couldn't
find some of the better cares of companies because they didn't have any knowledge about
that.
And if you go to an independent agent, they have this knowledge, but they're not investing
a whole bunch of money in marketing because they are an independent agent.
They're a broker representative of many different insurance companies.
So you may not know to go to them or call them that they exist.
You may just see progressive online and let me go to progressive and get a quote.
You see flow.
I know that we've talked a lot about tort reform,
it's something the governor wants this session,
but a lot of people have been asking about insurance reform.
Do you see this as part of that?
Absolutely, because people, what people agree with
and why they're supportive of tort reform is for one single issue.
And that is because their premiums continue to increase.
And so, even with tort reform,
the American Tort Association says there are no guarantees
that this will lower premiums, right?
And so other states like Florida have enacted similar measures
measures, they lowered the insurance premium tax, they've, you know, changed the
co-insurance model, they've worked to bring more carries in by changing some of
the regulatory environment around non-emitted carers. Those things matter if we
want to lower rates and we didn't do that in a comprehensive approach. I still
have people who are saying, hey, I caught my insurance company and I got full
coverage at the dealership but they're telling me I got liability only and I was
just in a car wreck and now they won't honor what I had at the dealership.
That's a problem. A piece of legislation that would ask for any rate
increased over 10% for the insurance commissioner to have to hold a public hearing so that the
general public, John Cue Public, can hear why the insurance company is proposing the
rate increase over 10% in premiums.
Most people don't know what the discussions are between the insurance commissioner and
insurance companies that happens in his office and while he said he doesn't approve all
of the rate increases that they asked for, we still don't know their justification for
why they're increasing rates and it can't be based on everything.
We're probably in casualty going up,
renters going up, home owners going up,
general liability, every version of insurance
is going just about up.
So if you want to charge more than 10% in premiums,
I think you have to disclose that at a public hearing
so there could be some public accountability
and scrutiny for those companies.
Yeah, one other thing I saw about it,
you want some kind of database for consumers
to compare rates, talk about that.
Right now, you have a lot of insurance companies
that own these websites and you think you're shopping
it out amongst their competitors,
but those websites are proprietary
and owned by the actual insurance company.
And so they're going to show their rate favorable
to who they may show as competitors,
but they're not competitors.
They may be subsidiary companies
that they actually have an interest or ownership in.
So with this website, we do just simply list
the average rate across each line of business.
So consumers will know who's an admitted carrier,
who's a non-amidic carrier,
who's allowed to operate in the state
so that they have a good understanding
because auto insurance may be the best company
for one consumer.
but if people have never heard of them
because they don't spend a lot of money on marketing,
then people may think it's only the big four
that they see on TV.
As the chair of insurance in the Senate,
talk a little bit about what you feel
about Senator Mallow's bill.
I think they're interesting.
I think he raised some valid concerns
and I look forward to having a hearing on his ideas
and vetting it out and let the committee hear that
and maybe we'll hear from some industry folks
in the commissioner's office on that.
So I look forward to it.
I asked him about this, the fact that we're talking about
toward reform and other people, some people have said,
insurance reform should take place.
What are your feelings about that?
Well, I think if we can stabilize our civil justice system
and make it more balanced and fair,
it will bring more competition back into the market
between insurance companies and stabilize rates
and hopefully we'll see him in some lowering of rates.
It's not gonna happen overnight,
But the crazy lawsuit, sort of the crazy verdicts
we've seen have driven some of the insurance carriers
to leave our market for certain segments of business.
And when you have less competition and less choice
for the consumer, it's not a good thing
and we're seeing prices go up.
I do want to make a point.
What other aspect of your life have you not seen
inflation in?
The Biden inflation has hit every aspect of our life,
whether it be automobiles or homes,
the cost of construction, cost of medical care,
all of that has gone up astronomically
in the last few years,
and all of that factors into the cost of insurance.
So when you have to replace a vehicle
or you have to a hospital stay after an accident,
those costs have gone up,
and so that's reflected in the increased premium.
But certainly, the Phryllis lawsuits
has played a part in that, too.
Let's talk about your bill.
Tell us about SB 35 that deals with property insurance
policies.
Well, we've seen, again, a pretty tough insurance market,
a hard insurance market, with carriers getting a lot
stricter on their underwriting guidelines
and trying to pair down their exposure in Georgia.
And we're seeing a lot more non-renewals
of people's homeowners insurance.
current statute only requires a 30-day written notice
for non-renoules and thus by mail, U.S. mail.
Some people aren't getting that maybe a week
before the non-renoule.
I feel like we need to extend that.
Notice time frame to 60 days to give the consumer
more time to respond and react and find other coverage.
It also will help their agents be able to navigate
the market for them and help them find other coverage
may be possible to get the non-renewal rescinded by the carrier.
Now, Chairman Walker's bill, SB 35, passed in the Senate and representative Matthew
Gamble is carrying it in the house.
As for Senator Malo's bills, Walker says he expects his committee to hold a hearing
on them in the coming weeks.
Chairman Walker also talked to me about help for Georgians hit hard by Hurricane Helene.
He has SB 201, which would protect homeowners who sign contracts with unscrupulous contractors.
Walker also pushed for budget allocations to provide hurricane relief.
It's got a lot more money in it for both the forestry industry, the ag industry to help
them recover, but also we put money in for nonprofits to be able to get grants to go
repair folks, roofs and stuff like that.
I'm excited about that.
We put a lot more money in for the debris removal
to help our cities and counties
with getting the debris removed.
The federal government, it's a 75-25 match
on the debris removal.
The state has committed, the governor has committed,
the state will step in and fill that 25% match
that and take that burden off the local communities.
So I'm excited that we were able
to put additional funding there.
I've got a bill Senate Bill 201.
It's on the floor today.
I hope it'll pass.
It's going to give protection to consumers
after a storm and a historic storm like Helene.
We often see contractors swoop in that are unscrupulous
and people are under a lot of pressure
And it really, they're at the worst point in their life,
wondering where they're going to live
and don't have a roof under their head.
And so they're pressured to sign contracts
with contractors that might not be legitimate.
And this bill I have today will give some protection
to allow the consumers to get out of those contracts
easier if it's after a natural disaster.
So these scam artists is who you want to go after.
And make sure people have some kind of recourse.
right. So it has two components. One is if they can cancel the consumer, the homeowner
can cancel the contract with a contractor within five days of being notified by their
insurance company. If the claim is not covered or only partially covered, they can get
out of the contract within five days.
His bill SB 201 passed by a vote of 53-1 in the Senate this afternoon and out goes to
House. I also talked to Senator Mallow about his bipartisan bill, SB 65, to require mandatory
kindergarten. I asked him what led him to draft the legislation.
I was sitting at a human elementary school with principal Wallace Lewis one day and she
had a family coming in and they were coming in and rolled for first grade. Is that the
start of school? And I thought and rolled in the first grade. I should have been here
in kindergarten, right? And then she, you know, a family said they were going to have to
to test in and said, well, principal,
while the students, why do you have to test in?
And she said, because first grade
is the compulsory age for attendance in public schools
in the state of Georgia, the home school,
public school, private school.
You have to go at first grade.
I said, so they have to test and she said, yeah,
because if there's any deficiencies or remediations,
we need to know that now so that we can get the interventions
for that student and get them on an IEP,
get them on any of the other resources that we need.
I said, well, why not kindergarten?
So kindergarten's not required.
I said, you get new.
We fund kindergarten, but it's not required.
to say no, the compulsory age for attendance is by age seven.
And so we had a bill to make kindergarten
instead of Georgia, we know that our children can't read
and read on grade level of third grade.
The earlier child is educated, the better off they'll be.
For parents who are doing a good job,
this wouldn't affect them.
For the parents who would enroll their kids
and let them stay in school for 20 days
and take them back out of school,
this bill would prohibit you from doing that.
Because if you're homeless, I love you.
Guess what, that kid would get two meals a day,
breakfast and lunch, and they would do that
by enrolling in kindergarten and someone compelling them
to make sure their child is educated.
And one part of the bill is for the to require
school districts to actually provide it.
And that means money for these districts.
So what do you say to them about that?
We fund kindergarten and the QBE formula.
So kindergarten and the QBE formula is the highest weight
of money that the state allocates in the quality
of basic education formula.
You get more money for kindergarten
than you do any other grade, which is why I pose
school voucher bill because the $6500 is even more than we allocate to the
kindergarteners and rolling in school at a kindergarten level. And so with that
being our strongest way where we spend the most money, then it should be
required if we're going to put the most investment there.
That bill passed out of the Senate's Education and Youth Committee and is now
with the Rules Committee. It could possibly come to the floor before
crossover day. I want to thank both Senator Mallow and Senator Walker for our
conversations.
Coming up, we're going to talk about some unique bills this session that might get your
mouth watering, plus an update on the busy week at the Capitol with Correspondent Sarah Callis.
You're watching Lawmakers on GPB.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers at the State Capitol during the session and
year-round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
It's good to have everyone back together.
Good news indeed.
Put your feet up a minute.
It's beautiful.
What does that sound to you, man?
It's what I love doing.
Guppity.
It's like it's more a double-wise kid.
Ariel?
Freshly baked biscuits, always.
Well, this is all proving rather cosy, isn't it?
Understanding the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in two thousand years.
This is amazing.
No, I'm excited now.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking, but look at this, it really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
We're going to talk now about a couple of what we're calling quirky bills.
These are bills that are not as serious as a lot of what they deal with at the Capitol.
The first one is making cornbread the official bread of Georgia.
I spoke to the bill's sponsor, Representative Casey Carpenter of Dalton.
Let's talk about this, Representative Casey Carpenter.
You want to make cornbread, the state bread of Georgia.
That's right, we're on a reunion tour this year.
This thing passed out of the house,
pretty convincingly last year.
And so we're looking forward to trying to get it out again.
What is so Georgia about cornbread?
Man, all the meat and threes up and down,
the I-75 corridor, and you head on to Southwest Georgia, man.
People love cornbread in the state of Georgia.
And it really goes back to the Cherokee, for me,
the Cherokee Indians, depending on where you live,
it's different Indian groups,
but that was a Native American food,
and they taught the settlers how to make it.
And then, of course, obviously,
there's meals all across the state that have
milled corn for years for cornbread
and has a man that loves southern food,
cornbreads where it's at.
So it's grown here, and then they also have the mills,
and then they go ahead and sell it here.
That's correct, that's correct.
So it makes it so Georgia.
Yeah, I mean, this is Georgia as anything else.
What's your favorite part of it?
I mean, when you have cornbread, what do you want it with?
I'm a big fan of peas.
So I like pjuice and cornbread, some greens,
hard to beat greens with it.
My granddad used to eat buttermilk and cornbread
crumbled up for dinner.
So yeah, there's a lot of ways.
Everybody's got their thing.
My grandmother used to put in buttermilk.
Mm-hmm.
Buttermilk and cornbread.
Let's talk a little bit about.
Last year, you had some competition.
The biscuit.
Yeah, big biscuits came out.
And we've actually had a few students there
about biscuit and, you know, obviously Chick-fil-A
being in Hardee's from Atlanta.
They're big biscuit sellers, but I just think that,
you know, there's biscuits everywhere.
Cornbread really sets us apart.
It makes it different.
It's totally Georgia.
Yeah, that's right.
It goes back to the indigenous people.
That's right.
So how are you feeling?
It came out of the house last year.
You know, I mean, I feel just like anything.
I feel pretty good about it.
It got mixed up with some additional language in the Senate,
so it kind of died in Senate roles.
But I think senators like Cornbread,
We just didn't give him an opportunity to vote on it.
But I look forward to my friend,
Bert Jones, bringing this up if we ever give it over there.
I see you with a tray of cornbread
walking through the Senate serving it.
Oh yeah, I mean, you know,
you gotta do what you gotta do to get your bills posted.
Hot, the butter, the little bit.
Butter meltin' off the top of that thing.
Man, it'll break your heart.
So you're feeling really good about it?
I am, I mean, we'll see.
It's early.
All right, let's hit your pitch.
It's here, your pitch.
I don't mean it's not much of a pitch.
If you don't like cornbread,
I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, it's fantastic with a lot of different things.
And this is Georgia.
Not as the peach, Robert Dickey of Kimmy,
but it's pretty close to the peach.
I love it.
All right, thank you so much.
Thank you for having me.
Another appetizing bill is about making Brunswick
stew the official stew of Georgia.
Here's my conversation with Representative Rick Townsend
of Where Else, Brunswick.
Thank you so much, Representative Townsend,
we're talking with us right now.
So let's talk about, you would like to make
Brunswick stew, the official stew of Georgia.
Of course.
What's that all about?
It's really all about, it makes sense historically,
and it makes sense economically as well.
Besides, it tastes great, you can't beat it.
Tell people who don't know what Brunswick stew is,
what it is.
Bunchery, this is kind of a thick, type stew, stew based.
It has usually pork in it,
where we put it down in Brunswick,
and it has certain veggies in there.
And you kick it and simmer it for a long time,
and the stew masters do their thing and comes out great.
It comes out really tasty and delicious.
So it's tomato-y a little bit.
A little tomato-y, yeah.
And then it does have the corn.
Now, talk about the corn and its historical reference in Georgia.
Well, of course, you think about the historical reference
about corn bread and not to mention
Casey Carpenter's bill, of course,
on making that official, I guess, bread of Georgia.
But thinking about Brunswick stew,
it can go with anything,
whether it's biscuits or cornbread.
Most people eat cornbread with it.
But it's just, it's been around for a couple hundred years.
And so, of course, American Indians had the corn.
And now, as people like to put sweet corn in there at times,
it's really up to the chef and how they want to cook it.
And you always have different variations.
And we have blind taste judges down there
who are blind taste testing when we have a stewed bully.
It's called, and what they've been-
A stewed bully.
Oh, yeah, she got to come.
We have thousands that come.
It's a one-day festival.
Raised money for local youth groups and organizations.
Part of Klanis, if you know the civic organization Klanis.
And it's one of our fundraisers
and just have a lot of,
we're usually 20 to 30 teams out there
and just have a good time at festival
and raise a lot of money.
So it's called Brunswick Stew.
But it really didn't originate in Brunswick.
Well, originated in Brunswick, Georgia.
Right.
Additionally, there's one of our counties in Virginia has tried to proclaim they're the
official birthplace of Brunswick Street, and we know that's not to be the case.
So I mean, we've got a plaque back in Brunswick, Georgia telling you that.
Without a doubt, it had to be Brunswick, Georgia.
Did he just try to steal it from you?
They tried to take the name.
They did.
Okay.
And St. Simon's, there's a connection.
Yeah, St. Simon is just across the causeway.
That's where I live at.
and Brunswick's our sister city,
and we all get along together and have a good time,
and it's just part of Glen County.
So tell me how you're doing with this bill.
It passed out of committee the other day.
Went through special rules.
I was excited.
We had the mayor of Brunswick wrote a proclamation
and letter of support.
City council did as well.
We had a local homeboy, a person who grew up in Brunswick
come testify about the significance of it.
And we'll see, it goes off to rules.
I'll be presenting either rules either,
probably Friday or Monday.
Hopefully we can get it through rules and through the house.
And then my counterpart, Mike Hodges in the Senate,
would be carrying the bill in the Senate.
He also lives on St. Simon's and fellow Kwanian.
And so he's going to carry the bill for me
once I get it through the house.
I want to know where the samples are.
Did you serve any even at the hearings?
I did not, but I did make a promise.
Once it gets to the Senate,
and they approve it, then I'm bringing in samples.
You have to have friends with me today.
I'm gonna bring in one of my chefs, Ron Adams,
the local Stu Master.
If not, I'll bring up Stu from Southern Solo,
one of our great places down there.
Okay.
We're ready for it.
Make sure you let all of us on the crew know about it.
I was gonna say, I'm sure you wanna be invited, right?
That's it.
We'll do that, Donna.
Alrighty, thank you.
both the cornbread bill and the Brunswick stew bill
passed in the house onto the Senate.
And with me, Sarah Callis, we have one more day,
crossover day, so tell us what to expect
on our special show on Thursday.
Okay, so we have some great gas lined up
to tell us all about what's going on in Cross Over Day.
We have Lieutenant Governor Brune Jones.
We'll have House Minority Whip Sam Hark
and we'll have Senator Greg Dolezal,
who's a Senate Republican.
And so, they'll be there to talk to us
about all things crossover and some of the bills
that we're expecting to come up.
There's a lot still left to do isn't there.
There is, I know we often call sports betting
the issue that never dies,
but we may see a bill that could legalize that
come up in the house tomorrow.
Okay, then.
Well, we're gonna keep up with you
and we hope you'll all tune in.
It's in the middle of the basketball playoffs
for high school, but we'll be here.
Thanks for coming in.
That does it for lawmakers today.
We're off tomorrow as lawmakers have a committee day,
but of course, as we said, we're back Friday.
I'm sorry, Thursday for our special crossover day show
with interviews from the Capitol.
Have a good night.
