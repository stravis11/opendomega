The hour of convening, having arrived, all members of the House will please report
to the floor and take your seats, all members of this house will please
report to the floor and take seats. Mr. Clark, would you ring the bell please?
All members, please report to the floor and take seats.
We are going to have the morning roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and
the clerk will unlock the machines.
all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines.
Well, good morning, that was a little weak. Good morning, better. Welcome to legislative
day five. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Before we have
our devotion. I want to extend a welcome back to our minority leader who is back after
vacation. He defied his doctor's orders to rest until April or May. I hope there's no
complications on that, Mr. Leader. When we go to have our devotion this morning, I'm
I'm going to ask you to keep Chairman John Corbett and his family and your thoughts and
prayers.
Chairman Corbett lost his dad over the weekend and he's something you never get ready
to have happen.
We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we
will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
He got a real treat for Chaplin this morning and he will be introduced by the gentleman from the 69th House District Chairman Miranda Nick's Chairman Nick's.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Earlier this session, I believe it was representative Bruce Williamson introduced the chaplain of the day and he said, I have known him all my life.
Well, today I'm going to turn this around and I'm going to say that I have known him all of his life.
Now, I know a little bit about this fella. He comes from a good family.
Now, his mother is a good woman.
I guarantee you.
But I've been told, I've been told that there are a lot of people
that think the jury's still out on his dad.
But for those of you who don't know, this is my son.
Before I tell you a little bit about him, let me introduce his family.
Of course, the good woman that's his mother is my wife, Debbie.
she's here. Stand up Sarah, his wife is here, Jasper, his son is here, Leyla, his daughter
is here, Barrett, his son is here, and Duncan, his son is here. You guys stand up, okay?
And Barrett and Duncan are going to be paging for us today as well. So they call this group
the Nick six, so we've got the Nick six with us today.
Jess was in the sixth grade when we moved to Georgia
from Alabama.
Jess graduated from Lagrange High School.
He went on to Sanford University in Birmingham
to graduate there and then he went on
to the University of Alabama Law School
where he has his degree.
When Jess was in law school and for a while after he practiced law,
he was the pastor of Briarfield Baptist Church
in Briarfield, which is just south of Birmingham.
Since that time, they have become members of Estavia Hills
Baptist Church, where Jess is the chairman of Deacons.
I know he's held a number of different positions in the church
there in leadership, but now he is chairman of their Deacons.
Over seven years ago, he and Sarah
started a new class for young adults.
And that class became one of the fastest growing classes
in their church.
The thing I'll tell you about Jess is,
Jess will not use the literature that they give to him.
He writes his own Sunday school lessons every week.
So I would say that he probably spends more time doing that
that most pastors do preparing their sermon.
Jess is a real student of the Bible.
And I think he proves that you don't necessarily
have to be in the pulpit every Sunday
to have a ministry and an impact on lives.
And I can't wait to see what he's got to say for us today,
so let me present my son, Jess Nix,
who's chaplain of the day.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen in this honorable house,
dad, people in the gallery,
thank you so much for having me here.
It's a true honor to be here,
and it's a double honor to be invited back to do this.
I did this about 13 years ago.
This is the first time that my family's been here, which is a terrific honor to be able
to be here with all my children, none of whom were born the last time.
So thank you.
It's a wonderful day for me and I just want to share some of that joy with you.
Today I want us to think a little bit about the roles that we all have.
You know, Dad was saying I was a pastor.
He was kind enough not to say the church I had was a church of about six people.
So we were not a very large church, we were a very close church.
The youngest member of my congregation besides my wife and I was 50 years old.
And I will say we have kept up with them, we love them dearly.
Then when I left that church and went to the church I go to now and started Sunday School
class. We started from scratch and we've got, you know, close to 40 people on
roll. So what I've learned is I'm apparently a much better Sunday school
teacher than pastor. And I'm okay with that, you know, sometimes God uses us in
different roles than perhaps we would like. Sometimes he makes us more
effective when we take different positions than if we got to pick them when we
let him pick them for us. So today I want to talk to you a little bit about
one of the roles that uh that you all play it's one that you all know well but
I bet it's not one that you hear too much talked about so uh I am a lawyer
by trade uh so I want to begin by reading Article 1 section 1 paragraph 9 of the
Georgia Constitution I'm sure you can all quote it that that guarantees that
the people have the right quote to apply by petition or remonstrance to those
vested with the powers of government for redress of grievances. Now, to put that in just plain old
English and tell you how it applies to you, the people of Georgia have the right to complain to you
when they think something is not right. And, you know, when you think about it, that means that the
mayors of the communities and your districts have the ability to ask for your help and getting
state funding for a local initiative. It means that local business leaders can help
your assistance in, you know, working through a permitting issue. It means that environmental
activists can ask you, could you please help them clean up a state park? I'm sure that
you get all those requests and I'm sure that we all recognize that your help with those
requests makes your district and this state a better place. We can all appreciate that.
So that's actually not what I want to talk to you this morning about.
I want you to think about some other requests that you get.
And as you know firsthand, the right to petition in the Georgia Constitution does not restrict
who can petition, nor does it restrict what they can ask you to help them with.
So the reason I know that is through phone calls with my dad.
These calls usually start with my dad asking some sort of very deep question about the
law.
He'll call me up and say, yes, got a question.
Is it really true?
I'm just giving an example that didn't really happen, but it could have.
Is it really true that you cannot wear a pink underwear to duck hunt in South Georgia?
And I'll talk to him and I'll say, well, dad, number one, I don't give out free legal
advice.
So take it for what it's worth.
Number two, if you get indicted for this, I guess I'll try to represent you.
But, you know, after I clear that, he tells me, well, I didn't figure it did, but somebody
asked me.
And he'll say, somebody, you know, one of my constituents asked me that question.
I felt like I needed to just double check that I was not missing something.
And I'll assure him that he was not.
bet that we could spend all day swapping stories between all of you for requests
that you've received from constituents, requests that perhaps didn't make the
greatest bit of sense and that you probably didn't have the ability to help
with, but requests that you receive nonetheless. Now I want you to think about
what you do with those requests because I'll tell you the one thing and I don't
want to give them a big head, but one thing I admire dad for is he responds to
them. He will actually email or call or write back to everybody who makes a
request of it. Whether it makes any sense or not. And the reason I know that is
because my mother and I will look at him and say, what are you doing? You don't
need to respond to that. You have nothing you can do to help. Not only do you
have nothing you do to help, it's clear that whatever's been asked, it doesn't
make any sense and he doesn't listen to us and he responds anyway and I just want to draw
your attention to those kinds of requests to think through those times when you get those
requests and guess what they're not going to help your district they're probably not going
to help you get elected again they're not going to get you a vote they're not going to do much
of anything, but there's somebody out there reaching out to you, and there's asking for
your help with something that they think is a problem. So, with those ideas in mind, let's
think a little bit about some of Jesus' ministry that we know about. So, if we start with
the Gatterin de Moniaque, we're told from Luke that he was naked and he had no home to
go to because he lived in the tombs and Mark chimes in that he could not be bound even by chains
and that he spent all day cutting himself and Jesus reached out to him and Jesus brought him back
to the fold so to speak. Let's talk about the famous woman at the well so Jesus you know when he
goes to talk to her and they're talking about living water he says go get your husband and she says
I have no husband. He said, you're right. You've had five. And the man you're living with now is not your husband.
And Jesus sits there and he talks to her and he meets her needs. Let's remember a little more broadly that
one of the complaints about Jesus from the religious leaders, from the people who held power was that
he was always eating with tax collectors and sinners. He was associating with the people you did not
associate if you were one of the people in power. And let's remember that Jesus responds to that
is that it's not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick, and that he came not to call
the righteous, but sinners.
And while I recognize that Jesus had a divine ability to heal and to intervene in situations
that none of us have, I think that it would be an injustice to think that his ministry
did not take a toll on him, that even reaching out to these people wasn't difficult for him.
If you look after the big events in his life, so let's take the feeding of the 5,000.
It Jesus feeds the 5,000 and it says he withdrew to a mountain by himself.
He needed some space.
Mark 1 records that one evening after sunset an entire town gathered at Jesus' door where
he was staying and healed people of diseases and drove out demons.
The very next first tells us that early the following morning Jesus went to a solitary
place to pray.
needed to get himself back in order. He was tired, he had worked hard.
Additionally, I think we have to keep in mind that when we read about the things that Jesus
did, we're given a snapshot, right? We're told Jesus reached out and healed this person.
We're not then given that person's biography as they went forward. I think we know enough
people in our churches, in our synagogues, in the places where we worship who are very
committed on Sunday and on Monday you'd never know it and I think we can
posit that human nature being what it is even some of the people that were
touched by Jesus went back to their old ways he would say you know go forth
and sin no more he didn't say go forth because now you will never see so even
Jesus realized and I think we can take it as a surety knowing human nature that
even the people that he would reach that may be a temporary thing and that they
may go right back to where they were before. I think that's why we learn in
Galatia while we hear Paul saying Galatians to all of us do not grow weary in
doing good. For at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
And so this morning I want to offer you that encouragement. Don't grow weary
in doing good and particularly don't grow weary in doing good to those constituents who
bring requests to you that may make no sense that you may not have the ability to help with.
The Georgia Constitution gives those people the right to petition their government and
the constituents of your district have designated you the person that those people should report
to. You have been put in a position to help those people uniquely. When I talk about roles,
that is a unique role that you have. And then we take the example of Jesus and the people
that he reached out to in the ministry that he had. And Jesus gives us all the example.
He gives us the call and he gives us the encouragement that whether it is the most powerful
person in your district or the person that everybody else walks by. All of them are your constituents
and all of them have needs that you uniquely may be able to help. So as elected representatives,
I hope that you will take that unique position and opportunity to serve and help the people
that no one else will and my hope and prayers that you will make the most of it. So I hope that
that you will join me in prayer now.
Lord, I pray you're blessing on this body
of elected officials.
Give them wisdom as they weigh through difficult
and profound issues of law and public policy
in their work in this chamber.
Help them to be patient with and attentive to one another
as they work together for the good of the state
and their districts.
I also ask that you guide them
as they serve the people living in their districts.
encourage and strengthen them to serve all of their constituents from the most
powerful to the most overlooked. Give them compassion, understanding and
inspiration to never grow weary in doing good. In your name we pray, Amen. Please
join me in the pledge.
And to the United States of America, and to the Republic of Alicia Sands, one nation under
the indivisible, the liberty and justice of all, and I think Mr. Smith, good to see you.
Yes, sir.
Good to see you.
I think doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

We're going on now to morning orders.

of the House.
The total time to be allocated is 20 minutes.
Given the number of members who have signed up, the chair will limit each member to one
minute.
at each Chair recognizes Chairman Silcox for a morning order. House will come to order.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today I stand to honor the six million victims of the Holocaust
and to recognize the group men and women who are here today to celebrate International Holocaust
Remembrance Day at the Georgia State Capitol.
In April of 1945, President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote to George C. Marshall,
the things I saw beggar description, the visual evidence and the verbal testimony
of starvation, cruelty, and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick.
I made the visit deliberately in order to be in position to give firsthand evidence of
these things if ever in the future, their develops a tendency to charge these allegations
merely to propaganda.
I am here to assure you that we in Georgia will never forget what our Jewish brothers
and sisters went through.
We as Americans and as Georgians must condemn all forms of religious intolerance based on
and ethnicity or religious belief.
Our Constitution protects our right to freedom of religion, and we must take this day to
remember those who suffer the most because their beliefs may God bless their memory.
Chair recognizes for a morning order representative Wolenski.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
One of the reasons we all just a minute representative.
This house will be at order during morning orders.
If you have other matters to attend to,
And please take them outside the chamber, gentlemen, may proceed.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
One of the reasons we all serve as for our families.
It is a top priority of Georgians.
Today I must share that my family tree has branches that don't exist anymore.
My great-grandmother had 10 brothers and sisters.
I should have 5,200 more cousins, but seven of those 11 siblings and 42 of my relatives
were murdered in the Holocaust.
My great Uncle Martin survived the Auschwitz death camp, so did my great Aunt Rose.
I will never forget seeing the tattoo on my great Uncle Martin's wrist.
He received from the concentration camp.
Today's the day set aside around the world to remember the Holocaust.
It's not to ask for guilt or sadness. It's not about rehashing the past.
See, at one time it was easy.
easy.
All right, at one time it was easy, those survived, could share their story.
We must not let the horror of 75 years ago fade, because there are few to remember the story
first hand.
Recently we are reminded with the tax against the Jewish community.
Our community has been forced to put tremendous resources and police protection at synagogues.
It shocks me that in Georgia, that anybody needs protection to pray due to hate.
We relearned this lesson of the past today because this is not about the Jews.
In addition to 6 million Jews who were killed, there were 5 million others killed in the
Holocaust at least solely because of their ethnicity, political beliefs, sexual orientation
or religion, including Catholic priests.
Today hatred is rising against many different groups.
We must remember that we cannot just stand up for our own.
We must support anyone who's being treated with hate.
Today, we must relearn this lesson of the past now before we learn a terrible lesson
of the future.
This session let us fight every kind of hate and let's do it together.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, good morning members of the House and guests.
Today I stand before you to share a memory.
As a child while in grade school, I had a friend, I'll call him David, just another
kid from the neighborhood, but he was a great guy. His parents were quiet, and they
didn't always come around when the other parents did. I remember his father, especially,
for he had a funny scar on his arm. At the time, I didn't think much about it, but as
a teenager, I read the book, The Diary of Anne Frank, and I realized it wasn't a scar
at all. It was a tattoo, a series of numbers. He was a survivor of a German concentration
camp. So that we never forget today, I share a quote from Ann Frank. You know, for such
a young person, she was very wise, but as Da Vinci said, wisdom is the daughter of experience,
and may we never have to experience what she did. Her message needs repeating. She wrote,
what is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it ever happening again. I ask that
We all remember and never let it happen again.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I yield the well.
Chair recognizes representative Al Williams
and representative Jones for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the Sistine Body.
Last Thursday, January, January 23rd,
Long County, Deputy Sheriff Sheldon Gordon Whitman was killed in the line of duty, serving
his county and his fellow citizens in a high-speed chase through Long County into Maca-Chosh.
The deputy sheriff is survived by his wife and four children.
Just to feel, join me in a moment of silence and remembrance of Long County, Deputy Sheriff
Sheldon Gordon Whitman thank you thank you Mr. Fever
chair recognizes chairman Gerald Green for a morning order
Thank you mr. Speaker good morning colleagues today we celebrate South West
Georgia day here at the Capitol the region of Southwest Georgia's rich with red Georgia
clay and produces major crops that contribute to Georgia's number one industry
agriculture. While farming is part of the fabric of Southwest Georgia we're also
open for business and I want to thank all the local governments, chambers of
commerce, our local health care system, Phoebe Putney, Andrew College, the
Boy and Girls Club, Albany State University, United Way of Southwest Georgia,
and also STEM. And we also have the Smithsonian traveling exhibit here and we
would love for you to come down on the second floor and join us. And Mr.
Speaker, I would like to end a feud here at the Capitol. I'd like to ask that
representative Randy Nick's chairman would he come up. We have from Southwest
Georgia, the rum. Hallelujah, unusual. And this was done by Spiro's wife April. She and she had a hard
time with the rum in there because it kept disappearing as Spiro moved through the house. Thank you,
You must speak, uh, thank you, uh, representative.
And I hope he'll do the Christian thing and share it.
The T totaler's caucus gets the first shot at it, though.
Chair recognizes Representative Casey Carpenter for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So guys, I come before you today to tell you some great news.
I don't know if any of you watched the pro-bow last night, but Coach Matt Land from
Dalton, Georgia won the Don Chula Award for the best high school coach in the United States
last night.
Super proud of him.
He's coached in Dalton for 25 years.
He was my position coach when I played and we can't be more than excited for what he's
done for our community and how well he represented it.
in Orlando yesterday. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome colleagues back to our session. I would like to
start again with our children that we have adopted ready for adoption in Georgia. Today I want to
to talk to you about Selena, who's 16 years old,
Christina, who's 12, and dominant, who's 10.
Selena is a smart girl who's currently enrolled in JROTC.
She plans to join the military to become a lawyer and help
kids like her through the adoption and foster care
process.
She has great grades and is well-behaved.
Christina is a loving, creative, and energetic child
who is protective of her brother and sister.
She enjoys doing arts and crafts.
Dominic is a polite and well-mannered boy
who enjoys sports, especially basketball.
He likes to play on his tablet.
This group needs an attentive, supportive,
and encouraging family who's able to keep them
connected with their adult sister.
And I would like to say on a personal note,
one of my most favorite jobs as a social worker
was to do adoption recruitment activities for children
who particularly for sibling groups.
Some research will tell us that sibling group bonds
are just as strong as a parent bond.
And to keep a sibling group like this together
is of the utmost importance.
So I encourage you to talk to your friends and family
about adoption.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan
and Representative Jones for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House, the Brunsett Golden Oils Chambers here
today.
So if you see them around, they can be capped, sort of lost, show them the way.
And would you please stand, members of the Brunsett Golden Oils Chamber, and we'd like
to welcome you.
Thank you for coming, and we enjoyed last night with you, too.
And I think I don't see Woody Woodside, but he's supposed to be with him, but welcome
to the chamber and y'all have a good time while you're here.
Chair recognizes Chairman Cantrell for a morning order.
Good morning colleagues.
I got a two-part morning order for you this morning.
First of all, I want to stand before you today and honor the real West Cantrell.
And many of you know me by that name, but the real West Kintrell at my house is my father.
He's a Georgian native, came from humble beginnings, the son of two public school educators
who rose to eventually become the president, CEO of a billion dollar international corporation.
And he turned 85 years of age yesterday.
He was the best man at my wedding, not because he's my dad, but because he's literally
the best man that I know.
colleagues, would you join with me in wishing my father a happy 85th birthday today? Thank you.
The second part of my morning order is to remind you you should have had a flyer on your desk
about the free showing of Just Mercy this Wednesday afternoon 5.30 pm at the landmark theater,
about three miles from here. This showing is brought to you by
generous gift from Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. No media, no
lobbyists, just us. Come join us. Chair recognizes representative Eric
like a Thomas and representative Bennett for a morning order.
Colleagues, if you would like to join me, and when great souls die, after a period peace
blooms slowly and always. Space is filled with a kind of soothing electric vibration. Our
senses restored never to be the same whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be
be and be better for they existed. On yesterday we lost a legend. Husband, father, friend,
and mentor.
Kobe Bryant, NBA, MVP, and lifelong L.A. Laker
will truly be missed.
Kobe's work ethic on and off the court
exemplified nothing short of greatness.
Our world lost a leader.
We pray for the Bryant, Mauser, Chester,
Obatiboli, and Soblin families.
Thank you so much.
And on behalf of Black Caucus, can we
you please give us a moment of silence.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes representative McLauren
for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to honor and express support
and the strongest terms for public defenders.
What do they defend?
They defend the Constitution,
the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
guarantees adequate, effectively,
or representation to every person charged with a crime.
Our system is built on the idea of adversarial process.
We pit forces against each other
and attempt to find the truth,
but that only works when both sides have a fighting chance.
And Georgia defenders do their jobs
without resources that they need.
They don't make as much as their counterparts,
the prosecution, they certainly don't get as much prestige.
They have hundreds of cases open at any given time,
mere minutes to prepare with clients.
They don't have resources to spend on things
like expert witnesses, to travel to interview witnesses,
or to do other work on cases that they need to do,
because they're forced to dedicate limited resources
to only what they feel are the most deserving.
That's not what the Constitution requires.
We ask public defenders to stand in the breach for us
to do their best to uphold the system,
to withstand furloughs and funding shortfalls,
even where we're failing them.
So I stand today to support public defenders.
We stand today and we pray that the house does and will too.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes representative Kendrick
for a morning order.
Good morning, Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues.
I am giving you your black fact for today
because every day is a day for black history.
And you'll want to tune in to the end
because there's a special Georgia connection
that many of you don't know about.
So Brown versus Board of Education was a landmark case
in the US Supreme Court in which the court ruled
that the state laws establishing racial segregation
and public schools were unconstitutional,
even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in equality.
This case originated in 1951 when the public school district
and Topeka Kansas refused to enroll the daughter
of local black resident, Oliver Brown,
at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her
to ride a bus to a segregated black elementary school
further away.
The course decision in Brown partially overturned
Plessy versus Ferguson by declaring
that separate but equal notion was unconstitutional
for American public schools and educational facilities.
It paved the way for integration and a major victory
for the civil rights movement.
Four years later in the case of Cooper versus Aaron,
the court reaffirmed is ruling in Brown.
And we have a Georgia connection in Brown versus Ford,
our very own representative of Viola Davis,
which I don't know where she is,
but she is actually a one of the plaintiffs
in that historic case.
So take some time to hear from her
about changing US history.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
House will continue to be at order.
House will continue to be at order.
The clerk will read the caption
to House Resolution 931.
House Resolution 931 by Representative Silcox, the 52nd, a resolution recognizing January 27th, 2020 is International Holocaust Remembrance Day and for other purposes.
Chair recognizes Chairman Silcox for an invite resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today as we celebrate International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I have some special guests
that I would like to introduce.
First, Sally Levine, who's Executive Director of the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust.
Next, Chair of the Board of Directors for the Commission, Dr. Claire Dagestino.
And then from the Israeli Council, Mr. Harold Hirschberg, Director of Government and Political
affairs, then Mr. Alex Gamler, who's Deputy Council General for Israel, and last but
not least, the new Council General of Israel to the Southeast United States as of July,
Ms. Anad Sultan Daedan.
Council General Sultan Daedan began an Israeli diplomatic corps in 2004 and has also served
in Cameroon, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia.
She holds both bachelors and master's degrees from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
She is married and she and her husband have three daughters.
Council General Sultan Daedan, I would like to present to you this resolution as passed
by the Georgia House of Representatives, commemorating the International Holocaust to remember
today and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
Please welcome the council general for her remarks.
Thank you.
Speaker Ralston, Madam Chair, members of the Georgia State House, thank you for the
honor to be able to address you on behalf of the State of Israel on this very important
day as we mark the International Holocaust Remembrance Day in 75 years to the liberation
of the Auschwitz concentration camp. On the day of liberation, approximately 7,000 survivors
were liberated. That is what had remained of over a million Jews who had been deported
there. From 1941 to 1945, six million Jews were systematically murdered throughout Nazi Germany
and German occupied territories in what would become the largest genocide and the darkest of
chapters in history. Holocaust scholar Professor Yudab Bowel, while delivering a speech to the German
Bundestag in 1998 said, I come from a people who gave the Ten Commandments to the world.
Time has come to strengthen them by three additional ones, which we ought to adopt and commit
ourselves to. Thou shall not be a perpetrator. Thou shall not be a victim. And Thou shall never,
but never be a bystander. Just last week we received an Israel or over 40 world leaders who took part in
the fifth world Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem among them United States Vice President Mike Pence
and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The attendance of so many world leaders reflected the important
recognition of the global responsibility and commitment to Holocaust remembrance into combating
anti-Semitism. 75 years after the end of the Holocaust, we know all too well that anti-Semitism
is unfortunately not confined to the books of history. There are those who still today
seek the destruction of the Jewish people and Israel, the nation state of the Jewish people.
Globally, including in the United States, the alarming rise in expressions of anti-Semitism
is a further reminder of the vital importance of educating
about the Holocaust, of educating about the dangers
of anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, and all forms of hate.
The state of Georgia's commitment
to Holocaust remembrance and education
is well reflected in the Georgia Commission
on the Holocaust, made a permanent state agency
in 1998 by Act of the Georgia General Assembly.
Today, on the Capitol, Holocaust survivors and liberators
from Georgia will be honored on panels
to be hung and unveiled.
Such actions taken by Georgia for remembrance and education
are of immense importance when we speak of never again.
As I stand here today, I am not only
grateful for Georgia's commitment
to Holocaust remembrance and combating anti-Semitism.
I am also grateful for the strong bilateral relations
that Israel and Georgia enjoy on so many levels.
I am proud to represent Israel here in Georgia
and proud that we have a consulate in Atlanta since 1956,
a testimony to the importance that Israel attaches
to the relations with the great state of Georgia.
The state of Georgia's Department of Economic Development
has had representation in Israel since 1994,
recognizing the great value and potential
in our bilateral economic relations.
Our economic cooperation for the benefit of both our peoples
continues to grow, as do academic exchanges,
cultural relations, and so much more.
There is still more room to further strengthen
and deepen the relations.
And I look forward to working with all of you
towards enhancing the state of Israel's relations
with a great state of Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, thank you, thank you, and step towards them and we'll get a picture together
Thank you, I think I'll see you at one o'clock.
I think we do it. Thank you for coming.
Oh, you're welcome.
Good to see you again.
Good to see you again.
Thank you.
House will continue to be at order.
House will continue to be at order.
will read the caption to House Resolution 932.
House Resolution 932, by the sort of Mitchell the 88th, a resolution recognizing commending
Bishop Reginald Jackson in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and for other purposes.
Chair recognizes representative Billy Mitchell
for an invite resolution.
First of all, Mr. Speaker,
I want to thank you in your office,
as well as Chairman Benton's office
for helping us to put this together.
Today is African Methodist Episcopal Church Day
at the Capitol.
The AME Church was founded in 1816
is grown to over 3 million members and 7,000 congregations worldwide, 500 congregations
in Georgia. Bishop Jackson is the presiding pre-late over the six Episcopal district.
He certainly brings a wealth of activism and issues affecting the church and social
issues without further ado, and Mr. Speaker, if I may be allowed, I'd like to recognize
some of the AME members in this congregation. We have Representative Calvin Smirie, Representative
Karen Bitton, Representative Marie Metz, Representative Abel Mabel Thomas, and I'm sure I'm forgetting
someone in former Representative D. Dawkins Hagler, is a member of the AME Church as well.
we have Representative Pam Stevenson and Representative of Dexter Sharper, but I believe
some of them were missing their tides and offerings, Mr. Speaker, but nonetheless, I present
to you the presiding pre-late of the Sixth Episcopal District, Bishop Reginald Jackson.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Speaker Ralston and members of the House of Representatives
let me thank you for this opportunity
and say that it is my delight and my joy
to be here with you today.
Today is AME Day here at the State House.
And we are fortunate that AME is
some all over the state of Georgia.
Can it be with us today and just let
me ask you to wave your hand?
Yeah, look at that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then we chose the first Protestant denomination formed
on American soil as always had a commitment
to education and to social justice.
And it is in that light that we ask every year
for AMEs to come to the state house,
wanting to see how our government works
and interact with the leaders who helped shape policy
and past laws in Georgia.
I want to specially thank the House of Representatives
here in Georgia for passing what we believe
is a very, very important piece of legislation
for two years.
This House has passed hate crimes legislation.
I think it's important.
Georgia is one of only four states in a nation
that does not have a hate crimes law.
I think it's important that we send a message that hate and racism anti-Semitism will not
be tolerated in the state of Georgia so I want to thank the House for the leadership
you have demonstrated on this issue and pray that you will be able to convince your colleagues
across the hall to do likewise.
over again in my mind, I keep hearing Jesus say, your kingdom come, you will be done
on earth. That's what we are committed to that God's will be done on earth. Again, thank
you for this opportunity. Let me thank all the AMEs for coming. Let me thank all of
the members of the AME Church who serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. Thank
Thank you so much and all the best as you serve this state and its people, thank you.
You
