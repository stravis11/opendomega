TRANSCRIPT
----------
I know that they are very sad about that, but that's okay, we're getting down to the last
Last, okay, okay, gonna crown that one, okay, I'm doing that.
Senator Robertson, why don't you, if you will,
give us a hard word and pray for us this morning.
I will, those who are comfortable doing so,
if you'll buy your head with me.
Good afternoon, Heavenly Father.
We thank you, Lord Jesus, for the wonderful day.
You gave us, Lord God, the crisp weather this morning
and the feeling, Lord God, that we know we're here to serve you.
We ask God during this hearing today
that we keep our hearts and our minds open
as the individuals bring legislation and ideas
before us Lord God that will impact the lives
of every single citizen that lives in this state.
Keep your hand on those we serve Lord God
and please keep us faced in the correct direction.
We ask all these things in the name of your precious son,
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.
Thank you, sir.
I brought my gavel so we can bring us into order
In case Senator Blackman needs help.
We're going to be looking at HB 269 working from LC 472466S.
Public comment, excuse me, 472466S, is that what I said?
Okay, and public comment, if there's a sign-up sheet here,
if you'd like to speak on it, Senator Blackman,
We're, have you come up right now and present the bill?
And we?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Representative, I'm sorry.
Promotion.
I don't want to promote you too soon.
Though we have some great guys that have come from the house
that are here with us right now.
So this is what you can be when you grow up, who knows?
Well, I, you know, I love my Senator, he's a dear friend,
So I'm glad he's there.
And as a matter of fact, bringing before you,
Mr. Chairman, House Bill 269, members of the committee,
he and I have actually been approached
by a constituent and a good friend, Steve Williams,
who is on our local workforce development board.
And once you get into more rural parts of Georgia,
the areas that they cover geographically
are quite expansive.
I think we have an 11 county service delivery area
And so he has asked that we allow those boards to meet via teleconference.
And I think you have amended the bill to require that it is recorded,
such as any open meeting would be.
And that's really the basis of the bill.
And I'll be happy to try to answer any questions if there aren't any, Mr. Chairman.
Okay.
Any questions, comments on the bill?
Pretty simple.
Have one.
What number?
number four. Yes. It's not a question. It's a comment. Is it not true that
COVID has taught us that we can do a lot of things now rather than just
being in person? Is that not a statement of that? I think the lady knows which
speaks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right. Any other comments? Questions?
That's right time. Right time. Right time. Right time. Right time. Right time.
Press. Press. Press. Press. Right now. At the right time, Mr. Chairman, I
Make a motion, do pass.
That's a second.
We have a second.
Okay.
Any other comments, questions?
None.
Okay.
All in favor.
Raise your right hand.
All opposed.
I'll get you to use your left hand.
Okay.
Okay.
It still counts.
Okay.
We're represented black when I think you can go forth.
You just have to go to rules.
And we're done there.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Thank you very much. Go forth. Okay, and we had a vote unanimously and let's say we've got anything on that
It's just the passage of hb269 lc472466 s
All right, and members of the committee. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your commitment and
Working with us. It's been fun and
We we appreciate it and with that we're gonna dismiss us and we're gone
Bye-bye!
