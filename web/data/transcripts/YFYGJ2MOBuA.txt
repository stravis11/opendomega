TRANSCRIPT
----------
We're going to spend the show focusing on some of Georgia's most vulnerable citizens
and the state agency working to make a difference in their lives.
The Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, DBHDD.
I sat down with the man who heads DBHDD, Commissioner Kevin Tanner.
We talked about a range of topics, from ways to boost a workforce that shrank during
the pandemic to how the agency is looking to add more beds for people in crisis.
We began with the agency's role in forensic services.
DBHDD receives court orders to determine
if a person is competent to stand trial
or can accept criminal responsibility
under an insanity defense.
Under the code, we're responsible
for the restoration work.
And what that means is if someone's been charged
with a crime and their defense attorney
or their family or the prosecutor brings to the judge
and says, you know, I think that my client may have not
be competent.
They may not be able to help me participate in their
criminal defense because of a mental illness.
Then the judge can sign an order that would require our
agency to have a licensed clinical psychologist, a PhD
level psychologist, do an evaluation.
If after doing that evaluation, it's determined that
the person is indeed not competent, then the
psychologist will make a determination on whether they
they believe the person's restorable.
If they believe the person's restorable,
they're saying in their professional medical opinion
that the person could be with treatment restored to competency.
And then typically what happens,
that reports given to the judge, the court,
and then the judge will typically issue another order
that says your order to go to the state,
to DBHDD, our agency, to be restored to competency.
And once that happens, they go on a wait list.
and we bring them to one of our hospitals.
And when that happens,
you also don't have enough beds for all of that
for everybody who may need that help.
Talk about that a little bit.
Yeah, that's what people often ask me
what keeps me up at night in this role
and that's definitely it.
And it's because we have almost 800 individuals in jail
today waiting on a state hospital bed.
And it takes on average over a year now
for a male to come into the state hospital system
once we've received the order.
Now, they could have been in jail
for some time waiting on the evaluation
and then some time waiting on the order.
But once we've received it, it's taking a year or more.
We only have an entire state of Georgia.
We only have 641 forensic beds.
Now, 60% roughly of those beds
have people who have been ordered to us
not guilty by reason of insanity.
And what that is, that's different
than not being competent.
That's someone who's been charged with a crime.
It's often a serious crime.
And the court has made the determination.
This person's not guilty because they have such a severe illness,
such a severe mental illness,
they don't know the difference between right and wrong.
And they're ordered by the court to come to us.
The average length of stay for that population is six years.
We have people who've been with us for 20 plus years
at the state hospital.
So I only have about 300 beds in the entire state
for restoration services.
and I have 800 people waiting on one of those beds.
I want to talk a little bit about your making crisis
stabilization and diagnostic center.
That's a project that I'm extremely excited about.
It's really getting a lot of national attention.
So we are also responsible for the intellectual
development on disability population.
And we run the now comp waiver services
through the Medicaid waiver program.
But we have certain individuals who
are what we call hard to place.
They end up being stuck in an emergency room.
They may have co-occurring IDD behavioral health illness.
They may have a behavioral issue.
They may have a physical element.
But for whatever reason, they end up
finding themselves in an emergency room.
And we have a challenging time,
sometimes finding a provider that will take the individual.
So we have a off-challenged Airste team and our staff
and with the support of the General Assembly
and the governor, we've identified some long-term solutions.
One of those is the facility that you just mentioned.
And it will be a 16-bed, impatient,
cross-estabilization facility for the IDD population.
It will have physical health, mental health,
doctors who are experts in treating an individual with IDD.
It'll also have things like OBGYN, dermatology.
Whatever service is the individual may need,
they'll come there.
So they're stuck in an emergency room.
we'll bring them to this facility,
they'll be stabilized,
and then they'll be able to step down
into a community-based service.
The other thing I'm really excited about at this facility,
though, is gonna have a very robust outpatient component.
And we're contracting with Mercer Medical School,
and Mercer Medical School is gonna run
the outpatient component.
And why that's exciting is,
they're going to bring their docs
who are in training through this outpatient center,
and they're gonna train those doctors.
So as they go out and rule parts, especially of the state,
they're going to know how to take care of sometimes
this challenging population to care for medically.
So it's a game changer for our system,
and that's fully funded in the budget.
And that should open toward the end of May of this year.
It's under construction now.
The other thing that we identified
is we're going to have to have good places
to step those individuals down into community settings.
So we've opened two pilot homes over in the Augusta area.
there are four beds each.
And we have reduced the number of people in a hospital
by over 33% in the last year.
We're also in the process of doing two additional homes
in Macon.
And the other thing that is exciting
is we sent up a proposal to CMS,
which is the Federal Medicaid Agency.
And they've approved three types of placements
that we haven't had before.
That's more intense for the hard to place individual.
And we're in the process of building out that network.
So my prediction is, in the next two years,
by the end of the next two years,
we'll have no one stuck in an emergency room waiting on a bed.
We're gonna have a system in place
to take care of that population.
Quite a large workforce,
but I know that there are some vacancies
you'd like to see filled by qualified people.
We operate five state hospitals,
and during COVID, we lost over 1,200 employees
that lay off the workforce and went somewhere else
for higher pay.
Again, thanks to the governor
in the General Assembly and some targeted pay increases
and some across the board, state employee pay increases.
We've been able to start, turn the tide on that.
We've brought back a lot of individuals and started,
we also have a department within our agency
that is laser focused on recruitment and retention,
the O-Cartidus tremendous job leading that effort for us
and it's making a difference.
We also have a large number of partnerships
that we have forged with universities
and technical schools to help turn out folks.
I'm going to be having dinner with one of our university
presidents here in a couple of weeks.
And we're working closely with them
to try to create a PhD-level psychology program
for someone who's actually working in the field today.
The only way I have 50 people that work for me
who's interested in getting a PhD
to have a master-level psychology degree,
their master-level psychologist.
But in order for them to be able to do the evaluations we
talked about to be able to testifies an expert in court,
they have to be a PhD level loss and psychologist.
I have a 35% vacancy rate in that area.
I have 50 people who would love to fill those roles.
But in order to get that education in Georgia,
they would have to quit their job and go to school full time.
So it's been done in some other areas around the state.
It's been done in law enforcement space
with the Georgia Law Enforcement Command College.
It's been done with public administration
and some other areas.
So we're having some serious conversations
as an agency about how can we partner
with the university system to create cohorts
in a pathway to help with the workforce.
I'm gonna be going to one of the medical schools soon
to talk to their medical students about.
Number one, consider a field as a psychiatrist.
Consider going into that.
Number two, consider the public sector.
Consider coming to work for us.
consider the state. I tell young people all the time that you know I've got a
staff of over 4,500 employees in a large budget and a lot of stress and
sometimes it can be challenging and frustrating and because some of the
problems are frustrating but all I have to do is pick a date and go to one of
our hospitals spend time with our staff, our nurses, our doctors and our
patients and to see the miracles that are being performed within the walls of
a hospital every day where they take an individual who is extremely sick that has a severe illness
that may be in a place where they're very difficult to even just handle but get them to a place
where they're and I'm thinking about one in particular where the lady had been in that case,
had been only unit by herself because of how challenging she was and when I was there she was
out in the courtyard reading a poem she had wrote about her recovery and her journey and she had
hope because she had found the right medication regimen. She had found the right people to
help her, to be with her, to walk with her. And for the first time, probably in a long
time, she had hope restored to her. So if I can get young people to be able to see that
side of what we do every day, they get up and go to work every day, make having miracles,
I think we'll be able to turn the tide and are staffing.
Yeah, my final question was going to be what, you know, you came in in 2022, so in this
period of time, you look back on all you've accomplished, it sounds like you just told
me that answer, like the things that make you feel really good about what has happened
since you've been commissioner of this department.
Yeah, you know, when Governor Camp reached out to me and asked me about taking this role,
I wasn't seeking the job, I wasn't looking for a job.
But, you know, I called a person that I have great respect for and asked them what they
thought.
And they said, you know, Kevin, only a few opportunities will ever come along in your
life where you can truly make a difference.
And when they come along, you have to take them.
And so I took this role because I felt like that we needed to make a difference.
And what I have found is we have a dedicated group of men and women across Georgia who are
or D.B.H.D., who are now filling and powered to be creative and to create change in the
system and their performance miracles every day.
The budget passed by the House today calls for more money for D.B.H.D., including to
extend forensic services and to add a jail diversion program and outreach services for
those with severe mental illness.
I want to thank Commissioner Tanner for talking to me.
