Good morning to you and welcome to day 12 of the session. We will begin our day today with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 4th House District, Chairman Casey Carpenter. Thank you, Speaker. Brothers and sisters of the House, I come before you today to introduce a dear friend as the pastor of the day, Pastor Eric Gyle, or Gile, if you're a sports announcer because they always mess his kids' name up when they're announcing the game. Eric has been a friend of mine for five years since his family moved to our community. Pastor Gyle has been a stabilizing force for a church that has gone through a lot of heartache over the last decade. He and his wife, Maxine, have been a blessing for Christ's Church and for our community. But today will actually be the first day I've ever heard him preach, because I don't bring my pastor down here. I don't want you guys filling his head with stories that might question his ability to shepherd his flock. In all seriousness, I brought Pastor Gyle down here today because we do life together. We have kids who are the same age, and I'm sure if he preaches anything like he parents, we're in for a great surprise. So without further ado, the man that met the legend, Pastor Eric Gyle. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Casey, my friend, Representative Carpenter, and thank you, Representative, as the great state of Georgia for this opportunity to speak and to pray with you today. This morning, I just want to share a couple thoughts about conflict, conflict that's driven by anger. It's something that we face every day. I've even been told that sometimes it breaks out here in this house that there's a little bit of conflict. I grew up in, with conflict on a daily basis, you see, I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, back in the early 70s and the early 80s. And that puts me right in the middle of the golden era of ACC basketball. Now, I understand we've lived here long enough that basketball, college basketball is basically something that stands in between football season and spring ball. I get that, but growing up in North Carolina, we got into it all the time about basketball. And one time, I remember, I was called into the teacher's office after a conflict, after a scrimmage on the basketball court. And the other little boy was in there and the teacher said, what happened? And I blurted out, he called me a tar hill. Now, my teacher had grown up on tobacco road and she knew the seriousness of that charge. And she talked to him and gave us both a stern tongue, but she said, don't you ever call him that again. It's how she left it. Now, conflict, it's a part of our fallen human nature. And several years later, I was in the middle of conflict, harsh conflict, ugly conflict. In fact, this morning, driving in when the police rerouted me around because of the bomb scare reminded me of this. You see, back in the early 90s, I lived in Belfast, Northern Ireland for a while. And I got to be an assistant pastor to church there. And this was, of course, during the time that the historians called the troubles. It's when the IRA, the Irish Republican Army was fighting the loyalists and they were blowing each other up and they were shooting each other. And it was a really, it was a tough place, full of conflict. A couple years before I got there, a friend of mine was driving to her brother's house. He was a assistant dean, a warden in a prison which made him a target for the IRA. Just before she got there, an IRA assassination team ran out when he was getting in his car and shot him dead. And that's what she drove up to the scene of her brother, her younger brother, lying there next to his car. A couple years later, my friend and I and some other Christian ministry workers were at a big community gathering. And all of a sudden, she tensed up and we said, what's wrong? And she said, the solicitor, the IRA lawyer, that got my brother's murderers off with a slap on the wrist, he just walked in the room. And then she started to shake a little bit and she said, I feel like God's telling me I need to talk to him about grace and forgiveness and about Jesus. And I don't want to. And she started shaking and she said pray for me and we got around her and we prayed for her. And we prayed for God's peace that passes all understanding to overwhelm her. And y'all right there, before my eyes, the shaking stopped and she squared up her shoulders and she marched across that floor. She introduced herself to the man and she shared about how much her brother loved the Lord. He was in heaven, how much she loved the Lord and how much the Lord most importantly loved him. See that day, conflict ruled by anger did not win, but God's peace did. God has declared that in this world we're going to face trouble and we will all face conflict, sometimes conflict fueled by anger, but friends, it doesn't win unless we let it. If you invite the Lord in and pray and ask him for his peace to come in, it will and he will and he wins every time. Today and during this session, when you sense that conflict maybe by anger, arising, I encourage you and I'd monitor you to take a second and to pray to ask the Lord to give you his peace that passes all understanding and to watch as he does just that. Will you please stand now and let me pray for you? Let's pray together. Lord God Almighty, I pray for these men and women leaders in this hallowed chamber right now. Lord, I pray Philippians 4, 6, and 7 over them as they enter into this session. Lord, may your peace rule over their hearts and conversations and deliberations as they serve the people of the great state of Georgia. I pray this in the Prince of Peace, Jesus's name, amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. Once again, I'll remind you that members may greet the chaplain in the south any room.

Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the lady's motion. The eyes are 101. The nays are 51. And this House has reconsidered its action in failing to give House Bill 1062 the requisite constitutional majority and that will be put on a later calendar. What purpose does Chairman tankerously rise? Mr. Speaker, I rise to make motion. State your motion. I move that House Bill 1029, House Bill 1030, House Bill 1031 and House Bill 1062 be recommitted to the House and the Governmental Coordination Committee. Clerk will read the caption. House Bill 1029 by Representative Jones, the 47th B. Tottled and Act to Mennonack, incorporating the City of Milton and Fulton County, Georgia. House Bill 1030 by Representative Jones, the 47th B. Tottled and Act to Mennonack, incorporating the City of Milton and Fulton County, Georgia and House Bill 1031 by Representative Jones, the 47th B.

Tottled and Act to be applied at home, instead of exception from Ups and County advalorem taxes. On the ladies' motion, that House Bill 1029, 1030, 1031 and 1062 be recommitted to the Intergovernmental Coordination Committee, is their objection? Is their objection? The chair here is none. And those bills are back in Intergovernmental Coordination. We're going on now to morning orders. The chair recognizes Speaker Ralston, Chairman Smith, Representative Smirie, and Representative Smith for a morning order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am honored to be joined in the well today by two of the greatest leaders to ever serve in this body. Make that three, I'm Miss Cannon. The Dean of the House, Calvin Smirie, Rules, Chairman Richard Smith, and Representative Van Smith. The four of us, along with many others in this body and around this Capitol, share a special bond. We were blessed to have had the Friendship, the Wise Council, and just plain fun of knowing Pete Robinson. Pete Robinson served in this body and then went on to Distinguished Service in the State Senate and everywhere he went, he became a leader. But I knew of no one who worked as hard as he did to stay out of the limelight and stay below the radar who wielded at the same time such strong influence over state government. He was a great counselor to governors, legislators, and a speaker. He did not seek out credit. To him, political differences never were obstacles to arriving at a solution. Besides being a loving father to his three children, perhaps his greatest legacy, is the number of young people he mentored in the ways of government and with whom he generously shared his knowledge and experience. We lost Pete last July, much too young and much too quickly, and I know I and others miss him very much still today. But his quiet influence we know will never die. Pete's three children, Carolyn, Miller and Grant are with us today and will be in the any room shortly after we conclude up here for those who wish to greet them and I yield the well now to Chairman Richard Smith. Thank you, Speaker. I'm going to take a little different approach because Pete and I were very good friends for over 30 years. There are people who come in and out of our life on a regular basis that make us about a person. And I can tell you right now if it were not for Pete, I would not have been on City Council and if it were not for Pete, I would not be here. Pete was a tremendous guy in force in my life and the last time I talked with Pete was the week before he passed. And remember, he started having issues and three weeks later he passed. Last time I talked with him, the last words I said is Pete, I love you and that's he said I love you too. We need to remember life is real fragile. So that's all I've got to say but I miss him and I would, there's not, there's been a day that's gone by I haven't talked about. And every time I'm sitting up there in rules or in my office or talking with you, first thing I think about is if Pete was sitting across, I would, I would, he and I discussed it. So he paid a major influence on me and I'll tell you I really miss him and I didn't know if I could come up and do this, Speaker. Walter Dean Schmory. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and thank you for bringing this resolution and this chair of the Columbus delegation in this house, Representative Van Smith and Registra Smith representative Carolyn Hugh Glenn, Representative Debbie Bunkner. I'm really thrilled with the sale word of two on behalf of Pete. Pete and I were dear friends. Pete was a very witty guy and he kind of kept me on the right end of things and we shared so many memories and moments together and the time when the day Mill and Grant brought it by my office and the day I wear it in honor of their father and Jenna and so so his was just a wonderful person. I've never seen anybody that goes fast and quickly up to leadership loud as Pete. He came in here in 1985 and stayed for six years and went to the Senate and in his freshman year he became a flow leader to Governor Miller and then he became a jar to leader and then became president pro temer of the Senate all within four years of service. So Pete was a tremendous individual and I'm just honored today to stand here and say a word about his life and he left a strong legacy and he did so much in the footprint of Columbus Georgia and across the state of Georgia so I'm honored today to stand here and say a word about my friend Pete Robinson. Welcome to Representative Vince Smith. Thank you Miss Pigger. I love Pete. Pete was a big influence on me when I first ran. I too as Chairman Richard Smith said I've known Pete 30 years and he would call up sometimes just for the moment and he'd go we need to talk. That's probably one time somebody called and I didn't really turn them meeting down because he was so knowledgeable. He loved the state of Georgia. He served the state of Georgia and he continued to serve the state of Georgia after he left political office and that's said by my speaker he was behind the scenes. Great friend, loved his family, loved his children and I hope you'll take a minute to speak to Carolyn and Miller and Grant and tell them how much you appreciated your friendship and appreciated the work that Pete did for the state of Georgia. Tremendous citizen of our state of Georgia and he was certainly missed. Thank you very much Miss Pigger. Thank you Madam Speaker. Chair recognizes representatives Corbett Stevens, Hatchet and Ridley for a morning order. They waive. The chair recognizes representative Weed Hour for a morning order. Thank you Madam Speaker. Good morning colleagues. As I walked in a church yesterday someone asked me so you're going to run again. I almost surprised myself how joyfully I said absolutely. But almost immediately I began to think about how many of you in this chamber who won't be with us next year and how each of you would have responded to that same question. Summer retiring, summer running for different offices, some leaving to satisfy the pressures which we are created back home in our time here. With these departures we'll lose tremendous amount of institutional knowledge, collaborative thinkers and good friends. Coincidentally this week's devotional was about the wait we all carry around every day and it led me to continue to reflect on the people in this room and how no matter where we come from, no matter what our backgrounds are, no matter what our political affiliations are, we all carry on the wait of serving this great state. As we began this session there's been a lot of divisiveness in this room. We need to remember that this is a citizen legislature and that we're all giving up things back home to serve our communities. We leave behind jobs, the comforts of our own homes and most importantly our families. All those things carry a weight with them all while putting the weight of our communities on our shoulders. All this led to me to acknowledge that regardless of my opinion of a particular policy, I have compassion for the weight we all carry when we come in this chamber and that I care for the people in this chamber. I want to encourage everyone here to lead in a way our world needs most right now, which is respectfully. Disagree sure but let's do it respectfully. Build relationships with people who don't think like you. Let's not further dehumanize the dehumanization of elected officials which continues to run off good people who choose to satisfy their weight of responsibility back home instead of being part of what can be a very toxic environment. Let's have compassion for the weight we each carry and look for the good qualities in your fellow colleagues. Madam Speaker, thank you for the time this morning. Respectfully, I yield the will. Chair recognizes representatives Jackson and Williams for morning order. Good morning, Madam Speaker and good morning to everyone. Lives of great men all remind us we should make our lives sublime and departingly behind us. Footprints on the sense of time. I'm here this morning to ask that you stand with us in the loss of Carolyn Quillen-Coman, the first person arrested in Savannah, Georgia in the Silver Rights Movement and Levy's Department store. Carolyn was a member of NAACP until her death having served on the board.

Civil rights movement, we worked all over the South, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi. She ended up in Memphis, Tennessee, and later became the field director there, and then went on to North Carolina and became the chief assistant to Governor Hunt. She stayed there and when she passed away, she was the a member of the County Commission, the vice chair of the County Commission. She was my best friend. We called each other room. The reason I, Al, is here, well, Representative Al, is because we came up under the same leadership, so I yield to our Williams. Thank you, Representative, and thank you, Mr. Speaker, Carolyn. So many years ago, with 50 years ago, as Representative Jackson and myself were being trained as some of the legendary leaders in Savannah, Georgia. Carolyn was always in the center, and confession is good for the soul. I had a crush on Carolyn. I rather deep crush, but I was not as good looking as I am now, so I didn't make it. But Carolyn, Cullian Coleman's name, will live on in Savannah, Georgia. And as a young guy, I'd catch the bus, I'd thumb-aride to Savannah to go and demonstrate with Carolyn and Edna, and if I got out of jail or didn't go, I could catch a ride back home. Legendary times. Thank you all so much, and thank you, Madam Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Bodie for a morning order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today I rise in black history to honor the life of Reverend James Edward Orge. Reverend James Orge was both a great civil rights leader and a great organized labor icon. Reverend James Orge was born on October 29, 1942 in Birmingham, Alabama. He served as an aide to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the civil rights movement. In 1963, Reverend Orge participated in the civil rights marches, led by Dr. King and Reverend Ralph Aberdath, who heard and laughed to Georgia. Reverend Orge was a project coordinator at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, known as SCLC from 1965 to 1970. This action drew more than more young people into the civil rights movement, just by his appointment. He later became the regional coordinator with the AFL-CLO here in Atlanta, Georgia fighting on behalf of working families. In that role, Reverend Orge worked on at least 300 labor organizing campaigns. Reverend Orge was rare respected and light by all who met him. He had a custom of greeting everyone by calling them leader. Reverend Orge died here in Atlanta, Georgia on February 16, 2008. Reverend Orge is one of few individuals who will be remembered in the American civil rights hall of fame and the American organized labor hall of fame. Rest well, leader. Chair recognizes Representative Wilson from Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today I bring to you Caleb, Georgia's adopted child of the day. Caleb is a funny, friendly, helpful and easy-going teen who enjoys riding his bike, climbing trees and playing basketball, video games and board games. Monopoly and Clue are his favorites. Caleb is just one of the hundreds of Georgia children waiting for adoption in our state. Thank you, Madam Speaker. All right, we're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clark will read the caption to House Bill 891. House Bill 891, my resident Williamson, the 115th being titled back to a men's chapter of the year. I want to title 70, if you go to Georgia, annotate it related to financial institutions, so as to revive for numerous updates. And this bill I'm referring to the Committee on Bank and Banking, that committee recommends a disbilled doobass. We had Representative Williamson here moments ago. Chair recognizes Representative Williamson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members, colleagues of the House. Rise today to present to you the annual Department of Banking and Finance. I'm out of breath, excuse me. Indeed, we're all apologizing. The annual Department of Banking and Finance Housekeeping bill is continues our multi-year effort to streamline and modernize the Georgia Banking Code. Touches on all of our financial institutions in Georgia, including Credit Union's banks, money service lenders, money transmitters, payment processes, and the like. Legislation is supported by the Georgia Bank Association, South East and League of Credit Union's, the Georgia Credit Union affiliates, mortgage bank association, Georgia Finance Service Association, Georgia Stop and Under Association. It proposed a much needed cleanup language, its long bill, but most of its terms and operational efficiencies include updates to language updates reporting requirements, updates to changing the trope procedures and add ownership entities for LLCs. Feel like I'm on a football field, Mr. Representative. Against Credit Union boards, meeting flexibility and give smaller credit unions a long limit flexibility. Be happy to answer any questions. If not, Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. You've got a question if you want to yield. Mr. President, one question please. Representative Val Williams to your left. Now keep in mind, the representative in the will needs to go get on his oxygen tank. Amen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was going to tell him I'll complete his bill and then walk you down to get a whiff because I didn't understand anything you said. Well I just want you to vote, Mr. Representative. I'll yield the will and ask for the body's favorable consideration. As the gentleman has yielded the will, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair heirs none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair heirs none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? The episode of the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 891. The eyes are 151. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1055. House Bill 1055 will represent it. Ridley the six and others will be titled an act to amend Code Section 401. The fish go to George Aneterley and the definitions relevant. The motor vehicles and traffic. This bill ember for the Committee on Motor Vehicles. That committee recommends the dis bill do pass. It recognizes a representative Ridley to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, everybody. I'm excited for all of us to be here today. We've got some sweeping legislation. I think you all will be ready to go back home and use this for reelection. What we're doing here on this bill, House Bill 1055 is this moving the weight of a ATV from 2500 to 3500 pounds. The reason it's doing that is because just like everything else, it's going to electric. The battery compartment weighs more than a gas powered engine does, so we're moving that up. Mr. Speaker, at this time I'll take any questions. You do not have any questions. How you man? Thank you all. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the Committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1055. The eyes are 150. The nays are two. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk agreed to caption to House Bill 780. House Bill 780, if I remember, is that a lever to the 33rd to be entitled to amend Title 47, the official go to Georgia, Antietta, ruling the retirement impensions, so is to provide for membership a full-time judges of the statewide business court and the retirement plan established for a public court judges. This bill never referred to the Committee on Retirement. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Levere to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm presenting to you today House Bill 780, which to pick up on the comments that Representative Ridley made, this is the one bill that can probably make a bill on ATV weight seem sexy and like a great campaign issue by comparison. It's a retirement bill. It would move the single judge of the statewide business court, which was created back in 2018 by the voters of this state and a constitutional amendment from the judicial retirement system to the employer retirement system, which may seem rather odd because he is a judge, but as a judge, he has statewide jurisdiction like the judges of the appellate courts. He actually sits in the deal center across the street here and has statewide jurisdiction like them. And administratively, he is assigned to the Georgia Court of Appeals, the judges of which are all actually in the employee retirement system. The Spellac Court judges are in the ERS. And so this would move him into ERS to sort of rectify that incongruity where he's the only one in that building who's not in ERS and is in JRS. So we leave this as a more appropriate place for him to be. So Yogi Beres said, if you don't know where you're going, you can end up somewhere else. Apparently, that happened back when we created the court. And so this is just rectifying that incongruity. I would say that there has been an actual oral study. Of course, there will be a savings to JRS and a cost to ERS and those net out at about a $7,000 per year cost. And I'll give the well for questions, Miss Bigger. You do have a question if you care to yield. I yield. It recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Does it gentleman you? Ah, you, man. So can you just explain to me what is the difference between JRS versus the state employment retirement system from the perspective of the judge? What will be different for the judge? There's a rather tedious detailed description which I have on my phone if you would like to hear it. But basically, he gets a little more lucrative retirement earlier under JRS, under ERS than the one under JRS. All right. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. I'm Miss Bigger. Have further questions. Thank you, Miss Bigger. I will yield the well and ask your favorable consideration of House Bill 780. Thank you. Any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 780, the eyes are 152. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. You feel better now, Representative Williamson? Okay. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 899. House Bill 899, my representative Williamson, the 115th and others to be titled back to men, title 13, the official code of George Anatetti relating to contracts says to revive for the legal effects of discontinuance of LIBOR on contracts, securities or instruments. This bill ever referred to the committee judiciary. This bill ever referred to the committee on banks and banking. The committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Williamson to present the bill. I can miss the speaker. Good morning. I come to you as a new and refreshed representative this morning to bring you another bill. House Bill 899, LC502059ER. Mr. Speaker, actually Representative Wilkesson mentioned to me that he had never seen me so flustered before presenting this legislation. He reminded me we had a new banks and banking committee chair. It was one of that might have something to do with it. Chair, I can fear in the hearts of his committee members. This bill, in all seriousness, is the second part of the Department of Banking and Finance is a legislative package this year. For those of you that are familiar with all of us are the Wall Street Journal of Prime Floating Rate. A lot of notes, anything from borrowing from small commercial needs through long-term orgies, oftentimes, are floating on Wall Street Journal of Prime. There is an analogous rating mechanism known as LIBOR, the London Interbank offered rate that's been used more traditionally in Europe and more sophisticated financial transactions. But long story short, because of some misbehavior in that marketplace back during the meltdown around 2015, the international banking community got together and decided that pricing mechanism needed to be replaced. And the alternative pricing mechanism is known as SO FAR, the Secured Overnight Finance and Rate, which unlike the LIBOR rate, this is based on actual financial transactions. It's going to be controlled and regulated by Alternative Rate Advisory Committee, which is made up of major financial institutions, oversight committees, consumer advocate organizations and such. LIBOR will completely go away in the end of June of 2023. In the theory is that there might be contracts hanging out there that reference LIBOR with no fallback language. This bill simply adds a fallback language for SO FAR for the protection of both the borrowers and the lending community. Mr. Speaker, that's what the bill does. We have to answer any questions if anybody has any. If not, I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. I'm happy to. Chair recognizes representative Gullet. Do you arrive for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General Yield. I'd be happy to. Isn't it true that the LIBOR transition is an issue for all states and passing this George is adopting a nationally recognized standard language to ensure that our citizens, financial institutions all have a clear way through this worldwide issue. It gives us an alternative way to address the disappearance of LIBOR. You're absolutely correct. Two states have already passed this model language. We'll be the third. There's numerous states lined up to get it in place. Again, it's all about making sure that when the final shoe drops in LIBOR pricing completely goes away, there will be alternative language if needed. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well and ask for the body's favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 899. The eyes are 154. The nasors zero this bill. Having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 961 will be postponed until the next legislative day. The clerk will vote no now to the supplemental rules calendar. Supplemental rules calendar, the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 826. House Bill 826, I'm resident of very hard of the 36 and others, to be entitled to incorporate the city of La Smal. House Bill 115, the committee on governmental affairs, that committee recommends a dispelled du pass by committee substitute. The rules committee has voted to limit debate to a total of one hour on all legislation. That will be divided by the chair 30 minutes to each side. That does not include the initial presentation by the author, nor does it include the minority report or the chairman's report. Chair recognizes representative Earhart to present House Bill 826. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I present for your consideration House Bill 826, which would authorize a local referendum to create the city of Lost Mountain, Georgia, in western Cobb County. Essentially this bill would, when passed, allow the voters who lived within the proposed city limits to decide for themselves, whether or not they wish to incorporate. This is about local control. This is about bringing representation closer to the voters. For a little perspective, and I can give it to you because I live in this part of the county, and have for 50 years. Years ago in Cobb County was a much smaller county. We have the same number of commission members, five folks to represent the entire county. Currently right now, the folks who live in West Cobb, my neighbors, they do have representation. They do. But it's one commissioner for 200,000 people. Upon the creation of the city of Lost Mountain and the creation of a city council elected by the members of that city, that representation within the city. Then decreased to one for every 12,000 citizens, an appropriate representation. This new city would provide limited city services, planning and zoning, code enforcement, sanitation, and parks and recreation. The governing body would be made up of six city council members elected by the city at large, for your terms that are staggered. Again, this model would sort of control and just smaller amounts of services, folks, is what is greatly desired in my part of the county. The nice thing about having representation close to home is that you know your representatives. You know your council members because you go to church with them. You see them at the grocery store. You see them at the ball parks. I can tell you that there's a tremendous amount of momentum for the concept of city hood in Western Cobb County. I'm proud to represent that district. I'm proud to know my neighbors and know that they have a beautiful and wonderful vision for Western Cobb County. They're excited to have a say in the planning and zoning of their own neighborhoods. Currently, 80% of those on the commission council who make decisions for planning and zoning do not live in that part of the county. So the idea that the folks who are making the decisions about these sorts of things would be folks who actually live in this part of the county. I'm encouraged about the positive feedback that we've had. I'm encouraged about the momentum that we have. And I certainly ask for your favor to considerate. Mr. Speaker, I will yield to any questions. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it don't let you yield? I do. Has there been a feasibility study for the city? Yes. Thank you for asking about that. The feasibility study for the proposed city of Los Mountain was conducted by the Carl Vinson Institute at the University of Georgia. That feasibility study concluded that not only was the city financially viable, but that it would result in a $3.5 million surplus each year. So we do believe that the feasibility gave credence to the, certainly the economic feasibility of the city. Does the general lady further you? I do. Can you elaborate when exactly what this feasibility study done and $3.5 million to who? Say the last part again. And the $3.5 million to who? Right, to the city. That is the surplus to the city. In the study was conducted last year. It was begun at the beginning of the summer and concluded in late October. And in terms of the, when I say the surplus, what I mean is that the revenue to the city would exceed its expenditures by $3.5 million. And then my final question. Does the general lady further you? I do. How will the people in this proposed city get their fire and police? Right. We are only proposing to provide those four services that I mentioned. So city and fire and any other of those types of services would continue to be provided by Cobb County. Thank you. Do you further yield? I will yield for another question. Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general leave the yield? I do. I'm just going to clarify the questions I was able to watch the hearing. As you know, I live right a stones throw away from this new city. Can you explain the governance model? Because I know East Cobb had a similar governance model of at large and mayor picking among y'all, you know, people in there. But if we're trying to get closer to the people, wouldn't it be better to have each district represent their own, I mean, elect their own council people? Because you're having districts, but you're having them elected city wide. That seems kind of a different portion of it. Thank you for the question. The importance there is to be sure that all parts of the new city are represented. That's why there is a requirement. There are three districts in the new city. With the city council of six people, the requirement is that two from each district must live in that district. That way we ensure that all parts of the city are represented. The interest. That is very important. Even those six seats are elected by the city at large. So in other words, they are also, you will find that that makes those representatives accountable to all of the citizens of the city. And yet they represent and they come from where they live in the community of one of those districts. That's important because sometimes you could have an issue in one district. Let's say it's a new development or something that could have a theft on the other districts as well. So that is what, so it is six total council members. Thank you. Two final questions. You know what you describe kind of reminds me of those multi-member districts back in the early 2000s where we had multiple people representing to kind of influence the election in a certain way by putting everybody together. I can also address. Right. I mentioned that that sort of that mayoral model in that process is working very well in Thomas Villan-Rome. Or there are good examples. Yeah. Okay. The last second question is, as far as the revenues, you mentioned a $3.5 million surplus. Will there be additional taxes for these residents? Will there are taxes go up? Taxes will not go up. I'm just kind of confused. I'm looking at line 1,000, 2,000, new revenues from Utility to Franchise fee. So is that the bill incorrect or is that new revenue? It's going to be the revenue. The revenue, the revenue, the revenue is going to go to the county. But that revenue would then be directed to the, to the city. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then final.

question. The letter that we talked about earlier and I'm sorry to you, you'll for one last question. I will. Thank you. You should have from the elections director, her concern about having a May primary. Is that any concern at all as far as pushing this through? You know, I'm aware I did not receive a copy of that letter but once she mentioned it in the rules committee early this morning, I what did have an opportunity to to call her and I did actually speak to Jenny Neville or the from the Cobb Board of Directors of elections and just to kind of clarify, she indicated to me that her preference would be for a November referendum, however, it's not certainly not required and we certainly are working with expediency here to move this along just as quickly as possible so we can give the good folks a blast mount in the opportunity to decide for themselves whether or not they'd like to incorporate. Mr. Speaker, thank you so much for the time and I do yield the well. Ladies, you'll did the well. We have members who have signed up to speak both ways on the bill. Chair recognizes representative of Nullowicz to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I apologize. I'm about as out of breath as representative Williamson was a little while ago and I'm in good shape. But I digress. I just want to point out real quickly just like I did with a city had bill we had in here a week or so ago, I have some real concerns with the governing structure of this city. You know, we hear a lot of people talk about how, you know, everyone and I don't disagree. Communities should absolutely have this ability to vote to self-determine what they want to do. Do they want to incorporate? But again, they need to be able to do it with their eyes wide open and we hear from folks who have said in the past, well, you know, Cap Cano, we have all these great cities. We've got Smurny, we've got Marietta, elsewhere, we've got, you know, Roswell, we've got all of these amazing cities in Georgia and that's absolutely true. But this city isn't like those cities. This city isn't like those cities and not just because it only offers a smattering of city services but because you have these at large seats and yes, several of the people do have to live in their district but because you have these at large seats, you can absolutely have a super majority on the city council that could live in one subdivision because you could have one person in their district and then the three other at large could all live in that same subdivision. Not only that, the mayor isn't elected citywide. This would be the largest city in Cobb County. With that comes a couple of things. For example, the chair of the Board of Commissioners and the mayor of the largest city in Cobb have a seat on the Atlanta Regional Commission Board. Should the person who gets that seat be selected by the super majority of four people who could potentially live in one subdivision? That is not what I think people think they're getting when they think they're getting a city. They think they're getting true representative democracy just like we have in Smurny or you have in Marietta where the council members have to live in the district that they represent. The mayor is elected citywide. You have checks and balances when you have that also. I don't oppose new cities. I don't oppose citizens being able to have that self-determination to form a city but again I think they need to know what they're getting and I think there needs to be a structure that actually gives them what they think they're getting and this governance structure is not that. I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Mary Francis Williams to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. So I've lived in Cobb my whole life. I've lived in West Cobb. I've lived in an area that would be covered by the city of Los Mountain. I lived there for 18 years when my boys were in school. I also have districts in my current precincts in my current district which are portions of them are included in this map. So this map is in your folders I believe. I wish you would take a look at it because I really wish you would take a look at it because it is a huge chunk of Cobb. A huge chunk of Cobb. The city of Los Mountain. I mean, Los Mountain is, Los Mountain is interesting. It's actually it's called Los Mountain because you see it from a distance but when you get closer to it it disappears and there is a famous old country store in Los Mountain in that area that is now owned by a bank I think but it's been preserved. But but that's near Paulton County. This is this is a huge area. This is 75,000 people. This is this is the huge chunk of West Cobb. So we say this bill is good for business and you know Cobb has brought forward to his park Lockheed KSU, Dobbins Air Force Base and we are on the route for the ports for the Georgia port because when products go north they're going to come through Cobb. Cobb's important. My concerns I have several concerns. The management of cities brings many logistical challenges and I don't really think those challenges have been addressed. I also have concerns about the the governor's model and there were comments made about Renegade Mayors so my dad was a mayor of Marietta and I know we have other former mayors in this house on both sides of the aisle and I I don't know I personally have never known a Renegade mayor with with some kind of a Kamikaze agenda. Also there is the concern about not being able to to manage this election in time. So we're looking at four new cities in Cobb and that's a huge burden on our election director and she has written a letter which I wish she would take into consideration and I've spoken with her too and she says Mary Frances you know she says we'll do what we're told to do so if you ask her point black if you ask a county employee point black and you're a legislator she'll say if we're told to do it we'll do it but she has said to me I don't know how when I spoke with her a couple of weeks ago she didn't have the reapportionment idea. I'm not I'm not anti city either and I I have anti cityhood and I have been told that I really should just stay away from this. This is lost cause Mary Frances why are you bothering with it so I'll tell you why I'm bothering with it. I love Cobb just the way you love your counties and I know I hear you talk I know you love your counties and your cities the way I love Cobb. I really love Cobb County. I love West Cobb. I love the horse barns. I don't think this is a homogeneous area at all it's just so huge but the other thing there's a question that people a lot wiser and more experienced have not been able to answer for me and they just kind of shake their head. I don't know Mary Frances. I say what is the impact of these cities these four new cities all at once on Cobb government and nobody can answer that question for me and I say I'm just worried about it I'm worried about it I just it just seems like so much my main concerns are East Cobb and West and Lost Mountain because they're both East Cobb is not shown on this map but it's it's almost as big as Lost Cobb Lost Cobb Lost Mountain Lost Cobb yep that's where we are. So I know this is hard I know that a lot of times we get into partisan battles on things and I get that I'm as guilty of it as anybody but I'm speaking from my heart and I'm telling you I love this county I think we're moving very very fast to make huge changes to a wonderful city that as I told you has brought you Dobbins Air Force Base Lockheed, Truis Park, KSU and that's only a couple of things I could go on and on so please this isn't something we have to rush and I don't think we know what we're doing and so I would ask you to vote no on the City of Lost Mountain thank you Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Seba to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues arise today in support of House Bill 826. I'm honored to represent the 34th district in Cobb County in which the City of Lost Mountain shovels out. My predecessor representative Burt Reeves who many of you know and respect in many of you just know he was instrumental in the formation of the committee to preserve West Cobb and I am happy to see this legislation come before this House for a vote today. For many reasons you've heard today this city makes sense it provides representative government closest to the people without duplication of services. This is not a referendum on Cobb County we have some of the best services in the state of Georgia no doubt but during my campaign this summer canvassing over 6,000 doors an overwhelming number of residents indicated they were in favor of this House passing a referendum allowing them to vote on the City of Lost Mountain. The formation of this city has been in the works for several years now. In 1980 when there were about 300,000 people in all of Cobb County and the major highway going through West Cobb was compacted gravel with dirt ditches on either side of the road cotton fields corn fields line the roads out in West Cobb County it's not that way anymore we have almost 900,000 people in Cobb County now you know on any given day we have several hundred thousand people coming to work or drive through Cobb County. For these reasons among others that you've heard today I ask for your favorite both consideration of House Bill 826 Mr. Speaker I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Ed Setsler to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker Lynch, you know in House just I didn't want to address some of the questions raised it's highlight from members before I served in office I was at a town hall meeting and was there with sandals, khaki shorts and a t-shirt and we were talking to our local elected official in Cobb County about a school that was being built in our area and we wanted to make sure that some basic little small details about developing the school site went into the plan to work with the neighborhoods around it. We talked about a little trail where our kids could walk to school and in the swirl of all that and we don't have a lot of time to talk today I just will never forget we had 60 people in that town hall meeting and I don't want to call our school board member out by name but that trail of trail never got built. Those folks in that town hall meeting you asked for something very very very very simple in the big churn of a county with over 700,000 people in it just details didn't get taken up. I live in an incorporated cob now I like my commissioner in fact as a state representative it's easy to get your your county commissioner to your to return your phone call I'm sure you all know that but the challenge is when I ran for office for the first time I ran for one reason so that regular people could matter. I didn't have a political resume before I ran I wasn't really involved in politics I was raising a small family working for the engineering and the the sense in which regular folks voice needs to be present needs to be heard and needs to have a role and have meaning in representative government that is the essence of what the city of lost mountain is all about. Currently in Cobb County one elected official really all of whom I get along with well and do their best to serve serves 192,000 constituents in an incorporated cob. If you need to want to have an easement taken care of you want to have a pothole fix you have anything addressed to your county commission you have 192,000 people for one commission district and a chairman that represents the entire county. In fact your backyard is really ultimately control your the local zoning decisions the things that affect your backyard and your street a control by people in post that you don't vote for your backyard is really control by folks you can't elect. Ladies and gentlemen this vision of this quality of life and preservation focused city of lost mountain is addressing that issue head on not because we have any issues with our county our county provides really unparalleled services in many ways. In fact that's the reason why the city of lost mountain will continue to get police and fire and other services from Cobb County because they do a good job of that. But those things that matter a lot to people what happens in your backyard what's the nature of growth and change and zoning and planning and quality of life in parks and rec and trash collection those things we believe with that focus on quality of life and preserving the really unparalleled rural residential very low density residential nature of lost mountain is something that's worthy of preserving and when overlaid with this this this issue of representation that every person ought to be able to vote for the elected officials that affect their backyard is really the impetus behind this city of lost mountain. Mr. Speaker I will say the question was raised about the governance model I think it's a very strong one. Our governor's model is based on consensus you know with the council members appointing a mayor to serve on two year terms that same model is used in the city of Thomasville with great effect it's used in the city of Rome again a city of more than 50,000 people with great effect this isn't a novel concept but it's one that focuses on consensus so the mayor really serves as the first among equals because the focus of the city of lost mountain is building common vision and moving forward as a consensus city focused on quality of life not ramming down tough for three votes with or using mayoral vetoes to try to solve squabbles and fights there's great consensus about what the vision long term vision for loss of mountains should be and as an area that's larger than 126 counties that's larger than the city of Albany larger in population than Valdosta gainsville Roman statesbury I believe the 74,613 people in within the city of lost mountain have a should have an opportunity to vote for themselves do they want representative government where their neighbors and folks around them make the decisions about their backyard or do they want to be represented with one representative for nearly 200,000 people mr. speaker I will address just very briefly and again I know the lady didn't intend to do this represent no what says a great detailed legislator it was just it was a factual mistake she made I didn't wanted to make a clarification there are no at large members in the city of lost mountain I know one of the other cities that was part of the picture initially in the city of lost mountain there are six council members there are three districts there'll be two per district every two years one will run on alternating terms but there are no there is no at large representation so I know she wouldn't have said that if she it was just a factual thing that she was was unclear about but we have three districts with two two council members each one of him will be appointed mayor for a maximum two-year term mr. speakers I wrap up I would just say we're will commit this to you I think the schedule of elections with the yes or no vote in May and the election of the council members in November will maximize involvement the yes or no vote in May which the cardboard of elections does have the ability to make happen we're talking about the city limits are along major roads I know the boards of elections have had problems with annexations of individual parcels in the past but these roads are clean they're very easily defined so it is yes what we do here does add a little to the to the responsibilities of our boards of election but Cobb County is one of the best boards election in the state we have tremendous resources and the May 22 primary date will allow this yes or no vote to happen with maximum participation so that in November with the maximum participation all the elected officials who would represent the city can be elected to do otherwise would be to require a special election to be put on board by our board of elections elected officials will be elected March with very low turnout a May yes or no vote and in November decision on our elected officials maximizes public involvement in this very important decision to give representative government to 74,613 people just like you and I were before we were elected that mr. speaker I would urge your consideration and your vote for hb826 and you'll do well gentlemen is yielded the well it's my understanding that the minority report is being waived no request for the chairman's time mr. Clark you will ring the bill you what purpose does representative annullo with rise parliamentary inquiry is it not true that when I am indeed wrong about something I am happy to admit that I am wrong I thought you'd never been wrong the gentleman knows of what she speaks is it not further true that well in line 192 of this legislation it states that a council member must be a resident of the city in line 196 it says there are six posts in line 200 it says each district shall be represented by two posts but I cannot seem to find where it says the representatives must reside within the districts I will let each member do as careful a reading as the lady has and then address the concern to their good judgment what purpose does chairman all over rise and my corrects permanent inquiries are my correct that franchise fees are not collected by the county they're only collected by cities and so the suggestion that somehow municipal awarded franchise fees will already been paid by the county that's another mistake that we want to correct isn't that true sir if the lady believes that I know that she believes it to be true It's there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair is none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute, the chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here now in the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 826 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 826. The eyes are 92, the nays are 61. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does Chairman Setsler rise? Make a motion. State your motion. Like to make a motion to immediately transmit this bill to the Senate. Chairman Setsler has moved that House Bill 826 be immediately transmitted to the Senate is their objection. There is objection. All those in favor of immediate transmittal will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. The bill has been passed. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion. That House Bill 826 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. The eyes are 94, the nays are 58, and it is on its way to the state Senate. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 840. House Bill 840, members, in the Carson, 46, and others to be entitled to incorporate the city of Windings. Let's Bill have an refer to the Committee on Governmental Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Carson to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Folks, last year, of course we went through the process, but we introduced a proposal for the community of Windings to incorporate in House Bill 840. What this bill would allow would be for a much of the similar arguments that you have heard for lost mountain, but some are a little bit different. You can see on the screens to your right and left a picture of city of Windings as proposed. I want to first start off by saying that this is a much smaller entity than what we have debated in this body previously. This is only 7,000 individuals as proposed. This bill would provide for a public referendum on signings, vining cityhood with a May 24th primary and looking to have November elections later this fall. The entire area is currently completely within unacquired Cobb County and has, like I said, a population of about 7,000 residents. This would be a very light city, if you will. We're only looking to create a city that would be in charge of three items, planning and zoning, parks and recreation, and code enforcement. A feasibility of a study was done by the University of Georgia, Carl Vincent Institute. They concluded that vining would be quite honestly very fiscally feasible with about estimated revenues about 3.1 million, estimated expenses, including capital expenditures, of about 1.9 million, leaving a very healthy surplus of $1.2 million, almost a little over a third of their revenues as a surplus. Now, in regard to the city structure, this is a little bit different. You can see the picture up there on the boards. Those are the four districts. One person would be elected from each district citywide, and a little bit different from other structures. A mayor would be elected citywide as well. Mayor and council would post would be serving for a period of four years. There would be an interim period where some would serve a three, some would serve for five as an introductory period, but there would be four-year periods afterwards. Mr. Speaker, that is essentially the bill. I would also like to mention, many people feel like the vining is already a city that actually came up and chair lady tailors committee. We thought that city of vining was already a city. I will tell you that this area is politically and demographically diverse, having said that there is 71% polling in favor of a city of vining. Now, I want to repeat that because there's a lot of city hood initiatives at this capital this year, but I don't think you'll find many of this much grassroots support by the residents. 71% polling as of a year ago, and it's only grown since then. These people are looking for the ability to vote, to have a referendum, and have government closer to the people. With that, Mr. Speaker, happy to answer a question or two. I know we have probably some other people signed up for this, but if there's no questions, that will yield the will. You have several questions if you care to yield. Yes, I'll take one question. Chair, recognize this representative Bernal to your left for a question. With the gentleman you. Yes, ma'am. I've heard over and over again about the fact that you all want to have about your commissioners and the fact that about the population that you're not getting the representation. So instead of creating four new cities and coves, why didn't you all just increase your commissioners? That was not something that was contemplated. The area specifically of vinings thinks of itself as a city. They're the ones asking for this ability to incorporate. Thank you. Do you further you? I will take just one more question, sir, and I know the hours late. Chair, recognize this representative Bernalowitz to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. General Maniel. I do. Yes. I have one question. The city has a mayor. It's all in 251. It also the city has a mayor. Four council members. There are four districts.

And I, you know, vonnings is, I agree with you, has a sense of community that is genuine and true. Are the council members required to live in the districts they represent? The council members, as I understand it, yes. And we've vetted this with legislative council. Are required to live in their districts, but they will be voted citywide. But they do have to live in the district that they're going to be represented. That's correct, yes. I don't mean, again, this is a much smaller, this is, you know, the last city was 70,000, this is 7,000, that's quite the same thing. Do you further yield? Yes, ma'am. The boundaries, how can the boundaries in the map, they go far beyond what people typically think of as historic vinnings. What is the reason for that? This is something that was designed by the cityhood founders. The mines did change representative from the map that was initially proposed to the ones that we're talking about today. And the reason being is because of the 2020 census. The map that was as drawn early last year was developed off of 2010 CDT, census data tracks. This map, as designed by the cityhood initiatives in regard to where are the people that think of vinnings as a city, they want that community field, they want that closer government to them, this is what the map they designed after the 2020 census data track adjustments. Thank you. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I know the hours late, I will yield the well and ask for this body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have a couple of members who wish to speak on the bill and the chair recognizes representative Eric Allen to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll be really brief as the only member of this house who represents vinnings and the community of vinnings. It was brought up in committee that I initially did sign on to this bill after talking with members of the community because I felt they needed the process to move forward. After multiple town halls, conversations with the pro movement, the people that were against, I'm not sure where the 71% poll came from, but it was clear to me that this is not something that the residents of vinnings wanted. Mostly they called it a forced city because of the three essential services. If you think about what was just said on the three essential services, they're zoning, there's code enforcement, and there's parks. There is not a park in what would be the city of vinnings. There is one green space with about 13 parking spaces that people take and walk their dog, but it's not technically any parks that are in that area. So you're basically looking at two services, zoning and code enforcement. The other thing I'll say is there's been some talk about Director Eveler and her request to move, to not have these in May, but to move them to November if they are for a vote. It's been said that people have talked to her and said that she's willing to do what she's requested to do, but I want to be clear, and the letter is on your desk, being told to do something that you're not comfortable with is not saying that someone is willing to or ready to do it. I think it is unfair and undue burden, and if this can be corrected in the Senate, I'm hopeful that they will take that up over there. So for those reasons, I'm going to be voting no because I'm responding to my constituency, and as the only representative in this body that represents and is elected by the people who live in vinnings in the proposed city of vinnings, I encourage you to do the same. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yoke well. Chair recognizes representative gravely to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Some of you may wonder why the gentleman who represents Polton County is up here to speak on the bill about vining cityhood. A lot of things cross our minds down here, but I'll tell you, because I'm not going to say I grew up in vinnings. Graduated from high school, Campbell High School in 1990, well, I won't say that, but yes, sir, go Spartans. It's a half of Campbell High School's district incorporates vinnings. So I grew up with kids and vinnings. I went over to spend the night parties and vinnings. My first date was at the old vining's end. Still there today. I know. Tell me what crosses your mind on that one. Well ladies and gentlemen, my aunt and Nana Gravley owned the old vining's end teak store for years in downtown vinnings, which those of you who are familiar with the area would know it is the Jubilee. Old vinnings, that's where we would go hang out in high school. That's where my mother worked in the Jubilee in the health care field for 20 plus years. It was nothing for me to go and spend afternoons weekends in vinnings. And I'll be honest with you, I was one of them growing up. I thought vinnings was a city. I never knew that it was just a community. And it's a beautiful community. Sits right on the cusp of the Chattahoochi River. It's an economic center for Cobb County. The bee stros and the restaurants and the bungalows and the town homes are just beautiful. My grandmother still lives a stones throw away from the vining's community. To this day, worked in the banking community for 55 plus years. So when it comes to vinnings, ever since I was a kid, I've heard people talk about this community. For years, I thought it was a city. And I could tell you, after I graduated and came back to Cobb County, the city hood movement or the talk about vinnings being a city has been happening since the mid to late 90s. So this is something that's been 20 plus years old. My cousin worked at the Croger in vinnings. I mean, there's just a number of things that my heart and my childhood associate with this community. If you grew up in Cobb County in the Smurna area, and I know my friends, Mr. Allen and Mr. Nolowitz, who served on the city council over there, has heard the phrase Smurna vinnings. Smurna vinnings, when you want to sell your home, you say it's in the vining's community. And I know, darn well, there's been people in West Smurna selling homes in the vining's community. I know we're near that area simply because they want to associate with that community. So I would encourage you to vote favorably on this issue that has been on the hearts and minds of the residents and the taxpayers of vinnings for 20 plus years. This is a community that deserves to be a city. And for many of us, we've always thought it was a city. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the will and ask for everyone's favorable consideration and vote this measure so that vinnings can become a city. That completes the members who wanted to be heard. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 840 will vote that? Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 840. The eyes are 99. The eyes are 56. House Bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. What purpose does Chairman Carson rise to make a motion to speak? I move for immediate transmittal of HB 840 to the Georgia Senate. Chairman Carson has moved that House Bill 840 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Having no objection, it is on its way over. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Honoring the life and memory of Miller Peterson Pete Robinson.

Submitted by members of both parties. It's the chair's intent to have the clerk read all of the bills and then take one motion to suspend the road, temporarily suspend the rules to allow them to be assigned to the Intergovernmental Coordination Committee. Okay, we've got about 50 bills I'm told, so we're not going to read the caption. And these are all Senate bills, okay. Is there any objection? I'll ask the motion this way. Is there any objection to each of these local bills that came over from the Senate to be for the rules to be temporarily suspended and let these bills be all assigned to the Intergovernmental Coordination Committee? Is there objection? Chair here is none. They will each be assigned to Intergovernmental Coordination. We also have a group of house bills. Same inquiry of you. Is there any objection to letting each of those bills be filed by the clerk and assigned to Intergovernmental Coordination? Hearing no objection, it is so ordered and they will be assigned to Intergovernmental Coordination. All right. We're going on now to announcements. Hearing no to announcements.

And I know how old he is. Now I recognize the majority leader of this house for emotion. And I won't ask how old he is, Mr. Speaker. I move to this house stand adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. Tuesday, February 8, 2022. The majority leader has moved that this house would be adjourned until Tuesday, February 8 at 10 a.m. All those in favor of the motion will say aye. Those opposed will say no. The eyes clearly have it. This house will be adjourned until Tuesday, February 8 at 10 a.m. All right. Thank you.
