TRANSCRIPT
----------
Governor Brian Kemp kicked off the final
day of the legislative session by
signing Senate Bill 36 into law,
ensuring that once again at the state
level that Georgians are protected,
including Georgians of faith. And I
wanted to let everybody know that
despite signing that legislation,
Georgia still remains a state that is a
state that there's no place for hate.
And I can assure all Georgians of that
today. The law bans the government from
interfering with a person's exercise of
religion. Critics of SB36 say it allows
people to use religion as an excuse to
discriminate against marginalized
groups.
