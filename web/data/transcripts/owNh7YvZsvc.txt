TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you all for joining us this morning and I want to start out with that the message
that I need everyone to understand here today is that the GLBC the Georgia Legislative
Black Caucus is watching in every corner of the state we are watching and ready to call
out injustice where it strikes. We are here to push back on behalf of all marginalized
people. We have two pieces of legislation that are absolutely unacceptable, and we're
going to talk about those once we finish the first part of this press conference, and
we are rallying to stop some of the injustice that we are seeing as we approach shiny
We have HB 127, which is the attack on DI programs in our state.
We also have a bill that cheats our voting, and it actually works to any time it seems
like we get more black citizens to come and vote.
Now we want to change the rules, so we would speak on that.
But right now we want to speak on behalf of Sparta and the injustice that is happening
with imminent domain and the plans to have a railroad come through the land and the
property of those who have been living there for years.
So with that, I'm going to go ahead and turn the press conference over to Representative
Al Williams and he is going to open us up on that subject and then we have some speakers
who will be speaking on behalf of Sparta,
following Representative Al Williams
and Representative Smiths or Fry.
So with that, Representative Al Williams.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and to my colleagues,
and those from the Hancock area.
It was one thing for sure we have gotten nowhere
without the invoking the spirit of God.
So I'm off the program a little bit,
we're gonna ask God to be here with us
because that's who ultimately is going to have to help us.
Let us pray.
All my everlasting God, we thank you for this day.
We thank you for those who have come.
We thank you for the strength of Hancock.
And Lord, we just lift you up for it.
It is in your name, we pray.
Amen.
I spent a good deal of my life, long as it has been,
standing at courthouses, where corrupt public officials
took lands from black people.
lands that dated back to reconstruction and actually the signing of Article 15 by General
Sherman stood there at homes with grieving mothers who had put their land up to get
somebody out of jail and had lost it for a pittance of what it's worth to corrupt public
officials. We stand here now. Eminent Domain was made into law for the purpose of public use,
not private gain. Obviously we have a Supreme Court that does not agree with that assessment.
But you come and generations of land takes a strip out of the middle to enrich further
There are just a few people who already rich.
This land was all a lot of these people had.
And here we are today.
I couldn't think of something more fitting to say than what the General Secretary of
the President of the United States said at the 1963 March on Washington, where I was honoured
to be standing in the crowd.
The General Secretary said, we've come late, we've come, but we've come to set the record
straight and it's time to set the record straight. This is not time for those
who are faint of heart and they are certain folk with a lot of jingle in their
pocket. They can make us silent. These folks set us up here to speak power to
speak power and speak their needs and so we're here to tell the state of
Georgia this is wrong. This is abusive. You have robbed those who have nothing
left to be robbed of after you had taken so much. Let's forget about the foolishness of
this session, crazy legislation with just enough words called God in it to make it seem
justified. It is unjustifiable what happened to the citizens of Hancock County. One little
railroad needed four miles to further enrich by hauling some gravel out. And now they claim
in spite of all the noise and dust, we'll move a little farther out and put up some barriers
and stuff, but that will not replace the land. We need to stand tall and stand with them.
We need to stand regardless to what has been said, because I'm old enough to remember
when the Supreme Court was not even our friend. But we fought home, and sometimes we need
to remember the struggles of the civil rights movement, when we sang songs like Angle,
let nobody turn me around. Let's dust off our shoes and be aggressive in helping
these folk from Hancock County who has been robbed. Oh, there's a lot I can
say but I'm gonna stop here to get good to them. I'm gonna ask you now to please
listen to my colleague and good friend State Representative Spencer Fry. Thank
you.
You know, we got a clap after that, you know, as a son of a preacher, and working with
Representative Williams for a long time, I hate coming on after him, but here goes.
You know, you might be wondering what I'm doing here, well, I am an associate member of
the Black Caucus.
It's a very welcoming organization in Senator Mayor.
I appreciate your leadership, and for organizing this.
You know, in the United States, the number one way that it has been proven to build generational
wealth is through land ownership.
And what we think about when we say land ownership, single family homes, but this is an issue
that I discovered, it means a lot to me personally.
And we have a family farm that had a utility condemned part of the land and were given
pennies on the dollar for a one-time payment, it's heartbreaking.
And I, obviously, am a white man in the South.
What we're talking about right now are the things that have been going on in this country
for four hundred years. Longer than that. I had the opportunity to speak to
Miss Jan, he'll be introduced in a second, and it's heart-wrenching to see a
form bisected by a 50 yard wide swat, swat, for a railroad track with one
crossing in that property. It may have changed by now but that's what it was
described to me when I read the documents. Can you imagine having a farmland
that's been in a family for a hundred years and now having to give it away for
pennies on the dollar to a private entity to haul gravel while currently
they're doing it with a road, and they can still do it with a road.
But they want to put a railroad in the middle, take these folks' property away.
This is not the United States that I was born into.
This is not the Georgia that I was born into.
But this is what we are going to be fighting over and over and over again until we can put
a pen in it and call it done.
And we've got the family that's going to speak here in a second, and I appreciate y'all
making the trip and coming up, it's so good to see you.
But right now I need to introduce an advocacy organization, come on up here Larry.
Larry, Larry Raleigh is an advocacy organization, and he's here to help us advocate for this
family for their generational wealth and for the wrongs of private industry taking private
property for private profit Larry. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I want to thank
everyone for coming out for this very important occasion. So thank you. I want to extend
my gratitude to the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus for hosting this event and standing
with the residents of Sparta on this critical fight.
Today we gather here, not here just to speak, but to stand firm against a long and familiar
injustice when it has taken land, stripped of wealth, and erased histories.
The Ados Advocacy Foundation stands with the land owners of Sparta.
Their fight is our fight.
We have seen time and time again how black families have had their land stolen, whether
it's through violence, legal maneuvering, or corporate greed.
Families forced out, generations robbed their opportunity.
The racial wealth gap didn't happen by mistake, and
land theft has been one of the dividing of the driving forces.
And now, Sandersville Railroad Company wants to continue that legacy under the false pretence of public benefit.
Let it be clear, this is not about the public.
This is a private railroad company seeking private gain at the expense of
Sparta land owners. This community was never consulted because their best
inches was never a priority. This past Sunday our organization traveled to
Sparta. We set with the residents, listened to their stories, and captured
their truth. What we heard was a resilience. What we saw was a community unwilling to back
down. Many of those affected were veterans, men and women who fought for this country. And
just as they fought on foreign soil, they are prepared to fight here to the very end
against the Sanders, Ville, Railroad, and Benjamin,
tar button.
This is not just a sparta issue.
This is a justice issue, a black wealth issue,
a Georgia issue, and it speaks to a larger truth
one that this country has yet to fully reckon with.
Black Americans who are the descendants of slavery
are older dead.
a debt that has accumulated over generations of theft,
exclusions, and economic sabotage.
Reparations are not just a more necessity,
but an economic imperative to restore what has been taken.
This fight in Sparta is one chapter
and a much larger story.
Until that debt is paid, until Black land and Black wealth
is protected, our work is not done.
To the residents of Sparta, you're not alone.
We stand with you.
We will fight with you.
And we will not rest until it remains.
This land remains in the hands of the families who built it.
And now I want to introduce you to the leaders
of the No Railroad Coalition, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
Mrs. Sally, Sally, Gary.
Thank you.
Come on up here, sweetie.
Come on here.
Come on this side.
Come on this side.
Good afternoon to everyone.
It's very emotional for me right now.
And that's because my husband and my sister here in Christ, we've been fighting three
long years, three long years to keep what is ours.
I'd like you to introduce you to my husband of 45 years, a retired school teacher, a veteran,
father of our three sons, two who fought in Iraq. He's taught overseas. Those are children
just make me. I just want to cry when I see those little children because he taught
little children. When he started off, he was healthy. Three years ago, halfway through,
he was diagnosed with Parkinson's. The doctor said the stress, the stress of the fighting,
distress of him up at night knocking on doors and fighting for his family land, our land
of over a hundred years where he was raised.
He was raised in the house his father was raised in and he lives on the land that his
grandfather fought so hard for and that we now live on and have raised our children.
I'm also a retired Georgia school teacher.
And I'm also a veteran.
I served during desert storm.
I'm also an army brat.
I've lived all over the world.
And I know injustice when I see it.
This beautiful lady standing over here next to me
has been on right arm, a left arm.
She's been a prayer partner.
Their property is next to us.
I've never met her before until this happened.
We came together in a county that is divided,
white and black.
It goes back history with legacy of plantation owners,
racism, even today.
But she and Mark and I have bonded in something very common.
Her family has legacy.
She wants to keep her family land.
I've seen her little grandchildren come and play
on their family place for Christmas.
It's a sight to see you all.
Now I'm going to say this.
This fight isn't about the Blacksmith family land.
It's not about the white Garrett family land.
It's not about the Griggs and the Riggs family.
It's about 50 American families also living
in a small rural communities.
Families who can trace their history back to slavery
and the long brutal journey on slave ships from Africa.
This fight is about land ownership
for people across the country.
It is about our rights, specifically the Fifth Amendment
right that says property can only be taken for public use,
not private gain.
But in this case, Mr. Tarbund and a few of his business
associates want to take our land for their private use,
to move their goods using Mr. Tarbund's freight train
back and forth through our property and community.
Mr. Tarbund has tried to pain our county,
Hancock County as poor and in desperate need
of his millions in tax revenue.
But we already have,
Hancock County already has a CXX train line
and two of the largest foreign-owned quarries,
Heidelberg and Vulcan quarries within five miles
of our property and our homes.
I ask you this, why can't they get on that train?
Why do they have to have another train?
These businesses have been in our counties
for over 30 years.
Has our economic situation changed?
No, it's only gotten worse.
So ask yourself, is this good to spur gonna really help us?
Let me be clear, Mr. Tarbbutton,
president of the privately owned Sandersville Railroad,
won't something from us or land.
To run his freight train through,
we want nothing, nothing from him,
except for him to leave us alone.
Let him, let him go back to Standitzfield, Georgia,
and focus on helping the poor black families who live
on Taipei Street.
And I challenge you to go to Taipei Street
and see how those black people have
to live with a train running down their street.
I've been there.
I go there to encourage myself and remind myself
This is a fight worth fighting because this is what's
going to happen to us.
To governor, to governor camp, to governor camp,
we're not millionaires like the tar buttons.
We wouldn't even be standing here today asking for help
if it weren't for the pro bono attorneys for the Institute
of Justice and the Southern Poverty Law Center who
talk our case. They're not outsiders. They're just people who see people hurting and have
a cause and have a fight. And they say, we're going to get in it with you. When they first
met us, they said, we're going to be in it with you to the end, Miss Smith. We're not going
to leave you alone. They came down and saw our situation. Do you know how much three
years of legal fees? What have caused us? A lot. We didn't even have enough for a month
of legal fees. The property owners, Governor Kemp, Governor Kemp, the property owners
and 50 families from the show's role community in headcock county are asking for your support.
We are asking you and the judges to reexamine an outdated law from the 1800s that give a
private railroad the same power as national freight trains.
We're also asking you not to allow the Public Service Commission, I'll say that again,
Georgia Public Service Commission, whose members have accepted campaign contributions
from the tar buttons to that one hearing officer makes such a life altering decision for
our families and our communities.
Because folks, if that trade comes through there, we're going to have to leave out of that.
We will not be able to live with two freight trains and two rock quarries and an asphalt
within five miles of our home.
Not through imminent domain.
Not through imminent domain.
We're not asking Mr. Tarbotton, the judges are the state of Georgia to give us anything.
You gotta understand, we have been there some of us over 100 years, 150 years, I know my
family has lived there, 30 years, Miss Sally has lived there longer than that, we have,
we've paid the taxes, we've lived there.
We did not go to Sandwichville, Georgia, we did not beg an ex-Mr. Todd buttoner, come
to our county.
He felt the need to write us a letter. He didn't even have the dignity to knock on the door
and call us on the phone. He just told us in a letter what he was going to do to us.
Take our property. So we're asking you to let us keep what's already ours. God gave
it to us. Jesus gave it to us. He did not give it to us. That's injustice.
Our ancestral land, our ancestral land,
land our enslaved ancestors worked,
land our families fought in wars to protect,
and land where some of our own were even lynched.
That means hanging for defending their own freedom.
I want to thank you right now.
get real emotional and I've been getting in a lot of trouble.
But it's all right.
Because I think, what did John Lewis y'all help me?
That said, his mama used to say, boy,
would you been out there and do it?
And he said, mama, I've been out there getting it.
It's a good trouble.
And that's what I've been getting into.
And I didn't mean to get emotional,
but I left some people back on show's road
and some friends and I'm going to say that Senator Fry,
So many people, the slaves, this organization right here
with Larry has, and there's some people out there,
and people all over the country you are.
They're looking at Georgia.
They're looking at Georgia.
This is not no longer a Georgia situation.
So Georgia, what are you going to do?
Are you going to let this country, this world,
watch you, hand over land. Not only my land, our land, Smith land, Garrett land,
Reed land, an entire community of families where that train's gonna run
literally in their backyard. I don't care what you read about football these
folks. Come down. They're watching to see what Georgia is going to do for its
people. All right? Thank you all very much for listening to us.
Good afternoon everyone. My name is Mark Smith and I am from Shoes Road. My grandfather
about the property on Shoes Road where we live.
He bought 600 acres.
It's been been over 100 years ago.
And none of that is taken into consideration when it comes
to taking that land from us.
We have fought this fight for three years now,
and we're going to continue to fight it.
I have three sons who I want to continue this legacy.
And I'm sure the Garrett's, they have sons
who they want to continue their legacy.
We don't want anybody to take this from us.
We got a letter in the mail some three years ago.
And he told us, this is Mr. Tarbotton,
he told us that our land would be needed
for a project that he has.
And that's all he said.
He didn't say anything about any kind of compensation
or I'm sorry, he didn't say anything to none of that effect.
It was just that we needed.
And so we didn't quite know what to do
when we first got that message.
That's the first we'd ever heard of anything like that.
And then when we told him that he's not welcome
to come on our property that way,
he told me that he would call the sheriff department
them to remove me, you know. And we've had this property for over 100 years. My
grandfather bought it in 1926 and we could never believe that we would hear
anything like this. So we just kind of didn't know what to do at first. And so
then we decided, okay, let's fight. And it's been an uphill battle ever since.
It cost us all kinds of money, it cost us, it even cost me my health, you know, this
worrying about this thing and that I was going to lose my grandfather's property.
And if you don't think that can work on you, and then here's a man with millions of dollars
telling you he's going to take it, you know, and you don't have that kind of money.
But like Jane said, we think the poverty center, who else is doing it with us, Institute
for Justice, these people stepped in and they have been fighting this battle for us for
all this time.
And we thank them for that.
And I guess one of the other things I want to say here is, is everybody else in this room,
you have you make sure that you put it in a situation where nobody can come and
take it because this is what happens to us he didn't ask us he didn't say that
that's what he wanted to do for any good purposes he just said he needed it he
wanted it you know but then he came up after we after we had something to say
he said that it was for the for the good of the people and we haven't seen
anything good for the people in this year. It's good for him and his own. He wants to take what
our family has, has and give it to his family. And we just, we've cried, we've done everything.
We didn't know. But, okay. It's, it's, uh,
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard today pain frustration
And this is just clearly a case of the rich coming in and let's call it what it is stealing
land from everyday citizens that have lived, that have history and have built history in
their families on that land for decades.
And unfortunately, we're seeing the rich, the powerful, and big business do this across
the nation.
But we need to take a stand here in the state of Georgia, and I want to thank the residents
of Sparta for coming down here to share your story today.
We are with you.
We are ready to help lift your voices on this issue and stick with you and do whatever
we can.
So I call on everybody today that's listening to us to reach out to Governor Kim, reach
out to the legislators in this state, tell them what you've heard today, help the residents
us part of, stop this big business from coming in and taking what is rightfully belonging
to those that live there.
So with that, we're going to take questions, and if y'all stick around, we do have a little
more piece to do as we talk about some other things that are happening here, but we are
opening up for questions for anyone that has any at this time.
Thank you all for showing up here today and speaking out and let us know what else we
can do to help.
With that, we're going to end this portion of the press conference.
Okay, everyone.
We're going to shift here a little bit.
We still have members that are going to stay here and speak about this issue.
We have two other issues to talk about really quickly.
And I want to hit on the injustice that we saw last night, play out on the Senate floor
as we work to push back and stop HB127 that is a tack on DI in our state.
And last night, after the majority prematurely ended discussion, they showed that they were
unwilling to be accountable and to hear the concerns of GLBC members.
I have never seen such an act of disrespect in the Georgia Senate during my time at the
gold dome.
We were silenced, all we were seeking to do was to take a poorly written attack of a bill
and make it better.
To try to fix it, actually, we had 19 amendments that the Senate Democrats introduced, and we
were not able to talk about any of them.
Those were used, procedures were used to silence us and shut us down.
And it specifically threatens funding, HB 127, the anti-DI Bill, threatens funding for
educational program or discussion, and it is systemic oppression and social injustice
among many other things.
Tell me how we can talk about Martin Luther King or John Lewis or two of Georgia's greatest
citizens and champions of social justice without discussing systemic oppression.
We also have HB 397 which is packed full of policies blatantly designed to shift powers
in ways to help the majority cheat to win by changing the rules because they can't
elections on their own merit. It appears that the majority party is no longer
willing to win support at the ballot box by passing policies that
Georgians support and are asking for. So they have worked continuously to
engineer the results that they want and they want to change the rules of the
game every time black people get close to winning elections. I'm now going to
pass the podium on over to our leader, our Senate leader,
minority leader, Senator Harold Jones, who's going to go
further in-depth with important information about both
of these bills.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And one of the things that you'll notice about this
is all of this is connected.
has been stated, it's the powerful versus the powerless.
So we're going to be talking about DEI Bill, the voting bill,
all sorts of things that are happening
with these folks here in Hancock County and Washington County,
and all is the powerful versus the powerless.
Over this summer, Georgia plans to cancel 455,000
active voter registrations, one of the largest voter
purges in the United States history.
These registrations take the form of persons
who have been moved.
also it takes the form of people who have not participated
in the last two general elections.
First, no one should ever be removed from a voter roll
because they have not voted.
There could be various reasons where they have not had
the opportunity to vote.
Those reasons number one could be that they're not voting
actually tells you that they have a distrust or mistrust
or they don't believe in the system.
And it is our job to actually bring them back to the polls.
But does that not mean that they're not
interested in voting.
Also, they may not have had transportation
for those particular actions when those voting dates took place.
They could be various reasons that our person may miss voting,
to remove a person off the voter rolls,
because they have missed a vote is wrong,
and Georgia's prepared to purge almost 100,000 people
who fit this particular category.
This purging, though, comes on the backdrop of HB 397,
which Senate just passed.
And understand this, these purgers are based on data produced by Eric, the Electronic
Registration Information Center.
But HB 397, which actually the Senate passed, says in July 1st, 2027, Georgia will be removed
from Eric, and according to Senate Republicans will remove from Eric because we don't trust
the Eric system.
To understand, on the one hand you have the Georgia Secretary of State, who is actually
going to remove 100,000 people, a total of 450,000 people using this Eric system.
And on the other hand, you have this Republican Senate that is saying they don't trust the
Eric system and they actually want to come off of it.
The absurdity of this cannot be overstated.
Another aspect of 397 is that they would not allow counties to accept absentee ballots
after the advance voting actually taking place.
So the advance voting ends on that Friday.
What some counties were doing was establishing absentee ballots
locations that a person could still actually bring their ballot there
on that Saturday or Sunday.
HB 397 has eliminated that opportunity.
And the word, the theory was that some counties,
or counties may not be at a handle,
people dropping off their ballots on Saturday and Sunday
because the election is on Tuesday.
But do we actually have people who came to testify to say,
the people that are receiving the ballots
on Saturday and Sunday?
They're not even the same folks necessarily
that will be working on Tuesday.
But here's the bottom line.
County should have the opportunity
to make that determination.
We appear in the state capital should not
to prevent counties from actually being able to determine
whether they want to have ballot access on Saturday and Sunday.
As usual in the state capital,
Republicans are only like local control
when they actually can control it.
So here's what we must do.
This is what the voters need to make sure that they do.
Number one, if you have missed a general election vote,
you need to contact your Board of Elections
and let them know that you still want to actually vote.
Even though the rule is what the Secretary of State is using
is to last two general election votes,
I would encourage anyone who's missed a general election vote
to make sure you contact your Board of Elections.
Secondly, if you have moved and returned in the last year,
make sure that you contact your board of elections.
If you have moved but you have returned in the last year,
please contact your board of elections
and let them know you're here, you're now registered
and you want to vote.
And then third, if you receive any mail
from the board of elections, do not discard it.
Make sure that you open it, read it,
and if it requires a response,
make sure that you actually respond.
This bill, HB 397, is not set in stone yet.
It still has to go to the house.
So we encourage that the house will actually
defeat this particular legislation.
And we also encourage people to realize
that the Republicans are engaged in this voter suppression
and actually trying to prevent people from voting.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ms. Senator Merrick.
Applause
Okay, we have one more speaker.
We have a student here, D.I.?
Yes, we got to go, we have one more speaker.
You're going to speak on the DI?
Yes.
OK, we have one more speaker today.
We have Brandon, and he is going to talk a little bit
about the DI bill, that's HB127, that passed through last night.
And we're going to let Brandon have the microphone.
Thank you.
Good afternoon. My name is Brandon. I'm a student at Georgia Tech and I'm here
today in between classes to plead with our Georgia State House
representatives to vote no on HB 127. I'm very disappointed to learn that this
bill for teacher leave was being hijacked with language from a bill that did not
pass by the crossover deadline and that many of my fellow Georgia Tech students
have spoken up against. I'm here to continue speaking against it because I know
that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs
are designed to give every student, students like me,
a fair chance to work hard and succeed.
Supports for this bill argue that DEI programs
have become discriminatory.
That merit has been replaced by sympathy.
But I stand before you today to say
that this is not the entire picture.
DEI is an acronym.
It stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.
Much of the outrage has been directed at diversity.
Perhaps because it's easier to pinpoint,
numbers can be counted,
demographics can be tracked,
but that narrow focus misses the deeper work DEI does.
So let's turn our attention to the other two.
Let's take a moment to talk about equity,
ensuring fair treatment, access, and opportunity
for all individuals.
Picture a student applying to a prestigious university.
A student who does everything that they can with what's available, a student who shows up
to school every day, a student who has the potential to excel at the university, but they
cannot because of their low income area.
The resources available are just not enough.
Their application is overlooked not because they lack intelligence, but because they lack
access to the tools needed to build a good one.
You cannot claim to value merit without ignoring the barriers that prevent students from
competing on equal footing.
Then there's inclusion, creating environments where everyone feels welcomed, respected,
and supported.
Think of the student who uses a wheelchair every day alone during recess because they
can't access the playground.
The bill would prevent schools from creating programs that bring that child into the community.
I could fill the bookshelf with stories like these,
both unique and deeply common.
Stories of students who aren't asking for shortcuts
but are asking for shoes so that they could also race equally.
Yes, some DEI programs are not perfect,
but we do not abandon it.
No, we amend, revise, and evolve.
Because the vision it aspires to is worth the effort.
The bill is signed.
This bill is a sign of our representatives
giving up on those who need help the most.
Turning their backs not because the work is done,
but because the work is hard.
The aim of DEI is not to replace merit,
but to reveal it.
By removing the noise of systematic barriers,
unconscious biases, and unequal access.
Let us move forward, not because it is easy,
but because it is the right thing to do.
Thank you.
Okay, everyone, I want to thank you again for joining us.
We'll open up for any other questions that anyone has out there.
And if not, thank you again for joining us and enjoy your afternoon.
You
