All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machines. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by a Lane's husband, the gentleman from the 31st House District, representing Emery Donahue. Thank you Speaker and she did behave so we made 43 last Thursday. I knew some of you like that. It's my privilege to be here and introduce my pastor but each each year we've had the opportunity to give each one of you this devotional book and hopefully you're spending time every morning with our Lord in his word. With this there was a representative named Paul Battles who started giving these once every two years devotional books and he asked if I would continue, been blessed to do that and this year Barry Fleming helped with the payment of these books. So I challenge you, my pastor is in this book but if we look at this, if we spend five minutes in our morning time, look how much we have in a 24 hour day that we should be in God's word. This here starts our day off and our week off so I always remember that and I thank you for the opportunity to share this with you. Jeff Kruk and his wife Becky lives in Buford, Georgia with their two children, Macy and Josiah. He became the lead pastor of Christ's Place Church in November of 2003. God is blessed by adding over 4,000 new members and today Christ's place has a membership of over 8,000. During that time, listen to this Christ's place has created more than 3,000 baptisms. Jeff is a graduate of Baptist College of Florida and New Orleans Baptist seminary and he has served as pastor of four Southern Baptist churches since 1993. Five years ago, Pastor Kruk was here and he spoke on standing tall while on your knees. That is praying for your brothers and your sisters. Pastor Jeff Kruk. Well, good morning. It's a joy to be here today to take a few moments to open up God's word and hear the Bible read and have prayer together. I want to talk just a few moments about you as a leader. You are leaders in this room and leadership is influenced and you have an awesome responsibility to steward that influence. So you need wisdom, you need discernment, you need courage, you need to be praying leaders and I want to just speak a second or two about leaders who pray. When you think about prayer, sometimes folks will say prayer is powerful but really prayer is not powerful. God is powerful. See when you pray, you're praying to God. The creator, the sustainer, the one who controls this world. So when we pray, we're praying to him and leaders need to know how to connect with God and prayer. You're not alone as leaders, many leaders in the Bible, they were men and women of prayer. Some you know from childhood days when you would hear about the leader Moses and how he led millions of people. You have a responsibility to give servant leadership to millions in our beloved state of Georgia and Moses was a man of prayer, some kings by the name of David and Solomon. They both were men of prayer. Solomon in fact would often ask God for wisdom. He would pray that God would give him a wise and discerning heart. I think about another man that was a leader like many of you men and women in this room. His name was Nehemiah and he had an awesome task in front of him. Jerusalem, the city of God was in great disrepair and they were living with broken gates and walls and no one could lead to get that project done. But Nehemiah led and he led on his knees and prayer. He would pray constantly to ask God for wisdom and a project that could never be done for years and years was completed in just over 50 days because of the favor of God that was on the prayers of Nehemiah. Leaders in the New Testament are called the apostles. They walked with Jesus for three and a half years and they were so impressed with the leadership of Jesus. One time they said, Jesus, would you teach us to pray? And when they asked Jesus to teach them to pray, this is what Jesus said to those leaders. This is how you pray. Our Father in heaven, hallelujah be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever, amen. It would surprise me if there's somebody in this room that would not know the Lord's prayer. But you know you could also call it the leader's prayer. I don't know what your daily practice of prayer is like but may I give a humble suggestion to you today that you can't improve on praying the Lord's prayer to God every day. It's the perfect balanced prayer. As you look at the lines of the Lord's prayer, it starts with praise. Hallelujah be your name. And when you pray, you're praying to God. You're not praying to the big man up.

stairs. Don't you say that? That's irreverent, that's different, disrespectful. He's not the big man upstairs. He's holy God. He's the God that created everything and created every person. And we hallow His name. We recognize His name is holy. And as you continue to pray the Lord's prayer, notice priorities. Your kingdom come. Your will be done. You have an assignment as men and women of the house. We need to know the will of God for this beloved state. And we want to pray that we're always in God's will. So make prayer the priority of knowing God's will. Also provision, give us this day our daily bread. It's difficult to pray that today when you could pull out a credit card to buy something. But back in Bible days, they didn't have credit cards. They lived from sunrise to sunset by the daily bread that God would put in their hands. And God is our source. And I know you men and women are very busy in your schedules and demands. And you need the power of God in your life. And learn to trust God for whatever need is back home with your spouse or your children or your grandchildren or the community that you serve. God is your source. Pray for personal relationships. When we get this right, everything gets right. He said, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Don't let bitterness creep into your life. Don't allow sideways energy in this house. We get sideways with one another with grudges and ugly bitterness that will destroy us. And we can never move forward when we're not united. So a good part of this prayer is learning to forgive other people. He says, pray for protection. Lead us not into temptation. You have a great role as a leader. You want to finish strong. Think about men and women that once served alongside you here in other places. Maybe they didn't finish the race. Maybe they did something stupid. Did you know what sin will cause you to do? Sin will cause you to do stupid things. The Bible says, stay on the paths of righteousness. And as we pray this prayer, we're praying for protection. There's a long way to the finish line. Don't gloat. Don't read the press clippings from last year. Finish strong. Keep you out on the goal and ask for the good hand of God to protect you from all the traps that could disqualify you, fateful men and women that serve our state. So I want to challenge you to pray like leaders. Pray and trust God depend upon him and humble trust and live with the smile of God on your life and ask God every day for his blessings and favor on you. Would you stand with me as we have prayer followed by the pledge of allegiance? Bow and pray with me. Father God, we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you today for the men and women that serve this house. Thank you God for the men and women that serve the residents of Georgia. They need our prayers. They need your wisdom and we all need your favor. We've been taught today from an open Bible that you're holy. You provide our needs. You protect us from traps. And Lord, you give us grace to be gracious to one another. So help us today. Live out God's truth as we've heard it read in the Bible. Give God wisdom to these men and women as they have this session today. May Jesus Christ be honored and glorified. This we pray in Jesus name, amen. Would you now offer the pledge of allegiance with me? Pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic which is standing on one nation in visible liberty and justice for all. We're going to get our members out. Luke Kingsley is here with brother Jeff. We welcome you to the house. We appreciate your admission and the church and all the groups you're working with. We appreciate you as well.

Can you rise and let's give you a proper greeting in the House. Thank you. You either will. We're moving on to a special morning order. If we can get everybody to their seats. I've been put on notice that I'm going to be standing here for a little while. So I appreciate you guys come take an attention and we've got representative Mandisha Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I rise today to give my farewell to Georgia General Assembly as this is my last session and term. If I had to entitle this speech story, it would be what did the Lord say? It's been three years, two months and 19 days. Although I came into this elected position with a lot of knowledge, I'm leaving with a lot more than what I came with. I want to say thank you to the minority leader, James Beverly, the chair of the caucus, Billy Mitchell, and the whips, Sam Park, and Sandra Scott. My chamber mates, representative Lisa Campbell, and representative Shae Gunnadina, and my administrative assistant, Carmen Champion, as well as the majority leadership. I would also like to thank the chairman of my committees, industry and labor chairman, work hyzer, chairman of energy, utility, and telecommunications, Dom Parson, and my beloved agriculture and consumer affairs chair, Robert Dickie. It took a lot to get to this seat. In 2017, the Lord gave me clearance to run for city council in the new city of South Fulton. There there were 12 people vying for the same council seat, and before the election, the Lord told me that I would not win. And I said, I just let me make it to the runoff, and he did. And after I didn't win the council seat, three months later, I heard the Lord say, run for state. And a former representative of this body said, Mandisha, if you want to run for state, you should have started a year ago. If you want to win against a long-term incumbent. So I asked the Lord if this was true, and he said, you did start a year ago. That's why I had you run for city council. He said, all of your city council district is in your state seat, and it will be the crust of your district. So on election night, I was in the bathroom putting on my makeup, getting ready to go to the watch night party, and the Lord said again, you didn't win. And I said, not again as I fell to the floor. Because I'm tall, my head didn't hit the back of the tub, and I fell. And I sat there for a second, as I shed a quick tear, then I got up and continued to put on my makeup. Later, an old college friend came to pick me up, and I said, let's stop by Bitties, my mother's house, because I had been running around from polling site to polling site, and I hadn't seen her all day. She was standing in the doorway, and it was dark. And she said, are you on your way to the party? And I said, yes. She said, I'm going to try to stay up and watch the numbers roll in. I didn't have the heart to tell her that she could just go to bed because I wasn't going to win the race. The numbers came out, and sure enough, I did not win. After the race, I immediately went to help Stacey Abrams for governor from June to November. And then I finally asked the question, Lord, what happened? You told me to run for city council. You told me to run for state, and I didn't get either one. I asked the question again, why did not win? And the Lord never answered why? But he did say, just stick with the food deserts, Mandisha. And at that time in 2019, I was doing all this environmental work. I created the environmental justice and education awareness symposium. There was a partnership with representative Bayes Moore, Roger Burles, Kim Scofield, Debbie Buckner, and I believe Derek Jackson was there too, along with Congressman Hank Johnson. In January 2020, the Lord said, you're going to win state representative if you decide to run, but the choice is yours. It was a little hard for me, but on January 13, 2020, I said, I'm running. I asked the Lord how to win a race against a 30 year incumbent, and he said, how many people voted in your race last time? And I said about 5,000, and he said, call them all personally. I gave myself four weeks to do it as a birthday present to myself from January 13 to February 11. All of this was hurting. My philangies, my arm, my shoulder, my back arm, the pain shrugged up through my back, and my fingers were numb, my thumb, my right thumb, my left thumb was numb because I had called all these people and asked them to vote for me. When I finished calling the people, I began canvassing. I knocked on the doors, but guess what? COVID-19 hit, and I was still out knocking on doors. I remembered, I started with the city of Palmetto, then onto Union City, then onto Fairburn, and I had to stop. I got to the door in Fairburn, and a voter said, why are you out here? At that time, I knew that it was time to come back in, and I was hurt because I love campaigning. I had to stop and give myself a milkshake and steak and shake to console myself. It's funny how it was a three year journey to get here, but I'm only able to be here three years because the Lord spoke again. And said, your time is over at the General Assembly. I have done what I came here to do. I had multiple purposes for being here, representative painter, but the first thing is always going to be ministry. Ministry will always be the number one reason that I'm in a space. However, my purpose for being here was because of agriculture. I was specifically here, Chairman Dickie, to build farmers in South Fulton, to activate and engage people in agriculture, and it was so specific that I became known as the political farmer. And I travel back and forth across Georgia, South Georgia, Middle Georgia, learning, growing techniques, hearing from farmers and understanding the resources they needed. Many times, I was the only Democrat there. It's not that I can't go further in agriculture here under the gold dome. It's not that agriculture is ending for me. It's just that I'm poised for a higher plane. I will continue to push ag, but push ag in multiple ways. Ag is not just soil and produce. Ag can reduce crime, heal bodies from chronic diseases. Ag can change the quality of life and can combat literacy in our education. And ag can create generational wealth. The ag commissioner always says, agriculture is national security. And then I would always come back and say, there is no culture without agriculture. When I saw over 300 trees being removed from the parkway in my district, I was sat in and I saw the truck of logs leaving. I was because I knew that the great monetary value had just left my district. That was ag big poppy. Everything I did here was related to ag. I pushed heart disease prevention with the heart of the matter summit that I created with the Department of Public Health. As a freshman, chairman, Terry England, allotted me a state appropriation to bring the Georgia Young Farmers Association program to South Fulton. I put on a agricultural Christmas for kids which connected Christmas to agriculture on farms with Santa and livestock. I held numerous events such as World Vegan Day where I gave out black bean burgers and vegan cook guys. When I'm most proud of is the 30 plus pieces of legislation I sponsored. And the Ag will literacy camp were second, third and fourth graders learned literacy on a farm from multiple instructors for an entire weekend. I'm advancing to a different platform to continue the work that will yield me more resources and dollars to affect the areas that's greatly needed in Georgia. I do not want to bore you with all the details of what's next or in store for the political farmer. But at the end of this term, I will no longer be the state representative of House District 5, 65. District 65 is so special to the South Metro area, so special that two districts were created out of redistricting. First, House District 67 with the Honourable Lydia Glaze and a new District 64. But today we have four candidates that have stepped up to run for District 65. And in order of how they qualify, I want to recognize them. Deandre asks Pickett from South Fulton, male Keaton from South Fulton, Robert Dawson from South Fulton and Sam Wakefield from South Fulton that are here with us in a gallery. Colleagues, one of these young male would be the next representative of District 65 serving South Fulton Douglas and Caluita County. One of you will be the next state representative for District 65. And I decree and declare from this stance that this seat is blessed, that the bills will be passed for you and that budgetary appropriations will be made for you. I declare that the winner of this election shall be successful in this seat and will continue to fight for the plight of the district and the plight of the people. And the winner will also function in the full authority and exude the power of this seat to not only do the work of the people but do the work of the Lord. And it is so. Colleagues, this is a short but fast and furious run. And I knew this time was coming. I just didn't realize it was coming this fast. But it is here. And the only thing I can say is he's able. He's able. He's able. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, as I yield the well. We're going to talk about the next step. We're going to talk about the next step. We're going to talk about the next step. We know you had the right direction when you came here and your service has been exemplary and we appreciate you as a person, your faith, and your belief in agriculture, Mr. Chairman, changes people's lives. It changed. I was in it. Thank you for what you've done. We appreciate you and wish you the best. We have some awfully good members of the moving on. We appreciate their service. We're moving on to the rules calendar members moving on to the rules calendar. Mr. Clerk, were you ready to capture and just Senate bill 169 169. Senate bill 169. The Senate is paying to the 54th. It's in the 45th. The office of the 29th and others to be entitled back to amend Code Section 22754. The office goes to Georgia and it's a ruling of procedures to be followed by a disciplinary officer panel or tribute or tribunal in public schools. This bill I've referred to the committee on education. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Cox has recognized to present SB 169 and Representative Cox. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. SB 169 is amending the current law that exists in the public schools where hearing dates for students that are being disciplined, that we provide limits on it, that it will be no longer than 15 days. A parent can request an extension, but currently there is no time limit on these set extensions. It also requires schools to provide instructional materials to the students that are waiting for these disciplinary process to also end. I yield for questions. Gentlemen has no questions. I yield the well. The gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being or beg your pardon? We do have a speaker in favor. Representative Dindinia. Representative Chairman Wheedauer. Would you tell Representative Dindinia we have a bill that he requested to speak on. I thank I see him in the south any room. He weighs. He weighs. Okay, we'll move on then. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none of the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here is none of the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. It's so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 169 that yeas are 167. And may as one the bill had received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, we have a former member of the House. Former Representative Ken Poston is making for you. Welcome. Representative Ken Poston was just informing he had written a book after he's up in Ringo. He's written a book after he left this body, the zenith man. So we're going to give you a card you can take a look at it. You may be interested in reading former Representative Poston's book. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 376376? Senate bill 376 by Senator Tillery the 19th year Patrick of the 32nd burns of the 23rd and others to be entitled back to a men chapter 11 and title 15. You can just go to Georgia and attend it relating to juvenile code. So it's to clarify requirements of parents, defects and courts in order to improve timely permanent placement of a child removed from their home. Mr. Bill, I'm referred to the committee on juvenile justice. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Gillette is recognized to present the bill. Representative Gillette. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to present Senate bill 376.

And although this is not a defects department bill, then most assurably is a bill that impacts defects. In a child determination, in dependency case there are certain factors that judges have to read through and decide. And I believe the sponsor of this bill and the Senate believes there's, I can't even say the word, ambiguity, as to whether her parent is moving forward on a single factor, and if that's enough to say the case plan is moving forward. And by virtue of a case plan moving forward, a delay in the termination of parental rights and ultimately delay in allowing the future of adoption is occurring. This bill requires that courts determine whether a parent has made substantial progress towards the completion of their case plan at the 75-day review mark. It also requires that the court to issue findings on whether a parent has made substantial progress on each point of the case plan. It's our goal, and I'm sure your goal here, as members of this House, to help provide permanency to the roughly 10,000 children waiting for permanent homes here in defects. And that's exactly what this bill does. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions. You have no questions. Thank you. As for your favorable consideration. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that you're here has done the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted yes. So the clerk will unlock the machine. On the pass, just sent bill 376, the yeas are 166. And these are zero. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is there for passed? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 422-422? Senate bill 422 by senators. Dixon to the 45th. Gooch to the 50th for summers of the 13th and others. Being titled back to men title 46. The official go to Georgia and TETA relating to public utilities and public transportation. So is the amount of either percentage limitation as to the amount of the investments and electric membership corporation may make? This bill haven't referred to the committee on energy utilities and telecommunications. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Carson has recognized to present the bill. Chairman Carson. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a bill that we've seen a number of times because of various back and forth with the chamber across the way. This is Senate bill 422. We've made some changes to the substitute. You see a couple of letter of support on your desk from Georgia EMC as well as Georgia Association Manufacturers. All this bill does is allow EMCs to invest up to now 25% of their net utility plant figures into a gas subsidiary. It also includes some disclosure language, which is new to this chamber anyways. On lines 46 through 59, we're doing this as a gesture of goodwill to our friends in the Senate across the way to be about transparency and so forth. I did have a question in regard to why is this necessary? It's necessary because of growth. But also when you can factor in the amount or the definition of net utility plant that's invested into a gas subsidiary includes the guarantees on the natural gas in those lines. As you know, natural gas commodity prices have been going up very considerably the past few years. So what this does is allow EMCs that fall within this to be allowed to grow but also responsibly and under compliance with the statute. That's all it does, Mr. Speaker. Go up to 25%. And I'm happy to take a question. But if not, if there's no questions, I will yield the will. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ask for the body's favorable consideration. Here's an objection to the previous question being ordered. Chair here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair here's none of the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report to the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here's none of the board of committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed, we'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the past, if Senate Bill 422, the yeas are 154, the nays are 13. This bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption Senate Bill 401, 401? Senate Bill 401 by Senator Patrick, a 32nd pane of the 54th, Kennedy the 18th, and others to be entitled back to amend. Chapter 11 and title 15, the Fisher go to Georgia, and it ended relating to the juvenile code, so it's to implement the recommendations of the Senate, foster care and adoption study committee, this bill I'm referring to the committee on juvenile justice, that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair Lady Ballinger, are you ready? Chair Lady Ballinger will present the bill, Senate Bill 401. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate Bill 401 is a very simple bill. It comes out of the Senate study committee that they had over the interim between the past session and this most current session. They recognize the need for more data to better understand what exactly is going on in our juvenile court system. So this just basically allows for our juvenile courts to enter certain information into JDAX. It specifies what exactly, what specific information will be entered into the system, where that information will be sent, the report that will be generated and sent to the House, Chair of juvenile justice and the Senate, Children and Families Committee, supported by the juvenile court judges and the administrative office of the courts. Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to yield for any questions. Lady has no questions. Thank you, our urgent favorable consideration for Senate Bill 401, I yield the well. Ladies, yielded the well, represent the Hutchinson has recognized the speak to the bill, represent the Hutchinson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon or morning, colleagues. Today I'm gonna do what I love to do the most and talk about myself. I have a long career in this industry. It's going on 30 years. I don't think anyone knows all the counties I've worked in and there are too many to list, but some of them are, we go as far as Hart County. I've been, I've worked in Habersham, Green, Walton, Bibb and every county in between. Unfortunately, I did not go to much to South Georgia because I didn't get a mileage reimbursement. But what I learned in working in all of those counties, circuits, districts, even though we have the same law and we have the same policy, everyone interprets it differently. And one of the cases that I was involved with that this bill remind me of was a case, I won't name the county, but these were three teenage girls. They have been in foster care for at least six years. The judge had been entertaining the mom who was only moderately involved in her court plan. He indulged her for six years because she went to a meeting one time. She got an apartment that she lost in six months, six years. And every time we met, I had a working relationship with the judge and I was like, you know, I don't really don't think mom is gonna get this together. And what he said was, what a judge hates the most is having their verdict overturned. And he was gonna make sure that none of his verdicts were overturned and that's why he took five, six, seven, and eight years to make a decision. In this case, after the five or six years, this child lost her foster parent. The foster parent was going to be her adoptive parent, but she had a medical issue and she couldn't go forward with the adoption. So now we have three teenagers with no place to go. Rights have terminated to the parents, no place to go. That judge hurt that family more than they helped. There was another case that I remember. I did an assessment on this brand new baby, a newborn baby. And there was a woman who was there to adopt the baby. This woman, the mother was on baby number six. The mother's IQ was 58. And there was this one woman who kept adopting her kids. She was on baby number six. She had six of these women's kids. I said, well, how are the court hearings going? And they said, oh, we never went to court. We just have her sign the kids over. But she has an IQ of 58. She signed them, there's nothing we can do about it. That woman should have had an attorney present. She didn't have the money for an attorney, but she should have had an attorney. She's an IQ of 58. There is no way she could legitimately sign away six children. But that court, that court circuit allowed it. What this bill is going to do, hopefully, is identify the areas that we have a problem. There are some counties that were well known for promising foster parents that they were gonna adopt kids who were foster care. So it made the termination of parental rights super quick, too quick, in my opinion. People were losing parental rights in six months. We have this area that's not terminating parental rights in six years, and we have another area that's terminating parental rights in six months. So it bill like this to collect data to see where all these anomalies are coming from. After all these years, is certainly do, past due we needed this yesterday. So I just wanted to let you know how important, some of the bills we get, we think, this isn't really gonna make a huge difference in anybody's life. This one will. So I urge you to vote yes, and we can continue to make our baby steps to help children foster care. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker, I yield a well. The lady is yielding the well. She had a question, but we'll answer that one in the sweet bind by. I think it's a bit bad. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here's none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock for what purpose you're up saying, Bayes More Ross? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that I am very supportive of this bill because my parents had adopted eight children, and we live through exactly what this bill is going to correct? So I thank the author of the bill. Thank you for the question. You know firsthand and bless your parents. All members voted. If so, clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 401, 401, the A's are 107, Nays are zero. This bill, having received a requisite Constitution majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate Bill 398398? Senate Bill 398, Senator Capatric, or the 32nd Roberts, or the 29th Walker, the 20th and others to be entitled to enact two men, Article 5 of Chapter 4, Title 20. The official go to George Annotated relating the Georgia Joint Defense Commission. So it's revised the commission's operations. This bill I refer to the committee on defense and veteran affairs. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Josh Bonner has recognized to present the bill, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to present Senate Bill 398, relates to the Georgia Joint Defense Commission. The mission of the commission is to advise the governor and the general assembly on defense and military issues with the goal of supporting the long-term viability and development of the military, both active duty and civilian. The changes that are being made to the commission is that it moves the commission from under the TCSG to the Department of Economic Development. It also increases the membership of the commission from 19 to 23 members. It adds the chancellor of the university system of Georgia as a member. And then adds members appointed by the House and Senate for a total of five each. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to take any questions. Chairman, you do have a question to your right. Representative Chess Cannon has a question to your right. Representative Cannon. There's a gentleman yield. I do. Is it not true that Georgia is home to nine military institutions employing tens of thousands of citizens in responsible for over 21 billion in annual economic revenue? The gentleman knows of what he speaks. I appreciate the question and it underscores just how valuable our military installations are here in the state of Georgia and how we need to foster that relationship to make sure that in the event, there's another base to re-enliiment and closing commission that they will just pass Georgia on by. Thank you. Gentlemen, has there further questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Jim, as yielded the well, we do have a speaker in favor of Representative Gladney is recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Gladney. She comes from a military town too. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise before you today with the privilege to support the legislation of SB 398. That brings together the collaborative efforts of two of the most essential elements of our culture and society as we currently know it. That's military defense and economic vitality. As a third generation military veteran, my grandfather was a World War II air and Navy veteran and my father was a Vietnam era army veteran having served in the DMZ, it is absolutely no secret that I am extremely passionate about my advocacy for the military, for veterans and for those currently serving on active duty. Georgia is now ranked ninth in the nation for veterans population. The state of Georgia is proudly home to 13th federal Department of Defense installations and 54 Georgia Department of Defense National Guard and Reserve units with almost every branch of service represented. Currently, today, right now, while we are sitting in these illustrious seats in this illustrious chamber representing our communities, there is an active deployment force representing the Georgia National Guard, the reserves and active duty troops, abroad sacrificing life and limb in harm's way, serving away from their families, absent of their own peace of mind. They are there to fulfill their commitment to support and defend the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, pursuant to the orders and the officers that are appointed over them. As our state grows and continues to attract business and industries, what I find is that the military, what I find is that many industry management teams recruit workforce candidates from the military. That pipeline seems to be an attractive background for those individuals with technical expertise and experience. Through the efforts of the Georgia Joint Defense Commission and the Department of Economic Development, the intent of this bill is to extend their scope and to ensure that all of those challenges will be addressed with intentionality and are considered favorably. Even if the economic development was not largely an outcome in this culture, the development of human capital directly shapes military effectiveness of a society. Military installations have an impact on their surrounding cities, counties and regions. The support of them and their viability is crucial. They are all crucial economic drivers in this state. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity and I yield the well, sir. Thank you, Lady, representing for your view on the subject, a complete somewhat discussion. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is any objection to a degree into the report of the committee which was favorable to the passes of the bill that Chair, here's none. Report, the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passes of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. Have all members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 398. The yeas are 169. The nay is one. This bill, Henry, see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of Senate bill 426? 426. Senate bill 426 by Senator Tillery of the 19th, Sessler of the 37th, burns the 23rd, walker of the 20th and others to be entitled to amend Title 40, the fiscal to George Aniteta, relating to motor vehicles, traffic, so revised requirements for joining of a motor carrier and a motor carrier is insurer to a cause of action. This bill I'm referring to the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends the dis bill, do pass. Will Birchett is recognized to present the bill, representing Birchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Again, I come to the well to present to you another piece of tort reform. And I know that perks everybody up, everybody's smiling now and looking at me like this is fantastic. So I'll get to the bill. Senate bill 426, I'm asking for a favorable vote for you from you. It is the direct action piece that you have heard about for so many sessions since I've been here. I know one of my colleagues from South Georgia who's not paying attention to me right now and I won't call out. There he is. He has been harping on me for this bill since I've been here since 2019. And so the chairman of appropriations and the Senate has brought this bill, Senate bill 426 and what it does is it requires that in an action against a motor carrier or a driver, there is a good faith effort and reasonable effort to service both the driver and the motor carrier before ever being able to bring in the insurer. The direct action is an action suing not only the driver or the motor carrier or the insurer. So the piece that we're taking out here is the allowance for attorneys to sue and insurer without first providing for service on the motor carrier or the driver. And the argument is simply this folks, folks say that if we sue an insurance company, a jury is likely to award a much larger award when they see all state or farm bureau or one of these large insurance companies versus the motor carrier or the insurer, the actual insurer driver. That's the essence of the bill. Another piece of tort reform that we are putting before you. I ask for your favorable consideration. If you have any questions, I'll stand for questions, Mr. Speaker. You have a couple of questions. Representative Chairman Perkel to your right is a payback question, I guess. Chairman Perkel. Thank you so much. Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields. Thank you for finally listening to me after a good little bit of time on this bill. Is it not true that this actually is just a matter of fairness that the insurance company should not be a name defendant in a action when all they did was write a policy? I think the gentleman knows what he speaks and the gentleman also knows the gentleman in the well does not practice in this area, correct? This is correct. This is true. One final question, please. Does the gentleman yield for a final question? How do? Is it not true that this does not allow the insurance companies to skate by with no obligation, but it just keeps them from being a name defendant in a suit where there's only four states in the nation that allow what the state of Georgia has up until this time. Is that not true? The gentleman knows what he speaks. Thank you. Representative Rees to your left, how's the question? I'll win the back. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Gentlemen yields, thank you, sir, for this bill. And I do note that this bill was a, came about because of a great conversation between the Georgia Trial Law Dissociation, the insurance companies as well as the Chamber. So we had three entities working on this bill to make it a great bill. But can you elaborate a little bit if you will on how it will operate so that the people in the Chamber will be aware you say not to insurance companies immediately, so from a time perspective, considering a two-year statute of limitation for negligence claims, exactly when and at what time can the insurance company be brought into this claim if the defendant cannot be found. So thank you for the question. If you look to the bill, it's recited on both lines 37 through 40 and on lines 14 through 18, excuse me, 20. Essentially there need be a reasonable diligence to service against the driver or the motor carrier. And if they cannot find and perfect service on the driver or the motor carrier, then and only then can they perfect service on the insurance company. And at that point, the insurance company has 30 days to respond. What you spoke about was the time is told essentially, if the term has run, then the secondary service on the insurer relates back to the original service on the other complaint, excuse me. So it does relate back in the event that the time has elapsed for you to bring the action. Does the gentleman further you? Oh, yes. I think it's my mic, not you. Go ahead. Isn't it true that as a licensed attorney in Georgia who has been required to help families doing time in their needs, especially those that have been in accidents with big trucks and have a very hard time finding it that they're defended, isn't it true that this is a great compromise that lawyers like myself is happy with and that we can work with and feel that it still gives everyday Georgians a right to pursue someone who may hurt them in the event that there's a very serious accident or God forbid someone lose their life. That is true. And thank you for bringing that out. But you know, what the interest that we always have to weigh out here when we talk about total reform folks is the interest of essentially the business and the aggrieved. So when you and I represent 60,000 Georgians here, some of those are businesses and some of those are just citizen Georgians that don't own businesses. So what we have to do here folks is do a balancing act. So when can a Georgian sue a business and we don't want to put too much weight on the Georgian side or the business Georgian side. So it's a balancing act and that's what we do here every day and to the gentleman's point, this is a compromise between the Georgia trial lawyers, the Chamber and the insurance companies. So thank you for bringing the question. With that Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. You'd have a couple of questions, but if you changed the yield the well, that would, we have a couple of speakers. We have speakers? Well, I'm gonna yield the well, then. So while you're the whip, you're a smart man. Kevin Billy Mitchell, recognize, speak to the bill of gentlemen, you do the well. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, I stand before you today to express my strong support for SB426, a crucial piece of legislation that aims to provide essential requirements for joining a motor carriers ensure to a cause of action. This bill is a significant step towards ensuring accountability and justice and cases involving motor carriers and they're insures. First and foremost, it is important to recognize the critical role that motor carriers play in our economy and daily lives. These companies are responsible for transporting goods and people across our state and nation and their operations are essential for our way of life. However, with this great responsibility comes the need for accountability when accidents or incidents occur. SB426 addresses this need by establishing clear requirements for joining a motor carriers insurer to a cause of action. By ensuring that insurers are held accountable and are actively involved in legal proceedings related to accidents involving their policy holders, this bill promotes transparency and fairness in the legal process. Furthermore, by requiring insurers to be joined to a cause of action, SB426 helps to streamline the legal proceedings and facilitate efficient resolution of cases involving motor carriers. This not only benefits all parties involved in the legal process, but also promotes timely and just outcomes for those affected by accidents and incidents. In addition, the legislation serves as a deterrent to irresponsible behavior by motor carriers and their drivers, knowing that their insurers will be actively involved in legal proceedings and held accountable for their actions can encourage greater adherence to safety regulations and best practices ultimately leading to a safer transportation system for all. As was stated by Representative Reese, we have the Chamber of Commerce as well as the trial lawyers in the group.

with this legislation which in my view is an accomplishment in and of itself. Georgia SB 426 is a crucial piece of legislation that promotes accountability, transparency and efficiency in cases involving motor carriers and their insurers. By establishing clear requirements for joining insurers to a cause of action, this bill helps to ensure that justice is served, that all parties are held accountable for their actions. I urge your support for this important legislation for the benefit of our state and our constituents. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. General, I yield the well. Rep. Stacey Evans is recognized to speak to the bill. Y'all give the ladies some room there. Rep. Steeve Evans, recognize the speak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I rise in support of Senate Bill 426. I just wanted to talk briefly to you about the goodness that we are showing here today by passing this bill. And I speak to you as a couple of things today. The daughter of a truck driver who congratulations dad came off the road last year and retired after about 20 years on the road. Very happy to have him back so he can see the grandkids more. Fun piece of trivia. More men are employed as truck drivers than any other single profession. For women, it happens to be cashier. And both my dad and my mom are in the most populous careers for their genders. But if it comes up in trivia, you can thank me for your ability to get those questions, right? But I'm also a trial lawyer. I don't practice in this area. I've never handled any car-wreck cases that I can think of, and certainly not any involving trucks. But all of these factions, all of these interests came together to bring you Senate Bill 426. And the representative who brought the bill came up and spoke. But I'm guessing there were a lot more blood, sweat, and tears that went into that process than he shared here today. Because bills like this are hard to get to. But they are so worth it. And it's really a lesson to us. It's a lesson to us in here. It's a lesson to those in the hall. And it's really the big reason I wanted to come up here today is when people sit down and talk honestly and put their cards on the table and don't make assumptions about the motives from one side or the other and really talk honestly. This is what I want. This is what I need. This is what I can't live with. And this is why to allow the other side to have a dialogue face to face as opposed to running out and getting the other person. And it almost becomes a game of telephone. And when we all know what happens when you get a game of telephone, things get distorted. The wrong information gets shared. And so this bill makes me think how many other great bills could we come in here with? If we sat down face to face, we didn't hide behind our phones. We didn't hide behind surrogates or other people speaking on our half. But we just sat down and had an old fashioned conversation. I think we would have a lot more good bills like Senate Bill 426. So I just wanted to come up here. Number one to speak in favor of a bill, which I don't think I've done so far this year. But also just to recognize what a good moment this is and urge everyone to vote yes on Senate Bill 426. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Ladies, you're the well. We have no further speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair has done? Report of the committee is agreed to shall. This bill now pass all in favor of passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted what purpose is Chairman Corp. to rise? Parliamentary inquiry, please. State you inquiry. Is it not true that all Georgians pay the price of lottery judgments? I think so. I'm sure the gentleman believes what he's sounding good to me. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 426, the yeas are 172. The yeas are zero. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is there for a past? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption Senate Bill 440. 440. Senate Bill 440 by Senator Brass, the 28th parent of the 42nd, Dixon the 45th. We've brought with the 55th and others the title of the act to amend Article 6 of chapter 2, the title 20 of the Fiscal Court of Georgia and attendee relating to the Quality Basic Education Act. So it's to provide for the accelerated career diploma program. This bill emphrates committee on Education Act committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Dubniks recognize to present the bill. Chairman Dubnik. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Chairman Brass and I co-chaired a study committee on dual enrollment last summer. And I will summarize this is not a simple bill. This is just a simplification bill. Y'all what we learned, if you really want to come look at what dual enrollment looks like, it is way too complex. And I said at the end of that study committee that if I had to explain part of this process to my own children at home, probably would not be too successful with that. So here's what we're doing to simplify four things. And I want to thank representatives Townsend, Ballard and Stacey Evans for serving on this study committee. And there was a 36 page report that we produced, but we have narrowed that down to do four things. We're going to simplify the high school diploma path known as an accelerated career. Somebody asked this morning, what does that mean? What is an accelerated career? Very simply, if you want to go through the technical college system of Georgia and get a very specific credential that is going to put you to work very quickly, we're simply helping you get there faster and easier. The path is strictly for those students who are traditional academic diploma students, but who appreciate the importance of a technical education, the value of that degree, and who are ready to go to work. Number two, we're going to simplify the funding available for this path. We're state government, and here we are realizing that we're spending more money through dual enrollment than we need to be on this program. And so on average, we're going to be able to cut the cost of someone wanting to go to work by third. Very proud of that. We will create one definition of high demand career path. You may have heard that statement in the past, and some of the programs that we fund, there's multiple lists. How do you get on a list? How do you get off the list? Which one takes priority? We're simply empowering the State Workforce Development Board to create that one high demand career path list. And finally, we're making sure that we look at dual enrollment funding so that we get a return on the investment every year. The Georgia Student Finance Commission will look at everything that's going on with these students, how we're being fiscally responsible, and we'll come back to us as a legislature with a report on how much money we're actually saving, and thus being able to put for other uses. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill. I'll be happy to stand for any questions. You have a couple of questions. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that Governor Kim has emphasized workforce development, and this bill will allow students to earn the credit angels that employers are looking for faster than ever? Absolutely. Thank you for the bill. Yes, ma'am. Chair Lady Lynn Smith, right on the aisle in front of you has a question. Thank you. Chair Lee Smith. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry that it was the central education system in New New and Georgia. That was the birthplace of this concept back in the late 90s. A lady certainly knows of which she speaks, and that was quite the impressive day I got to spend in in Cali to County. And is it further not true that I appreciate the effort of this body through the years to keep perfecting this process so that more and more of our students have wonderful options for their education and careers? Absolutely. Thank you for this work. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Gentlemen, those little about education, if you're yield to the chairman of the education committee, chairman Irwin to your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman, is it not true that doing enrollment students have higher secondary and post-secondary graduation rates? I believe that would be true. Yes, sir. Does he yield for one more question? Yes, sir. And those students that are enrolled in dual enrollment, when they finish their training in school, they earn higher wages after they graduate. I believe that would be the case as well. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Gentlemen, further yield for one more, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to recognize Representative Talonset for a question to your right. Is chairman to yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that this legislation is part of a joint study committee on dual enrollment and for high-town young ages, which had bipartisan support? Yes, sir. That is the case. Mr. Speaker, with that, I will yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration on Senate Bill 440. It's good to see you in the will there, Mr. Chairman. Thought it was not to prize you out there with a crowbar for a second. Thanks for your presentation. Reptile Glazes, recognize to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of SB 440. As many of you know, I actually finished my career in education as college and career director. And this bill does what we could not do for many of our students. And that is to accelerate them in high school to give them opportunities in a pathway to build out skillsets that would take them into the marketplace and give them an earning potential way beyond what they normally would. And so when I look at this bill and see the opportunities, what I really see is our young people having not just a bridge, but actually a highway to get to their career to build their skill sets and to begin to build Georgia in their neighborhoods and communities as they seek to have a good opportunity. And they seek to have the career with the type of skill sets from our TCSG programs that are needed in our marketplace. We want to continue to build out this economy, but we cannot do it without giving opportunities and access to our young people who are ready to build out their skill sets. Thank you so much Matt Brass and Senators from the other side who brought us this great bill. It is bipartisan and it is an opportunity for our young people to get quicker to the marketplace with the skill sets that are needed. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Ladies, you do the well. Great insight to a great bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here has done the previous question is ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? Chair here has done the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here has done? The report of the committee has agreed to. Chair here has agreed to. This bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted for what purpose is represented by the rise? Ms. Speaker, is it not true that Georgia's accelerated career dual enrollment program is the envy of other states and one of the reasons that we are the number one state to do business? I know the lady speaks truth as she knows of what she speaks for what purpose is represented. Mr. Chair, is it not true that many of the clients in my homeless outreach program attend to attend to that technical college and they see themselves elevating out of poverty into independence? I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks is a great program. The great results have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 440. The yeas are 168. The nays are zero. This bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption Senate bill 456456? Senate bill 456 by senator Strickland, the 17th year Patrick. The 32nd wants to first albors the 56th and others to be entitled back to men article 14, age, chapter 7 to title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to the central caregiver registry. So it's not disabled persons to the registry. This bill emphirds committee on public health that committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair lady sharing Cooper is recognized to present the bill. Chair lady. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you Senate bill 456. Years ago, those of you who were here will remember we went through a special process where we allowed certain people to apply to have a federal background check if they were going to be caretakers. If they were hiring a caretaker to take care of an elderly family member. The feds are very, very careful with the who can apply to them. There is a charge of about $56 for somebody to make that inquiry. And the inquiry goes back to the person that's considering hiring individual. And in a strict yes or no to the hiring. It does not give any explanation as to why it would be a yes or no. It would just says they're good to go. You can hire them. They should be good or no, you cannot. So this just adds a disabled person which they explain that a disabled person means an adult or child who is mentally or physically incapacitated or has Alzheimer's disease or dementia. That's what the bill does. It adds people, family members who want to take care of their loved ones by hiring somebody to keep them in their home. And to work with them, they can do the background checks. And with that Mr. Speaker, if there's no questions, I will yield the well. The lady is yielded the well. There's no questions. Representative Holly. Representative Holly is recognized to speak in favor to the bill. Representative Holly. So today I rise in careful support of Senate Bill 456 on your screens. I'd like to introduce you to my big sister, Sorda Kahali. She is the one who encouraged me to step out of the shadows, a champion of life who whispered a suggestion to me to get deeper involved in politics. In 2017 when she departed this earth to join the Lord, it enabled me to be able to see that Georgia stands in the position to be able to provide for the least of these. Just a well-sorted modicum of care that is not right for my sister or anyone who is not physically able to have to seek out care while they themselves are undergoing serious treatment. She passed of rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension and stills disease. And while my family, my mother, my sisters, my father and I had to take turns as we had to watch over her, be able to provide her meals. At times, be able to help her as she completed applications for experimental medicines when there was no opportunities for her to see the physicians that she needed. And in the end, fortunately, God allowed for my mother to be by her bedside in Harlem and a hospital where she gave up her ghost. And for that, I wish for you to be able to join me in support of Senate Bill 456. You can please have your seat. Standing up for family is something that I think we might all do at times we are not always privy as to when that moment may be. Senate Bill 456 recognizes the strength of structured family caregivers or FsFCs and the need to maintain a registry of the professionals who keep watch over the health and healing of our loved ones. With the necessary addition of physically and mentally disabled, currently Georgia provides a home and community-based services waiver to pay for the provision of such services. With the needed updates and our state's medical services to sustain the most vulnerable among us, bills like Senate Bill 456 enables caregivers to make caring for the disabled and our incapacitated loved ones, they are primary focused. FsFCs enable that support structures include the provision of even backup caregivers to handle other tasks while loved ones can still receive care. Additionally, I thank my good friend who may be watching John Kirkpatrick, whose care of two severely disabled persons has enabled me to see the necessity in having the FsFCs to have the funding and the support necessary. One of the most troubling decisions a family must make is to decide whether to care for their disabled or physically ill family members under limited means or to eventually do as my family had decided and to send that loved one to another state where care may have been better funded but through which the person may have to solely only care for themselves. No person should have to make that decision. I would much rather for family members to be alive and that means it's tough when you have to say goodbye to them if the care should be provided elsewhere. But you all today, even though I know that sometimes we do disagree on the issues about that funding and where it should be placed, we can recognize the strength of structured family caregivers allowing for that support to remain in our households to allow for the recipients of these Medicaid waivers to enable there to at least be some level of care. Of resolve when family members must make this hard decision. So I ask you to join me in support of Senate Bill 456 as it will extend the oversight of caretakers and it will ensure that patients cannot only receive care but that we as a state can move to becoming one more responsible and provisional and the services granted to those who cannot fend for themselves. Thank you my colleagues and thank you for your support for my good sister. So I still love you. Take care. Thank you, Representative. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that chair has none? The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machine on the past just Senate bill 456 the yeas 168 the nasa zero this bill hadn't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 480 for eight zero Senate bill 480 by Senator Hodges the third compatriot of the 32nd Watson the first. How stateless the 50 second and others to be entitled to amend chapter 10 to title 49 of the fish go to Georgia annotated relating the Georgia board of health care workforce. So to provide for student loan repayment for mental health and substance use professionals serving in certain capacities. This bill I refer to the committee on public health that committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair Lady Cooper is recognized to present Senate bill 480 480. Thank you Mr. thank you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen the House before I start on Senate bill 480 I do want to say to Representative Holly thank you for those words elder abuse is rampant across our country for every reporting case of elder abuse. There are estimates now by the federal government that say that 24 cases go unreported so anything that we can do to ensure that our elderly are well taken care of by eligible people that don't have any kind of a bad record is for the good now to Senate bill 480. As you know we have put in pass the bill making mental health and put it on parity with any other kind of health issue. One of the problems that we're having in our state and getting more care to people that have mental health issues is that we just flat don't have the people to take care of them we don't have enough psychiatrists we don't have enough psychologist we don't have a nurse psychiatric nurse practitioners are social workers so what this bill does it's a loan repayment plan. And it is very specific to people that are remain in Georgia while they are getting loan repayment and that they work in their area and basically it is you know it goes with amount of funds that we have and the board will put the rules into place and they will get priority to the different areas of our state and they will look at whether this group needs psychiatrists or this group needs psychologists or this group needs psychiatric nurse practitioners and try to match that as our needs across our state come forward so with that Mr. Speaker I will yield a well and I would ask for your favor bill on Senate bill 480. If you have no question she's yielded the well. Represent Ramon is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker colleagues today I rise in support of Senate bill 480. One of the things that we always spoke about during my time as a management consultant is retention and recruitment. And a lot of times an organization simply cannot afford to increase pay even if they want to programs like this allow them to provide a benefit that is as close to payment as possible particularly for professionals who have to get degrees that they cannot afford based on the rate that we can pay them for the services that they are providing today in particular this bill is so important not just because of typical student you know loan related issues but I want you to look at this graph up on the screen as you can see fentanyl and synthetic opioid deaths and overdoses have skyrocketed Georgia is one of the states that has seen a 30% increase compared to the year prior and it's only getting worse some of these figures are from 2020. We can't allow these epidemics to go on answered and bills like this give us an important tool to begin addressing these crises if you notice some of the other substance related deaths have either flattened out or have gone down. But when it comes to fentanyl it is still increasing and part of that is we need a different type and a more specific professional to be able to address that specific addiction and that specific drug. Lastly when it comes to programs like this when we were talking about retention it's one thing to be able to hire somebody for a year or two but to be able to keep them around for five years is incredibly important for patients. It allows that provider to make sure that they continue to stay on course with their treatment and obviously this is not just for substance abuse but also for mental health continuity in care is crucial for success and bills like this will enable us to recruit more people to retain more people and make sure they have the skills that we need to help as many people in Georgia as possible. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield the one. Ladies yielded well. Represent Kennard recognize speak to the bill. Represent Kennard. Thank you Mr. Speaker I rise in support of this legislation today. Georgia you are very aware that we have some workforce challenges and you can also that's more acute in the medical profession and you can compound that even further in our mental health spaces. Our program partners with viewpoint health which is our local CSB and I'm always hearing from them about their deficit with social workers, counselors, psychiatrists especially clinicians. So I really appreciate this measure as we can kind of fill in the gaps with our mental health workforce in Georgia. Thank you for your support of it. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is any objections to the previous question being ordered the chair here is done.

The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair has done? The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no in the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purposes, Chair Lady Dimpsy rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry? Is it not true that it is a wonderful thing to hear so many members in support of this genuine challenge in our state and addressing an exact way that we can bring good services to more people? I thank us a good thing and when this house works together we can accomplish anything. Thank you, Chair Lady. For what purpose does the committee, the committee, the committee, and the committee? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry? State you inquiry? Isn't it true that this bill is a positive bill as our other colleagues have referenced and will help us in recruiting mental health professionals, especially to help our children? In our schools and isn't it also true that during the 2018-2019 school year it's been reported that nearly 80,000 Georgia students in six through 12th grade reported having seriously considered attempting suicide. And that in Georgia 2 and 5 children had trouble accessing the mental health treatment they need. And programs like this will help us give the continuum of care we need for all of our children. I thank the lady who knows of what she speaks and thank you for those facts. For what purpose does the chair lady still cox rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry? Mr. Speaker, is it not true that substance abuse is off in the result of untreated mental health issues? The treating those issues can often reduce the number of people who turn to drugs and alcohol? The lady knows of what she speaks and I appreciate the question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, we're going to close this out but I'll say to you, we all know that mental health substance abuse superiority for this house, we're glad to send us joining in to move this issue forward. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the past, if Senate Bill 480, the A's are 167, the Nasr 2, this bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption, Senate Bill 454, 454? Senate Bill 454 by Senator the Strictly in the 17th and Jones of the 10th. To be entitled, and act to amend, Chapter 6 to title 19, the Fisher go to George Anitetti, really now, the Alimony and Child Support, so it's been provided for guidelines for Child Support Award calculations. Ms. Bill Edmond, for the Committee on Juvenile Justice, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee Substitute. Representative Houston Gaines has recognized to present the bill, Representative Gaines. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Bring before you Senate Bill 454 by Senator Bryan Strickland, Senator Emanuel Jones. This legislation comes on behalf of the Child Support Commission, Commission that Leader Abstration myself or Honour to Serve on, includes a lot of expert judges and family lawyers from our state. The Commission has come up with some recommended changes based on economic study that's required every four years by federal law, the first update and necessary update in 20 years to some of the Child Support laws that we have on our state. And again, all of everything in this legislation is always subject to a judges ruling when considering these cases. But this bill will keep us in compliance with federal law and give us some much updated overdue updates to our Child Support laws. I'm happy to answer a couple of questions if there are any, Ms. Speaker. You have no questions. Thank you, Ms. Speaker. I yield the well. General Gielder the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agree into the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to shout this bill. Now pass all in favor of pass to the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. I have all members voted. So the clerk will lock the machine. On the past of Senate Bill 454, the yeas are 166. The nay is won. This bill, having to see the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 508? Senate Bill 508 by Senator Dixon. The 45th Albers, the 56th Strictland, the 17th Hillary, the 19th and others to be entitled back to amend. Title 15 in the official go to Georgia annotated relating to courts. So it's required for duties of the administrative office of the courts relative to accessibility of certain personal information of state and federal judges, justices and spouses thereof. This bill I've referred to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Matrives has recognized to present the bill. Representative Reeves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm proud to present Senate Bill 508, a judicial security bill earlier. There was mention that there's nothing that a judge hates worse than getting reversed. There actually is something that a judge hates worse than getting reversed and that's getting violently attacked or killed. Just in the last two years, judges in Wisconsin and Maryland were murdered by disgruntled against. In Nevada, someone hired a hitman to go after a judge, and then many of you have seen the video of someone jumping across the bench in Nevada to attack a judge and knock down the flag of our country and the course of attacking that judge. And in Georgia, that kind of behavior can't be tolerated and what this bill does, it was brought from the administrative office of the courts, the judicial council. This bill protects the private residents and contact information of judges so that people cannot intimidate them or threaten them with harm. This will keep our judges safe and support the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, I request a favorable consideration if there are no questions. I yield the well. The gentleman has a question to write in the back representing Jordan Ridley has a question. In the back, to your right, Jordan Ridley, not Riddle Ridley. All right. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do, to the Ridley with a beard, not the hat. Is it not true that more than 30 states have passed or are considering similar laws that limit public records of addresses, telephone numbers, and other identifying personal information of judges? The gentleman knows what he speaks for top five state and so we need to get this enacted to protect the rule of law on our judges. Jeremy, your representative Terry Cummins has a question to your left. Does the gentleman yield? Representative to my colleague from CAHNIA do. I really like this bill but I'm wondering why it does not include the staff and the judges' office. I used to work in the judges' office years ago and as we know from an incident that happened here in our state and what's going on, sometimes the clerks, the secretaries, and other people that are on staff, they are also subjected to personal attacks and threatening layers at home and everything else. That's a great idea from a fellow lawyer, legislature. I'm glad to work with you on that in the future. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, is yielded the well, a chairman Mitchell, who recognize, speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. SB 508, vital piece of legislation that focuses on the accessibility of certain personal information of state and federal judges. This bill aims to ensure the safety and security of our esteemed judges while upholding the principles of transparency and accountability in our justice system. Judges, of course, play a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and administering justice fairly and impartially. However, they often face threats and risks to their safety due to the nature of their work. Providing judges with the option to limit the public access to certain personal information such as home addresses and contact details as essential to safeguarding their privacy and security. By enacting SB 508, we are not only protecting well the well-being of our judges, but also promoting the independence and effectiveness of our judiciary. Judges must be able to focus on their duties without fear of harassment, intimidation, or harm. This bill empowers them to make, to take the necessary precautions to shield themselves and their families from potential threats. Furthermore, by granting judges this ability to control the dissemination of their personal information, we are bolstering public trust in the judiciary. The measure demonstrates our commitment to respecting the privacy rights of those who serve on the bench while maintaining the transparency and accountability that are fundamental to a functioning democracy. The only floor in this bill, as I see it, is that we should add state legislatures to this bill. And as much as this notion of swatting occurs, it would seem to be only right that we add legislators to that, but I understand that there may be a future bill coming that we may be able to entertain that. So, in closing, I urge all of you to support this important piece of legislation for the benefit of our judges and the communities they serve, and with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. General, I yielded the well. We have no further speakers. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered.

Go through some of the provisions of the bill. Section 2 codifies a few things that are already being done in practice regarding transparency and what is available to the members on revenues and expenditures. Section 3 adds two audits and gives deference to those with sunsets, and in reference to those annual audits, it also includes some requested cleanup and standardization language, including some input for consideration from certain stakeholders. Section 4 establishes an official review of these audits by Senate Finance and the Ways and Means Committee. If I may, Mr. Speaker, I just hadn't had the opportunity to thank the members of the House on that tax panel this year, but representatives Buckner, Carpenter, Hatchet Martin and Williamson were really very much appreciated during that process. There are any questions I'll try to answer them. You have a couple of questions to your left. Chairman Parsons has a question. Thank you, Speaker. Gentlemen, you? Yes, sir.

Isn't it true, Mr. Chairman, that this legislation enabled us to better analyze the effect of this of various tax credits, and that's the key component of future tax reform efforts as we move forward? I believe you said it correctly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask for this body's favorable consideration, and yield the will. That's good. The gentleman's yielded the will. We had a speaker, but he's waived that completes our discussion. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered.

We've come before you today to honor a former member of this House, Mr. John Otis Mobley. He passed away this past Friday at the age of 90. He was a lifetime resident of Winder and a 1951 graduate of Winder Bear High School. Where he served as a class president, senior class president. Mr. Mobley earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia and his master's in education from Pepperdine University. Mr. Mobley had a servant's heart and spent his lifetime serving as Lord in this country. He retired from the U.S. Air Force after 20 years of service, earning the rank of Lieutenant Colonel while working in counterintelligence for the office of special investigations. After his service to his country, Mr. Mobley retired to his hometown and served on the Winder City Council and later as mayor. He then served as Bearer County State Representative from 1987 to 1996. He was a faithful member of Corinth, United Methodist Church. He was also a Gideon, a chaplain of the American Legion and a member of the Coana's Club as well as serving as board member on the Winder Hospital and the Friends of Fort Yardrow State Park. The representative knew it also like say a few words. John is survived by his loving wife of 70 years. Surely Fleamon Mobley of Winder, his children Danny, Cheryl, Karen and Mike, his mini-grandchildren and his great-grandchildren. I'd like to ask for special prayer for Karen, Peyton, Mynees, Rylann and Regan. I love you guys. Members, please join me in a moment of silence and memory of a great statesman, John Mobley.

Another remembrance. Thank you all. This is the third time I've had to get up here this session about a member of our community that has passed away. Unfortunately, I lost the mayor of our hometown, Mayor Robert Price. He has represented our community with honor for years. And when I tell you he was proud of where he came from, I mean that. He would show people the old schoolhouse where he carved his name into the desk and he knew nothing but like a scrub. And so to lose him suddenly this past weekend is devastating to our community. And I just ask that you will please join me in praying for his family and our hometown. Thank you. Thank you. Prayer for his family as well and that community. Representative Moore. Representative Angela Moore, you recognize for an afternoon order. Hello colleagues and everyone. I just wanted to say that since 2021 this month, this week, I stood right here and took my first oath of office. It is my legislative anniversary. Some of us have gotten along, some of us haven't, but it has been the honor of my life. So happy anniversary to me and district 91 for the state of Georgia. Representative Park Cannon has recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Cannon. And friends. Mark. Who do you need, Representative Cannon? Yeah, the whip. Oh, the whip. Thank you. Come on, Mr. Will. So today we stand here very excited celebrating the first ever Bired Rustin Day at the Georgia State Capitol. Bired Rustin, many of you may have heard of someone named Martin Luther King Jr. who put on a huge event, the March on Washington, but the actual organizer, the boots on the ground was Bired Rustin. And many of the reasons why Bired was not put forward in the movement was because he was openly gay. And so as much as many members of the civil rights community were excited about the March on Washington, there was also still that political divide in the civil rights movement about LGBTQ leaders. So yesterday was his birthday. And at the Center for Civil and Human Rights, we all stood and sang Happy Birthday to him post-humously. We also were joined by his husband, Walter Nagel, who is still living and who is here present in Georgia. And so today we have some members from the organizations that support Bired Rustin Day in the gallery, if you'll stand. And we will be presenting this resolution for the annual event that they do, which is called the Rustin Lord Breakfast. It takes place the morning of the MLK parade. So every year when the MLK parade starts, the LGBTQ leaders meet in the morning and have breakfast at the Louder Milk Center or other nearby places. So today we're just excited to celebrate in the national commemoration of Bired Rustin's life, as well as she reminds all legislators that there is an active campaign to get him a forever stamp. Just like we have been working to get John Lewis a forever stamp, there's also the Bired Rustin campaign. And so we ask that you join it and we thank you all for being here today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for being here. Welcome to the people's house. We represent you Hutchinson. Give the lady in the world your attention please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, colleagues.

Eric is one of the hundreds of children who are available for adoption in Georgia. Let's spread the word that Eric needs in a forever home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will.
