TRANSCRIPT
----------
Election issues are always top of mind
during legislative sessions and we see
lots of bills introduced. They're among
the most controversial pieces of
legislation. We had hoped to have a
discussion today from both sides of the
aisle. We reached out to several
Republicans who were unable to make it.
We will have them on an upcoming show to
talk about the topic. Joining me now is
Democratic Representative Cyra Draper of
Atlanta who is minority caucus chief
deputy whip. Her House committees
include budget and fiscal affairs,
oversight, judicial and judiciary, I
should say, and juvenile. Welcome to
lawmakers for the 2026 session. It's the
first time having to be here.
>> Thank you for being here. You recently
wrote in a newsletter about what you
call the most important election issue
that no one is talking about. You were
referring to SB89 that passed in 2024
that requires the state to phase out the
use of QR codes by July 1st of this
year. It passed along party lines. You
voted against it. Tell us more about it.
>> Well, I voted against the bill as a
whole. That was one portion of the bill,
a very small portion of the bill, but it
was a portion of the bill that required
>> time to address because our current
voting system uses QR codes. If you ever
go vote in person, uh you vote on a
touchcreen, you make your selections and
then a ballot gets printed out and there
is a QR code on that ballot that has
your selections. Um but there are folks
in Georgia that had concerns about that.
They said, "I can't read the QR code. I
don't actually know what's embedded in
that QR code. So, how do I know that
what I who I wanted to vote for is
actually reflected in that QR code." And
so, the legislature listened to that and
they said, "Okay, we'll get rid of the
QR code, but that's only the first step.
We have to figure out the how as well.
>> Okay. So, you were the only Democrat on
a blue ribbon study committee over the
last few months on election procedures.
It was released, the report was released
yesterday, and I want to point out that
we invited the chair of the committee,
Republican Representative Tim Fleming,
to come on the show, but he was unable
to make it. He has agreed to come on in
the future, but among the
recommendations is to extend the
committee to the end of December of this
year. So, tell us about that and why.
Well, I think there's a lot of issues
that we have to grapple with when it
comes to elections. Uh the system that
we are currently using is coming to a
contractual end. We can either choose to
renew it or we can move into a different
direction. I know there's a lot of folks
that want us to move into a different
direction. And let me just say being on
the blue ribbon committee, uh we went to
several pl we we we traveled all over
Georgia this year uh because we wanted
to go to the people and we wanted the
people to tell us, you know, what do you
want out of your elections? It was such
a privilege uh to get that feedback uh
and and we are taking that feedback and
it's part of our recommendations. But I
think the thing about election issues is
there's you have to hear from all the
stakeholders. You have to hear from the
voters. You have to hear from the
counties who actually administer the
elections. Um and you have to take all
that information and then you have to
execute. You have to execute a system
that works for as many people as
possible. So it's a long-term process.
It's more than what we can do in a
40-day legislative session. So, I'm so
pleased that we're extending the
committee to do that work and to do it
well. That's what's so important.
>> December 31st. So, we'll hear more about
that. Now, another recommendation from
the committee is to adopt legislation to
quote, "provide voters with the option
to utilize preprinted handmarked paper
ballots on election day, beginning with
the 2026 general election. the
legislation should require all ballots
that contain a QR code of any kind to be
handcounted for the purposes of official
tabulation. What are your thoughts on
this?
>> So that is the recommendation that the
committee made to address the QR issue
uh QR code issue that you open the
segment with. This would be a solution
to the QR code issue that we are trying
to resolve this session before July. Um
I will say uh in in the report I was
opposed to recommendation number two.
Uh, I just don't think there's enough
time before the November 2026 election
to make such a major change in how we
run elections. And I think it's a tricky
issue. I think we as a committee are
still kind of trying to figure out what
is the best approach to the QR code
issue, whether it's what's in the report
or maybe we make a different kind of
shift in a different direction. I think
as a committee, we are still trying to
figure that out. So, more to come on
that one.
>> And can you tell us whether we will see
QR codes in in November? Well, look, I
mean, the law is the law says we have to
phase them out by July 2026. So, unless
we resend that law, that is an option.
We could resend that law. We could delay
that law or we can come up with another
solution. My hope is that whatever
solution we come up with is a
responsible solution that doesn't throw
the 2026 elections into disarray.
>> Okay. Do you think the handmark paper
ballot system is the best route? Um,
look, I actually am pretty agnostic as
to what kind of system we use, whether
it's with the machines that we have now
or handmarked paper ballots. There's
pros and cons to both methods, as there
are to many things. Um, what's again,
what's most important to me is that
whatever system we use has great
processes and works for Georgia voters.
>> Okay. What concerns what concerns do you
have about the upcoming elections for
statewide seats and the midterms in over
overall? Well, um this is an opportunity
to pivot to what happened in Fulton
County last week. Uh because what
happened in Fulton County, I I I think
one of the worst things we can do is
minimize uh the threat that it poses. Uh
the state has the election
administration function. Uh Georgians
have been and folks in the legislature,
I've been in the legislature where folks
on both sides of the aisle have been
saying we don't want outside
interference with our election. This is
a attempt to involve the federal
government in what should be a state
function. And I don't care who what you
are, Democrat, Republican, independent.
We should not want the federal
government inserting themselves into our
election. That is exactly what is
happening. And uh the threat is being
made uh by President Trump that you know
he wants to nationalize our elections uh
and that makes our elections less
secure, less safe and it's something
that we should all be pushing back
against.
>> When you first I noticed that you went
down there. I saw you in some video.
Yeah. So, you were there when it was all
taking place with this the FBI raid.
What were your thoughts about what was
happening at the time?
>> Many different thoughts. It's incredibly
undemocratic what happened, but I think
my my the the main thought was this
isn't about 2020. So, the the warrant
that was executed on uh said they wanted
all the materials about the 2020
election from Fulton County, but anybody
who follows the evidence, anybody who
follows the facts knows that the Georgia
election in 2020 was the most
scrutinized election of all elections.
We had recounts, we had audits, we had a
uh independent performance review of
Fulton County. There were almost 60
court cases that challenged the election
results here. all that failed. So if
you're looking at the evidence, there is
no question that there was no systemic
voter fraud in Georgia and that
President Trump did not win Georgia in
2020. So what was going through my mind
when I was there was this is not about
2020. This is about undermining the 2026
election. Because if you think you are
going to win the 2026 election and your
party is going to win the 2026 election,
you don't want to undermine the results
because that goes against your
credibility. But if you're afraid of
losing, you start laying the foundation
now to sew doubt.
>> Okay. Well, we'll hear more about this.
We're only on day 11. So, thanks so much
for coming in. I appreciate it. My
pleasure.
