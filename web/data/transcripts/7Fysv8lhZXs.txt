----------
This is also very much an education budget. The house version of the HB68 includes an additional
half a billion dollars in education spending
for the FY 20 over the FY 215 original budget.
You know, let that wash over you for a minute.
Half a billion dollars more in education.
The House passed HB 68, the fiscal year 2026 budget
in their version education and the state's prison system
are the big winners.
Now it's the Senate's turn to insert their budget priorities.
Good evening and welcome to lawmakers on day 30
of the legislative session.
I'm Donald Aurean Atlanta.
Ten more days for the Georgia General Assembly.
And with the House passing the budget,
the legislature chooses and crosses a major hurdle.
The Department of Behavioral Health
and Developmental Disabilities is one of the agencies
getting a boost in the House funding package.
I sat down with DBHDD Commissioner Kevin Tanner
discuss the needs of his agency, including what keeps him up at night and how he's able
to see his staff create miracles.
Also in the studio, two legislators dedicated to helping those in need will talk about
legislation and more.
One of them had staff in Barrow County near Appalachia High School during the shootings
last September and will tell us how they helped before during and after the tragedy.
We began with a report on what took place at the Capitol today with correspondent Sarah
callus. Donna it was a late start for the house today but by early afternoon they
had fulfilled their most important duty. The house took up the only bill they
are constitutionally required to pass each session. The budget for the
upcoming fiscal year. The budget is smaller than the amended budget for the
current fiscal year because it does not include as many one-time surplus
investments. Things are tight. Many of you have asked for funding for your
communities or asked us to support programs and initiatives within state agencies. I wish
we could address them all or go further than we did, but we can't. The needs are great
and there are many worthy causes competing for the same limited resources.
The budget, or HB68, applies to the fiscal year that starts in July and includes $250
million more funding for the state's prison system from last year.
to the funding and the corrections FY26 budget
is an annualization of the needs we recognized
in the amended budget, including funding to hire more
than 700 correctional officers to lower staffing ratios
and improve bed capacity so that the department
can implement life, safety, and security projects.
This budget also recognizes that salary enhancements
are working to attract and retain staff
the prison system and it includes additional salary increases to keep our
foot on the gas and adds more money to the governor's recommendation for
education. This is also very much an education budget. The House version of
HB68 includes an additional half a billion dollars in education spending for
the FY-20 over the FY-20 with five original budgets.
You all let that wash over you for a minute.
Half a billion dollars more in education.
Including a new program to address student mental health.
The addition comes after a deadly shooting
at Appalachia High School last fall.
It has become abundantly clear that school safety
and student mental health go hand in hand.
That's why I'm excited to announce a new program created
in the House budget in the Department of Education
called Student Support Services.
This $62 million program is an umbrella of services,
if you will, that's designed to cover the needs
of the whole child.
It's a collection of ideas and long time requests
many of you are likely familiar with that support
our students in ways that the QBE formula can't.
this need program provides $20 million in mental health grant funding for
middle schools and high schools. The budget passed 171 to 4 and was immediately
transmitted to the Senate. Also today, the House celebrated an important
milestone for one member. Today is the day that the Lord has made and I will
rejoice and be glad in it because I'm getting ready to ring the bell ring
the bell, ring the bell. My last radiation day. My last radiation. Thank you. Thank you.
Now I could not have done it without all of you. Thank you so very much Mr. Speaker, all
of you. I love you from the death of my heart. Thank you.
And recognize the Shepard Center's 50th anniversary. The Shepard Center treats brain and spinal
court injuries. The cause is
personal to House members as
speaker the House chief of
staff Terry England is
recovering from a spinal
court injury with the help of
the Shepherd Center. The Senate
started their session with a
resolution recognizing today as
Georgia lineman day at the
Capitol, as the state continues
to recover from damage done by
Hurricane Helene, the men who
string and repair power lines
received the special recognition.
These guys and ladies really are
the backbone of our energy
infrastructure. They braid the storms, the flooding, dangerous temperature, long nights to ensure
that our homes are lit, that we're kept safe and warm in those most darkest of hours.
They also remembered slaying Roswell Police Officer, Jeremy Labonti, who was killed last month
while responding to a suspicious person call at a shopping center. An interchange at state route
400 and Holcomb Bridge Road in Roswell was named after Labonti in Memoriam,
and the family was presented with a flag today that was flown over the capital.
For everyone who has ever served as a first responder or in the military,
please join me in suiting this family. God bless you. Thank you.
The Senate then got down to business as they quickly passed two house resolutions and a bill.
HB 287 dealt with updating DNR fishing and hunting license regulations.
DNR has purchased right at 20 wheelchairs that's on tracks. So any person is paralyzed
in state of Georgia does not have to have does not have to buy a hunting of fishing license
and also anyone that's outside of the state can also get hunting and fishing license for free.
House resolution 97 and 98 regulate the sale and leasing of state property and non-exclusive
easements in dozens of counties throughout the state. All the legislation was passed unanimously.
They then stood in recess until the House sent over the budget, assigned it to the
the Appropriations Committee and gabbled out for the day.
No floor activities are planned for tomorrow as committee work will be the top priority.
Both chambers will be back in session on Thursday.
That's my Capitol report, Donna.
Thanks, Sarah.
We're going to spend the show focusing on some of Georgia's most vulnerable citizens and
the state agency working to make a difference in their lives.
The Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities, DBHDD.
I sat down with the man who heads DBHDD, Commissioner Kevin Tanner.
We talked about a range of topics from ways to boost a workforce that shrank during the
pandemic to how the agency is looking to add more beds for people in crisis.
But we began with the agency's role in forensic services.
DBHDD receives court orders to determine if a person is competent to stand trial or can
accept criminal responsibility under an insanity defense.
Under the code, we're responsible for the restoration work and what that means is if someone's
been charged with a crime and their defense attorney or their family or the prosecutor brings
to the judge and says, you know, I think that my client may have not be competent.
They may not be able to help me participate in their criminal defense because of a mental
illness.
The judge can sign an order that would require our agency to have a licensed clinical psychologist
to PhD level psychologist do an evaluation.
If after doing that evaluation is determined that the person is indeed not competent, then
the psychologist will make a determination on whether they believe the person is restorable.
If they believe the person is restorable, they're saying in their professional medical
opinion that the person could be with treatment restored to
competency and then typically what happens that reports given to
the judge the court and then the judge will typically issue
another order that says your order to go to the state to DBHDD
our agency for to be restored to competency and once that
happens they go on a wait list and we bring them to one of our
hospitals and when that happens you also don't have enough
beds for all of that for everybody who may need that help. Talk about that a little bit.
Yeah, that's one people often ask me what keeps me up at night in this role and that's definitely
it and it's because we have almost 800 individuals in jail today waiting on a state hospital bed
and it takes on average over a year now for a mail to come into the state hospital system once
we receive the order. Now they could have been in jail for some time waiting on the evaluation
and then sometime waiting on the order,
but once we received it, it's taking a year or more.
We only have an entire state of Georgia.
We only have 641 forensic beds.
Now, 60% roughly of those beds
have people who have been ordered to us
not guilty by reason of insanity.
And what that is, that's different than not being competent.
That's someone who's been charged with a crime.
It's often a serious crime,
and the court has made the determination.
And this person's not guilty because they have such a severe illness, such a severe mental
illness, they don't know the difference between right and wrong.
And they're ordered by the court to come to us.
The average length of stay for that population is six years.
We have people who've been with us for 20 plus years at the state hospital.
So I only have about 300 beds in the entire state for restoration services, and I have
800 people waiting on one of those beds.
I want to talk a little bit about your making crisis
stabilization and diagnostic center.
That's a project that I'm extremely excited about.
It's really getting a lot of national attention.
So we are also responsible for the intellectual
developmental disability population.
And we run the now comp waiver services
through the Medicaid waiver program.
But we have certain individuals who
are what we call hard to place.
They end up being stuck in an emergency room.
They may have co-occurring IDD behavioral health illness,
they may have a behavioral issue,
they may have a physical element,
but for whatever reason,
they end up finding themselves in an emergency room.
We have a challenging time,
sometimes finding a provider that will take the individual.
So we have, I've challenged our team and our staff
and with the support of the General Assembly
and the governor, we've identified some long-term solutions.
One of those is the facility that you just mentioned,
And it will be a 16-bed, inpatient,
cross-estabilization facility for the IDD population.
It will have physical health, mental health,
doctors who are experts in treating an individual with IDD.
It'll also have things like OB-GYN, dermatology.
Whatever service is the individual may need,
they'll come there.
So they're stuck in an emergency room.
We'll bring them to this facility.
They'll be stabilized.
and then they'll be able to step down
into a community-based service.
The other thing I'm really excited about at this facility,
though, is going to have a very robust outpatient component.
And we're contracting with Mercer Medical School.
And Mercer Medical School is going to run the outpatient
component.
And why that's exciting is they're
going to bring their docs who are in training
through this outpatient center.
They're going to train those doctors.
So as they go out and rule parts, especially of the state,
They're going to know how to take care of sometimes
this challenging population to care for medically.
So it's a game changer for our system.
And that's fully funded in the budget.
And that should open toward the end of May of this year.
It's under construction now.
The other thing that we identified
is we're going to have to have good places
to step those individuals down into community settings.
So we've opened two pilot homes over in the Augusta area.
There are four beds each.
And we have reduced the number of people in a hospital
about over 33% in the last year.
We're also in the process of doing two additional homes
in Macon, and the other thing that is exciting
is we sent up a proposal to CMS,
which is the Federal Medicaid Agency,
and they've approved three types of placements
that we haven't had before,
that's more intense for the hard-to-place individual,
and we're in the process of building out that network.
So my prediction is, in the next two years,
by the end of the next two years,
we'll have no one stuck in an emergency room waiting on a bed.
We're going to have a system in place
to take care of that population.
Quite a large workforce, but I know that there are some vacancies
you'd like to see filled by qualified people.
We operate five state hospitals.
And during COVID, we lost over 1,200 employees
to that left the workforce and went somewhere else for higher pay.
Again, thanks to the governor and the general assembly
and some targeted pay increases
and some across the board, state employee pay increases.
We've been able to start, turn the tide on that.
We've brought back a lot of individuals and started,
we also have a department within our agency
that is laser focused on recruitment and retention.
The O-Carter does a tremendous job
leading that effort for us and it's making a difference.
We also have a large number of partnerships
that we have forged with universities and technical schools
to help turn out folks.
I'm going to be having dinner with one
of our university presidents here in a couple of weeks.
And we're working closely with them
to try to create a PhD-level psychology program
for someone who's actually working in the field today.
The only way I have 50 people that work for me who's
interested in getting a PhD to have a master level
psychology degree, their master level psychologist.
But in order for them to be able to do the evaluations
we talked about, to be able to test
to find an expert in court,
they have to be a PhD level lesson psychologist.
I have a 35% vacancy rate in that area.
I have 50 people who would love to fill those roles.
But in order to get that education in Georgia,
they would have to quit their job and go to school full time.
So it's been done in some other areas around the state.
It's been done in the law enforcement space
with the Georgia Law Enforcement Command College.
It's been done with public administration
and some other areas.
So we're having some serious conversations
as an agency about how can we partner
with the university system to create cohorts
in a pathway to help with the workforce.
And I'm gonna be going to one of the medical schools soon
to talk to their medical students
about number one, consider a field as a psychiatrist.
Consider going into that.
Number two, consider the public sector.
Consider coming to work for us, consider the state.
I tell young people all the time that,
I've got a staff of over 4,500 employees
and a large budget and a lot of stress,
and sometimes it can be challenging and frustrating,
and because some of the problems are frustrating.
But all I have to do is pick a date
and go to one of our hospitals, spend time with our staff,
our nurses, our doctors, and our patients
and to see the miracles that are being performed
within the walls of our hospital every day,
where they take an individual who is extremely sick,
that has a severe illness,
that may be in a place where they're very difficult
to even just handle,
but get them to a place where they're,
and I'm thinking about one in particular,
where the lady had been in that case,
had been only unit by herself
because of how challenging she was.
And when I was there, she was out in the courtyard,
reading a poem she had wrote about her recovery and her journey and she had
hope because she was had found the right medication regimen. She had found
the right people to help her to be with her to walk with her and for the first
time probably in a long time she had hope restored to her. So if I can get
young people to be able to see that side of what we do every day they get up
and go to work every day making having miracles I think we'll be able to turn
and the tide are staffing.
Yeah, my final question was going to be,
what, you know, you came in in 2022,
so in this period of time, you look back on all you've accomplished,
it sounds like you just told me that answer,
like the things that make you feel really good
about what has happened since you've been
commissioner of this department.
Yeah, you know, when Governor Camp reached out to me
and asked me about taking this role,
I wasn't seeking the job,
I wasn't looking for a job, but I called a person that I have great respect for and asked
them what they thought, and they said, you know, Kevin, only a few opportunities will
ever come along in your life where you can truly make a difference.
And when they come along, you have to take them.
And so I took this role because I felt like that we needed to make a difference.
And what I have found is we have a dedicated group of men and women across Georgia who
or D.B.H.D., who are now filling and powered to be creative and to create change in the
system, and their performance miracles every day.
The budget passed by the House today calls for more money for D.B.H.D., including to
extend forensic services and to add a jail diversion program and outreach services for those
with severe mental illness.
I want to thank Commissioner Tanner for talking to me.
Well, coming up, more on behavioral and mental health
legislation from two house members
who are passionate about those issues.
They've dedicated their lives to helping others
through life's challenges.
This is Lawmakers on GBB.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the state capitol during the session and year-round,
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen.
I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman.
People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it.
By acknowledging our own worth.
Oh, please.
Don't continue.

Understanding the past gives a sense of the future
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years
This is amazing
Pompeii is a battle against time
You think I'm joking, but look at this.
It really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
History teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry. We're going to continue the conversation
about the needs of Georgians covered under DBHDD. Joining me is Republican Representative
Katie Dempsey of Rome. She chairs the Human Resources Subcommittee of Appropriations.
She also serves on the Georgia Behavioral Health Coordinating Council. Also here is Democratic
Representative Shelley Hutchinson of Snellville.
Her committees include Public and Community Health
and Judiciary Juvenile.
She is a social worker and owns the Social Empowerment Center,
which, among other things, provides mental health services
for adults, children, and families.
Welcome to both of you, to all lawmakers.
Thank you.
So I want to start with your reactions to some of the things
that the Commissioner Tanner talked about.
Anything that you want to bring out,
a little bit more about what that he talked about.
You know, I think the IDD work is so important that's happening and making.
I was there for the groundbreaking, but I was also a part of the appropriations effort
to add that.
It is the one and only in our nation that will be exactly like that.
People with developmental disabilities and who have complex mental health issues too,
it's a very hard population to care for.
They need very special care.
Yeah, he said that it's getting a lot of national attention, so I'm glad to hear that.
What about for you?
Well, I think the thing that I thought of most is the workforce.
Mental health is not an industry that the state is going to make money off of.
So we don't have the type of money we can pour into like a private entity like Hyundai
or Rivian or something like that.
So we have to find the money to pay highly skilled people for a highly skilled population.
It's just, it's not always there as much as we want it to be, but it's so important because by not treating some of these illnesses, we see crime rates go up, we see divorce rates go up, we see children in foster care more often.
So it's something we have to do and we have to find the resources to do it and fortunately we did do some good work in the budget.
And making it the job attractive in terms of paying them what they need. He said he lost a lot.
the private sector, that's true.
That is true.
I know the other thing is the budget did,
there was money in the budget for that,
for a D.B.H.D., that's very much needed.
There is, but it's also, this is the first budget
that I can remember where so much money was spread throughout.
Previously, you've seen a lot of money in the D.B.H.D.B.H.D budget,
but actually, now it's an education to deal with many of the factors
that are going on there in our K through 12 schools.
It's in our jails and corrections.
It's in law enforcement, as well as D-B-H-D-D,
and health, full-time, regular health
that we don't always think of as mental health,
because that integration of services,
that's parity, and that's what we're all working toward.
We're gonna talk about your parity bill in a minute,
so we're gonna talk a little bit about that.
Representative Hutchison, I want you to tell us
about the Social Empowerment Center that you have,
and then I want you to tell how your staff
helped at Appalachia High School during the crisis.
So I started the Social Empowerment Center 23 years ago.
It was just for me and a friend to do the work
that we loved in the community.
But 23 years later, we have a little over 100 employees.
We work in mostly Northeast Georgia.
We start in Gwinnett County.
We kind of spread out from Athens to banks
to all the way back through Barrow and Hall
and back to Gwinnett County.
That's kind of our region.
And we've been integrated in that community for over 20 years.
So one of the things we do in Barrow County
is we staff the schools there for mental health services.
And that's where Appalachia is.
Yes, that's where Appalachia is.
The day of the shooting, we had staff,
our staff travels to all the high schools in Barrow County.
We were addressing another emergency at Barrow Linder High School,
which is close by, when the shooting happened.
Our employees were locked in all of the schools in Barrow County
because there was a threat throughout.
They were barricaded in their offices all day.
And really, the kids' mental health is paramount.
But as the owner of the business,
I have to think about my employees
who were barricaded in their offices all day.
They needed triage themselves.
And of course, we do everything we can
for our employees and for our clients.
But we saw 80 families that day, the first day.
that was a Thursday and by the end of the weekend,
we saw almost 300.
Wow.
And I think we had, in one week,
we probably had 300 new referrals for cases
for kids that witnessed some of the most horrific things
that I've heard as a supervisor or as a therapist.
And those numbers have gone up.
Because what we're finding is we have kids
that maybe weren't in Barrow County,
maybe in High Room, Georgia.
They have a genuine, all the years I've worked with teenagers,
I've heard every excuse why a child doesn't want to go to school.
But this was a really genuine fear from a lot of children
around the state and the world really,
that they are, their fear of going to school
is getting more severe and more real to them.
Because now you have neighbors who've experienced these things.
So we've been busy.
I'm glad you were there and I hear that people are recognizing
your work, so I appreciate that.
Yes, we thank Barrow County Schools for recognizing the work that we did there.
That's good.
I want to get to the bill we talked about a little bit earlier and that's HB612 and that's
adding the behavioral health coordinating council adding to it.
You're already on it.
What would you like added?
I am and I think I've been on it for quite some time since it's inception but we have
incrementally added different voices to that group and it is a great, it's a great sounding
board with the commissioner as well to have agency heads as well as advocates and consumers
on there. We added the insurance commissioner and that is going to be a step toward really
ensuring the parity that we are challenged with. Back in 22, we did pass the parity act
and to understand that mental health is treated equally with physical health, that there
There are no different deductibles or copays or time limits to when you can seek services.
That is so important.
So there will also be a parity compliance panel added through this measure.
And that's going to be a great way for us to continue to monitor that, to collect data,
and to make sure that Georgians are actually receiving the best care.
Yeah.
And that bill passed.
You had another one that passed out of the house, and that's 677.
It is.
That involves placement procedures for children discharged from a hospital or a psychiatric
residential facility.
Tell us about that.
Right.
We're having a growing problem, not only in Georgia, but across the nation, particularly
young, young people that are not in defects care necessarily, but they are in crisis.
And after three to five days of crisis care, when it's time to leave the hospital, when
they are not medically needing services, someone has to be there.
to pick them up, to take them home, to take them to where they should be, and to go into
the next steps of care. Well, at that discharge, often a parent or the guardian or the custodian
is not willing to do it anymore. These are some of our hardest children. They are at the
end of their rope. The parent is not giving up on the child necessarily, but cannot take
them back into a home environment where, perhaps, it'd be
dangerous for the rest of the family members.
So we're trying to find a better way to deal with that.
Well, you're feeling good about both of those in the
Senate.
I do.
OK, then.
Well, we'll keep up with that.
We'll hold home.
Yeah, thank you both for being here today.
I know we've run out of time.
There's so much to talk with you both about.
But that does it today for lawmakers.
We'll return on Thursday when the Chambers
Gavilan for day 31.
Tomorrow is a committee day for the General Assembly.
And on Thursday, among our topics, the AJC's best dress lawmakers of 2025 have a good night.
