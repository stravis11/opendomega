TRANSCRIPT
----------
you you grant us wisdom and discernment as we go about this meeting Lord and we thank you
for all the many blessings you bestow upon us and Jesus' name we pray amen amen thank you
committee members for being here today as well as everybody who is seated in the room want to take
a special moment to thank all the staff here that has helped us out from all the different groups
and specifically Miss Allison Bailey who has only been with us a few months now and she is
is legislative assistant for this committee.
And then we also have Ms. Brooke Partridge back there.
She is interning with us, so we're excited.
And we've also got Jack back here,
who's on to keep everybody straight,
supporting Senator Robertson.
We give him an extra prayer every night.
So we're gonna talk about a few things today.
And the first thing I want to review really quickly
is we have Senate rules which for the committee,
which normally would be in our folders,
we're gonna get those up back in there.
But I wanna remind everybody that this is a very active committee.
We have a lot of bills that come through
and we're gonna try and do is not jam pack everything to the end.
I think the lieutenant governor has made it clear
that we should start moving some things earlier,
but would rather do one or two bills in a meeting
rather than trying to do nine in a meeting.
It's a lot of overwhelming work.
We're also gonna do our very best
to get the agenda published the day before,
to give first and foremost our committee members
the opportunity to look through those,
but also for the public and everyone else here.
I can't always promise you that will happen
because sometimes a specific circumstance will arise,
but that will be our intent and Allison
will be the person will be working on that agenda
putting it together.
Certainly those bills should be online.
If for some reason we have an amendment
or a committee substitute to that,
We will try to have those available in our office,
which is 421, as most people know, right outside here,
that you could pick up a copy of that
if we don't already have that published online.
We'll also do our best to have electronic copies
as well to email.
Next thing is when we do have amendments,
which we will have at different times,
if it is a minor amendment, it's a word change
or a day change, et cetera, doing those I'll call it
on the fly are very reasonable acceptable.
If it's a big material, change the bills, though.
And you want to bring it in amendment.
I'm going to need that brought to me 24 hours in advance
so we can sure we've vetted that out.
And that'll be something that I'll work on.
I'll certainly ask our vice chairman, Senator Robertson,
to help, and specifically also legislative counsel, who
helps us to make sure that those are going to work properly.
So I just want to review kind of the logistics first.
The committee, anybody have any questions on that?
Okay, seeing none, as everyone is aware, all bills that were reported fade away of this
committee and got to rules but then were never heard on the Senate floor got reported
back to the committee.
So we have right now quite a few bills that came back to the committee and they're not
only your folder right now but we're going to reanalyze what they are but there is just
to give you kind of a high level overview.
There were ones relating to cameras in school zones,
booting for cars.
We had ones limiting certain things in school zones again.
That was a second bill.
Watercraft, education, law enforcement, accreditation,
gypsy credentials, non-lethal use of tasers
and other stuff.
So there's a group here and there's about 10 bills or so.
We're going to re-analyze those because some of them were substituted at the end from what we're originally put here, and when it's reasonable and feasible, we will combine bills that are in the same code section or the same subject matter in order to make sure we ease the legislative process.
So we'll be going through those and then we do have two subcommittees as you may remember.
Bills will be assigned to subcommittee sometimes, sometimes not, it really depends on the depth of them
If we think that they need more input and research, and I want to thank everybody who has served on those
Once they're assigned to a subcommittee it is up to the subcommittee chair to host those meetings
And the last thing I want to say is we need a request from the bill's author to hear the bill
If we don't get a request
We will just make the grand assumption that you probably didn't want to move forward with your bill for whatever reason
You may have had it tacked on something else. You matter how change of heart
Either way, it's fine with me, but until we get a request and then once we get a request
We'll review those requests and decide what's going to make it to each one of the meetings
We do have our meeting schedule is the same as last year we canceled yesterday's because of
All the events happening with the eggs and issues breakfast as well as the Pro Tems luncheon
but we'll be meeting on Wednesdays and of course today on Thursdays.
I know Thursdays sometimes are tough,
we're not in legislative session on Friday,
but we're going to do our best to make sure we have a good solid quorum
and everybody can be here to participate in the process.
Any questions?
Okay, so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to have Austin come up
and he's going to give us an overview of what has happened up to this point
in the Public Safety Committee's background.
What do we cover, the things that we do?
Just to give a refresher for everybody here,
and the last but not least,
I'll remind everybody on the committee,
as well who are in the audience.
All the bills which are in our committee
can be found at any time on the legislative website.
By simply clicking on the advanced search button
and searching by committee and this calendar year,
and you can see all of those bills
and the status from which those bills are in.
So I will turn it over to you, Austin,
That was us with your, with your update.
Well, thank you members for having me here today.
It's an honor to be with you.
My name is Austin Bryson.
I'm at the Office of Policy and Legislative Analysis.
And I will be the analyst for this committee, this session.
I do realize that it is late on Thursday,
first week of session.
And I promise I won't keep you too long.
So like Senator Albers was saying,
I'm just going to briefly go through kind of what public safety
does. I know that seems pretty obvious to most of you, but I know each session, it's
really easy to get honed in on one or two specific topics, and it's easy to forget just
how wide-ranging these committees can be. So first, I'm going to just look at the general
areas of focus here. The Committee on Public Safety has general jurisdiction over legislation
related to the security and safety of Georgia citizens. Additionally, the committee reviews
most legislation related to the licensing of drivers and safety on Georgia's roads. Now,
I didn't write that beautiful language that came right off the committee website.
So there's the official definition for you below there are the key areas of the committee.
I'm going to go through each of those in turn just briefly and in a little more depth.
So first up is a motor vehicle safety.
Now I got this information here off of the Office of Highway Safety website and a lot
of it just goes through 2021 because that was the most up to date, fully worked out information.
But speed-related fatalities represented 22% of all traffic fatalities that occurred
on Georgia roadways in 2021, alcohol impaired, and drug-related crashes increased by 14%
from 8,520 to nearly 10,000 in 2021.
54% of all motor vehicle traffic crashes had at least one confirmed or suspected distracted
driver, and for those passenger vehicle occupants who were fatally injured, 52% were unrestrained.
Now just quickly, that chart below there, one trend that I saw that I thought was interesting
was back when this chart starts in 2012, the difference between rural and urban traffic
fatalities is very close.
You got 589 to 603, but as it goes on, urban becomes nearly double that of rural.
And I thought that was a bit of an interesting trend over the course of the decade.
And I'm just going to stop you for one moment.
I think all this analysis is very important, but looking at your fourth bullet.
For those passenger vehicles, occupants who are fatally injured, more than a half is because
they didn't wear a seatbelt.
The one simplest thing that we can do to save somebody's life, I think that's very important
to point out.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Senator.
And so next topic that this committee covers largely is DDS procedures.
So Georgia maintained 67, Department of Driver Service locations, statewide, digital licensing,
probably something you've all heard quite a bit about.
It's a new feature it's making headlines.
The offices received two grants recently.
One was a grant award of 117,000 that will be used for
defund a traffic data analyst, which I drive from Woodstock
every day, so I'm very happy.
Anybody that's analyzing traffic pattern.
So it's good with me.
There's also a $240,000 grant that was given for the
Georgia Electronic Conviction Processing System.
And just as sort of an example, you know, I've put these out
throughout their presentation.
HB120 is an example of a bill that dealt with standards
for issuance and revocation of limited driving permits
for certain offenders.
And before you go on to the committee members,
who else has downloaded their digital driver's license?
All right, Senator Jackson, anyone else?
Very simple process to do.
Go to your Apple Wallet or your equivalent
on your Android phone.
You'll take a few pictures of it.
it'll submit. It'll come back. This is a legal ID. You can use it at the airport for other
forms of identification. Great thing. Some reason you misplaced your wallet. You don't
have something with you. This is a good solution.
So next up, fire protection and safety. That's another big topic here. Georgia has 487 fire
stations and departments. In 2022, there were 69 home fire fatalities reported by US
media. One thing that I found interesting is how Georgia Fire Department is
compared to the national average. The national average has 70% volunteer rate.
Georgia is slightly under half. We almost have doubled the career firefighters as
the national average, which I think is pretty impressive. Next up we have law
enforcement agencies. So Georgia has 11 state law enforcement agencies. This
ranges from larger agencies like the GBI to smaller agencies like the Georgia
World Congress Center Authority. Stone Mountain Park also has quite an operation. They have the Stone
Mountain Park Department of Public Safety, which I had no idea it was such a large operation.
The DPS provides police, fire, emergency medical, and rescue services to the park's visitors and
employees. Another thing that I just wanted to put in here briefly is post-certification.
And most of you know what that is, but the Peace Officer Standards and Training Council
puts out the standards for training our police officers in the state and that
that is an extremely important you know part of making sure that our officers
stay safe our citizens stay safe and one thing people I think forget about is
even from a legal side of things in the courtroom if you've ever been in a
criminal proceeding you've certainly heard a prosecutor establishing post
certification with an officer and having them explain that which is very
important. And also just to clarify for everybody post also will investigate and
could potentially pull someone's credentials from them if there was something
found to be problematic or illegal in their actions. Right, thank you. So in
Georgia there's 159 elected sheriffs, one for each county. There's
approximately 350 local police departments, 12 martial offices and
approximately 12 county police departments. Here the example bill I use for
For this category was HB142, which dealt with the establishment of unified campus police
forces.
So the next topic is pretty straightforward, so I just got an example here.
But school bus rules are important, and this committee does deal with that.
HB301 was the example I used here, and that dealt with violations of improperly passing
a school bus and speeding in a school zone when captured by cameras.
Why don't you go back one for it?
Absolutely.
It's a good reminder for everybody here, so just take a moment and remember when you can,
especially if you're on the other side of the street, pass school bus,
only if the highway is fully divided. Make sure that you don't do that. There are cameras
on a lot of our school buses too that capture people to do in that one, make sure the kiddos
is your safe. Yes ma'am. Your number will you talk to the microphone and I'm asking you're
number when you're talking about officers are they I'm assuming they are included the school
resource officers are they in that number that you quoted. Let me go back here they I'm not sure
that they would be in this number here they they very well might be I don't know they'd be
to be included in the local police departments.
I think that's mostly city, but we have a resident expert
right here.
I think that's a great question.
Because I know Cobb County school system
has their own police department,
Muscogee County school system.
Most of the universities and colleges have their own.
So I think that would be great if we make sure
that all of those numbers are part of that.
Because that's something that gets missed way too often
and needs to be there because Cobb County doesn't need
resource officers because they have a police department
thereby they have the resource officers already there.
So in Harris County, the resource officers in our school
were provided by the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
So it's a sharing of resources.
So great question, Senator.
You look quite well.
We need to add those in.
Let's break those out to Austin, maybe for a future meeting.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
So next up we have firearms.
I mean, I think we all know how this applies,
but I did want to point out that some firearm bills
will go to judiciary, some come to this committee,
for instance, a constitutional carry.
Some of that goes to judiciary,
but I've used two examples here of SB277 and SB344
from the 2022 session.
These bills dealt with, the as introduced of 277,
dealt with extended exemptions for weapons,
carry laws for certain court officials inside of a courthouse and 344 dealt with it was a
bill that required training to possess certain firearms.
Now I'm a little hesitant to show you this slide as much as I like to shoot off fireworks
on 4th of July but it is important so the firework industry has become a multi-billion dollar
industry in the United States and according to the National Fire Protection Association
Fireworks started over 12,000 known fires in the US in 2021,
including over 2,000 structure fires, 300 vehicle blazes,
and nearly 10,000 others.
The NFPA estimated that fireworks could start some 19,000 fires
annually in the United States.
I do want to comment when Georgia passed the fireworks law
when we did years ago.
One of the things we put in there is the ability
based on us having a drought or other weather conditions to suspend some of the
times and dates that we allow fireworks for some of the very reasons that
you're citing. So here I've got rules of the road, another category that we
deal with here. The two pictures I have are what reminded me of traffic
violations the most. I've got spaghetti junction from my mini drives from Marietta
to UGA during my internships, during rush hour as well as my current exit at the capital
where I often see people trying to move over seven lanes to get off their last minute
because they didn't read the signs.
So the two example bills that I used here were HB-119 and 541, both of these just dealt
with procedures for passing vehicles.
For instance, 119 modified the procedures for passing stationary vehicles other than authorized
emergency vehicles all right so next up the Department of Public Safety that was
created back in 1937 they oversee the day-to-day operations of the Georgia
State Patrol capital police and the Motor Carrier Compliance Division so
they have large ranging responsibilities and then last but certainly not least
the the GBI and it deserves its own slide for sure as much as they do
within our state. The GBI is broken up into several divisions. They have the
division of forensic sciences, the Georgia Crime Information Center, the
investigative division, which does a significant amount of investigations on
officer-involved shootings, the legal division, medical examiner's office, and the
crisis intervention team. With regard to them, I'm sure many of you have been
down to the GBI offices and labs where they do significant amounts of their
work. It's quite an operation they have down there. I was fortunate enough to go
myself back when I was an intern at the Cobb DA and see the autopsies and the crime labs and
it they're very impressive operation over there. George is very fortunate to have them. But with
that said, I promised I'd keep it brief and I think that covers the major categories
the public safety committee. So thank you so much for letting me be here today and I'll turn it back
over to the committee. Thank you. Thank you, Austin. Great job. Do you want to add the Department
of Corrections, which is our prisons, even though sometimes they will fall under state institutions
and properties for the committee, for the actual physical building, a lot of the legislation
will come through us as well.
And a lot of these different departments will connect, as an example, if we're working
something on the, with the governor's highway safety, well, the first people we're going
to talk to is George State Patrol, right?
Because they're out there on a road all time.
We'll be working with our George Sheriff's Association with George Chiefs of Police.
We'll work with sometimes the DOT to make sure that we're connecting those dots.
We have a lot of partners in here,
same with the Firefighter Association,
the Fire Chiefs Association.
We've got a lot of groups that are very well represented here
at the Capitol that can't have all the folks
in their profession here at any time
and they send some pretty darn good people down
to speak on their behalf.
So I appreciate that.
Do you wanna mention just a couple more things
before we open up to the committee,
because two of us in this committee,
Senator Jackson and myself,
both swatted right after Christmas. And it is an unfortunate incident. You may have heard
both of us talking about it either in the news or coming from the Senate well.
But for a quick update on that to remind everybody how dangerous that is,
please talk to the people that you know. Talk to your family, talk to your friends,
talk to younger folks who may not realize that that's not a prank. It's very serious. We could
literally harm people or they could lose their lives.
Really big special thanks, though,
to George State Patrol and GBI for the work they're doing.
It is very difficult to find the people
that do this type of work because of the technology.
However, we're pretty close.
So we're going to thank them, as well as all local
and federal law enforcement.
It's a team to make all those things happen.
Also, I want to just say that I'm sure you all
heard Mayor Dickens spoke at the exit issues breakfast yesterday, as well as a lot of
PR between him and Chief Shearbomb here in Atlanta for the tremendous job they have done
to reduce the crime rate in our capital city.
That is certainly worth celebrating.
A big part of that is the support of our law enforcement, the very intentional work,
as well as the crime suppression unit, which Governor Kim put in the place.
Many of us have written along with the crime suppression unit that's going out three
to four days a week with a compliment over a hundred officers from Georgia State Patrol,
bringing in other state agencies as well as working with the Atlanta police, Fulton County
Police and Sheriff's Office.
So a lot of good things are happening.
Is it perfect?
The answer is no.
But are we trending in the right direction?
Absolutely.
And that's a wonderful thing.
Last thing I want to bring up today is aside from the two standing subcommittees that
we have in place and they are again designed to vet legislation on occasion, depending
on a specific need, we will assign a special subcommittee for the purpose of looking at
something that's out of our normal parameters.
And in this case, we had a lot of issues in 2023 that really stemmed back candidly for
almost 50 years, but they really came to ahead in 2023 with a Fulton County jail, with
10 people losing their lives, overcrowding, you all saw, I'm sure, in one way, shape or
form that on the news and the pictures.
So I asked clearly the most experienced person that walks in this building every day in
the legislature, which is Senator Randy Robertson, our majority whip, to lead that subcommittee
because as a retired deputy sheriff and a major, he's actually both worked in and managed
A.J.L. and he has held two committee meetings.
I want to let him give you an update, but I will tell you, since he held his first committee,
there's no overcrowding right now.
Suddenly things are getting done much quicker and much faster by a little oversight.
So kudos to the great work he's been doing and all the people who have realized with shining
a little light on something can get people to get things done a bit more efficiently.
So Senator Robertson, would you give us an update, Mr. Chairman?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Briefly, I want to thank Chairman Albers for this opportunity, but also I want to thank
everybody who we've reached out to.
There's some of us in Senator Jones himself works with a sheriff's agency in his district
and understands a lot of this.
And when this information came out, the first thing we understand is the vast majority of
people don't understand the role of accounting jail, what exactly it's supposed to do in relation
ship to the court.
So when we started the meeting, these meetings were basically the first two were basically
educational meetings for the committee members.
We brought in experts.
experts, we brought in the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, we brought in the Prosecutorial
Attorney's Council to basically explain the system, if you will. The Sheriff's Office
came in and explained what the jail does. And as many people have admitted and as was brought
out in the meeting, there is a misunderstanding, a common misunderstanding within the community
about what a jail is and what a prison is. They are not the same by any stretch of the
the imagination, nor is the responsibilities
of the individuals operating those facilities.
Very different.
One facility is there to hold individuals
who have not been convicted of a crime.
They have only been accused of a crime.
And so we looked at the process there,
and remember our primary focus to start with is overcrowding.
And so we talked to the sheriff,
talked about the facilities,
the things that were going on in there.
Then in the second meeting, the sheriff came back,
spoke a little more after the jail experts
that spoke it in the previous meeting.
And then the Pat came in, Pete Scandalactus
and his incredible team, and pointed out the,
or explained the judicial process,
the normal judicial process moving through.
Our next goal at our third meeting,
which the announce will be coming up shortly,
will be to have some, some experts
from the local prosecutor's office to come in
and we're gonna look at the process
of how cases are selected,
how the process is used to decrease the population
within the jail by moving the individuals in the jail
into the judicial system
so that their cases can be adjudicated
and they can either be released back into the community
or incarcerated if that's what,
if that's what the system determines via the due process.
And then in conclusion, after the meetings,
I think we focus, we'll have representatives
from the county commission come in,
and therefore we talk about funding,
the future opportunities that we believe are on the horizon
for the Fulton County jail,
whether that is consolidation of services,
whether it's the construction of a new jail or whatever,
and also issues around technology
and other new ways of doing things
that hopefully will alleviate the overcrowding problem
here in our capital and hopefully some ideas
that we can use around the state
to address this problem if it exists in other communities
and to prevent it from happening in other communities.
But I feel that our subcommittee hearings
have been extremely fruitful.
A lot of great information coming out,
but I wanna say this,
any agency that I have reached out to
and asked to come in here and offer information
with a special emphasis on the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.
Nobody has hesitated to come in.
Nobody has questioned me saying,
as if they were nervous about what we were going to ask.
Everybody was very forthright, very forthcoming.
Chairman Albers pointed this out when this was established.
This is not political.
And as long as I chair this committee,
this subcommittee, it will not be.
We need the information so we can solve a legitimate problem not only for those that run these facilities
But for the men and women the citizens of Georgia who are being held there awaiting to have their constitutional rights of due process
So the meetings are going well and there'll be an update coming out within the next couple of days on when the next meeting will be and again
Chairman Ivers, thank you so much for this opportunity
Thank you chairman Robertson
Okay, I'm going to open this up to the committee for any questions or comments, Senator C.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm curious to know how many of our, we got our counties or municipalities that have
their own training establishment.
more I'm learning are having them or acquiring them or building them or whatever and I'm just
curious. Any ideas?
You know that's a great question. I don't know if I could tell you how many specific
counties because sometimes there'll be a local police academy, fire academy, sheriff
may have the academy. We have obviously Gypstick is the main one which most of you have
been to and we will have an off-session committee meeting there as we like to do every couple
of years. Director Wigginton, who leads Gipsdick, has got a pretty robust plan to increase
our regional academies. So we have more opportunities to do that. I think you're also going to see
some pretty exciting things coming down the line that many of us have been working on
to increase the hours of training for our new police officers. Things have changed.
The world continues to evolve. And I think everybody here believes more training is good,
whether that be through one of the regional systems
or at the future Atlanta Police Training Center,
which I look forward to cutting the ribbon
before we know it.
Other questions, comments?
Yes, Senator Williams.
Thanks, sir.
I'd like to go back and look at some of these school cameras
where they're located schools or close to a fall line,
or a freeway. They're not exiting or entrance or exit on to that freeway or fall
line but they have cameras and they turn it into a school zone but they're
not putting flashing lights to let people know when they're operating. I'd also
like to require that when they send you a photograph of your tag that you've
exceeded the speed that there's also in that photograph that can wide-angle
little ends so that the speed that you're being clocked at that's shown on that
radar also validates what they're riding because I've had reports that
that's not consistent so I'd like to really look at that issue. I think it is a
There's a great issue, Chairman Jay Collins over in the House and I and Senator Roberts
and spent quite a bit of time working on it toward the end of the session.
We do need to make some updates to that.
I agree with everything you're saying.
It needs to be done properly, it needs to be consistent.
We've had a couple of bad actors, Candlely, who are running cameras 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, off of school zone times two, that we've had to have some conversations.
We've had a handful of cities who put on stand-alone cameras.
We got an opinion from legislative council that that was, in fact, illegal.
And most all of them stopped immediately.
I want to thank the great work that was done through Butch Ayers with the Chiefs of Police.
So we want to make sure that we're consistent, right?
We want to be safe, but we also want to make sure that we have the proper parameters in place.
So I would love for you to capture that and work with us because we're going to be updating that bill
bill probably in the next week or so because I'd like to get it out sooner than
later. I think one of the last things that we'll mention on that is there's
been discussion a long time about who owns the cameras and who makes the
decision to do that and in our bill just remind everybody we change that
because the schools and the local jurisdictions were battling over that. The
candid answer to this is the schools have no play in that at all. The schools
do not maintain the roads in front and the schools do not have someone out there who
at otherwise be running radar and pulling people over for driving in a manner that was
inconsistent with the law.
So that is up to the local jurisdictions to put that in the place.
Certainly, they'll work with the school, but that is on a city, county, or state road,
and it should be the law enforcement's jurisdictions area to make those decisions.
But we will have a robust debate on that one, Senator, and I look forward to hearing
everybody's feedback and input.
Have one more.
Yes, sir.
Watercraft, you mentioned watercraft education.
Where am I at?
We have lakes in Claire, like O'Coney.
And there's been some fatalities on those lakes.
But, and where someone would be in the wrong
and create that fatality.
There's no insurance at all.
And they've killed the breadwinner of a family.
And the family has no recourse, nowhere to go.
There's no requirement of liability insurance.
And it may be something that we have to look at.
That's a very good point.
I'd be honored to help you with that.
And I think we'll get Chairman Walker,
as well from the insurance committee,
to probably weigh on that as well.
Good, thank you.
Thank you.
Other committee members, Senator Robertson?
Yes, one thing is during off session,
I've received a couple of phone calls
about the possibility of agencies running speed traps
in a couple of parts of the state,
primarily down South Georgia.
And so, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So, which shall remain nameless until we get the information,
but there are penalties in Georgia code for doing that.
And what I hope to do during this session
look at some of those code sections because something that any good law enforcement officer
opposes is revenue-based policing.
And I want to be really careful as we look at this technology too, that when we're using
cameras to send citizens' citations that the fees being charged are flat fees and they
are not or penalties or flat penalties and that they're not additional fees being added
on top of this that would put the undue financial stress on the operator, thereby appearing
to be revenue-based policing. But the fees would have to be something negotiated between
the vendor and the municipality coming from the profit side, if you will, the vendor
side, and not from the motorist who has cited. As an example, there was one piece of legislation
and it may have been Chairman Collins coming over.
I think it had a flat fee of $100.
I just wanted to make sure I went to court
in an off session with a couple of residents
who had gotten traffic citations
and were really intimidated by the process.
And one thing they didn't understand
is when the judge said a fine of this
and when they went back to pay it.
And I'm sure Senator Jones knows exactly what I'm talking
about, they go in the back room.
He goes from $100 to $175
because of all of these fees that have been added on
by the General Assembly to pay for other things.
And while in those types of situations
that's established policy and law and understand it
on this technology side, I think it's a little different
animal, so we need to be really, I wanna look at that.
But I am gonna follow up on the speed trap issue
and be communicating with committee members
to see if there may be some action.
We need to take to better police, the police that are attempting to generate unfair revenue
from unsuspecting citizens traveling up and down our roads.
Other committee members?
As we wrap up, we've got some pretty great experience on this committee from prosecutions
to EMTs and paramedics and firefighters and law enforcement, and even now dads of firefighters
like me.
So, I'm pretty excited for Senator Payne and his son.
He's been sharing me a wonderful, wonderful career and the great things his son's doing.
So, what we do is very meaningful, and we'll say it a thousand more times of how grateful
we are for every one of our first responders that goes out each and every day to protect
our community and we are working outside of this committee, both Senator Robert, Senator
and I, to increase the amount of retirement through the POAB, which is the police officer,
annuity benefit fund, as well as the firefighter pension fund, and that will come through a different
committee. But I'd ask you to remember that when those hopefully make it through those
committees onto the floor in order to help out all of those who protect us. So with no
other further comments, this meeting is hereby adjourned. Thank you and have a great day.
You
