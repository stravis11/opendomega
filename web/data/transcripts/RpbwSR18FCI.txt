----------
you you you you you you you Senator again. Thanks for hosting us in your district and I look forward to a good discussion today. This is supposed to be our final study committee meeting and so we hope to after hearing from the speakers have some good discussion being this is Senator Gimps district. He's gonna welcome the speakers here and maybe was on the agenda. So thank you. Thank you Chairman Hood. I want to thank everybody for turning out today and really I know we've already thanked the mayor but where's Jennifer? Where's Jennifer? She's in a first stand up and take a bow. Said let's let's let's congratulate. Jennifer Scott is the longest serving city manager that I know anything about. Said she's been here for about quarter century or somewhere close. Said they as the city and I'm gonna pick on Mayor Pat Graham who's the chairman of the Barrow County Board of Commissioners who served as mayor for two or three terms two terms here is the mayor of rousalton so they you know when we talk about the things that are going on in rousalton Georgia said they used to be a little a little cotton town that that Kim Basin's your bottom and it's really impressive what I was going on. So for me mayor thank you very much for hosting this your facilities are magnificent and if anybody in here needs access to Wafah just so you know the there's a barcode or our QR code right outside the door that you can get on the Wafah and if you need the restroom it's down at the end of the hall the on the right outside. The my name is Frank again and me and Chairman LaHood worked with our committee members and I want to thank all our committee members for being here today this is the third meeting of the service delivery strategy meeting the that we're working on we'd like it to be our final and if you see there's an agenda here we're gonna we're gonna go a few few things differently on the agenda the I'm gonna change things up like I do in baseball so for me the I had a request and and I want to start off with I'm gonna I'm gonna pick on Angie Davis and Pat Graham and I'm not sure how y'all want to work it the if you want a tag team or if you want it one wants to go before the other but to because I think at all our committee meetings we've heard about the the friction between two of my favorite local governments and that's Barra County and the City of Wander and it's it's where I wanted to put a face and a name to those communities because you're gonna find out hey these are executive officers of their local government that are working really hard for their people and for me they I congratulate both of them I know I've been been a rang before for for saying things that that sometimes I just said well it needed to be said I'm gonna brag on you because for me they they've stayed at the table they've worked through a lot of issues and and there's issues that many people know and I meant a lot of folks that don't but Chairman Graham the I'm not sure how you want to start start the presentation if you want to start and introduce your council but I'd love to have y'all start off our meeting thank you Senator see people hear me this is a little high is it working excellent thank you I'd like to thank the committee for allowing me to speak today I like to thank the co-chair senator Ken and Representative LaHood appreciate your time and diligence on this important effort and also thank Mayor of Rousselton for hosting I almost could have walked here today so it made it very convenient for me I did serve two terms as the Mayor of Rousselton between 2002 and 2009 we renegotiated six different service delivery agreements we did it twice in Hall County twice in Jackson County once in Barrow and once in Gwyneth that involved working with 36 different cities and it's a process that requires communication cooperation and a lot of give and take in 2009 when at County had an impasse that led to a court challenge and what finally tipped the scales in the Gwyneth in Gwyneth County was bringing new leadership that was eager to resolve the conflict chairman Vanister had refused to negotiate with the cities in Gwyneth when chairman Charlotte Nash was elected she worked to resolve the tax equity issues which involved the cost of the planning department and the cost of the Gwyneth County police department sometimes the roadblocks to achieving a service delivery agreement come down to a people problem that's when we have to rely on our voters to correct people problems and they do so by putting new leadership in place much of the discussion of this joint study committee has focused on the Winder Barrow service delivery dispute our service delivery agreement should have been adopted in 2018 that's five years ago all of you are aware the George's Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month another big item has happened we've had municipal elections let me introduce at this time the mayor elective the city of Winder he's not going to have a chance to speak today but he's someone I'm going to be speaking with a lot in the coming weeks months and years Jimmy Terrell I'm confident that new leadership and Winder will come to the table in good faith and work with us to adopt a service delivery agreement the county and the other five cities have already been ready to improve an agreement since 2018 and it's possible we may come to an agreement before the Supreme Court has a chance to rule I've had a chance to review the 11 recommendations kind of procedural recommendations that are before this committee today and I took a very high-level look at them as local elected official and I looked to see which of those items might have helped Barrow County and Winder come to an agreement and which ones would have made no difference I do think all procedurally the majority of them are good things to put in place but I want to bring up one item that was not on your list that would have definitely made a difference in our ability to adopt service delivery agreement the current service delivery statute allows the county seat a veto of the adoption of a service delivery agreement in our case the county seat represents about 22% of the population in our county and they blocked the other six local governments from adopting an agreement for the last five years we met with all of our cities after each round of court rulings to make sure that we were all still on the same page we were the local government representing local governments representing about 75% excuse me 78% of the population in our county have been held up by a city that represents 22% I think there might be a problem with the legislation when a veto objection cannot be overridden all the other local governments representing 78% of our population should have had an opportunity to say wait a minute this agreement will work for us of the I reviewed the 11 recommendations and I again I looked objectively through would they have made a difference would they have helped us resolve our conflict took very high-level look Angie our attorney's gonna come to you with all the details minor minimal of all the agreements I think nine of them would have had no impact at all they would have helped but I think we still would have had this impasse that's lasted for the last five years the one item that is the largest motivator of all of these that are listed here is number eight there has to be some kind of consequence for not coming to the table and not negotiating a good faith and number eight mentions the loss of QLG status that is a motivator number eight says that the longest QLG status can be held in a bayance or the sanctions can be held in a bayance is six months that would definitely help I've had some discussions with other city and county people over the last several days since I've seen since I saw the list and actually there are some that feel there should be maybe even a larger motivator one of the discussions I had with with a senator that's not on this committee is perhaps withholding local option sales tax or 50% of the local option sales tax proceeds to local governments that have an impasse that lasts longer than six months if you put a little bit of financial pain into the situation it has a tendency to bring people to the table quicker with an eagerness to work out the issues other items on the list just I wanted to briefly mention item number two I think that item might need some clarity it's trying to get the DCA to tie the timing together between service delivery and comprehensive planning and the last sentence or next the last sentence I have a question about the FCS negotiation cycles with comprehensive planning cycles for each county in the affected cities to include comprehensive planning involving local option sales tax and I'm not sure if you're trying to tie the negotiation of local option sales tax to all three of those things or not so I would like to see some clarification on that or maybe maybe a service delivery agreement needs to have an additional agreement that says how the jurisdictions are going to approach negotiating their next local option sales tax but I think item number two could use a little bit of clarity and one of the items that also I hope this committee will look at is item number 10 the beginning of item number 10 wanting appropriate and accurate geographic maps to detail service areas I think that's right on I think that's procedurally something that is a benefit I have a concern about the second half of item number 10 where if a jurisdiction that has a service area is reluctant or unable unable to serve another Jewish jurisdiction can come in and serve that that one seems to throw the supplemental powers clause right out the window unfortunately I know there are some local governments that might try to use utility service to thwart personal property rights that may try to deny utility service to stop a development for moving forward forced annexation is another issue that comes into play there forced annexation should not be necessary simply to receive a basic utility service or to deny utility service to stop development all of those things are unacceptable but I do think from a legislative standpoint I'm hoping this committee will continue to honor home rule and allow local government officials to do what local government governmental officials do and I'd be happy to answer any questions if anyone has any about this or any other topic any questions from the committee you're going to have to go a little bit louder for me yeah it's much better just a little clarification on the objection you have to another government providing say water and sewer utilities when the one that has it in their service area is unable to provide it I've been in situations where you know if it's in the same county and say the county government or the city cannot get it there without great expense but right around the corner in the service delivery area that city or that county government can get it to them yeah I absolutely agree with that okay and I think that's item number nine that there can be swaps of service area and swaps of territories without reopening the entire service delivery agreement and bringing every entity back to the table correct green partners can swap one of the challenges I've seen over the years with the multiple service delivery agreements that I've been involved with sometimes there are areas in rural parts of the state where utilities are not present we actually had a situation in South Hall County where there were some utilities particularly sewer service that was not available at the time we did those agreements the DCA at that point in time would not accept a map that didn't have the entire geographic area of the county assigned to a service provider so we actually did have jurisdictions that couldn't provide there but we were not allowed to put a gap in the map showing no service provider the entire map had to be divvied out to service providers one of the creative things that Hall County did years ago was put together partnership areas where there were areas that no utility was close by they put together a partnership area with a narrative that allowed different utilities to come in and partner or work independently to provide a service in an area that had a did not have a specifically defined service provider so there are creative ways with the current statute that local utilities can do that you're talking about within a county and its local municipal governments yes thank you very much I am said they'll or you can if you'd like to and one of the things I want to make sure everybody understands the as if y'all saw some of the emails back and forth the uh with what we sent out the end of last week me and chairman Lehuda had taught some of our partners and we came up with a kind of a starting foundation point for our discussion to where we might go for committee recommendations those are just discussion points and it's one of the things that you know I thought okay if you're we're gonna try to do this as a final meeting we're gonna need to spend a couple hours here just with our committee members just just to talk about where we want to go but I thought I had those some ideas on a piece paper that we could share with the committee members the and I'm glad to have anybody in the audience that wants to address that as we we move forward on our speakers today because it is one of the things that you know you got to start with a blank sheet of paper and move forward while I put a few dots on the paper to begin with so I hope everybody will keep that in mind as we move forward and next I'm gonna call on my friend Miss Angie Davis said they and I think I've known Angie she was actually a county attorney back when I was a county manager a long time ago the and I know she does a great job of representing all of her clients but she's here representing Barrack County and she's been been involved with the litigation the oneness all the way up to the state Supreme Court which is more recent they have it ruled on it so Miss Davis one of the things I do want to make sure that our committee understands I didn't put anything in there about the Supreme Court case said they and what was going on with it and the reason being is is because I I think that might be getting us into a little ahead of the court so if if you know you you'll let you give us some comments there may be some questions so thank you Miss Davis. Yes sir thank you Senator again Representative Lehood members of the committee very much appreciate the opportunity to be here as Frank said I'm Angela Davis and while I am proud to represent Chairman Graham and Barra County and I have handled the litigation before the Supreme Court I also have a unique perspective on these matters because our firm represents numerous cities and counties as well as development building airport and water and sewer authorities all across the state more than a hundred different legal entities and just this year alone so I'm hopeful that based upon that as well as the fact list SDS negotiations from South Georgia and North Georgia and all places in between that we have seen a lot in this area also we train and teach quite a lot on both sides of the aisles for cities and counties and local government issues so I'm hopeful that based upon all of this that I can be a useful resource to this committee and offer you some insight as you grapple with what's very difficult issues because I do believe we've seen and heard just about everything in the local government SDS arena in extending this invitation to speak Senator again did indeed request that we not address or seek to re-arguing the litigation that's pending before the Supreme Court and I could not agree more this matter was argued as you've heard last month before the Supreme Court and remains pending this case is a culmination of years of litigation that goes from the trial court ruling for the county on all of the issues in the county's favor to a court of appeals decision that upheld that decision for the county and then to the pending appeal in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court appeal itself has involved the filing of briefs by not only Barrow and Winder but also two cities on half of the city of Winder and 13 other counties in support of Barrow as well as of course violence by ACCG and GMA so we are thankful that out of respect for the time and investment of all these parties over all these years that the will of the co-chairs is that those issues be left in the discretion of the Supreme Court and not be a part of what this committee is doing here in this session for the legislature and I will confine my comments as requested and again we appreciate that because I think that's the the respectful way to proceed and a communication I received yesterday Chairman Corbert mentioned and urged the committee to address several substantive issues indeed some of those very issues are pending before the Supreme Court so we respectfully oppose that suggestion to address those issues before this legislative committee and I cannot and I will not respond to each of those out of respect for Senator against direction but if the committee does endeavor to address those substantive issues and go into those issues that are pending before the court we are hopeful that you would allow additional time for interested parties to comment on those substantive issues because we are concerned about some of those recommendations we believe there'll be addressed directly by the Supreme Court some of them are addressed directly by the drafters of the SCS act itself and their legislative committee report known as charting the course and or their unconstitutional as proposed so if there's going to be any delving into those subject matters irrespective of the direction we would ask for additional time because the schedule of having a completed report by the end of the month we believe would just be too hasty if getting into all of those substantive matters so again I will confine my comments and focus on the procedures and particularly focus on the 11 point overview that was provided by the co-chairs which we appreciate very much to have some substance and some some framework for our discussion but going just first off that framework I would like to offer a key recommendation similar to what the chairman mentioned with respect to suggestion that we have that we believe would be a procedural tweak that could have a very significant impact on negotiations around the state in my experience and I've had two of these cases now go to the Supreme Court the most contentious prolonged and expensive negotiations have been involved where there's been driven by one city opposed not only to the county but opposed to all the other cities in the community and this is possible because under OCGA 36 70 25 B the statute sets up what is an effective veto power for certain cities based upon how the statute defines the parties that are necessary to sign the SDS agreement so we believe paying attention to that portion of the statute alone to remove the ability of one city to have an effective veto power would be the most effective modification that could improve the SDS act this one very modest procedural revision would enhance the ability of all governments in a jurisdiction to be heard to reach agreement and ensure that other cities are not disenfranchised while this concept would need to be fully vetted and I trust the discretion of this committee to do that we have made some suggestions and the materials that I had placed at your seats today the black language this is that page four of the materials that you have for my office the black language is the current statute that provides and subparagraph B who the necessary parties for signature are and then in red we offer two options again these are suggestions for a starting point on this conversation option one would provide that if there is a holdout city that the other remaining parties if they all agree to the SDS strategy agreement that they could proceed without that holdout city and the holdout city then would be subject to sanctions until they decided to agree to the to the strategy another option would be to set some kind of population threshold based on municipal population so if there's a holdout city if there's an override by say a super majority maybe 65 percent I left that percentage number blank for consideration and debate but maybe it's 65 percent maybe it's 75 percent of the municipal population if that much of the municipal population is represented by cities who are in agreement with the SDS agreement that the county and everyone else agrees to except for one holdout city then again the parties could proceed so again it's just some options we would ask respectfully for you to consider because again the cases that I've seen and the two that went to the Supreme Court both of them involved one city that was in a disagreement with the other cities in the county as well as the county and if there was some mechanism to get around that veto then those cases wouldn't have gone forward to that point and to that extent so we believe that could be incredibly effective and it would also I think benefit counties and cities alike with with that is our key recommendation I'd also like to talk through some of our primary objections real quickly with the framework of the 11 point overview as chairman Grayam said I think generally what's in the 11 point overview is favorable and many of the things that are discussed there could be a real benefit to this process but there are few things that we'd like to point out that we may not necessarily be covered in the overview but we want to ensure that this committee doesn't branch off into those subject matters as I'm going to mention first we would oppose any kind of binding arbitration or even mandatory arbitration so at one point there was some conceptual discussions about a binding arbitration process and I think the whole goal here is you know how do we ensure that that communities will come to the table and negotiate in good faith and be motivated to get a deal done and some think penalty some think you know forced arbitration and there's a variety of ways maybe to get at that better negotiation process but a forced arbitration or mandatory binding arbitration our opinion would be unconstitutional it would take away the home will powers of the local governments to make these service delivery decisions themselves and would be given it to an arbitrator that has been struck and stricken in other cases as unconstitutional we believe it would be subject to court challenge as well and if we went with the binding arbitration provision we would just see ourselves in different litigation about a different topic so we don't think that would be useful or helpful we also think mandatory arbitration would likewise be undesirable and here's the reason I've heard many many people say that the goal of this committee and the goal of the interested parties is to ensure that this process is less expensive and preserves the relationships in the community because we see expensive time consuming prolonged and then everybody in the community ends up hating each other by the time these are over so if those are our goals we don't believe that mandatory arbitration is is something that should be included here because mediation is an opportunity to come together in a collaborative creative way to exchange ideas and make decisions arbitration is nothing short of a full bloom trial and even some of the drafts that we've seen it's an opportunity where there's an exchange of evidence there's documentary evidence presented there's testimony by party so the mayor is going to be on the stand the county's council is going to cross-examining them I promise you that's not going to do much to preserve relationships and it's going to be just as expensive as going to court and so we believe forcing parties to arbitrate would be a mistake if your goals are lessening expenses and preserving relationships instead we think that could be an option there's some communities that may know hey we need a little bit more and they may choose to do that that's

But I think otherwise it should be a choice between mediation or arbitration. Our second major objection would be with the involvement of DCA. With no disrespect at all to DCA, DCA has so many responsibilities and they cover so many vital local government functions. But the land dispute resolution process that requires DCA to maintain a list of arbitrators and to manage the strike selection process for seeding an arbitration panel. It's just not worked very well for anybody that's been involved and I've been involved with that for years. It doesn't work well in a lot of respects, not to the fault of DCA, but because maybe we can't get qualified arbitrators who'll sign up. Part of the reason for that is the fees are so small, people can't take a day off work or not willing to commit the time and energy to be trained and to understand the issues and to come and spend a day. And there's also been instances where DCA has not been flexible in ensuring the panel got seeded if one of the parties did not follow the rules. And so I think creating a process where DCA is the driver in terms of creating a panel of approved arbitrators and mediators would be a mistake. The notion of dispute resolution process has been part of law and litigation for decades, not centuries. Typically the parties will choose a mediator of their own or an arbitrator on their own and they set the parameters for how they'll proceed. This process should be no different. The parties are best suited to retain a mediator, an arbitrator who is experienced in the necessary field. If it's about roads, then you might want to have someone who has a particular expertise in roads. If it's heavily financial based, then you might want someone who with that kind of expertise. But the parties can decide those issues for themselves and we believe that would be best suited for them to do that. And then in doing so, the parties are buying into who they selected. And the arbitration process and the annexation context, you have a strike option, but you're otherwise forced into whomever is selected by DCA. And we would urge this committee not to go that route with any proposed revisions to the statute. Currently the parties select who they wish to mediate. And I think that's the best way to continue. If you do go with some kind of approved panel, we don't believe that current or former elected officials or staff are necessarily the best people to put on those panels. For a few reasons. For one, as you probably figured out by now, the legal issues are incredibly complex and complicated. And parties could benefit from a lawyer or I've used a former judge in several of my medias that has been very effective. Those folks are out there, senior judges are out there and can be utilized. Retired folks, retired attorneys or attorneys that have served as county or city attorneys throughout the state. They can bring a lot of information and a lot of expertise to bear. But when we depend on like an annexation context, it all being former city and county officials or staff members, then you're necessarily bringing people in who are going to come with a bias for how they have done things. Not necessarily a negative bias for one party or the other, but just the way they've done it. This is why we do it in our community, works fine for us, and all to work fine for you. But the whole thing about constitutional home rule and the whole thing about the SDS Act is the reference to flexible flame framework. It's supposed to be a decision made by the local officials who know their community best and a flexible framework where they can work together to come out with the best service results possible. And bringing people in who may say, well, we do it this way in my town, and that work fine for us. So you ought to do it that way too. We believe that would artificially result in some biases and perhaps not have the neutral impact that would have if we had a lawyer or a judge or a consultant or someone that's not, that has a more broad brush of potentially of experience. The last thing I want to note as a major objection with what's in the current 11 point plan is something that the chairman mentioned to, and that is item 10 with respect to the utility service issues. So agree wholeheartedly that requiring maps would be very useful. And in fact, DCA has kicked back SDS agreements for years now if there's not a map attached. But I think putting that in the statute would be good. And I think having that map be specific as to parcel would be very helpful because sometimes we've had the best of intentions with maps, but there's a line drawn down the middle of a parcel and then you have to figure that out. So parcel based mapping for territory would be I think very useful. And that's a great procedural suggestion. But then the automatic trigger concept of what happens if a party cannot provide the service. We believe that goes beyond procedure and that gets into making substantive decisions in this legislation which we believe that the committee was to be avoiding in this round of consideration. If the automatic trigger is there, so as it's written now it says if one party can't provide then another party who can can take that territory. If there's any kind of automatic trigger, again we would oppose it because that's a substantive issue. That's getting into the service decision. And for other reasons we believe that that could be a very dangerous result. We believe it could be like a gotcha grab a territory for any opportunistic county or city who might wish to enhance their territory areas. It would create sort of a free for all Wild West approach that could have a compounding effect as eager governments gobble up territory outside of an agreed upon service boundary. Remember these maps have been agreed upon in a contract. So to have any kind of statutory method that says automatically forget your agreement another party can do anything they want, I think that's incredibly dangerous not only from a legal perspective as breaching the contract but also in terms of the results that would occur. And to try to answer even Fuller Chairman Corbett's question about what would the harm be? One, the way the statute provision would have to be worded would be very difficult because as it said now what party does not have the capability? Well that's very vague. What does that mean? What does capability mean? What does be able to provide mean? When do they mean? Does it mean it has to provide it today or does it mean provided in six months when the customer needs the service? I think that could be abused in a lot of ways in terms of say, oh you can't do it right now? Okay then we're going to take your territory and run. And that's not consistent with the agreement. I agree with the chairman that I think it has the potential to undermine the supplemental powers clause which is built upon serving within your own jurisdiction or having an agreement if you allow someone else to serve. That should be the same thing here. We would urge this committee to not touch this at all. If you want aspirational language about communities working together that's fine but this is not an issue that needs fixing. Responsible government to do this every day. As the chairman mentioned there's landswops. You can't provide that or your line won't be there for six months. They work with the customers. They determine when the service needs to come online. And many times that provider may not be able to provide the service that day that they've been asked by customer but that customer may not need that service for a year. So they give them a certification letter and they have that line expanded or extended and then they're ready to provide the service. But under this kind of a potential automatic trigger that kind of thing could be unwound and unravel and not be permitted. So again in terms of a flexible framework which the statute requires. Okay. Let me ask you a question. I agree with your saying there because there does need to be some negotiation between the counties in the cities. For example, in one county I know they say if you cannot provide the service you have to give a letter to the person. If you can't give within one year or two years then they have the ability to take it. And so for that reason I agree with you. There's not enough detail here to say you can just take that position. Question would be this should this maybe add a comment that a service delivery agreement should provide a direction for when a government cannot or will not provide that. Should that maybe be part of this legislation to include that they will cover that in the service delivery. So it's not left and open in. Yes and I understand your question and I think that's a really fair question. And I think as the chairman mentioned left alone with this flexible framework which the SES act has purported to be and I think is Paul County came up with a very creative solution just like that. They provided for how they would have these partnership areas of their territory and they provided that in their SES agreement. So I think absolutely governments could do that. But you know over the course of ten years things change and so that's a challenge as well. I think it's much better not to try to legislate this. This is the kind of cooperation that needs to happen and does happen already organically. So I think it would be better if in the legislation not to touch it. If you want to offer some aspirational language that the party should consider what would occur if in fact service could not be provided. But I don't think it should be a mandate and most importantly I don't think it should be an automatic trigger. I think it has to be based on agreement of the parties that the parties can agree because in SES there's so many services. I mean I think like in the Barrow County Winder there's probably what 58 services or so. I mean a lot of services that we're talking about and you can't just carve one out and say okay we're going to now say a whoops you're out of your territory and then unwind that because that could have been a part of the negotiation for some of the other 48 services. So I think you have to leave it to the agreement of the parties. And I see Senator again has happened his watch so I will stop with that. You have some comments and the materials I gave you as to each of the individual 11 point items. I apologize if I ever stayed my welcome but I thank you for the opportunity and happy to answer questions now or later as your time allows. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms. Davis. One of the things that for me this is like going down a list of friends here. Next speaker I'd like to call on is my friend David Maynard who's the mayor of the city of Winder. The mayor may or may or if you would come come forward and if you want to bring your counsel with you however you want to tag team it. I'll let you all do the same as chairman Graham and counsel or however you want to make that work. I guess I'll come by myself. May I pass something out to you? Please. I'll just hand it to me. I'll pass it out for you. I don't remember members of the committee. I appreciate it. I talked to you. I'm David Maynard. I'm the mayor of Winder closing in on 12 years and before that I was on the council for four years. But I've lived in Winder all my life and I love the town. I love my county. And it tears me up to see the struggles we've had. Contrary to what we've heard, Winder has negotiated in good faith. In fact, we've settled 39 out of 41 services. Only two that remain are roads which is common across the state I believe. And then water service territory and water rates. You know, our lack of coming to an agreement. And I'm not sure it's a failure on the SDS Act. And I believe in Act. I like the intent of it. I like the no double taxation and no duplication of services. But I'm facing both of those in our struggle. And so instead of a failure in Act, maybe it is a failure in the local leadership. Of course, I don't want to believe it's me. But I assume we'll be out of the picture in the past case and it'll solve itself. One, one, and I'm a layman. I'm not an attorney like some of you guys. But I thought about SDS for a lot of years now. And I think about it a lot. I wake up thinking about it. One change in Senator again and about I talked about this, I think might would be helpful. When it comes to utilities that cost so much to develop a utility system to permit it, to finance it. And they are specific to territories and to areas. I think once a utility territory map is agreed on, I think that maps would stand. I think it should survive an SDS negotiation until it's changed. I think those territories ought to be fixed. I mean, and I thought we had those in water. Oh, and as far as one of my issues or water rates I talked about, I think that comes out. I think it has real good method of resolving water rate issues. It's just the lower courts decided not to use that. They want to go a different way. So I think that part's good. The I had one more point. I can't read. I'm about to have wind up here. Oh, one place and one dispute we had to settle, one service area is ambulance. And I think this is a case where the act worked. We county provides ambulance countywide, but they wouldn't provide one in the city, which we felt desperately we needed. But through a process in SDS, we negotiated and we have an ambulance in the wine or so. I think that works to that degree. Senator, tell me not to do a long presentation. So I'm not, but I'll be glad to answer any questions if you can. Are there any questions? Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate what you're trying to do up here. Well, yeah, it's a, Yomist has. I'm going to call on another good friend that comes to pick next and a former colleague, Andy Wells, who's represented the city of Wander in that same Supreme Court case. And Andy, if you don't mind, come forward. And let's hear a different point of view. You know, Mr. Chairman, I don't know that I'm going to have a whole bunch of different points of view on this. Gentlemen, some of you know me, some of you, meet me for the first time today, but I served in the General Assembly for 10 years from 2011 through COVID. Let me tell you, this legislation, the SDS Act, which was enacted in 1997, has worked really well for three decades. It has some problems with it that you've heard about today you've been hearing about. And so I think there's room to address it and improve it. But one of the things that when I get hired by a community to negotiate SDS agreements, the first thing that I tell the mayors that hire me, or it could be commissioners, because I represent three different counties as well. I had gone through those SDS negotiations on behalf of counties. And when I do that, I tell the leaders that the bottom line, the SDS Act, that's intended for leaders, to be leaders of their communities. The involvement of attorneys and consultants is helpful to an extent. It is also problematic. And I'll get into some recommended changes to the Act, but sometimes more process is not helpful. I think you heard Miss Davis go through a detailed explanation of different recommendations that you're looking at. But let me tell you, every time that I've gotten involved in these kind of disputes with this local auction sales tax or SDS or any other number, things that even use audience spots, the more process you build into it inevitably puts people into positions. They start to fall back in these positions and then they become reluctant to change them. So I would caution against adding more process. I think that the existing process could be streamlined. And I think you should go to a time clock. I think you need to set specific time frames, whether it's three months, six months, but you need time frames and you need the sanctions to be in effect. I'll tell you some interesting story. When I started doing some of these cases, the judges would just take the sanctions off. Sanctions go in automatically under the statute and some of the judges would just, okay, I'll sign an order that says the sanctions come off. And then what do you have? You have Fulton County where you have no SDS agreement for decades. Well, that's not helping the taxpayers. In the whole point of SDS, the general assembly put together was to provide for a protection against taxpayers paying twice on taxes, subsidizing services they don't receive. It's a very fiscally conservative piece of legislation. It helps your local taxpayers. It doesn't help your local taxpayers when it gets into prolonged litigation or those sanctions are imposed that force a decision. And when those sanctions are held in advance, you get a dragout. And I'm not here speaking on behalf of Winder. I'm sort of wearing my old hat, what I told Chairman was that when he asked me to come, because I had no intentions of coming, but when he asked me to come, I said, well, Senator if you don't mind, I'm just going to speak my mind. And I'm probably going to be wearing my legislators hat, former legislators hat rather than representing any one group. I'm not here on behalf of ACCG or GMA or Winder. I'm really here to talk to you because you're struggling with legislation. And it's hard. It's hard work. Lots of information. So I thought, how can I be helpful in that regard? Because that's the objective of the committee. And so my thought process went to, look, I think sanctions need to be imposed. I think there needs to be a time frame in which, after a certain point in time from when it's kicked off, a set of sanctions goes into effect. Now I think you ought to do a piecemeal, not all at once. Maybe you do financial, as Chair Graham mentioned. Maybe you go to the pocketbook. If you go to permitting, permitting can really have a negative impact on the individual property owners that need those permits, businesses, industry that's moving in. So maybe that one kind of falls off a little bit later. That's it poses a later date if you don't get an agreement by accident. So let's say six months, no agreement. All funding that is managed by the state is just frozen. I'm not saying taken away permanently, just frozen. The tap stops. Just throw the tap off. No more money. Okay. Let's see how that works for you. That's probably going to put people back together at the table. If you do six months later, that's not resolved, then you turn off the permits. Not saying that's what it should be. I'm just giving you just an example. And then we're facing those realities of money being cut off and then permits being cut off. It gives you two sets of windows to negotiate. It readjusts and forces people to recalibrate. So I think the sanctions is the most meaningful tool. And the cases that I've been involved in and I've negotiated about just under 40 service delivery strategies. All of them being decided in mediation or early negotiations. Only three I think maybe four have gone to court. Actually only four have gone to court. Only three have resulted in a hearing. So in my experience, it's 10%. So it's not really that big of a problem, but when it is a problem, it's a severe problem. Putting the sanctions in place helps to force that problem to go away on its own by leaders, being leaders. And in two of those cases, the judges figured this out. And what they did was they did exactly what I've suggested you do now. They put a time clock on us. They said, you know what guys, I'll let the sanctions while you do mediation. If you haven't solved this problem by ex-date, finish your mediation, and I've gotten a report back, then sanctions go back in place. So even the judges started to figure out that their best tool in the statute was the sanctions. I think that is the best tool you've got. So I would urge you to look at that part of it. You know, this legislation allows local control. It allows each and every chairman who's here today and mayor here today to discuss those issues and resolve the issues, based upon what those issues are to the community. And they vary from community to community, whether it's ambulance, roads, EMS, dispatch, the services are, you know, as Miss Davis says, there can be 50 plus more services, depending on how much you break it down. So I would urge you to allow that local control to remain, allow local leaders to be local leaders. I had a mayor called me and he said, come in here, I wanted to go, I want you to be part of our negotiations and help us through mediation. We go into mediation, we're doing the negotiations back and forth. He says, Andy hold on just a second, you stay right here. And he steps out and walks over to the chairwoman and they go into another room and they come out and they say, hey Andy, I got this idea. Why don't we trade a little bit of that loss money that we get to the county and they'll do this and we'll do that. And what do you think about that? I said, are you good with it? He said, yes sir, is it legal? I said, I think it is. He said, all right. They went back in. We were done in an hour after we drafted up the documents, send it out, done it. Leaders being leaders. We had somewhere in the south, south of South Georgia, one of the commissioners and the mayor stepped off, talked about it, figured out what they could resolve, went back in, sold it to their commissioners and council members, it was done. I had another one where I asked the mediator to instruct the group that no lawyers be allowed in the negotiation room, all lawyers step back and step out and that settled too. Look, I'm happy to be a practicing lawyer and to do the job that I'm supposed to do. But this isn't helpful to communities when they're paying lawyers the money that ought to be exchanged to get a deal done. Period. That's not what this statute is intended to do. Now I do think you need to keep an ultimate decision making authority in the Superior Court. I think those provisions are helpful. They've been upheld as constitutional. I don't think you should change that because there may be situations where there is a real legal issue that is blocking it. That's the case in the Winder Barrow case, a real legal question that has to be answered. That should still be there. It needs to be that stop-gap measure. If you put the sanctions in place and you put people in a shot clot, then you're actually going to help the leaders work that out and negotiate that out earlier and not require the courts, except when there's very extreme circumstances. I don't come to you telling you that I thought of these ideas recently. I'll share with you this that in 2013, I'd only been serving for two on my third session and actually drafted legislation to do a lot of what I'm talking about here today. I'm not coming to you as someone who's been trying to make a living of practice and law under SDS. I actually try to put the sanctions in place, make them hard, make them financial, put triggers involved. That was Senate, that was House Bill 855. You can go back to the 1314 session and pull up House Bill 855. I don't think it was the perfect piece of legislation. I only think it was the best I had all the best ideas. One thing it did do is it made those sanctions come into play and stick and the judge could not remove them. I think that's an important point of that legislation that would work well here. When you go back and look, you may find that legislation also touched up other parts of the bill that probably need to be tweaked and addressed. You might look at that legislation as something helpful in terms of guidance. I think you will improve upon that and make better legislation than what I was trying to draft then because even with the experience that I've had over the last decade, there are other issues that can be resolved in the act that should probably be addressed. But I would recommend that to you as someone who looked at it before and solved the same problem happening. Last point I'll make for you is that this issue of veto power and timing of the process, ACCG I think it made a really good point at the last meeting and GMA along with them both jointly, that process needed to have a definitive timeframe to resolve itself in 10 years seemed to be a good timeframe. The legislation that I proposed in 13 actually set that required that a renegotiations occur on the third year after the decennial census. That's the year after lost. So you negotiate lost out. Now you know what your funding is. Now you know your money. Then you turn around and you negotiate out your SDS and services. That was an idea but I think the 10 year idea is good. But if the parties want to do a shorter term, a shorter refusal on that, they need to. I think it's also a good idea that those service areas that the agreements themselves, they remain in effect unless the parties have said this is a date that terminates or that 10 year window comes along. I think there's a lot of wisdom in what GMA and ACCG were proposing on that 10 year cycle. I don't think it needs to be tied to lost. I think it needs to be around that 10 year window because it makes some sense relative to lost. The last thing I'll just say to you all is that it's this concept of vetoing. This is a contract. That's the nature of it is the result is a short, concise agreement between the parties where they agree on all aspects of services, how they're going to be delivered, how they are going to be paid for, where they're going to be delivered. And in order for them to have the contract, you've got to have all parties sign an off of it. So I think it's important to look at how maybe sanctions are put into place relative to people who want to be absent from the process. They're a little small city. They don't need to be involved with it. They're good with however it works out. Maybe they are willing to consent with another city or county to let them represent them in the negotiations. That might be a process that would work. But you can't deal with veto issues if you also deal with the veto issue that exists in local options, sales tax. So if you do pull these things together, the House and the Senate needs to resolve the veto problem in local options, sales tax, where if a county doesn't want to sign off on the agreement or a city doesn't want to sign off on the agreement, the tax expires. And that's a serious problem for all local governments financially. And I think that adversely impacts them in their discussions on how to pay for and provide these services on the service delivery act. Happy to take any questions you may have. Any question from the committee? Andy, I really appreciate you here. Testimony day. And I think there's a lot of things that we can talk about. This is where this afternoon, our goal is to come up with those recommendations that can make it work.

Thank you very much. Senator, Chairman, thank you very much. Yeah. Jennifer. I'm so impressed. Yeah. That's the true task of a good city manager. Yeah. Well, while she's doing that, I'm going to take a four minute break. I do want to pick up the pace a little bit. My goal was to try to get our speakers through in the first hour. Looks like if we can get an hour and a half, we're going to take a four minute break. That means you got time enough to run to the bathroom and run back. But hold that thought. Thank you. You Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your announcer. Thank you all so much for coming back to order. Next speaker on our agenda is Mark Beatty, the director of planning for the Northeast Regional Commission. Good to have you here, Mark. Thanks for inviting me. I'm going to invite you guys to my next public hearing so I can get a good turn out of y'all. Thanks again for having me. Regional commissions are glad to be a part of the discussion. We're servers delivery providers ourselves and it's all a member of the local government. Again, thank you. Everybody behind me, you're welcome. I gave you something to look at today while we go through this. I'll try to be pretty short and sweet. I know you guys have a lot to consider. This is a very nuanced discussion with a lot of pieces to it. The portion that I'm going to be talking about is just a very small piece of that puzzle regarding the mapping. So there are a couple of people before me have already spoken to this a little bit. I will probably reiterate some of the points that they said. But yeah, I believe you guys have these slides. So we're just going to go through it and I don't have a quicker say I'll just let you know whenever to change next slides. These first couple, I'm just going to give you all some context on the three pieces that are part of my discussion. One, be in the regional commissions and their role in service delivery strategies and mapping and the submission to these strategies. The second being the service delivery act itself and then the third being what GIS is. So I was told come to this assuming that you guys had not used GIS or as your products before. So if I'm a little bit part down please excuse me. But just to give you all some context on regional commissions, I'm sure you guys are already familiar with what we are. But if you're not, here's a map of all the regional commissions in Georgia. Georgia Association of Regional Commissions is the organization that collectively binds us together. And we are part of the state service delivery system as it says. We help with regional planning, local planning, aging services, basically overall just workforce development. Our overall goal is to provide technical resources to our local governments. We end up working a lot with smaller local governments or more rural areas just because they don't have the staff capacity to do so. So we are a way to kind of give them collective, collective purchasing power. So we have full time staff that can help them. We work with local, state and federal partners for all the work that we do. And yeah, there's quite a lot that falls under the umbrella. Next slide please. So just to give you some context, y'all are in our region, which I assume is why we were asked to come and speak with you. So we appreciate that inclusion there. Brousel Center is at Northern tip of Barrow County. We have a 12 county service area at the Northeast Georgia Regional Commission. And I've got a couple of slides there. I've highlighted in green the points that are specific to the topic that we're discussing today. So the planning and government services division, which is my division, is the main one that's applicable to STS strategy. Submission to DCA and assistance to local governments. And we work with our two other area agency on Aging and Workforce Development. Next slide please. So just in case, let me get a raise a hand for you guys. Have y'all ever spent your entire day staring without blinking at a map in Ezri Art Pro? Y'all ever done that? It's easy to do. It's one of those programs that can suck up your entire day. It takes a lot of work, a lot of technical expertise. Just to give you all a definition of what it is and why it's important. It's a spatial system, geographical information systems. It's a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps out all data points that you're wanting to show on a map. Having that bird's eye view is very important and useful whenever you're making decisions on what types of services you want to offer. But also how to maintain and expand those systems. GIS is a very important tool. It's a very ubiquitous in the planning field. You kind of can't get around using it in one way or the other. And so again, in green there, the benefits for GIS is it improves your communication, improves your efficiency, and offering the services. And it works to give you a better management decision making tool, which is extremely important in SDS negotiations. Next slide please. So this is straight from DCA's website right here, the intent of this act, which I'm sure you guys are very familiar with, is to provide a flexible framework for local governments and authorities to agree on service delivery. There in the middle, very important for mapping is to minimize any duplication or competition among local governments and authorities in providing local services. So imagine if you didn't have a map shown where you're providing water and sewer services. And everyone was just relying on their interpretation on ground level to negotiate. That would probably be pretty problematic. So mapping is very important in that part of things. And then lastly, the intent of this act is to provide a method of resolving disputes, which you guys have heard from the attorneys about. I won't get into that one now. That one's beyond me. Next slide please. So if y'all haven't ever gotten into the nitty gritty of a SDS agreement, you've got three parts to it. You've got form one that kind of provides an overview of all the services that are provided by this local government. And any outlines, any changes to their services from the previous agreement. Form two is a summary of the service arrangement per service that they offer. So water gets one form two. So sewer gets another form two, so on so forth. And then it is most of the time. I know Angie pointed out that DCA has kicked back some service delivery agreements for not including a map. But there are maps are not tied to every form two. So most of the time they are tied to water and sewer, 9-1-1, or EMS delivery. But they're not included for all of them. I don't believe that is a rule, obviously. Next slide. So I wanted to give you guys something to look at so that you could see the variety of maps that you get in service delivery strategies across the state. So I've got a couple of slides here. And I'll just kind of go through really quick not to point out that these are good maps or bad maps because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I just want to point out the differences and show how those differences can play out and happen a conversation. So you see that first one there on the left that's Morgan County. Most of these maps I'm going to show you are in Northeast Georgia's centric. That's a pretty decent map. It's got roads. It doesn't have road names. But it's got roads, roads layer there. It doesn't have parcels. And this is for land use planning services through the local government. But it at least shows the boundaries or the municipalities of whose responsibility it is to provide land use planning services. So very clearly the city of Madison provides their own Morgan County provides it for the county, unincorporated county and three other cities. There's three other cities are kind of hard to see but they're tucked in there. And then you've got the JDA providing services in their little corner on the west over there. So it's pretty clear. Could be improved on. Doesn't have road names like I said. Doesn't have parcel lines. But pretty decent map overall. It's got the components. It's got a legend. You know, like, you know, with the symbology means. That one on the right is a little bit different. Could be better. That one's got road names and like that one on the left. But it is very pixelated. You know, if you're getting into how to discern where that is or what that means. You can't really get a lot of information from that map because it's not readable. The only person that's going to be able to read that is the engineer who created it and has a giant 38 by 40 or 48 by 36. Hard copy print in his office. So could lead to some could lead to some confusion. Why they're what? I'm getting there. I'll get there. Yeah. And so yeah, so that's what that's kind of what I'm that's kind of what I'm getting there is that there's no standard. There's no standard standardization for the types of maps that get created in service delivery. It's kind of up to the local government. Oh yeah, you're fine. And so, you know, that can lead to confusion. Like Angie pointed out about parcel lines that one on the right for Jasper County. It's very clearly not based on parcel lines there with the city of Monticello's water service area. So whenever you get into a dispute potentially in the future. And you've got a parcel that's split in half. You know, GIS has an accuracy of about 30 feet. Give it a give it a take. You know, so there's a little there's a little bit of a gray area in there. So it's really good to be parcel based whenever you're whenever you create these. Next slide. Here's a couple more showing good and bad traits. The one on the left is Gwinnett County. There's 911 emergency call service. It doesn't have parcel lines, but you can kind of infer that, you know, 911 emergency call service is offered by swanney Duluth. Norcross Lawrenceville and snowville just by that hatch pattern. And that the county takes care of the rest. But again, you're having to kind of infer that from this. It's not necessarily clearly, clearly discernible because you know, I have parcel lines to kind of show that. So it's good for local government negotiations. It's also good for the public. If there's anyone from the public who are referred to these maps, maybe it would be kind of difficult for them to read it. It also doesn't show one of the one of the better ways that parcel lines would have worked in here is for the city of Auburn and. Resthaven there where they cross county boundaries and Brazlton to or the cross county boundaries. If someone from the public were wanting to see which 911 emergency call service applies to their parcel, it'd be kind of difficult to tell from this map. The one on the right is a little bit better. It doesn't have parcel lines, but you can see that the boundaries are based on parcels. It has road names. It has call outs telling you where the city limits are and what that green green line is, a sewer service area map. So that one's pretty clear. I feel like you know with with some time taking a look at it, you could really discern, you know, very clearly what that boundary is and can lead to quicker, quicker negotiations because you know very clearly what you're looking at. Next slide. Here's one that's a little bit more difficult. This is actually a screenshot that someone took for where they had a good idea. They pulled in their layers into an online map system on Google Earth so that you could zoom in and zoom out and see where these electric electric, electric transmission territories are. So on an online platform, that would really work. Looking at it right here, it's pretty difficult. So it could be better. Next slide. And this, I'm going to give a shout out to Joel Logan. He's the GIS manager for Jackson County. He is very good at his job and this is a very good map. Now I wanted to give him some, give him some praise for it. A very clear map again. Doesn't have parcel lines though, but it very clearly states with that call out there. And with that green symbology, where the city limits for Braselton is and where there's a county maintained roadway within the city of Braselton. So unarguable map. Jackson County provided six maps just with their road maintenance showing those exact things where they were these nuanced roads that the county was maintaining within the local government. So very clear, good messaging through their agreement. Next slide. So the implications of a bad map and these are kind of worst case scenarios here, unclear service boundaries. If you don't have a clear map shown where service boundaries is, then that could lead to confusion from the providers and to the public at those boundary parcels. And who knows, maybe it could lead to an argument or dispute in the service delivery agreement. There are no way to track any metrics to see if that's ever been the case, but it's a possibility. And then complications during staff turnover, I've had situations where I've worked with local governments, or maybe one person truly knows the extent of the service delivery of a service that they're providing. And that, you know, if you don't have a map that's showing showing where that is, then that could lead to complications during staff turnover and having a transferable knowledge base. And then it could lead to duplication of services. If you don't have a clear boundary that's clearly shown and agreed upon, then hey, you could have a duplication of services. And that's going against the intent of the SDS Act. So next slide. All right. So do you guys have to be quick. So final remarks here. I just want to make sure you guys are clear on the role of what original commission takes on in the SDS updates. We provide per our DCA contract, provide GIS assistance upon requests, emphasis on upon requests for SDS mapping. It's kind of up to the discretion of each regional commission on how involved they get in that process and if they are a piece of that puzzle. And whether or not they charge a fee for that service. And then also we assist with per our contract requirements. We assist with the submission of the SDS agreements to DCA and make sure that that state tracking on SharePoint is maintained with them. So if I had any recommendations for you, leave in today. It would be to if you suggest any changes, whether they be legislative changes or procedural changes. Make sure you discuss that with DCA. They're the ones that are charged with the responsibility of overseeing this act. So it'd be important to have them at the table. There's a potential for statewide mapping standards like you had indicated in your question. And there would be a potential to expand the use of online maps. That would give the public and the local governments the ability to zoom in and out on the extent and really get a granular review of the extent of what their services are. And really just help with the discussion. It's essentially just supposed to be a tool. Those two things could essentially make the tool better. So I'll give a shout out to Susan Miller. She's the state geo geospatial information officer with DCA. I think she'd be a great person to have in the conversation. All right. Take on any questions. Anybody has any? Are there any questions from the committee? Mark, I want to thank you for your presentation. I also want to give a shout out to Bart Walker. Bark is the executive director for the Northeast Regional Commission. And glad to have you here. Mark said great job on the presentation. The next I'm going to call on March. Where's Mark? You know, it's kind of interesting. The service delivery act. Kind of kind of mutes the private water systems or private utilities in the state. But at the same token, the I had dinner last night said the bear. With with Mr. Smith here in in Browseville, and I didn't realize when when I met him a few years back the extent of his service. And what he does in providing water to 33,000 homes. 31,000 homes here in Georgia. So Mr. Smith, the floor is yours. Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity for water utility management to submit testimony to the joint committee here today. I've given you all a handout. I believe you have information on our company and a copy of my testimony. So water utility management has been designing, permitting, constructing, operating and acquiring private water and wastewater system since 1970. We presently operate over 200 systems with over 400 wells serving 31,000 households in 17 different counties in southeast and South Central Georgia. We're the largest private water company in the state of Georgia. We respond 24 hours, seven days a week in our service areas. We have robust inventory of spare parts and pumps and motors and stock. And we're proving to be very capable and reliable because of our performance and track record. EPD has granted us delegated authority where the only private water company in the state of Georgia that's attained that level of certification. So under delegated authority means we're regulated by the EPD in the same manner as a medium to large municipality. This delegated authority requires us to have approved plans and specifications for all expansions and construction on file with the EPD and allows us to expand our systems with pre approval from EPD. Our engineer of record then submits a report at the end of the year detailing our expansions under the same regulations as a medium sized municipality. We hope that the committee members will recognize that there are significant water and wastewater services delivered to hardworking Georgians by private companies throughout the state. In Canterbury County, our company has a franchise agreement to provide water and wastewater services for a portion of the county. This is at I-26 and I-95 of its design to serve about 2000 homes. This relieves the county of the burden of infrastructure investment and operational responsibilities. We're discussing this same arrangement with many other counties. It should be noticed that the service noted that the service delivery act does not recognize vital roles that private companies play in service delivery. South East and South Georgia is blessed to have the Floridian aquifer as its primary source of water. There's a map attached to the testimony. South, this is one result of this abundant resource is that prior to 1997, most counties did not have to develop costly county-wide service delivery systems in this region of the state and provide water from a central plant. Because the technology is relatively simple and inexpensive to drill a well growth occurred without county-wide water systems. During the first 150 years of industrialization, South Georgia seemed to be limitless. However, in the 1980s, salt water intrusion became a problem in the area of Hilton Head and South Carolina threatened to sue Georgia for over pumping the aquifer. The first Floridian aquifer moratorium was established in 1997 for Chatham-Brown Liberty in the southern half of Effingham County. Over the time, the operators in Chatham County in collaboration with the EPD and some of the major industries and actually every permit holder has undergone a 19% reduction in our permitted capacity. And we've reduced the pumping in Chatham County from 93 million gallons a day to 52 million gallons a day in 2022. That's a 57% reduction in pumping of the groundwater. Effingham County's Permidic capacity has shrunk at least 30% during that same period. During this time, we continue to build systems in our area permitted by EPD with our permitted water sources. Over the years, we've connected systems together and were required to convert from drinking water permits to groundwater permits. Today, we continue to consolidate our operations and our permits. A drinking water permit covers systems pumping under 100,000 gallons a day and sets a specific number of taps that can be allowed by the permit. When water exceeds 100,000 gallons a day, the system is required to have a groundwater permit. With permission from EPD, we have moved water capacity from county to county, from permit to permit to construct systems. We've also accepted groundwater permitted capacity from the city of Fort Wentworth in exchange for the sale of a water wastewater system. The water capacity was then allocated to new neighborhoods, housing developments mostly in Effingham County. As a result of Permint Consolidations, we now have 1.2 million gallons of groundwater capacity in the restricted red and yellow zones, which are Chatham, Brian, Effingham and Liberty counties. This is enough for about 4,600 homes. Despite the critical need for water capacity to serve much needed housing, we face significant problems being able to utilize these permits. The existing service delivery strategy agreements between city and county government should not provide a wind of opportunity for private water providers. We are asking for a level playing field to deploy this permitted capacity. We request the right to expand our existing systems. I think this could be really ameliorated in some extent, but if you would just put the private systems on the map in so that it becomes part of the service delivery, which is in effect what is happening, we are providing the service, but we're just not included in the service delivery areas. That would go a long way toward defining this issue. In one situation, I control land next to an existing subdivision, and would like to add 65 lots to the subdivision and have it served by our water system, but I'm not sure it's going to be allowed into the service delivery strategy. Please note our area is experiencing a severe housing crunch. We have 20,000 manufacturing jobs headed our way in the next 18 months, and we have got to do something for housing. Our company can deliver water service quickly by drilling a permitted well as opposed to waiting for central infrastructure to arrive. We are currently under a zoning war at William and Northern Brian County, while the county determines their water and sewer infrastructure needs through a land use plan that's still under development. The cost and timing to develop this.

system is unknown and will rely on water coming from new wells developed in Bullock County. Presently, Chadham, Epi-Hem, Brian and Liberty counties do not have any significant available Florida and aquifer ground water capacity. Chadham County sold their water systems to us in 2016 and Brian is drilling multiple wells in Bullock for service to the Hyundai plant. Epi-Hem purchases water from the City of Savannah's I&D plant and Liberty County is trying to develop a system using the My Scene Aquifer which is considered by some to be not as robust as the Floridian. All these solutions involve running miles of pipe building pumping stations that significant expense for the citizens of these jurisdictions. Cities and counties are asking for significant loans from GEPA grants from the state or ARPA money to underwrite these expansions. These expensive systems are then proposed to require to charge a large cost recovery or TAP fees and consumption fees for the cost recovery. And there's also a lot of debt involved. Our company can deliver services more cost effectively more quickly than a central public system. We pass these savings on to the developers and the new homeowners. We request that we be allowed to serve areas in the coastal zone if the respective county cannot provide the service within one year. Specifically we're asking that the service delivery statute be amended to provide for statutory ability to be able to expand services in the underserved areas of a county by a private water system or municipal provider. Some municipalities may be interested in this operational flexibility and with this new tool and opportunity we're prepared to begin to deploy the flexible permit capacity we hold to meet the demand for affordable housing we're seeing from rapid industrial growth. Thank you for your time and I'm happy to entertain questions. Are there any questions from the committee? I don't know if anybody else has the significant rights that's in the business. At the end of the day in that region we're going to need every every down the water we can find and at the end of the day none of the counties have the permitted ability today to provide for the growth that is imminent. My big concern is we've got one county having to go to another county to drill wells to pump water back. If you see that in any other area? Yes it's happening in the Town of Rice borough in Liberty County has drilled wells over in McIntosh County and they're pumping water back from McIntosh County into Liberty County. The Town of Hinesville is entered into an agreement with Long County to do the same thing. Doesn't that then argue for a some kind of a joint multi-county approach toward water and sewer management? I would think so and I think the other these these well the EPD's taking a hard look at these wells because ultimately I think they I mean I won't speak for EPD but they're looking at granting permits for the Hyundai plant that would have a sunset on it and then eventually the water would have to come from an expanded IED plant of the city of Savannah and run treated Savannah River water up to serve the Hyundai plant so it could be that these permits are a temporary, well I say temporary maybe as much 20 years but a stopgap method on the way to a surface water plant. I mean there's we've done a lot of work we've all suffered a lot of permit reductions and by producing them in the Savannah IED plant produced 55 min gallons a day it's near capacity but we we have dramatically affected the salt water intrusion issue in South Carolina much to the to the benefit. The used to tell us five years ago that salt water would be in Georgia in 125 years and now they're saying well it's probably going to be over 200 years now so that's that's the result of all the conservation efforts. Going the right direction. Hey uh chairman doctor you have a question? Yes, Mr. Chairman if you don't mind so I think you summed it up when you said you're a unicorn. When you when you look at this as Senator Burns suggested this is something that I've never even really thought about that you're providing that service to so many different customers so should there be a threshold if you're if you're doing this as a private company should there be a threshold that's included in SDS if you service X number then you're required to provide that that map that service map to the local government so that it could be used for planning and if so then is there an appropriate size for a utility company if you're a certain size should you provide that and I think you could probably go beyond water with other services as well um and then I've got I've got one more point that I think we need to ponder and I can only pull on my experiences I know we had a private sewer facility that served the portion of our county and if that private company were to fail then that that responsibility to provide that sewer service fell back on our authority to do so so with you serving so many homes and I'm sure your company is prosperous and prosperous and will continue to do so but is there any kind of agreement in place should you fail to meet your requirements to provide this service that would fall back on a local government entity sure that you have that's a great question back in the sixties I believe it was or early seventies the state came out with a plan they required a trust indenture for every water and wastewater system and they were in place for about 45 years and they never had to call on the trust e to to do that so it was a it was a you know a protection but it was never called upon I don't know the exact status of the trust I don't think trust indentures are required for water or sewer anymore but um but in any event that's what was in place but now it was never utilized so they finally removed the restriction because it was actually very uh cumbersome on the on the deeds and titles to all the assets is why they removed the requirement Mr. Smith since I believe in and local control right here in front of you one of the things that for me I know we don't spell out private utilities in the service area but if if you had each of the local governments that you serve in to basically put you in there their plan from from the jurisdiction that you're in would not not serve the same effect of what you're trying to do the so that you know they're saying hey we've relegated this area to xyz water company or or something along those lines that that's what I'm advocating I mean there's certain areas throughout our entire service area that I just know there's not going to be any municipal these are some of these are islands in Chatham County there's not going to be any municipal service and the county's already exited the water and wastewater delivery business so they might as well uh designate that particular Burnside Island as as a being served by a private company I mean we would just like to be on the map okay thank you Ch거거 there's no restriction just to provide that for you. And we just need to say that what you need is that. And you. No, I'm thinking what that means, is that the amount of oil. No, no, no. In fact, we welcome those contracts. And what about the amount of oil you have? There's better. There's much better. And so rather than providing a requirement and service delivery that mentions the private systems, it just seems like including the mapping would be the main portion that we need to do as a committee so that there's good government to know who the private providers are. So they can go to you if they have an opportunity for growth and say, hey, it's going to cost us 12 million. You can drill a well right there for me and a half. Right. I think we need to leave it. My opinion of the local governments. We got you. Mr. Smith, I want to thank you for your comments and your time today. I enjoyed learning a little bit more about your business. Thank you so much and thank you for dinner last night. Really appreciate that. Of course. Look, if I look down my agenda, and I come over here to, this is this dog and pony show from our friends at ACCG and GMA. And I'm going to call them both of them at the same time because they, they, uh, uh, Clint Mueller with ACCG and Jim Thornton with GMA. And I've tried to remind them that we're supposed to be done with the presentations at two and they're 44 minutes behind. So I just are also late. Thank you, Chairman Ginn. Thank you, Chairman LeHood. We hear you loud and clear. We will be extremely brief because I know you want to get into your discussion. Really, the only thing I think Jim and I wanted to do is really just give you a quick update on the status of our joint task forces that's been working on this issue as well as local option sales tax. And then as far as what's in your materials before you, we're not going to comment on any of those. We'll be available though as you all discuss this. If you have any questions for us, we'd be happy to answer any questions. So on an update, if you'll recall it about Austin meeting, we talked about our task forces in their, in their work. And at the time, they were talking about trying to align SDS, plant planning and loss together. That was a part of the presentation that I gave. Part of the presentation that Jim gave was talking about the dispute resolution process. And we talked about having a panel of people that would come in from the outside here, these disputes and they would not make a binding arbitration decision. But they would make a arbitration non-binding, they would make a non-binding arbitration decision, and then the penalties attached to that. Our task forces got back together again. They now want to go in the direction of figuring out if there's a formula that can be agreed to un-lost. So in other words, don't have a dispute resolution process at all for lost if we can come up with a formula. And so that's really changed things. They're now looking at a whole different type of dispute resolution process for SDS, something that would be definitely non-binding arbitration or mediation, not a whole panel that would be hearing it. They're still trying to work through the details of what's better, non-binding arbitration or mediation or an option to do either one, and who gets to decide that. So those are all things they're still discussing. They also, since we last talked, I think they've made the decision that they don't want to touch anything that's under litigation. You've already heard that today. They want to let the Georgia Supreme Court come out with their decision on that and then maybe address that later. So our task force where they are, they want to have another meeting. They said probably the first of January. We may try to speed that up and do something before the end of this calendar year, but it's difficult, obviously, during the holidays. So right now, they don't have any meetings planned between now and the end of the year. They want to continue to work and try to reach a consensus. And then if they do reach a consensus, their recommendations would go to our respective policy councils. GMA has a policy council. We have a policy council. They would look at those recommendations and decide whether they agree with them or not. And then we'd be ready to make formal recommendations. Again, I know that doesn't fit your timeline. I know that you all have a quicker deadline that you're trying to achieve. We're still going to go through our process regardless and see where that comes out. But again, I'm happy to provide you all with any input to that we can. And Jim. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief also. I agree with the report that Clint's provided on behalf of GMA and ACCG, our joint task force. You all have heard, this is your third meeting. It's your first meeting. You heard at link from Clint and me as well as Larry Ramsey and Ruchia Patel from our organizations. Legal departments and then Clint and I were in your meeting in Valdosta and shared. Some ideas that our task force had kicked around. At that point, they were just ideas. I think what you need to recognize is, and you do, through this testimony, is that the complexity of these issues or what our task force has also been grappling with. Because these are very complicated issues with 159 counties, 537 cities. Everyone has figured out a little bit different solution in their location that works for them. And the flexible framework of SDS is working like it's intended. And then we have the flashpoints where the agreement is not reached. And that's what gets a lot of attention. But in the large majority of these cases, agreement is reached by the local governing officials. But because of the complexity and because of the variety of solutions that people have reached across the state, our task force members have heard that. And they have heard that this solution or that solution might not work in every community. He might not work in their community. And so as they have processed that information, they've gone through a very deliberative process, much like what you have done. And I think where, as Clint indicated, I think where we're probably going with this is getting the task force back together, continue having conversation about procedural improvements, not trying to create any kind of substantive rulings, if you will, or changes, or imposing any kind of substantive solutions. But seeing are there ways to improve the process? As mentioned, if we separate loss, we right now lost an SDS or not necessarily aligned. We were talking about aligning them. That creates its own set of complications. So now there's some talk about not necessarily aligning them, going with more of a formula-based solution for loss, with some measurable criteria, making SDS stand on its own, on its own. And so as we move in that direction, we will continue to keep all of you informed and updated on that progress. But right now, we haven't come to a place where even our, we still have internal disagreements among county officials, disagreements among city officials, because there are different solutions that would work in different contexts, Georgia being a very large and diverse state. And so we'll continue to work through that and report. We certainly appreciate the recommendations that the chairman have supplied, the 11 recommendations, feel like there's a lot of merit there. That's something that we will continue to work on with our task force. Appreciate chairman Corbett as well with the recommendations that you supplied, and certainly we'll take those back. All of your discussion today is something that we will take back to our task force as we continue to see in parallel with the work you're doing, are there recommendations that our associations can support. And we'll be here for questions during the Q&A. So is it your goal, the two policy committees to have your recommendations by, do you say January? Just want to clarify what your goal is. So recognizing that the legislative session has its own calendar, we know that if there was going to be a chance of legislation moving forward, we would need to have that in legislative form in January, probably by the end of January. So certainly our task force is looking at getting back together maybe once more before the end of the year, we talked about getting together again during the budget week, the budget recess. But from our perspective, an ACCGL at Clint Comin on his policy process, but our staff can't represent GMA, our task force members. And we have three great officials, Mayor Reed, Mayor Paul and manager of Phillips who are serving on behalf of GNA. But they are just serving as a subcommittee, if you will, of our policy council. Once we have some recommendations from them, we'll take them back to our full 45 member legislative policy council and allow them to vet it, hopefully coming out with a formal recommendation. They do have the ability to represent a policy direction on behalf of GMA. And I think ACCGL has a similar process. Our process is very similar. I think the position we're in is if we can get some consensus, we hope to have that by the beginning of January and that will help inform whatever legislation goes through the session. If we do not arrive at consensus and one of the legislators drops a bill, then we'll just be faced with the responding to that. Our policy council will still have to be providing input because if any bill gets dropped, we're going to provide input on it. And again, the things we're okay with, the things we don't like if we don't like something, why? But it would be much easier, I know for the legislature, if we can reach consensus and come with a unified position, which is what we want to do. And that is the state of goal of our policy councils is to work on trying to find consensus. Thank you all for your presentation. The, you know, Mr. Coach, chairman of the hood said the one of the great things about being on this committee is we know that the government always has the answer. So for me, I want you to look down our list and I say the guy with all the answers, he kind of like the shell answer man, deputy commissioner, rusty, hey, good with the department of community affairs. I don't want to put you on the spot or anything, but I know you got all answers. So come up and tell us what they are because we're done here. Thank you for that vote of confidence, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate it. Cochairs and members of this committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here before you today. I promise to be very brief. I know time is of the essence. A couple of things that I just want to do to respond to the questions that have been asked of us. And as well as following the presentations that we've heard today, thank you for having them in front of us. They, they said a lot of things that we could have. But I'm grateful for the opportunity to be here before you. Prior to coming to the Department of Community Affairs, a couple of lives ago, I was at a regional commission in the middle part of the state. And I had the opportunity to work with cities and counties as they were entering their service delivery strategy negotiation processes. And I was able to witness the extremes. One where we walked into the room and one party brings the local newspaper. One brings one of the regions, TV stations to the discussions. And we knew from the word go that one was going downhill. Contrast that with an alcohol the name at the time it was Hawkinsville and Polaski County. We sat down at AB's barbecue and then I were in 15 minutes later we had lunch and settled the update of their service delivery strategy. I don't know if barbecue is part of your solution here, Mr. Chairman, but it might be worth a shot as we get started. A couple of things we've heard today that this is a quarter of a century old. One of the things that hasn't really changed in 25 years is the forms that we use for the process. That is virtually the same as what we had from the word go. We just follow statute. There was no promulgation of rules called for in this act. So we've got the statute that's there before us that we're using as the foundation. And one of the things represented prints you brought up the question about maps and marked it a great job talking through that. The way the the verbiage is in the statute if I can find it it says a description of the geographic area that that's what was put down as this act was created. But what we have done is we have seen the evolution from 25 years ago literally a representation of the county with a sharpie. That that's a visual representation. I would consider it to be a map today. We've gotten a little more sophisticated. I think all of those hand drawn maps are just about if not all the way out of the queue is what the existing maps may be. But as Mark described a digital representation is definitely advantageous. That's something that we would definitely encourage through the process. It is a challenging process and we understand that when you have to draw a line in the sand that's automatically going to create conflict between parties as you start a process that says this is mine. This is yours. That's both geography that gets brought into the context of money. And it is a challenge that has to be worked through and overcome. And I think the word that's been thrown around is leadership. And I think that's one of those things that's critically important in this process as we consider local leadership is definitely imperative to making sure that these processes flow as smoothly as possible. At DCA I'll say a couple of things that we embrace. Number one we embrace reducing conflict between cities and counties at any opportunity. That's something that we desperately want at all costs. We also don't actively advocate for penalizing local governments. But whenever you can't come to a requirement there have to be consequences to that. And while that's not always pleasant to hear I think it definitely means that you are going to continue working toward that solution where the absence of any ramifications means it gets put on the back burner. One of the things that I will also say we are supportive of is when there's a situation where you end up with a consolidated government where there's only one entity within the jurisdiction. Let's not make them go through unnecessary paperwork to submit to the state something that says hey this is our service delivery strategy. There's no conflict between this one party. I think that's just simplification of everything associated with this. We're also supportive of what we generally consider a 10 year window on this. I would caution that as we look at the language that's currently in statute there are certain triggers that necessitate that you bring this up again for revision. Some type of interim update to this such as the creation of new cities, the dissolution of cities, things of that nature. I'll try to give a made up practical example of this if I may. But in a scenario where if we were rigid on a 10 year without the opportunity to update in the middle. A city gets created in year three of this 10 year window if you look into the service delivery statute it basically says that. When you do not have a local government represented in your service delivery strategy and approved service delivery strategy you limit state grants permits loans etc. We don't want to get into that scenario where unintended consequences that language is in the act and then we put a rigid 10 years let the local government decide when it's time to update it. But what we have noticed is that as new cities have been created in the last 10 or 15 years we've seen an accelerated number of new cities and that's great we're all for residents self governing themselves. There hasn't been a timeline that's put in place for that to be considered for a new city to be put into the service delivery act we would encourage some type of guard rails there whatever that may be just so that we as an agency that's administering this knows that that communities know what the expectations should be there. And yes sir. Commissioner one of the thing that let's go back to your fictitious new city that got created in year three of the 10 year plan under current law would you kind of refresh all of our committee members what happens today with that new city that you know if we go over here and somehow between. And then we have some browsers and then Houston which are adjacent to each other said they we manage to squeeze in another city said the what's going to happen it's in Jackson County and and I look at it and I'm like okay under current law what would happen and then what do you think really is it is it okay what we're doing well let me quote directly if I may no state administered financial assistance or grant loan or permit shall be issued to any local government I think it's pretty clear there that hands are tied as far as that goes now if the legislature changes that language of course that changes the fictitious example here but I think in that scenario there has to be a mechanism whereby this new city that we have squeezed in that small little sliver has the opportunity to be included in a service delivery strategy. And I guess what what makes the most logical sense in your mind for for doing that would you do you take okay that's the taking a portion out of what what what was if it was incorporated from the two cities and then you take a portion of those or if it was an unincorporated Jackson County then would you say okay we're going to take the money that would have gone to unincorporated Jackson County. Senator you're not going to get me to take a position on a d annexing cities to create new ones right here but I'm just I'm just saying I spot a squeeze in in between two cities because it what's good for the goose is good for the gander and I'm trying to try to play devil's advocate here. The local governments decide what happens in that scenario to me it's it's that simple. But then they can't get the grant along because of the service delivery it would need something that would be very quickly whether county can come together assume there's no deaccession of a city and they would name that city limits that's been incorporated by the state of Georgia now to be a service delivery for public utilities for example it could be a real quick tax amendment which we wouldn't have to go through the whole service delivery starting over again but it would be a we just sign off and get it in. So they can get their water and sewer get their jeep alone their grants or whatever. It seems a little more complicated than that however I'm simplifying. I know the issue is I've seen these small cities trying to cooperate to get some funding to get some water and sewer to an area sure they couldn't get without being on service to them. That would be my interpretation of this attitude as written. Excuse me did I've heard you talking but I wasn't sure but did you come to something more like hey if we're going to make a new city before they were it's approved they have to have these types of things in space in in order before we even look at approving the city versus approving the city and then having to go back and and do that type of thing I'm just trying to figure out what's you know most expedient because I mean when they want that city. They're going to need to have certain requirements and I think that service delivery strategy should be a part of that. We're going to hold this discussion till we get done we're going to go ahead and move forward and get Commissioner had good finished and then we'll have that. May I just close with one last thing one of the terms phrases that gets used quite a bit but I'm not sure if we can get that. This is separate from the service delivery strategy discussions is qualified local government status.

Within the SDS, there are SDS penalties and sanctions associated with it. They are distinct, although some of them overlap with the Qualified Local Government status. In the 11 point document that came out, we did use the term Qualified Local Government. I would recommend that we just use the service delivery strategy sanctions that are associated with that unless the legislature changes the penalties associated with it. Could you help us understand, explain, to those that need clarification, what is DCA authorized to do now for a city and county who are unable to reach agreement as far as sanctions are lit in the QO? As far as process, I would like to hand this to John West who is our division director over our community development division where this is housed and let him handle that if that's okay. Representative Chairman, make your understanding your question. You're asking essentially what happens when local governments are unable to reach an agreement on an SDS within the prescribed timeframe. Right. What is the range of actions DCA could take? Not having any rulemaking authority or anything that's been provided to DCA under the statute as it currently exists, our hands are pretty well tied. When local governments are unable to reach an agreement, we are directed by statute to impose the penalties, the sanctions for noncompliance with statute, which essentially prohibit any state agency from providing any state administered financial assistance or permits to the local governments that are located wholly or partially within the territory of that county. The only opportunity for flexibility exists within the context of a court issue debates which have been implemented in various manners by different judges across the state at different times. But that is really the only other mechanism. All of the dispute resolution processes that exist in statute whether they are before noncompliance occurs or whether after noncompliance occurs, it all happens independent of DCA. The only thing that we can do is bring in the stick. We don't have any carrot. It's all stick on that end. You lose access to state administered financial assistance and permits. So if I understand your current law, the judge could pretty much undo that stick out of your hand in virtual poop perpetuity, miss sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, miss Chairman. Right now, as you are dealing with some communities that do not have current service delivery strategy agreements, how many of those are under any form of a sanction on how many of those are in a bay? I believe the current list of communities that are actively on the exchange of zero. I can look back over my shoulder at the actual program manager to make sure I'm correct. She says I'm correct. In terms of those that actively have a bayonets, it's a handful. I'd say five or less. One more follow up. Of those that are currently in a bayonets, what's the longest a bayonets that's out there? You can ask to make. I think we're at about 14 years. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Did I get that on? Okay. I had a question as well. We've seen some commentary about DCA panels. Have y'all thought that through? Have been part of those discussions on creating DCA panels, sort of what it would take to retain those experts to be on that panel and rates and things of that nature. We have had conversation with ACCG and GMA, specifically about that. As has been stated previously, there's a comparison to annexation arbitration panels. Complete candor they have not worked perfectly. I won't stand here and say that they have. However, from a, we are not going to take a policy position about what is the right way for these disputes to be handled. We are the entity that's charged with doing something, whether it's associated with this or anything else we will do is we're legislatively instructed. Thank you very much for your presentation. Rusty and Anna. Look, this concludes the presentations we have to do today. The next thing on our agenda is for our committee to have discussion about where we want to go as far as where we will try to put together a report if it's not required that we do a report. One of the things that I want everybody in the room to recognize that we have been approved for an extension on our report deadline to December 15th. The clock's ticking, but we did get a little bit of extra time because I know we'll have a lot of ideas that we'll carry forward today and we'd like to call on some of our staff to help us with the writing up of the report. Then hopefully we can get one. So we're going to take a little recess and I'm going to ask if I can get a little bit of help to kind of get our tables in more of a, where we can see everybody a little bit better. Anybody that wants to stick around for that discussion, you're welcome to. I would ask for some of our staff to stay with us. We may be here to the midnight hour burns, but we'll try to work forward.
