TRANSCRIPT
----------
So, I understand that.
I'
You hear me?
how many of our members are old?
I think we need six for a quorum, and apparently we have five at the moment, but uh...
Yeah, we have five, including the two chairman.
Yeah, and Derek Norton is having technical difficulties in trying to log in now.
I just wanted to have a link, so hopefully it should be on shortly.
Yeah, so we should have a quorum any minute now.
Um, while we're waiting on him, um, do we need a quorum to open the meeting?
We, on the house side, we do not.
Okay.
We go to the center side to go ahead and not have yourself at it.
Said the, uh, we, we, we can't vote on anything till we have a quorum.
Right.
Well, I'll just share him again. If it's good with you, just go ahead and welcome everybody
and call the meeting to order. And I want to thank the committee members for getting
back together again for this list last time. And I want to thank ACCG and GMA for working
together to get us this list of recommendations that we can vote on today.
And I want to point out that this list is not legislation.
It's just simply a list of seven recommendations that the committee will hopefully approve today.
It gives us a framework to begin legislation.
This for anything becomes law has to go through the entire legislative process.
There's still a long way to go.
So what you're again and I have decided to do what we'd like to do is.
Consider we have a forum.
Just take a quick, you know, vote on this list and totality and.
And just understand that there's there's going to need to be more discussion and we move forward, but we're up against a deadline.
We need to check in the Norden joins you guys are good
Okay, great. All right welcome there at Norton Mayor Norton. Appreciate you doing it. Sorry
Late I had a little bit of technical difficulty probably user error
You're good
So you make our quorum and we've opened the meeting caught up to order and
Hope everybody's had a chance to look at the seven recommendations
And I was
copy of that. We can confirm all the members got a copy.
Yes, sir.
I know I got a copy. Anybody else?
Yeah, I got a copy.
Yeah, I got a copy off the job.
Thank you, given Prince.
I like him. He's driving while he's doing this. Good job. Good job.
Chair reprints. Only for the team. Only for the team.
We have.
As chairman, I don't know from the chair, from the co-chair, if I can make a motion, but you know,
we can beat the horse or move on and get the committee's report submitted. I'd like to move
that we adopt the report has written. I think I want to thank our staff for the great job they've
done and prepared and everything.
John, you got a motion in a second. We have a motion in a second and any quick discussion
before we vote. All right. This is Mayor. This is Mayor Ward just just to make
sure we put on the record with regards to ACGA 367020. You know the intent of
this SDS article has stated in the statute is to make sure that this remains
flexible and consistent with what the cities and counties are looking for. I'm
I'm very encouraged with everything we've done.
I think this final report books appropriate
and has some flexibility built into it for those reasons.
So it has my full support in being adopted.
Thank you, Mayor Ward.
Appreciate that.
All right, well, there's no other discussion.
All in favor, if you'll just say hi.
Hi.

Look great to me.
Yes, works for the house.
All right. Very good. Well, everybody, I want to thank you again for all the hard work that's going into it.
again it's been a pleasure serving with you, co-chairing with you and look forward to some meaningful
legislation coming out of this. It's good for county cities and people of Georgia.

Feliz Navidad.
