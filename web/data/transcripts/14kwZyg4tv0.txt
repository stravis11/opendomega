chairman don hogan
for a special order
thank you mr speaker and i don't know
who left all this crap up here
uh
it says we're coming to your ducks all
yeah they're not going to shoot my ducks
uh
because trey rhodes has got a
legislation house bill 343 that
prohibits him from coming on my farm
without written permission and i'm not
going to do that and there's the duck
collars they put up here
i don't know about some of these people
uh
and all these notes up here i don't know
who snow seasons are
eat more possum
that was a bad bill
against
the raccoons and the possums this year i
am disappointed that y'all passed that
and moved it over to the senate i guess
that's where it is now
when i qualified to run for this seat my
wife and i stopped to hazelhurst and
bought a money order for 400 to come up
here made out to the georgia
republican party inc
and the first person i made in line out
there was trey kelly so i went to my
wife and i said you sure we need to
qualify for this
after meeting trey kelly
yeah but i i didn't know how to get the
400 back so
i went ahead and qualified
and mr speaker promised my wife he'd
look after me when i got up here first
thing he did was put me right over there
uh in in between trey kelly and matt
dollar
and you think about having a problem
trying to keep them straight and matt
dollar would always call up and say how
about
voting me in today i did that for a
while until i got caught
and uh
and i then i quit doing that for that
dollar and he'd still come in late and
he'd come up here and get an excuse
and then
he'd get up early and walk around just
walk all over the place looking at the
ceiling
you didn't know where mad dollar was
coming from
uh
i don't know who all i'm supposed to be
talking about up here but
he's supposed not to be using
legislators names up here to get today
but
the speaker can't do much to me because
i'm leaving monday
[Applause]
and then one morning early trey kelly
handed me a bill
and it was signed by a lot of you
and the number one signature was the
speaker
and uh
i think you signed it
yeah you did
so it was turned in and the speaker
about 30 minutes later said like this
you know how he does
so i went up and i said sir he said i
got a problem
i said problem he said i need to know
what committee to put this bill in
i said mr speaker you know better than i
do what committee to put bills in he
said but jess you signed this i said yes
sir you did too
and uh he said well this is to create a
city on saint simons
i thought i was gonna have a heart
attack right there
i uh
i said mr speaker how about giving me
that bill he gave it to me and i put in
my coat pocket and it's on st simons
right now
i'd like like to
remember two people that were very
meaningful me
jay powell
you could take a bill over here to him
he'd tell you throw it in the trash or
it's a good bill
so he he had some wise counsel and i
miss him very much
and the other one was john meadows
john meadows would come over over here
with that little red book that was
supposed to go by
and we'd been at the fox uh barbecue and
they kept bringing those little fruit
drinks in there
so he somebody told him that i'd had
four drinks for lunch so he came over
there and he opened that book um he
pointed there about alcohol during lunch
so uh
but i do miss him very much
the clerk's office
i admire
very very much because they're hard
workers and i think all of them were
down here a few minutes ago having a
picture made
but uh
the speaker would always not to speak
but the clerk would always say to me
every morning i went in to read the
journal sheet to say
good morning sir i'd say good morning
sir
so that's the great greetings we got
every morning and he's a great guy
uh the clerk's office does a tremendous
job scotty has done a tremendous job
and
the other group i'd like to thank his
legal counsel
uh betsy over there worked on a lot of
mental health bills for me
and jeff lanier was
unbelievable he worked on some other
legislation for me the door keepers
if you hadn't seen don holtz
to look at his socks today
go check him out so he's got some hogan
socks on today
and how dare
jesse petry do what he did with that
dang lighthouse
tag that's the ugliest lighthouse on the
east coast
and he made fun of the saint simon's
lighthouse and that's the most beautiful
lighthouse on the east coast so shame on
you jesse
uh
i guess one of the saddest days of my
life was a mon aubry getting killed
he was in my district he was jogging one
morning
and he was killed with
a blast of three buck shots
by the people that murdered him and uh
that was sad
and i appreciate the minority caucus
coming down
lending a hand to us i appreciate
al williams doing what he done coming
down to help us and we were able to
handle it could have been a real tragedy
for brunswick
uh but that was that that was useless i
mean that was
tremendous murder
and that should have never happened for
a young man like that
and as a result of that though we
we were able
to pass a hate crime bill the governor
got behind that and the citizens arrest
law
and uh bert reeves i thank him for
carrying that he was
worked for the governor and the floor
leader at that time and he did a great
job with it
i'd like to thank the majority leader
john burns he has been a tremendous
friend
and jan jones has been a tremendous
friend when i was first elected
her door was open to me all the time
discuss legislation and what i should do
about this and do about that so
you're a tremendous friend both of you
thank you very much
terry england i begged him and begged
him
uh for money for my technical college
and i brought him a little shrimp
uh
last year when he didn't give me any
money i went to him and i i said how
come i didn't get my money he said you
bring me no shrimp
so i brought him shrimp this year i
didn't need to bring you any more
so
that worked and then i got buddied
i i got i got buddy to loach
to sit side of him over there
and buddy buddy's been working on him
heavy
buddy got some money from macintosh i
think and some other money and you go
across the hall over there
uh
guys and had appropriations over there
didn't treat us very good this year so i
don't know that needs to be improved
uh
jay roberts
passed house bill 170 which i didn't
like part of that and i went to the
speaker about it speaker said
and it was a five dollar on net worth by
the sea and they were hurting so the
speaker said to me we sat down over
there and he said imagine this that's a
ball of twine right there you pull a
little bit off here and you put a little
bit off there and all of a sudden you
don't have a bill i said understand mr
speaker i'll see you later
the annie room over here
i'm carrying about 10 pounds home with
me from it
so i'm gonna have to lose those 10
pounds
carl gillier
is the best dressed man in this house
he uh he's unbelievable
he's a great friend
and
uh he was my best chaplain
until dale washburn came along
and dale did a great job this year and i
admire him very much
he was the best chaplain of the day but
i didn't know he had so many sins he
confessed to up there
he's got a great wife and why would he
be out sinning
but
he said right up here
he said right up here that he had sinned
and he said a lot of sins
jenny earhart gave me two great
cookbooks and i appreciate that jenny we
used to see it right up there
knees all crunched up against that
railing up there
last year
my best chairwoman is lynn smith
she is great she has done so much for
the water
problems we've had in this state and we
got two around down in glenn county and
up in macintosh county and see how
mussels are grown and and so forth so
you're a great person thank you very
much
i'd like to recognize an individual
who's no longer with us reed harris was
a legislator up here and passed the uh
the marshland protection act in 1970. he
was part of a law firm in brunswick
and the law firm was representing a
mining company
from savannah all the way to to florida
and they were going to mine all the
marsh
so reed came out against and passed
legislation again and he got kicked out
of the law firm
and then in 1979 he passed the shoreline
protection act
which is very important and he was a
great legislation he always he worked
to give this house independence from the
governor the governor used to appoint
all the chairs and everything and this
house was pretty much run by the
government but reid harris was involved
in getting an independence from the
governor's office
his body in here
he told me i told him what i was going
to do and he said well i'm running for
state office i said well this probably
help you
[Music]
we're in uh
404
clob
he came to me one morning and he said
why am i getting all this republican
literature
i said representing bodhi you've been
given the money
and
then he wanted to borrow my red tide to
take it home and wear it
at home so he'd know what he looked like
but he's got a blue one on today
uh
and uh smiry
he was in that office with us and i
never seen so much coca-cola stuff in
all my life i said this has got to be a
rich man
uh coca-cola everywhere
and i used to have an antique shop and i
sold a lot of coca-cola
maybe you'll be here
but uh i admire you very much
and we probably might see you down there
as an ambassador too
shaw blackman
shaw and i have been friends for years
he's my roommate one of the hardest
worrying individuals i know of
[Applause]
he worries about everything
you can't calm him down
uh
his dad and i are very good friends
we've done a lot of traveling in ireland
and playing a lot of golf over there
and shaw and his sister went with us one
time and shaw takes all this kind of i
don't know where it's medicine or what
he takes but it's all this
weird drinks he drinks
and uh
he'd have to roll the witness downs when
he got to drinking that stuff
[Applause]
the other tragedy we had was the golden
ray
it cost right at a billion dollars that
golden ray
moved out they sectioned it off in
several pieces had 40 200
automobiles on it it was a disaster
but we were able to get it out of there
and there's several lawsuits related to
that at this time
i'd like to thank my wife and daughter
over here
libby hogan and my daughter nicholas
[Applause]
[Applause]
they surprised me today by coming up
here i didn't know they even knew
anything about me getting up in the well
but they were here this morning and
thanks to trey kelly for arranging and i
get them from the airport up here
uh
it's hard
to drive half and five and a half miles
from st simons up here
you at my age you drive half five and a
half miles and it takes you two days to
get over it we got a lot of legislators
in south georgia that do that
and
it's just
it hurts
driving the driver and you're taking
your life in your hand you come through
henry county mcdonald and so forth
i'm serious i mean you just bumper to
bumper from the south of uh henry county
all the way to the capitol and uh
that's not that's not the way it ought
to be
i
i've met the new mayor a couple times
downstairs and i hope he's able to
straighten some of these streets out up
here
i mean i don't think my truck's gonna be
worth anything when i get out of here
uh
cause it's uh
these streets are bad
and uh the cost of living up here
shaw and i
4 500
a month to rent a two bedroom condo
and a lot of you live around atlanta
here you spend the night in your bed
every night and you don't pay that
but uh it takes a lot out of you to do
that i love most of you
and
i appreciate all of you
but
thank you all for being my friend
in passing
uh house bill 1013

her
her motivating the speaker to do what he
did

legislation that we've had
in 10 or 12 years i mean i
i'm i'm i'm anxious to see just how it's
going to work out
but my aot bill that i've worked on for
three years which is
uh
the
outpatient treatment
that i hope it's going to work out and
thanks to
to my friend over there head of
appropriations he put quite a bit of
money in there for the mental health and
i i just hope that we're able to start
out in the right direction providing
service for many health
i just had a friend that was killed in
the jail
in brunswick
he was diagnosed schizophrenic when he
was just a boy slept under his mother's
house most of the time
and a great family but
he wouldn't stay on his medication
and our jails today are still full full
of people who will not stay on their
medication
and some organizations don't think we're
to force people to take medication
psychotropic and so forth but unless we
do enforce it people stay on their
medication
they're going to suffer greatly and a
lot of them are going to die

chair recognizes chairman petrie to
present the bell
thank you madam speaker
ladies and gentlemen the house arrives
today to speak to you about senate bill
10
but i first want to say something about
my good friend representative hogan made
some remarks about my
my uh my lighthouse and i just want to
emphasize to him i don't know if he's in
here but i want him to know that i love
him like a great great great great
grandfather and uh i just want him to
know that in spite of his comments um
ladies and gentlemen i bring to you the
substitute the senate bill uh 610.
uh this measure um and i'm going to
speak to you about uh the two section
the two sections of this bill and i want
to explain the first one very carefully
this bill very simply is going to
require that every four years the
department of community health does a
rate study
on uh home and community-based service
waivered programs so you all know and
our chairman england would understand
this stuff so well we have entitlements
to medicaid services in the world of
long-term care and then we have programs
that are waivered services that allow
people to be served in the community
those programs that you'll see before
you there's the now the new options
waiver there's the comprehensive waiver
in this bill there's an independent care
waiver program the gap program which
serves uh medically fragile pediatric
children who would otherwise be in
hospitals and then there's the
the edwp which is the elderly and
disabled waiver so all of these programs
are waivered programs that serve
individuals who are disabled
who have long been part of the medicaid
population that we serve
and allows them to be serving the
community the challenge is is that we
struggle up here as we fund these
programs
we don't really have data to show us
what the rates should be to serve those
individuals
this bill by representative sally
harrell in the senate would require the
departments to do rate studies so that
there's data to show us what the rate
should be it's important that i tell you
that the legislature is not compelled in
any way to to
accept those rates but at least the
information will be there and i believe
this will be very helpful to some of our
subcommittees for making good decisions
uh the section part the second part of
this bill if you'll look at lines 31-37
is precisely the language in and house
bill 1404 that we have already passed
out of this chamber that bill passed 167
to five that was representative pruitt's
bill
and what this bill very simply does this
part of the bill
is allow what are described here as
private institutions for mental diseases
are private psychiatric hospitals to
accept medicaid
so remember this is not medicaid
expansion
individuals we already have 78
500 georgians with mental illness who
were on medicaid
but when they are served in private
hospitals and i think most of you are
aware that our state hospitals have all
closed
so we need resources to serve
individuals with mental illness in this
state this is a very good bill as a
companion to house bill 1013 and it will
allow those organizations to serve uh
our constituents with mental illness and
to be able to
to bill for them madam speaker that's
very simply what this bill does and i'm
glad to accept the question or two if
that's necessary uh there is a question
the chair recognizes chairman hogan for
a question
why don't you start being my friend
i'm sorry sir when did you start being
my friend
the day you got here
what did you say when you first got in
the well tonight i told everybody here
that i loved you like a great great
great great grandfather and i mean it i
mean it i i mean that's not what i was
told i was told that you
you thought of me as your great great
great great great grandfather i mean uh
tomato tomato mr chairman
bye
there are no more questions
thank you madam speaker i yield the will
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair here is
none the committee substitute has
adopted is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair here has known the
report of the committee has agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
have all members voted
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine on

that the students are protected if they
go to an institution a for-profit
institution that they have funds um
to make sure that if something happens
with that institution the students are
made whole what the bill specifically
does
is it limits their oversight to schools
that are offering degrees previously the
way the language went there was some
ambigu ambiguity
in that they could also regulate people
that were uh helping with testing
in order to get those degrees and that
was not their original mission it also
eliminates in sections three seven three
through seven and nine through thirteen
references to agents in years past these
schools were sold to students through an
agency arrangement with individuals
that's really just this that doesn't
happen in 2022
so they are licensing the schools and
the schools themselves are responsible
for their agent
it reduces the bonding capacity but
increases the opportunity of the agency
to make students whole by creating a
fund that's paid into by new schools
and
that fund will be
what i would refer to as a sinking fund
so money will accumulate so if there's
an untimely closure the students could
be made whole
it
allows them and by doing that it allows
for self-insurance it also this allows
the agency to be more responsive and get
the money to the students faster because
if a bond has to be cash there's many
times there's arguments with the
insurance company it takes a while to
get the money in order to make the
students whole so they can continue
their education with that
madam speaker i would just ask the
house's favorable consideration this
again is a department bill it takes us
in a direction to
ensure the students in georgia that are
going through these institutions
or taken care of in the event of an
untimely closure the reason for the rule
substitute was to better define
post-secondary activity that only
changed from the higher ed committee
that was made in rules as lines 23
through 30 to make that definition
clearer there was a prepositional phrase
that could have applied
to the post-secondary degrees and to the
awarding of the study experience portion
and we wanted to make clear that that
will only uh
apply to the second one you'll see that
on lines 25 through 30. with that if
there are technical questions i'll
answer them otherwise ask the house
favorable consideration senate bill 333
there's a question the chair recognizes
leader
beverly for a question
a gentleman you yes sir
this is sort of a technical question um
the
you increase the limit from 500 000
dollars a cap to is it going to go to
about 10 million
until 2040. right and so
the reason for that
increase
is it stepwise or is it up to
20 40 it'll be 10 million dollars
yeah thank you thanks gentlemen for the
question well the reason for the
increase in the funds is because the the
reduction of the bonding requirement
because having the fund allows the
organization access to the money in the
event of an untimely college so they can
make the students hole faster as opposed
to arguing with the uh holder of the
bond the insurance company that that is
the reason the increase the reason out
to 2040 is so that they don't charge the
schools so much as to increase the cost
to the students
but if that answers the gentleman's
question so you increase the fund to
have money to pay out the students in
the event of an untimely closure
and um that would make them more the
money more accessible than it would be
coming out about it's a self-insurance
if you will
there are no more questions thank you
isa house favorable consideration senate
bill 333 and yield well the gentleman
has yielded the well is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered the chair here's none the
previous question is ordered is there

34th and others to be entitled back to
amend article 2 chapter
11 of title 16 official george annotator
relating offenses against public order
so as to provide for an offense of
promoting illegal drag racing and laying
drags this bill have referred to the
committee on judiciary non-civil
that committee recommends this bill do
pass by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative smith to
present the bill
thank you madam speaker pro tem
members of the house today i bring to
you the house committee
substitute to senate bill 10. you will
see within this bill there are several
changes made in section one you will see
that we have amended the
code section relating to impersonating a
public officer employee to include
an officer of the court and section two
you'll see that we have written into the
code section that it will be illegal to
have a global positioning or monitoring
device
on a person's vehicle that
has received a temporary protective
order consent order
or a protective order and then going
forward through
the bill you'll see in section 3 and
section 4
that this bill will amend our laws to
allow for
judges to have the discretion
and i point out discretion
to ensure that if someone has a failure
to appear in court that they would not
lose their license now this does not
reward bad actors that just have a habit
of not showing up to court
this requires an order from the judge to
ensure that someone's license would not
be suspended and madam speaker that is
the
gist of the bill now yield for question
there are no questions up there we have
a question
chair recognizes representative holly
for a question
thank you madam speaker do you yield sir
up for a question to my friend
just so curious
for the bill in its current state i know
i've read it and
i do appreciate you bringing it because
you know someone who used to
put these special condition bond orders
to make sure that folks were let out on
violent crimes that they would have no
further contact and especially nowadays
with the way technology is going um it's
being abused unfortunately so i think
this is a good bill um but further uh
actually do you further you i do
is it is it true that even though
um
this bill actually started out to stop
uh drag racing on the highways uh the
language currently in the bill does not
address that
yes sir and i can provide gentlemen with
the explanation real quick last year
this house and its wisdom
passed
legislation that would actually deal
with drag racing we're seeing on our
streets in fact
was watching the news earlier this week
and it seems like those laws that we
passed last year were doing that and we
were afraid that with the version that
had come out from the senate that it
would be a little too overly broad so we
didn't want to mess up a good thing we
had going on
man speaking with that i will yield well
and ask this body's favorable
consideration the gentleman has yielded
the well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair hears none the previous question
is ordered is there any objection to
adopting the committee substitute chair
here is none the committee substitute is
adopted is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee

the bill the chair here is none the
report of the committee has agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
for what purpose does representative
mclaren rise
your inquiry madam chair is it not true
that there are a number of very
thoughtful and hardworking criminal
justice reform advocates who have been
supporting the spill and working on it
to make sure that our system works a
little better than it did the day before
is that not true the chair
is sure that the gentleman knows of
which he speaks thank you
for what purpose does chairman berchette
rise to make a motion
i make a motion that we immediately
transmit representative maclaurin to the
senate

motion

allows for our veterans to receive
services many of our veterans are
transient and some are homeless and do
not have proper identification a state
issued id
some are just transitioning out of the
military need documents to be notarized
and once they leave their military id
card is turned back in and so they will
get their veterans id health card and so
this bill will just allow notaries to
notarize documents by verifying who they
are by using their veterans health
identification card issued by the united
states department of veteran affairs a
fairly simple bill and i would ask for
your favorable consideration and passage
of this great piece of legislation today

the chair recognizes
for a special order
representative tommy benton
thank you mr speaker
uh
ladies and gentlemen the house i
i think most people know that and all
everybody's been up here most people
have known that they decided not to uh
to return next year
and uh i wanted to to talk just for a
few minutes
uh about what
working
here has meant to me
uh
and also to the district that i
represent
but before i do that i wanted to tell
you something about myself
most people don't realize it and and
because you don't see other family
members i have three sisters they're all
younger than me
and those of you that are older an older
brother and sister you know that you're
always right you know that
you don't pick on younger brothers and
sisters
that was the way it was at my house
and you can believe that if you want to
that younger brothers and sisters are
made for that
um
i wanted to tell you a little something
about
uh my family my
my father's name was thomas and my
mother's name was matilda
and
my daddy was from jackson county and my
mother was from walker county
and my mother's father was a cotton
buyer for crystal springs which is the
meal that mr tarvin owned at
chickamauga
my father's parents were both teachers
but they weren't teacher both teaching
after after uh when before he was born
because when they got married my
grandmother had to quit teaching because
they didn't allow married women to teach
at that time
they were both my parents were college
graduates they went to
the university of georgia my my father
did he had a degree in agriculture my
mother had a degree in home economics
from maryville college and you wonder
well how did they get together they
would live so far apart well an opening
for a home demonstration agent opened up
in jackson county and my mother got that
job and they met and the rest is history
they instilled in us a work ethic that i
think
still prevails
for for me and my sisters today
we don't
don't sit around much we're always
finding something to do
and
they also instilled a need for education
it was never that
if you go to college it's when you go to
college
and all of all of us ended up being
college graduates
the neighborhood that we grew up in
there were 15 kids
in the neighborhood but that was just
three families
uh that was uh four and
my family
five and another six in another
and uh all of those every one of us got
the chance to go to college now didn't
everybody finish college but out of that
group we ended up with four teachers and
and two pharmacists and and two
attorneys and two business two business
men so
um
the
pervasive idea in the neighborhood was
education
um
i when i graduated from high school i
went to west georgia college it's called
the university of west georgia today
when i started there it had
2 500 students when i left there it had
nearly 8 000
but it only took me four years to get
finished
i then went to bernal college and got a
master's
in education
it has been a tremendous honor for me to
serve the last 18 years
i'm still allowed when i come into this
room
you think of all the georgia movers and
shakers that have been in this room
and then you think about all of us
that help those movers and shakers get
things done
i modeled with the building
and how it came about
i've been in a lot of state capitals
i've done some traveling i've been a lot
of state capitals but for its age i've
not seen any that i thought were any
prettier
i want to start off by thanking several
people the first is my wife karen
she has been a tremendous support from
me these last 18 years
she's had to put up with a lot and be
understanding of
what i had to do in this job
we would be married 23 years in june
we met on a blind date and i know some
of you are saying she must have been the
one that was blind
and you
and you're and you're right
uh most husbands will agree
to an old saying that they out kicked
their punt coverage
we had a lot in common but some of those
things were
neither one i was smoked or drank
we liked 50 60s and 70s music she's more
50s and 60s and i'm more 60s and 70s
she's an amazing person worked at st
mary's hospital for 46 years before
retiring two years ago
she couldn't be here today but she's
watching online and i would i would
appreciate a welcoming from y'all thank
you
[Applause]
[Applause]
um i want to thank my children i have
two
um i actually i have four cause karen
had two when we got married
and uh
i i really want to throw a shout out to
my son thomas who looks after the farm
when i'm up here it seems like that when
i'm up here we have fences break down
cows get out and uh i'm thankful that
he's there to
put the fences back up
i want to thank my administrative
assistants and i've had some really good
ones
some were so good that they seem to be
being poached by other representatives
or departments
i can think of two that i lost to
appropriations just real quick
i want to thank the house clerk and his
staff i've been privileged to know
and work with two clerks
they were and are top-notch in their job
performance
i want to thank the door keepers and the
post office staff
the door keepers always meet you with a
smile and a handshake
but i gotta talk about the post office
corey is going to have to work on his
technical skills and learn how to adjust
the thermostat to keep it warm in here
for us older people
i want to thank the lobbyists
for the information that they have
provided over the years
i can honestly say that i never got any
wrong information from a lobbyist
now they might have had a different
point of view from another lobbyist but
they were giving me their perspective on
it
i want to thank the speaker and his
staff
top notch in every way
in handling requests and problems
brought to them
i want to thank all the members who have
really become my friends
and me yours
it will certainly be one of the most
important parts of my tenure here
i wish we had met sooner
i want to thank my constituents that
have elected me for nine terms to be
their representative
from the 77 vote margin
in 2004
to the 80 percent in 2020
and finally i want to thank my roommate
we had never met until our election
victories neither of us were predicted
to win
i beat the incumbent he beat the
favorite
we decided to room together because i
represented a little bit of bear county
i guess terry wanted to keep an eye on
me make sure that i represented bear
county correctly
we had a lot in common we both loved
history didn't drink or smoke
one of the things that we agreed on
first off was that we would not question
the others vote on an issue
and we have not
i can tell you there have been some
pretty hard stares across the chamber a
couple of times
we've had some pretty great
conversations on history and books that
we've read in our and or our reading
but those conversations no matter what
we were talking about had to be finished
by 7 30 p.m
i could see it in his face and hear it
in his voice that the spring was winding
tighter
and that in just a few moments he would
be launched toward his bedroom to go to
bed
i had i then had the apartment all to
myself
when we came in as freshmen and along
with that the republican majority we
were told
don't think about a bill
watch and
learn we were told this several times
even before we were sworn in in january
of 2005.
i'll come back to this in just a minute
we had a lot of free time since we were
freshmen no committees
meeting
couldn't even think about a bill so
we set about exploring atlanta
we would take turns driving to places
we've read about in history or been told
about
we even rode out to the federal
penitentiary to see what was going on
out there
it's a dark foreboding place i don't
know why anybody would want to have to
go there
we didn't think we'd see anybody knew
but we we thought we'd take a look
around
we'd both grown up with some pretty
rough characters
you know bear county was famous for the
dixie mafia
and jackson county was famous for its
car stealing and bootlegging
uh i think jackson county is the only
county in the state of georgia that's
ever had two of its citizens on the
fbi's 10 most wanted list
i want to mention a couple of narratives
and they're as short as stories go
i always say to introduce a little humor
in
mixed as it wakes people up i wish i'd
had this the other day
uh they used to say at the beginning of
the tv show dragnet the names have been
changed to protect the innocent
but nothing's been changed in these
stories except they had a little
embellishment now and again
the first story
begins on a nice december morning 2004
in athens at the biennial
three newly elected representatives are
sitting at the table enjoying a nice
breakfast
the discussion was on a bill that we had
just signed
a couple of days before and pre-filed
remember what i said about the bills in
your freshman year
the three rookies sitting at the table
were you guessed it
terry england tommy benton
and our good friend tim bearden
from
from
over there in west georgia
for the sake of the story
this was tim's idea
and terry and tommy just went along with
him to help him out
well all of a sudden tim gets quiet and
kind of has a pained expression on his
face
terry and i then realized that there was
someone on the other side of tim that
was
uh and it was the caucus chairman
who will remain nameless
it looked like she was really chewing on
that ear
and then when she got tired of that one
she came to the other side
well she was talking loud enough for
tearing me to make it out make out what
she was talking about you guessed it
that bill
after she was gone tim said it didn't
bother him none
but he we looked at his ears to make
sure there was no damage or injury
and guess what
that bill didn't even get a hearing
the second story is a little more
serious
but it when you when you tell it it
turns out to be kind of funny
we terry and i were on our way home from
atlanta after going to a fundraiser for
a colleague
the lady's name was jill chambers she
was a quiet unassuming lady
you had to be here to know her and uh
we often rode together to meetings
taking turns and driving
it just so happened that it was terry's
turn to drive that day when we were in
his white ford pickup
that i had dubbed the white bird
i never referred to it by that name in
his presence i thought it might hurt his
feelings but the name fit because it
flew
early on i decided that what terry
warner really wanted to be was either a
fighter pilot or a nascar driver
well we were on i-85 in the hov lane
just past shackleford road in the flow
of traffic now floor traffic
late in the afternoon when all of a
sudden all the people in the right hands
right-hand side of the interstate
decided they wanted to ride an hov lane
too
they all come piling over there in on us
drivers started looking at locking up on
their brakes and we realized that we
were in
the big one
we had nowhere to go except straight
since the wall is to our left
and it didn't take long for things to
get ugly
i seem to remember him saying hold on
but that really wasn't necessary
i was already bracing myself and i
already grabbed the all-shoot bar on the
door
we hit a car that had moved over into
our lane it was a rav 4 but it was
changed very quickly into a rav 2 and a
half
i'm watching to my right and i see a car
go by backwards another sideways
everybody trying to put their feet
through the floorboard to try and stop
and then it was over
what it had
what had happened in what looked like
slow motion had lasted about 15 to 20
seconds
well
we're pretty shaken up we i hadn't i'd
never been in a wreck that's serious
before
we get out of the truck and start
surveying the damage and there was a lot
to go around
there was glass all over the hood and we
realized it came from the rav4
the first emergency unit to get to us
was the hero unit
the driver gets out
he's a big man and starts to look around
into carnage
then a dekalb county officer gets there
the hero goes over to talk with the
officer about how he wants to work the
wreck
either to work it in the lanes or take
pictures and get the cars out of the way
so traffic can start moving
well the officer said he would work on
working in the lanes at which point the
hero tells him
wrong answer
the officer needed to start taking
pictures because the hero is fixing to
start dragging cars
boy did he drag cars
the howls of protests by the cars as
they were physically dragged across the
interstate to the emergency lane with
something to hear
not only do we have to listen to that
but also the hecking from the
rubberneckers shouting thanks for tying
up traffic and giving us the peace sign
with just one finger
well terry goes back to his truck starts
looking at the damage to the white bird
when the hero gets to the truck terry
suggests that the only thing wrong
that would keep him from driving is that
the wreck bent the bumper down
enough to be on the tire
and if the bumper were pried up then we
could drive home
so the hero goes back to his truck and
gets a pry bar and it's a big one
he comes back to the truck twirling it
like a baton
well he's
puts the pry bar in between the bumper
and the tire and he's putting all he's
got into bending the bumper out of the
way and he bends the pry bar
he then looks at terry
and says
you pretty good size fella
and if we both try we might be able to
bend it
so terry gets a hold of the bar and he
and the hero pull with all their might
and the bumper bends just enough to come
off the tire
we then find out that a witness saw
who'd caused the chain reaction
so the white bird
the fix or repair daily ford
was the only one that flew home at at a
much slower speed
when i was elected in 2004 i never
thought i would be here 18 years every
two years kept rolling around and i kept
thinking of reasons to run again
it just happened
i really got interested in the
legislature when i was teaching
i brought my georgia history classes to
the capitol for 30 years
we always came during session
for several years i drove all the way to
the downtown but find parking places
for the bus was a pits
so then we started riding the marta from
avondale to georgia state a lot less
hassle
students got to ride on the train for
the first time and a lot of them had
never been on an escalator
our state representative was bubba
mcdonald
he was also my boss as i worked for
mcdonald hardware part-time on saturdays
and during the summer
my first year teaching showed me that it
was going to be hard to make a living
teaching school
i was still working at the hardware
store when i was elected to the house
i've known lauren over there all of his
life
we used to give him such a hard time at
the store
when he was growing up
red paint and flat handle scrub brushes
comes to mind right now
but if you ever need any gossip on him
let me know
when i got here asked to be on three
committees
i was assigned four
i'm still on those original three and
since then i've added three more
i've so i've learned so much about state
government than i ever thought about
teaching to middle school students
i've also learned that a good many
people up here want you to be
politically correct and want you to say
what they want to hear or approve of
about five years after i got here
there was a group of five of us
along with the
uh
one person that we decided to support
uh for speaker
those five were doug collins john
meadows terry england tommy benton and
tim bearden
and we were going to support david
ralston for speaker
we were not successful in that first
vote and i all thought we would be
banished to the land of nod
but one year later we were successful
when the speaker at that time resigned
it was a three three-way race
and david ralston was successful in the
next caucus vote
we were all proud for him then and now
doesn't mean that we always agree
when i got here in 2005 i had a
representative who had been here for
several years tell me that if you will
vote like you're not coming back
it will keep you in good standing with
the majority of your constituents in the
district
i have tried really hard to heed that
advice
people want you to level with them even
if it means telling them something they
don't want to hear
students are that way too
they knew when teachers were just him
hauling around on questions they'd ask
in my first campaign
one in which we raised a little over
thirteen thousand dollars
we were doing a lot of door knocking
when this guy asked me why taxes were so
much higher in jackson county than
inguined or dekalb where he'd lived
previously
i asked him if he wanted the pc answer
the real answer and he said the real
real answer
and i gave it to him
i told him it was because he and others
like him had bought these little postage
stamp lots at high prices and had
infected all the land prices in the area
that in turn had caused housing prices
rise but not enough to stem the tide of
new people coming to the county
my county right now is being invaded by
whenesians
more people mean more kids new schools
are needed and the hits just keep on
coming
after i finished he looked at me and
said
you've got a sign i can put in my yard
i appreciate you leveling with me i
followed that example during my career
just level with people
i passed some bills that i'm really
proud of the historical bill that allows
governments to place those documents in
courthouses and government buildings the
ten commandments the magna carta the
mayflower compact the declaration of
independence are just a few of those
documents
another one was the antifreeze bill
it was to put a bitterness an antifreeze
to make it taste bad instead of sweet
now i never tested to see if antifreeze
really tasted sweet but they said it did
we had i don't know whether any i
remember about but we had a lady that
decided she wanted to poison her husband
and then her boyfriend and then her
second boyfriend
and
called her black widow
poisoned him with antifreeze mixed in
with sweet tea
the idea was brought to me by a former
student
her dogs were poisoned with chicken
dipped in antifreeze in her fenced in
yard
took me four years to get that bill
passed
it would have passed it would pass the
house and get caught up in the senate
my nemesis over there would not let it
leave the rules committee because
i would not vote for his school voucher
bill
imagine that
but it finally passed both houses and
signed by the governor
several years later the local vet told
me that since that bill had passed he
had not had a single antifreeze poison
other bills dealt with land and home
appraisers education bills retirement
bills
some required some hard work in getting
to know people both house and senate
members
since coming here in 2005 no one can
doubt my appreciation for public
education
and southern history and heritage
public education is where i made my
living for 30 years it was some
sometimes a precarious living because
teachers sours were not very good when i
started teaching in 1974.
teacher salaries did not really improve
until zell miller became governor in a
three-year period our salaries were
raised 25 percent never seen so much
money
public education is where the make or
break point for our society is going to
happen
education is the great equalizer and
public education takes all that come
through the door
they don't get to pick and choose
and i've tried to defend the system to
the best of my ability
in the area of southern history and
heritage let me start off by saying that
i am very proud of my heritage and i try
to bring honor and understanding about
the people who came before us
that is why i get really annoyed
with individuals who want to label my
ancestors as traitors or racists
i know it fits their narrative of what
went on during this time period the 18th
19th and early 20th centuries
but you're only getting one side and a
lot of that is wrong
i know that i've said some
some things that upset some people
i'm not up here to apologize but to say
at no time did i speak for anyone but me
my right to contradict and say things
that you don't like don't stop where
your feelings begin
and the same can be said in the reverse
we can agree to disagree and let it go
with that
the other day i listened with great
interest
when a resolution was read that
condemned the southern invasion of
ukraine
you remember those ivy that were
old enough to remember
that when the old soviet union was
collapsing ukraine and a lot of the
other republics
decided to see seed to get away from
russia
and so they did and they set up a
constitutional
type government
all of them
as i listened to the resolution that was
read the other day
terms such as unwarranted and unprovoked
independent and sovereign nation
many russian citizens have protested the
invasion and many detained by their
government for protesting peacefully
the people have courageously sought to
defend their nation
that's
now
but go back to
1861-65 and see if any of those
descriptions fit the southern
confederacy
a lot of similarities
i love my country and i
respect my ancestors
i want to leave you with a quote
it is one that i've tried to live by in
my adult life starting in the early
twenties
i have a copy on my office wall
duty
is the sublimeous word in our language
do your duty in all things
you cannot do more
you should never wish to do less
that was by robert e lee
mr speaker i heal the whale
[Applause]
thank god
[Applause]
members will
greet
representative benton in the south annie
room
so we didn't pass anything out while he
was speaking
let's go ahead
clerk will read the caption to a group
of privileged resolutions
honoring life in memory of judge alton p
johnson

technology that we have taken from blood

uh type of medicine
that the cancer you have will respond to
unfortunately
that you know there is not enough
knowledge out about this
new type a new technique that and
certainly makes cancer treatments much
more advanced and easier on the
individual and more successful and the
people that are especially hurt by this
lack of knowledge
are
african-americans especially males
uh elderly elderly and people on
medicaid because often they are denied
uh having
this biomarker the biomarkers identified

law library fees
miss bill amman
referred to the committee on judiciary
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by committee
substitute chair recognizes chairman
heath clark
to present the bill
thank you mr speaker and colleagues uh
you can ignore the caption that the the
clerk just read senate bill 276 is now
exactly the same as house bill 109 that
we passed
unanimously
last session
this bill will do three things it
extends the number of years that a
victim of child sexual abuse can bring a
case from the time of discovery from
currently two years to four years
it extends the statute of limitations to
the age of 38 for for the discovery for
victims of child sexual abuse
and
it opens a one-year look back window
for victims whose statute of limitations
has expired
for them to file an action against an
entity that had a duty of care for the
individual for the victim
and the the organization
knew that they had a volunteer or an
employee who committed
the act of abuse
and it can be proven to a very high
standard that they knew of the abuse
and instead of reporting it
they acted
to intentionally cover it up and
fraudulently cover it up
again this bill only applies to
mandatory reporters
and so these these entities knew that
the act was happening under their watch
and instead of reporting it as required
by georgia law they worked to cover it
up and so that is the bill mr speaker
and i will yield for any questions
you have a question if you care to yield
i will yield chair recognizes
representative barr
do your right for a question does the
gentleman yield i will yield
did you mention that it was unanimous
when it left this house it was unanimous
yes do you further yield i will is it
not true that it has truly been an honor
to serve with you these past eight years
well thank you and the pleasure has been
mine as well and mr speaker i will yield
the will
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here's
done the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute
the chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of

those opposed to vote no and the clerk

what's the problem
have all members voted
[Music]
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machines
on the passage of senate bill 276
the eyes are 151 the nays are zero
this bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority
is therefore passed
clerk will read the caption to senate
bill 605
senate bill 605 by senator burke of the
11th
to be entitled an act to amend article 5
of chapter 8 to title 34 the official
quota george anne tata relating to
contributions and payments in lieu of
contributions relative to employment
security
so as to provide for certain nonprofit
organizations they have the option of
making installment payments to finance
unemployment benefits paid this bill
having referred to the committee on
industry and labor that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
chair recognizes representative gamble
to present the bill thank you mr speaker
members i rise today with senate bill
605
this is a bill that is designed to help
an organization that we all care about
which is the ymcas
when coveted hit the ymca saw its paying
membership roles dropped dramatically at
the same time the need for programs such
as pod-based distant learning for
lower-income families went way up like
most large non-profits the ymca
self-insures for unemployment payments
rather than participating in the
unemployment insurance program
federal law allows non-profits to do
this
and it saves them money
and they buy insurance policies to cover
unexpected high claim levels in this
case the ymca had had high claims
because lifeguards coaches fitness
instructors and other staff were
temporarily laid off at the same time
their insurer denied coverage for all
coveted related claims this bill simply
allows the ymca to pay the debt it owes
to the unemployment insurance fund over
three years without penalties or
interest it won't cost the taxpayers
or the fund a dime and it avoids large
cuts to programs that georgia families
depend on that would result if the
entire amount were required at one time
we work to draft this bill narrowly and
put a sunset in it
that the provision will end as soon as
the issue is covered the bill has
already passed the senate and comes to
us uh with you unanimously and i ask for
your favor a favorable consideration of
senate bill 605 i'm happy to entertain
any questions you have a question if you
care to yield i'll yield
uh chair recognizes representative
jasmine clark to your left for a
question thank you mr speaker does the
gentleman yield i yield
so just to clarify i have two questions
the first question is you say this is
for the ymca but ymca is not written
anywhere in here will this apply to any
other nonprofit organizations in the
state of georgia it could so long as
they meet the definition that was
defined that they have to have had uh
more than 360 thousand dollars
in unemployment coverage so and that's
that's also in there and does the
gentleman further yield i do
so the individuals the unemployed like
the lifeguards and the other people that
would be covered under this unemployment
are they affected by this bill or is it
just the organization it's the
organization that's correct thank you mr
speaker i ask i yield the wealth this
time ask the body's favorable
consideration is there any objection to
the previous question being ordered the
chair hears none
the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the

senate bill
183 by senator robertson the 29th anna
davarte the 31st pain and the 54th and
others be entitled back to amend article
1 in chapter 16 in title 15
of the official quota georgia annotator
relating the general provisions
regarding is to revise
qualification requirements for the
office of sheriff this bill has referred
to the committee on public safety and
homeland security that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
rules committee substitute
chair recognizes chairman collins to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker i bring before you
senate bill 183 it started out as a
share a qualifications bill for the
sheriff's office and it's changed a
little bit since then so i'll walk you
through the bill the first part of the
bill deals with the qualifications
to hold the office of the sheriff
what we want to do in this piece of
legislation is say that if you're going
to qualify to run for sheriff you have
to be in good standing with the post
council
currently you do not have to be a post
certified officer to run for sheriff
this says that you have to do that to
hold to seek that office
the next part of the
the bill
deals with
the compensation
for our sheriffs we passed out
senate bill 830 and added an additional
court
for the sheriffs
currently they receive additional
compensation for one court this adds two
courts
to the sheriffs and then the final part
of the bill
deals with some of the cleanup that we
need to do for our school speeding
traffic cameras
i had a lot of dealers reach out to me
over the last several months and car
dealers are having to pay these unpaid
civil monetary penalties for folks who
speed
in these school zones
so when folks trade in cars or you trade
a car and that civil monetary penalty
hasn't been taken care of before you can
change that title
you have to to pay that fine even though
you did not incur that so we're changing
that
in this piece of legislation
also
we're changing
the permitting process for who applies
for the permit for those school
cameras we're taking away the school
system and having it be a more
accountability on the local government
so it would be the local governing body
whose law enforcement would be enforcing
those who would be applying for the
permit and mr speaker that's the genesis
of the bill and that's the bill and i'll
stand for a question or two if anybody
has a question if not you do have some
questions okay do you yes sir
chair recognizes the minority caucus
whip representative wilkerson to your
left for a question
thank you mr speaker does the gentleman
yield i sure do uh referencing lines 178
through
180
you're saying is transferring the
accountability from the
school system to the county right
however when we talk about our children
is it not true that
the school systems are responsible for
them and that this is really a fight
between the
the school board not wanting to give
that power to the county well i guess
that's a matter of perspective to my
colleague
i see that as a way that uh you know if
you have people that are complaining
and i've received a lot of comments and
input from my constituents and from my
colleagues here in the house about
these traffic cameras maybe being abused
so right now in the permitting process
you have the school board who is asking
for the permit along with that local
government so we're taking one of those
out of the equation so the buck's going
to stop with the person that applied for
the permit that's in my opinion i think
this makes this a much better bill okay
does the gentleman further heal yes sir
just one more question so is it not true
that both cobb that i know of and
douglas are opposed to this bill so it's
real the school system so if we pass
this we would be taking that authority
from the school board and giving it to
the municipalities who i guess are
desiring this ability to ticket and
raise the revenue off of that well
ultimately the public safety falls back
to to the sheriff of the police
department
not necessarily the school system so i
think this this puts everybody in the
right lane in my opinion and that's why
i included this in the language of this
bill
mr speaker i'll uh like to yield the
will and ask for your favorable
consideration to my colleagues on senate
bill 183
gentlemen has yielded the well is there
any objection
to the previous question being ordered
the chair hears none
the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to withdrawing the
committee substitute the chair here's
none the committee substitute
is withdrawn
is there any objection to adopting the
substitute offered by the committee on
rules
the chair here's none the rules
committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair hears none the report
of the committee has agreed to shall
this bill now pass
all those in favor of the passage of the
bill will vote i those opposed to vote
no and the clerk will unlock the
machines
what purpose does chairman houston rise
parliamentary inquiry inquiry is it not
true that lowndes county has a sheriff
that was not
that only attended this school after he
was elected
do you have to attend this is it not
true that whether this is written you
have to be a peace officer before or can
you do it afterwards
well i think it depends on whether this
bill passes
and i don't know anything about the
lowndes county sheriff's training so
okay
okay
it's true okay thank you sir
have all members voted
[Music]
have all
members
voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machine

what purpose does chairman oliver arise
parliamentary inquiry
inquiry
setting aside the question of how many
benefits the sheriff may be getting in
this bill that we may or may not have
had a chance to debate
isn't it true that in my district in
many districts elementary schools are on
state highways where local constituents
have a great deal of interest in the
measures that slow down speeders on
these state highways right past our
elementary schools
if the lady so states i know she
believes that to be true
have all members voted
have all
members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine

requires a majority of the quorum
the eyes are 89 the nays are 52
and the bill is on the table

bill 382.
senate bill 382 by senator roberts of
the 29th albus the 56th gooch the 51st
council of the 46th and others to be
entitled act to amend code section 1664
of the official quota george entertainer
relating child molestation and
aggravated child molestation
survives provisions for misdemeanor
convictions for the offense of
aggravated child molestation
this bill i'm referring to the committee
on judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends this bill do pass by rules
committee substitute
chair recognizes representative sainz to
present the bill
thank you mr speaker uh
senate bill 382 does two distinct
policies initiatives one being a gbi
request to modify
what we know as the romeo and juliet
provision so that child molestation and
aggravated child molestation both
parallel
which would be age 13 to 16 minimum
being
down to 13. the other one is something
that this house has passed twice now a
house which it latest iteration was
house bill 194 with one minor
modification in 2019 with the court
decision parkview state
georgia's most dangerous sexual
predators many of them went off of gps
monitoring because of the limitation
that our sex offender registry had to be
able to utilize what is known as a what
is a very effective deterrent what this
bill does is in very rare circumstances
when an offender has been twice
adjudicated for a crime that you can
find in section 3-8 for those crimes
listed if they have committed it once
and are back in committing one of those
crimes they are able to have life
probation and we've modified it to may
so the judge has the discretion to see
if that's an appropriate um
addition to the sentence this is the
only way that the we would later then
have the tool to keep a gps monitor on
those offenders and they the offender
would have after 10 years on probation
dcs would be required to have them be
reviewed to make sure that they are
still an appropriate use of of the
offense with that i'll yield for
questions if there are any
you do not have any questions thank you
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here's
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to withdrawing the
committee substitute the chair here's
none the committee substitutes is

amend code section 48.5 311 of the
official quota george anne taylor
relaying the creation of county boards
of equalization duties review of
assessments and appeals as we'll have
reported the committee on ways and means
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
by rules committee substitute
the chair recognizes
chairman blackman to present the bill
thank you mr speaker bring before you
the substitute to senate bill 511
which is a bill as it's been asked by
for the clerks
of court it simplifies the property tax
appeal hearing timeline
that continues to maintain a resolution
in a timely manner and advantages to the
taxpayer
it it also i think if you will note
has two other pieces of
legislation that have already received
favorable consideration from this body
that is hp 500 is the renewal of the
agribusiness and rural jobs act
that is to incentivize investment
private investment in smaller businesses
less than 250 jobs and in rural counties
only
and also hb 1224 which allows personal
property valued at over two hundred
thousand
dollars to go straight uh to a hearing
officer under superior court mr speaker
if there are questions
i'll try to answer them if not
oh you'll do well
uh you do have some questions if you
care to yield i'll yield for a couple i
know it's late chair recognizes
chairman burchett to for a question to
your right
thank you mr speaker does the gentleman
yield yes sir
isn't it true that
the garger program that's included in
this bill it was wildly successful in
south georgia and that i saw out a
renewal of this garja program because i
in my district have seen many businesses
that have benefited from this
program
i believe that's true jason shaw started
this program back in 2017 if i recall
correctly
thank you for the question
take one more mr speaker
do you further yield i'll take one more
chair recognizes representative ridley
do your right for a question
does my friend yield
i think so uh
i'll be nervous too um is there anywhere
in this bill because there was rumor
about something about uh
group haircuts at inman quarter
barbershop or something that you get a
discount
if you take a group and i was trying to
wonder why i wasn't invited the other
day
when all y'all went
all i can tell you is if you walk in
looking like i did last night
they stay open late and make an
exception
uh mr speaker hours late i'll yield the
well and ask for favorable consideration
is there any objection to the previous
question i'm sorry we have a speaker
that wish to be heard
chair recognizes representative park
to speak to the bill
thank you mr speaker
so i appreciate this bill and certainly
uh want to as a member of this body do
everything to support rural georgia
especially when it comes to fostering
economic development
i also greatly appreciate the fiscal
stewardship as demonstrated by the chair
of the appropriations committee and i've
learned a lot
however i do want to bring the attention
of the members of this body to lines 116
to 121
in which we have the 100 million dollar
loan
that was that this body previously
passed where a state audit in release in
december
said that this program in which we've
already loaned out a hundred million
dollars does not come close to paying
for itself in which it's already
cost the state 56 million dollars and
that it would take the state 72 years
to pay back the 100 million dollar loan
that we've already given out and which
there is no requirement other than
self-reporting
which no bank in this country
would do
and yet in lines 119 to 121
we are providing yet a second round
of a hundred million dollars without
oversight
so i i just want to bring attention uh
to this provision that's in an otherwise
good bill which i appreciate
but i want to just make note that critic
critics have argued that this program is
wasteful and efficient and lacks proper
oversight
and that an expert in tax credit
investments
in reviewing the georgia audit release
this past december
stated that this was a very expensive
program that helps a lot of people from
out of state to make money off of
georgia taxpayers without creating
lasting value in georgia
so as stewards of taxpayer dollars
i would respectfully urge the members in
this body to vote no
particularly in light of the provision
that's included here
and i do hope that we could perhaps work
together to ensure that there is a more
oversight
regarding measures to
boost and foster economic development
throughout this state but certainly in
rural georgia thank you mr speaker i
yield the wall
all right is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair here is none the previous question
is ordered
is there any objection to withdrawing
the committee substitute
the chair here is none the committee
substitute is withdrawn is there any
objection
to adopting the substitute offered by
the committee on rules the chair here's
none the rules committee substitute is
adopted
is there any objection
to agreeing to the report of the
committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill the chair here's
none the report of the committee has
agreed to
shall this bill now pass all those in
favor of the passage of the bill will
vote i
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machines
what purpose does chairman blackmon rise
parliamentary inquiry state your inquiry
mr speaker isn't it true that in lines
137
all the way through 151
and beyond all the way to the end of the
bill that we have reporting requirements
extensive reporting requirements
required by this legislation
i believe that to be true
what purpose does
chairman burchette rise
parliamentary inquiry inquiry isn't it
true mr speaker that the dollars that
are invested are all private dollars and
it's required that those those dollars
stay invested during the duration of the
program and only are get the benefit of
the credit
once the program is complete and the 60
million dollars is a five-year
reconcile for the state of georgia
i think the gentleman is correct in that
statement
what purpose does representative wade
rise
uh pursuant to rule 133 and out of an
abundance of caution may be excused from
this gentleman has that right and the
journal will so reflect
have all members voted
have all
members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machines
