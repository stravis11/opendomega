TRANSCRIPT
----------
a civil thought in leadership at the University System of Georgia, 375,000, 41.15.5 reduced funds
for summer programming. That's a $2.5 million decrease due to decreased utilization and
effectiveness. 41.15.6 was a reassignment of $3 million that was to go to two law schools.
41.15.7 is a reduction of 700,000. That's due to delayed program implementation there.
41.15.8 that's just a transfer of the 1.6 million in funding for the Center for
World Prosperity and Innovation from the University System over to the Department of Ag. 41.15.9
is an additional $600,000 that allows the Georgia Tech computer science program to extend into 10 additional counties across Georgia.
41.15.10 has increased funds of $100,000 to the Georgia Youth Science and Technology Centers.
41.15.11 is funds for the dental clinic a long time.
come at the, been, Misselle, dental clinic, 577,000.
That's used also to teach a lot of our dental college
of Georgia students, which we are now about to expand
into a Savannah campus as well.
Under 41.17, 0.5, Skittaway Institute of Oceanography.
There's a $326,000 increase to reduce some of the austerity
reductions that are still left over there
at the Skittaway Institute on the state side
from COVID reductions.
Additionally, some doc electrical and other work
is $193,000 at 41.17.6.
Under teaching 41.18.6,
increased funds for Georgia capital history,
publication of $125,000.
And we will go on over to section 44
Under Student Finance Commission of Georgia, you'll see under 44.3.1, an estimate for the correct amount needed to increase funds for projected need that says $17 million, $436,000.
Under 44.5, there's a foster care scholarship pursuant to Senate Bill 85 that believes in the House Higher Education Committee.
committee. That doesn't have a dollar amount, but it's contingent on us looking to do additional
help for former foster students. If you're going down to the 44.7, there is a reduction
of 50,000 in that program that currently have over a million dollars in reserve. So they
can fund it. Some changes based on their reserves. Over at 44.10 under hopes, scholarships
for private schools.
This is kind of related to 44.10 and 44.11 private
and public.
That's an effort to move $10,147,000
to make the Zell the Hope Private Scholarship Award
to match the Zell Award in public.
So that's just a move of $10,147 million.
Now at 44.13, that's just a new program of memorial grants.
It was originally the public safety memorial grant section,
but now that we're adding or potentially adding
an HP 56 public school employee memorial grant,
that's a new program area.
So it just moves over $540,000.
And it has a kind of a placeholder
for that public school employee memorial grant.
44.16 is the other side of that $540,000 move
Under 44.18, the promised scholarship, there was a maximum amount by legislation of $141 million based on looking at other states and the uptake in the first year.
Typically, it's around 1%. We, just to be safe, we estimated a 2% uptake of all the eligible students under the current formula, and that would be $45 million, rather than $141 million.
So that's the new amount is $45,646,000 there.
Down at $44.21, that's a request to increase the tuition
equalization grant from $1,100 to $1,150.
They currently have over $5,000,000 in reserves.
So it's believed that they can fund that out of their current reserves.
And I believe there's on their technical college system,
I don't believe we have any new additions or changes.
I'd answer any questions from the subcommittee.
If not, is there a motion?
I have a motion and a second, any further discussion?
If not, all in favor, aye.
Any pose, likes on?
We'll adjourn this, could be on higher education,
subcommittee.

You
Good morning and I'm going to call this meeting to order for the subcommittee on Transportation
Appropriations and I'm just going to highlight the changes to the governor's recommendation
starting with section 47.1.3 and this is an increase to funds for airport aid.
This will be the first time in three years that the base funding for airports will have
been increased and just for some perspective, we're still spending 10 times less than our
neighbors in Florida and we have the same number of airports.
I'm going to bring you down to second 47.11, the rail program lost $4.8 million in revenue
due to the sales tax, fuel tax suspension and the House would like to make them
hold by zeroing that out and section 47.15 there's no recommendation to the
change in funding but we are asking the Atlanta Regional Transit link to
provide a report to us just due to the fact that ridership has drastically
reduce since the pandemic and it's not returned to pre-pandemic levels so we
just would like to understand better how those dollars are being spent and
hear their thoughts on how they can make that transit program the most
effective cost effective and meaningful for the riders they're using it but
there's a lot of empty seats on those buses now. That is it and I'll entertain
motion all right we have a motion and we have a second all in favor say aye any
opposed hearing none we will be adjourned thank you
You
Good morning again, I'll call order the meeting of the Human Resources Subcommittee.
We will start with behavioral health and developmental disabilities in section 15.
1.1 will play state general funds with other funds for the hepatitis C screening program.

about 90,000 hepatitis C screenings and 950 cures since 2016.
15.1.2 will increase the funds for alcohol use disorder peer support.
This is new funding of $1 million to support the program at Northeast Georgia Medical Center
and Gainesville, Braselton and Winder.
This will expand into Habersham, Lumpkin, Dublin, and other rural southern areas.
15.3.8 under adult developmental disabilities.
now comp waivers. This will be 150 slots. Wish it was more. We always do. We will continue
to work on that. So there was additional money added to help that. 15.3.9 to increase
the funds for citizens advocacy to expand their services. This is an opportunity of $100,000
help them use matchmaking services which help people move out of nursing homes
into better care. They will hire six matchmakers. The next is on under adult
forensic services 15.4.5 to provide funds for a jail diversion project. This is a
partnership with NAMI and Macintosh Trail CSB for jail diversion pilot in Henry
county, similar to assisted outpatient treatment. This is $185,420.
Next under adult mental health services, 15.5.7, to increase the funds to address some
of the homelessness challenges that are particularly prevalent in Atlanta. This is new
money, $300,000 to mercy care to help fund the expanding services that they do every

750,000 for partners for home this will fund one team which is we'll address
about 75 people delivering intensive services three times a week with a
social worker a nurse a psychiatrist and peer specialist to those who are
homeless, but also dealing with persistent mental illness.
Next is at 15.5.9.
This is for the Georgia Housing voucher program, 1.7 million, this will fund about 100 vouchers.
This is an ongoing challenge as it is a huge part of our DOJ settlement agreement.
15.5.10 will increase the funds for a North Fulton Behavioral Health Crisis Center.
In the amended budget, we put in half a million for the planning and design, and this is
right under a million, it's about 9.8 million, sorry, 9.4 million to begin the next steps
of this process.
their child and adolescent developmental disabilities. 15.7.1. These are for two
autism centers that do great work in our state. A hundred thousand dollars for
Matthew Reardon and Savannah area. This will be year-round school for about 35
children with autism to help them with some of their hiring and special
education teachers and then five hundred thousand dollars for Marcus
autism center. They also have a year-long program which has a huge waiting list
so this will help them to reduce that. Next under Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,
15.9.2 to increase funds for psychiatric residential facility discharge planning.
Hillside in Atlanta needed more coordinators to help them for the next step and make sure that
that there's a smooth transition post-discharge.
They only have one and this will help them.
Next, under Human Services Department, section 28.
28.2.3 will increase and expand services
for at-risk girls, going $150,000,
going to paste center for girls.
It serves girls 7 to 18 years old in Macon Vib and Peach County, providing individual and group therapy substance use for prevention.
This will help them expand their services into other locations.
Under Child Support Services 28.3.3, this will also increase funds for a child support
help in an area for our DAs in the Cab County who are helping with support for out-of-state
non-custodial parents.
This will continue to help them meet the needs there at $191,000.
Next under 28.4.4.
The House is going to support maintaining funds for wraparound services.
This is a fairly new program called E9US, is referral system through defects and chins.
The staff can use it to connect family with local services and prevent child welfare involvement.
And that prevention tool is so important, I think, as we move forward to address the welfare
needs in our state.
Last year, I'll just tell you a little bit about this.
This past year, I believe since November, they had almost 4,000 interactions with clients
and it's expected to reach 6,500 in the first year.
This is a strong prevention program.
28.4.5 will increase funds for a heavy equipment operator certification program for high
risk aid that broke and shackles $125,000.
Under Elder Community Living Services, 28.8.3 to provide funds for non-medical home and
community-based support services.
This will fund about 400 slots, a little over a million dollars, and help the Council
on Aging Address vital services to keep seniors in their homes, such as meals, home
here, transportation.
That's at $28.10.5 under federal eligibility benefit services.
This will increase the funds to annualize a $3,000 additional salary enhancement to our
eligibility case workers.
And 25, we funded well-fair child support and elder protection case workers.
So this is an addition to that at $5.7 million, $28.10.6.
The Department is going to be directed, this is language in our budget, not dollars, to
prepare and submit a plan to address the backlog of eligibility determinations to the Office
of Planning and Budget and the Chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee
by June 1, 2025, to help us understand and address the 70,000 determinations that are
part of a backlog.
28.11 out of home care. 28.11.2 increased funds for utilization growth for the increased
cost of care in the foster care programs. This is 19 million, excuse me, million, I'm sorry,
it's early girls, y'all know that lady's 19 million here helping me. Okay, 28.11.3 increased
the funds for essential clothing supplies for foster youth. I'm so excited about these two
programs because they really are addressing some of the things that our state cannot actually
do.
Bloom closet which is in several places in our state and they are bloom mobile as well which
delivers opportunities for school supplies and clothes for children and then also kids
cup and 2,000 each in Dublin each will be getting 200,000 28.11.4 to increase the funds
for foster youth to help keep them closer to their biological family, a very worthy goal.
It's a new program, half a million for families, for families.
This will be a $10 a day per child to allow opening foster homes annually and to help them
keep the staff on board, but also it has been found that children who are placing their
home exit about 102 days earlier than those who are far away. This is a great
new opportunity for us. 28.11.5 will provide funds for a 2% provider rate
increase for our child caring institutions, child placing agencies, foster
parents and relative caregivers. This is six a little over six million.
28.11.6. This will increase the funds for community action teams to deter child welfare
involvement. There are contracts that we have. This one is with Youth Villages Intercept
Program which works with kids 0 to 17 years to de-escalate very difficult situations.
The next is at 28.11.7 to increase funds to support youth aging out of foster care.
Youth Village also has a life-set program and serves about 40 children, young adults
actually, to help them move into independent living.
It costs about 50 per person a day and this is a 325,000 ad.
Out of school care services at 28.12.1 will reduce the funds and recognize 10 million
in the Department of Education Student Support Services for Out of Care programs.
This is after school and in the summertime particularly, remaining contracts with a hoopy regional
library, which is in Badalya, and also with the United Way of Greater Atlanta and Washington
Street Services, which are in Covington.
2017.1 will increase the funds for personnel for the salary and fringe for one administrative
position for the Council on Aging. Right now they have one person and the population is
growing and they need a little more help. Two items here, 20, I'm going to start with
28.23.3, where we'll be transferring funds from that to 28.20.4. So this is not an ad,
but a movement of funds for vocational rehabilitation to the department and administration to align
with the work they can actually do, it will help them be able to utilize employees that
they have in a much better way.
28.23.4 will increase the funds to supply new and usable, durable medical equipment
and assistive technology to are disabled adults and children, this is a program called
they're in over 100 counties right now and we'll be building a warehouse in
Griffin which will service a satellite distribution center for all of this
equipment and last in veteran services section 48 48.2.1 to increase the
sun the fun this is this is movement also we will move this from 48 2.1 to 48
3.1. The funding, it's a cleanup from OPB. The money will move into the Georgia or
veterans nursing homes area and increase their funding there of about $63,000.
48.3.3. This is the work with the U.S. Department of Veterans Services to identify ways the
Millageville sub-acute therapy unit could be used to best serve Georgia veterans. This
This will provide, this is language mostly, but it will, yes, that's it, this is the cleanup unit, cleanup of the unit.
48.344 will actually increase the funds to address the rising cost of health care in our war veterans' homes.
This is a million and a half.
The VA provides a 50% match for homes, but the state has not increased our match in 10 years, so this will help them greatly.
48.3.5 will increase funds for 40 additional beds to submit a plan to reach the maximum
occupancy to the office of planning and budget, the House budget research office, and the
Senate budget and evaluation office by September 1.
This is an add of 2.1 million.
Currently the Homes are at 54% occupancy with 262 beds.
This would bring us back up to 62 percent, and the VA recommends 90 percent, so are we
working on that challenge, right?
And that is all that we have in human resources.
If there are any questions, I will hear them.
If not, I will entertain a motion.
We have a motion to pass.
We have a second.

This meeting of the Subcommittee on Public Safety
Appropriations Order and the first thing on the...
First, let me say this.
We're way behind and I take the longest of anybody,
so it's going to be just the facts, ma'am, today.
So...
We got plenty of time.
Okay.
He says we got plenty of time.
Starting off in Section 18, Community Supervision,
18.2 before increased funds for personal services to reflect increased retention of the community service supervision officers
4 per 8 million of this is vacant positions that have been held open to use proper reasonable costs and
There's 4.7 million that they've used 53
Foreign staff salaries a for operational costs
And moving on to our largest category, the Department of Corrections.
Throughout the Department of Corrections in DJJ, there are 4% and 8% pay raise coales.
They have a difficult time with both hiring and retention.
So I'm going to go to their universal and I'm going to go through all of them together
at one time.
There's a 4% increase for education, chaplains, food service, and maintenance positions
would come to $2,331,515.
Six-month-ingrade promotion and compression
for correctional officers was
happened in correction.
People on the bottom have been getting pay raises.
The supervisors have not.
There's a $500 difference per year
in the supervisors versus correctional officers.
And now nobody wants to take a promotion for $500
and take on the additional responsibility.
That comes to $9,637,825.
There's a 4% increase for all correctional officers,
which is $13,438, and 8% increase for behavioral health
counselors.
We tried to hire them at 4%, and we couldn't get them 8%.
We've had better luck.
That's $5,080,99.
And in 700 additional correctional officer positions
and proof staff to offender ratios,
ours is 14 to 1, 11 to 1 is the standard.
That's $9 million, $59,814.
Now under section 19, 19.1.7 increased fund
for existing operational needs, $1,911,000.
19.1.8 increased fund for administrative cost
for the opening of the McGree's Women Facility,
$917,000, $170, increased funds for administrative calls for the opening of the Smith Transition Center
and additional dormitory, which was both open this summer, $84,941.
Skipping over to 19.211, increased funds to add correctional officer position to prove
stay-off defender ratios, this is the same thing I just talked about in the different
section for me in 417,000, 19.2.12 increased funds for utility costs. This is
deficit targeting $388,043. Moving down to food and farm operations and
creates funds for food and farm operations, $3,948,490. This is just to meet the
food costs for the Department of Corrections 19.3.6 increased food for food costs related
to the opening of Smith Transitional Center McRae Women's Facility and a TIFF cafeteria
contract for basic correctional offshore training cadets, 1B and 177,000, and this also
is deficit targeting.
Under 19.4.5 increased funds for the dental health contract and to support increased
population, $6,997,000 increased funds for the mental health contract to support increased
population, $22,211,000, 70% of the people incarcerated in our prison system have mental
health issues.
$19.4.8 increased fund for physical health contract and sport of increased population
$20,390,000.
$19.4.9 increased fund for retention of experience corrects all through to address compression
$3,626.
$19.4.10 increased fund for health care contract for McRae Women's Facility to account for additional
full-time physical health employees $998,000.
The Fender Management, 19.5.5, increased funds for a $6 per
DM increase for county correctional institutions.
The state pays $75 a day for a per DM.
We pay the county correctional institute 24 now.
$6 will make it 30.
They utilize them for a lot of, you see the people cutting
grass along the roads and that kind of thing.
Many of them are saying that if we don't increase the funding,
they're going to give them back to the state.
We have no place to put them.

Well, good morning. I think we have a quorum and most of you, many of you have been here
through the entire presentation from all the subcommittees. As y'all know, there are
a lot of, we're doing a lot of good things, a lot of expenses in certain places. I just
I just wanted to, before I did my official comments
and presented the bill, I wanted to thank all of those
involved in this process, all of those in the House
budget research office that have put in.
Y'all just don't know the hours they put in,
especially last week, we're getting this done,
plus crossover and all the committee meetings,
because we have people that work,
our people in the budget office work,
committees in the budget. So, before we even do anything, I want to thank Christine Murdock,
all her staff for all the hard work they put in the last few years.
And I'm going to turn it over to the Vice Chairman who's upset that something's not in the budget,
so maybe he'll call for the vote.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we'll allow a vote this morning though, but I want to thank
you and let's give Chairman Hatchet a round of applause for his hard work.
And I'll now turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman, to present House Bill 68.
Thank you. Two months ago, the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections stood before
all of us at this podium to present the governor's amended FY25 and FY26 budget
recommendations for his department. That day was unprecedented for two reasons.
First, the recommendations were released in advance of session. And second, it was
an historic infusion of cash that was being recommended for the prison
system. The advanced recommendations and cash infusion highlighted the
sense of urgency share between both the executive and legislative branches and our need for
swift action to address the pervasive problems within the prison system.
Your appropriations public safety subcommittee, led by Chairman Hitchens and supported by
Courtney George, has spent the last two months combing through the governor's recommendations
for the department.
Last last week, we passed an amended budget that included an infusion of $345 million in
new funding for the department.
Much of the money appropriated was for staff, but it also included funding for some terms
we had never heard before, like Tiger Teams, Maximum Security, Modular Units.
budget ads were all designed to enhance staffing and increase bed capacity so that much needed
repairs can begin that will make our prisons safer for both inmates and for our officers.
The FY26 budget you have for you now builds upon those recommendations. Recognizing that agency needs
are fluid and ever changing as new information becomes available.
The House version of the budget adds an additional $125 million on top of the governor's recommendation
for a total increase in next year's budget, the corrections department of $250 million.
Much of the funding and the corrections FY26 budget is an annualization of the needs
we recognize in the amended budget, included lowering staffing ratios and improving bed
capacity so that the department can implement life safety and security projects.
This budget also recognizes that salary enhancements are working to attract and retain staff
in the prison system, and it includes additional salary increases to keep the staffing momentum
going. It also addresses deficits in the corrections budget, where funding for vacant positions
has long been used to cover gaps in increased operational costs, including utilities and
health services. Now that the department is having more success at retaining staff, these
expenses must be accounted for and made whole in the base budget. Finally, this budget includes
$38 million in additional funding for private prisons and correctional institutions, recognizing
that these entities are in an essential part of the correctional network. Without them,
we would not have that capacity for all of our defend offenders.
While this theme of the budget so far has been public safety, this is also very much an
education budget. The House supports the governor's recommendation for enrollment growth and
fully funds the QBE formula, but we also include $98 million in additional education spending above
the governor's recommendation, primarily for students safety and mental health.
The House budget includes a $25 million investment in new school safety initiatives designed to
assess and prevent school threats. It also includes more than $60 million for a
knee program that I'm really excited about called Student Support Services. This
knee program is a collection of ideas and requests many of you are likely from
me or with that support our students in ways that the QBE formula can't. This
This new program provides $20 million for mental health grants for social workers to
do outreach, for mental health grant funding for middle schools and high schools, $5 million
for grants for social workers to do outreach and address chronic absenteeism, $10 million
for out of school care and programming or boost 2.0 as some of you may know it, and finally
$28 million to implement a new source of funding
for disadvantaged students otherwise known
as a poverty week.
Together, these programs aim to support the whole child
with needed services outside of the classroom
to improve mental health and boost academic achievement.
Finally, literacy has been a major focus of concern
for members in this body as well as in the Senate.
That's why the House is included in additional $10 million in funding to implement recommendations
from the Georgia Council on Literacy, including funding for 116 re-sub-based literacy coaches
to support teachers on the science of reading.
Of course, in a $37 billion budget, there are numerous ads in other policy areas that
I know many of you will agree are equally important, and this budget addresses those
needs to include a few eight million dollars to CJCC to offset the loss of
vocal dollars. $6.4 million for a 2% provider rate increase for child
caring institutions, child placing agencies, foster parents, and relative
caregivers. $3.4 million for 150 new now comp waivers. $32 million in reimbursement
rate increases for providers treating patients on Medicaid $8.3 million a new
funding for graduate medical education including $2.8 million for 150 new
residency slots and $5 million to establish a grant program to support new and
expanding residency programs and $23.5 million to provide and enhance
supplement to our state retirees. This is just a few of the highlights that you
can be proud of in the House Committee substitute on HB 68 and I would
appreciate your favorable consideration. I will simple to answer any questions.
Do any members have any questions? All right seeing none what's the will of
the committee. All in favor? Any opposed? Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and this meeting
is adjourned.
