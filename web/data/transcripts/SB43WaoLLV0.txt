Members, all members, please come to the floor. Members, please come to the floor. All members, please come to the floor. Because the hour convening having arrived, all members, please take their seats. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell? Thank you, Mr. Clerk. All members, we're going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? Please come to the floor. Good Tuesday morning. What day is this? Oh, PBJ Day. That's the one I'm talking about. Thank goodness for those peanuts and that jelly. I had my share. I don't know about y'all. Appreciate those peanut growers. The number one peanut state in America. This great state of Georgia. We're glad they're with us today. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Oh, excuse me, I guess I better do that first. I got excited about those peanuts. I guess you could tell that. Have all members now voted? If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? Thank you members. Doorkeepers now, will you lock the doors? Keep them locked? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain. After which, we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Today, our chaplain will be introduced by the lady from the 147th House District over in Warner Robbins, and the Biffany Ballard. Biffany Ballard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, members. It is my pleasure to introduce Pastor Vince Harrington and his wife Antoine. They are from no limit Baptist Church in Warner Robbins. I met him last year when he came to the Capitol with a group of pastors to pray for us. He and I have had many conversations over the past year or so. He is a nurse, and his career field shows that he has a heart for service, which he lives out at his church. They run a warming center for our homeless residents during the winter months. But more than that, they brought in portable showers. They help people get documents that they need in order to get jobs and housing. So it is so much more than just your traditional homeless shelter. So he really does have a heart for service. And one of the things that is in his long term plan, which is near and dear to my heart, is a love for students. And his long term goal is to have something at his church where we can help students who don't have Wi-Fi at their house, get Wi-Fi to do their homework. So that is their long term goal. And I am so pleased to have him here today, and I hope that you enjoy his message. Thank you, sir. Good to have you here. Good morning, everyone. It is just good to be here. Thank you so much for the time. Thank you so much, Speaker. It is good to be here on this day that the Lord has made. They told me I was to do a scripture and a little word and a prayer. So if I could do a scripture, it would be Luke the 10th chapter. 25th verse just says, be in behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? They asked me to come here and I was thinking, what would I say to such a group of prestigious people? What would I say to a group of people who has the weight of the world on their shoulders? A group of people who would come and delie make decisions that affect people's lives? And as a thing, he got reminded me of a story here in Luke. A lawyer, a scribe, a lawyer, an educated man comes to Jesus. And when he comes to Jesus, he simply asks him, what must I do to obtain eternal life? He basically asks, what do I have to do to make myself worthy? What do I have to do to make myself on that list of what they call good people? What do I have to do to make myself on the list of the ones that they say, guess what? You made it in. What do I have to do to obtain this thing called eternal life? And Jesus being Jesus takes him back to the law and says, what does the law says? He says the law says to love God first, but then it says to love your brothers as you love yourself. First thing I want to tell you guys is simply, guess what? You're in a position to show love. Every day you will make laws, every day you will make decisions, but let your decisions be in love. If you do a decision in love, it will always be the right decision. He tells them, as he's looking, he tells them, Jesus tells them a story. He says, there's a young man, he's coming from Jerusalem to Jericho, Jericho, and along the way he is robbed, he is stripped, he is wounded, and he is left for dead. He said, while he's there, long comes the past, the priest, the bishop, the rabbi. He comes, he sees him, but he moves to the other side of the road. He looks as not only the bishop comes, but another man comes, he's a good man, he has moral claws, he's going to church every Sunday, but he sees him, but he moves to the other side of the road. He says, but lastly, there's a Samaritan. Now this Samaritan you're looking and understanding something about this Samaritan, he's the type of man who doesn't deal with the Jewish people. They don't talk to each other, they're not of the same religion, they're not the same race, they don't walk to the same place, don't go to the same places, but he looks and sees this man wounded. He stops, he heals his wounds, he picks him up, he carries him, takes him to the end or the hospital, pays for his care. But that's why, why would he do this to someone he doesn't know, someone who doesn't think like him, doesn't look like him. Basically, God is saying, if we want to inherit that internal life, know that the decisions you make, people are hurting, life has hurt all of us. We can all have occasions and thoughts to realize we've been wounded in life, and we all need somebody to stop and see about us. We're all going to have a time in our life that we need somebody to check on our wounds. We're all going to have a time in our life that you're going to need someone to carry you along the way. You're a decision that you were making this house, we're determined who was healed, we helped heal someone, your decisions will help carry someone. Every day you make decisions just remember, you know what, somebody's wounded and I'm in a position to help. Somebody's hurting, I'm in a position to help. And if you just show love, we all just show love one another because one thing we know, this is a great state. This state is going through a light, but through love we've come together. We've gone through storms, we've gone through battles, but every hardship has brought us together and through love we've gotten stronger. Every day I'm just going to show love and the more we show love, guess what? One day we'll all meet that mark where we can be obtained that eternal life. I pray God bless you as I go to pray for you, ask that you all please stand and join me in prayer as I pray for you. Pray with me. Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus, Lord we come before you now. Lord we're humble. Recognize we can do nothing without you, but with you all things are possible. Lord ask right now, Lord, that you bless this house. Lord bless each and every person in here, you know their needs, Lord. Let your wisdom fall upon them, Lord. Lord, that your wisdom may come through them, Lord. Let your love, Lord, touch their hearts, Lord. That love may be shown by this house, Lord. And Lord that you may get the glory, continue to bless this state. Lord bless our governor, Lord. Bless us, speak of the house, Lord, and let that anointing run down to each and every member, Lord. And Lord, we give you all the glory. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen, amen, amen. God bless you, why are you standing? Please join me as we say the pledge of allegiance. We are the leaders of the United States of America, the Syrian Republic, for which it stands, the One Nation under the line, indivisible, and just as strong. God bless you. That's strong. Thank you so much. That was great. Thank you. Members, we want to thank Pastor Harrington for his ministry here today, but especially for his ministry in Warner Robbins and all the lives he's impacting in Warner Robbins. Thank you for that as well. Doorkeepers, you may open the doors. Members, you may join Pastor Harrington in the south any room. And greet him and thank him for his service. And get a photo. Thank you.

forward. Without Mr. Speaker I'll stand for any questions. Gentlemen, I have no questions. I yield the will. Make a Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, zero to the well. Is there any objections to previous question being ordered? Hearing none the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Hearing none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the past to the bill? Hearing none the report of the committee is agreed to. We shall this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? All members voted. Point purpose is represented to your to rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The State of the inquiry, chair. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this House bill 244 aims to support local governments and ensures that accurately financial reporting. Yes, sir. That's what the chairman said. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that this House bill 244 aims to support local governments and ensures that accurately financial reporting? Yes, sir. That's what the chairman said. Or the member told me when he dropped the bill. Is there any objection? Excuse me. I think we're there. I don't think there's objection. We did that part, then we're represented to cannon. Have all members voted. All members voted this so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House bill 244, the years are 162. The days are seven. This bill hasn't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is there for pass? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House bill 309? 309. House bill 309 by Representative Clifton. On the 131st, to be entitled, not to amend the chapter 8 of Title 36, the official code of Georgia and Tate Rillay. The county police officers required option of resolution or ordinance and voter approval prior to a abolishment of a police force that was created by such method. This bill is for the committee and public safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Clifton has recognized to prevent the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot to do today, so I will be brief. This bill is for county police departments. I'm going to say that one more time. I'm counting police departments. This has nothing to do with city police. Currently for a county to create a police department, the commissioners will vote on it. And if passed, it goes to the citizens to vote. The way the rules and code stands right now, if they want to get rid of said police department, the commissioners vote on it and it's gone. This bill requires in order to get rid of the police department for it to go back to the citizens to a vote. So essentially the way it is created, this bill will enact the same standards to get rid of that police department. Gentlemen, do you have a four question? Yes, sir. Rips, if you jazzed me in Clark to your left, I recognize four questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, yield? Yes, ma'am. So I'm always curious when we see bills like this, it's probably a story behind it. So is this something that happened in a county where they abolished their police force? And now we need to, I guess, add an extra layer to this process. So what I've been told is that there have been situations where after a police department has created the power given to the commissioners, allows them a lot of control over that police department. This really, again, just goes back to putting the same processes in place to create it as it is to get rid of it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gentlemen, you are for another question. Representative, you need to your right. Good morning. Ladies, recognize. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that defunding or debanding a county police force could lead to reduced public safety, longer emergency response times, and increased crime in our communities? Yes, ma'am. Thank you for this bill. Thank you. If you have one more question, Representative Rimsich, Ramon, to your left up the Sunrise, recognize four questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, yield? Yes, ma'am. Currently, if a county wanted to create a referendum process, could they do that, or are they not allowed to, and that's why we need this bill? I am not aware of the answer to that. I just know that what the current code is currently states, this will fix that. Sure. Yeah, I'm just usually trying to figure out what would be preemption versus that kind of thing. So, thank you. Thank you. Representative Burke Shit, please recognize for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to zoom in you. Yes, sir. I do that. You're simply making it where a decision is made by the voters that you undo that decision with the voters versus having a unilateral decision by the commission. That is absolutely correct. That's exactly what we're doing. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, sir. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield the well. Gentlemen, yield the well. We'll let the chairman pass the parliament inquiry. I guess he'll be fine with that, because he did have a question. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none. The committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the pass to the bill? Yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Crow rise. Parliament, your inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true? I think by requiring voter approval for both the creation and disillusion of a county police department, HB309 promotes consistency in respect to the will of the community. I think the answer to that is absolutely. Have all members now voted? All? We'll wait just a moment. Get your steps in. That's a good thing for you. All members now voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 309, the yeas are 169, the nays are three. This bill haven't received the records that cost us a majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 314-314? House Bill 314 by resident of La Hood. The bill is included with 175th annals to be entitled to amend chapter 5 and title 43. The bill is included with the charge of the antenna relating to athletic trainers, so it's to revise and update definitions. Mr. Bill, I'm referring to the committee unregulated industries. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from Valdosta, chairman John La Hood, is recognized to present the bill. Chairman La Hood. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I've got House Bill 314. It was brought to me by the Board of Certification for Athletic Trainers. The intent of the bill is to protect the industry from bad actors that are calling themselves out as athletic trainers and also to clarify. The prior to act for athletic trainers was first put into place in 1977. This is just an update to modernize language to better fit what they actually do today. The intent to make sure people understand what athletic trainers can do. Mr. Speaker, there's any questions I'll take, Kenny. Do you have a question, Representative Isle? Is recognized for a question to your right? Thank you, will the gentleman yield? You're the right to your left. I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am. Isn't it true that the difference in training for athletic trainers versus physical therapists is that athletic trainers have a bachelor's degree or is a physical therapist has a doctoral degree? That is, could be one difference. I do believe athletic trainers have a master's degree program. But the curriculum, I have an outline of their curriculum here and it list all throughout the conditions that their athletic trainers are taught and trained into evidence of knowledge to treat. Such as a staff infection that may be in the locker room is a condition, not just an injury. And so those are the kind of things that we want to be sure athletic trainers are able to address when those things come up. Thank you. Will you yield for one follow-up question? Of course. And I appreciate, of course, the work of our athletic trainers and our PT is my son is an athletics and he also sees an athletic trainer when he is injured in sports. But I'm correct in understanding that in this bill you propose to make the type of care offered by athletic trainers essentially indistinguishable from that offered by doctoral retrained physical therapists. Okay. Thanks for the question. And absolutely not. It's not we don't want to make it indistinguishable from what a physical therapist can do. It explicitly explains in the bill that an athletic trainer will only treat conditions first that a doctor approves and refers but also that are the result of physical activity. And the whole idea is for the athletic trainer to get the patient back in the game, whether it's on the sports field or the game of life, whatever it is, we just don't want to restrict the conditions they're treating to. Andres that resulted on a sports field. You know, sometimes you could fall down the stairs in your house and injury to your knee, your ankle, or your shoulder required the same treatment. I understand. So that just to clarify that that delineates between injuries incurred in playing the sport that the athletic trainers assigned to versus physical activity anywhere in life. Is that the difference? So I understood your question right. Then yes, we're changing the word injury to condition. And by condition, what we mean is sometimes injury is understood to be an acute event where a condition could be a lingering issue that requires ongoing treatment. Thank you. Thank you for the question. The scripting Val Williams, you left up front is recognize request. Thank you. Speaking of general yield. Yes, sir. You've almost done it. I want you to give me that explanation. I keep hearing condition and injury coming up. It was a scientific definition. What separates one from the other? So House Bill 314 restricts limits and qualifies the condition to be the result of physical activity. And a condition can mean a lot of things. But in this case, condition is limited. It's qualified by in the bill and it spells it out. It's qualified by an activity that resulted in a condition. An activity related to physical agility, which normally happened on the athletic field, but not necessarily. Thank you. Thank you. To your right representative, Dr. Martin Newton. Representative Newton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. I personally need to apologize for not his study and this is much my understanding. Isn't it true, though, that the athletic trainers generally train on people and get experience on kind of the younger side of the spectrum, the more active, the more fit, the ones more likely to want to. And get back to sports. Whereas the more in depth training of a physical therapist, kind of airs sometimes on the other extreme. A post-hip fracture. Are you at all concerned about the potential discrepancy there in the average age of experience regarding their patients? And this by extending them to everything a physical therapist is trained to do. I guess I have a little concern that the type of training and the type of patient is different. Isn't that true? You make a good point. And as the name implies, athletic trainers, that is the audience they are focused on, athletic trainers. Which is why we want to clarify that sometimes conditions that did not result from the athletic activity need to be understood and clarified. That that's in the scope of the athletic trainer to treat. The athletic trainers are not going for the elderly hip fracture patient. That's not the goal. However, I will say that lots of physical therapy clinics are hiring athletic trainers to treat patients of that nature. But that's not the intent of this bill. And I don't see it opening the floodgates for that happening. Because Dr. Newton, the doctor still has to make the referral and bless the patient to see the provider. Remesley, if you're in the Nisha Jones to your left, just recognize for a question. Thank you, Speaker. Does the gentleman you? Yes, ma'am. I'm too am a doctor. And do conditions include arthritis, colds, appendicitis, pneumonia, carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma, skin rashes, abscess, tooth heart conditions, etc.? Thank you for the question. And I'll just reiterate that the bill, there's language in the bill that restricts limits and qualifies the only conditions that result from participation in physical activity or to be managed by the licensed athletic trainer. Does the gentleman further you? Sure. Isn't it true that House Field 314 removes restrictions from treatment of injuries at athletic settings to expand the treatment to any conditions at all settings? Any conditions at all settings? Is that what you said? Yes, ma'am. Okay. It does not limit the condition to an athletic event. That's what you're asking. Let me repeat it. Isn't it true that House Field 314 removes restrictions from treatment of injuries at athletic settings, excuse me, to expand treatments to any conditions at all settings? No, not any condition. Only conditions that are restricted, limited, or qualified by physical activity. And that can be found in the bill on the first page. I'll find the line for you. One last question if the gentleman uses. Okay. Isn't it true that under House Field 314 there is no definition for conditions? The whole reason we need this bill is because of all the questions that are being asked today. That's why we need it for clarification. Because athletic trainers today are treating conditions not just limited to injuries. And that's okay. That's in their scope today. So all we're doing is clarifying that injury is not the best word to describe what they do. They do treat a lot of injuries, but sometimes there's a condition that is treated as well. gentleman, you'll for. I'll yield from one more Mr. Speaker. Representative Washburn has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the chairman you? Yes, sir. Isn't it true that House Bill 314 updates definitions and certifications and consequently ensures that our athletes are receiving the best possible care? Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask for a favorable consideration from this House and I'll yield the well. Gentlemen has numerous other questions, but I think do we have a speaker on this bill? Representative Powell, the chairman of the committee from which it came. His recognized to speak to House Bill 314. The gentleman's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And the ladies and gentlemen, I was. I didn't mean to come down and speak, but it was sort of a fail safe in case, but since there were so many questions. This bill, the athletic trainers, our code section hasn't been updated in almost 50 years. Things have changed in that scope in their scope of practice. As my friend, Representative Washburn said, just upgrades the language. He cleans up a lot of antiquated language under that section. There seems to be a lot of discussion about conditions in the committee. Some of the folks who were opposed to the bill of athletic trainers said that if we were put on line 12, injury slash conditions was not the will of the committee, because conditions are created in this section. These conditions are created by injury. But I think the key to all of this, if you'll look down on line 1617, it clearly states nothing in this paragraph should be construed to expand the scope of practice. Of a athletic trainer. Beyond the determination and the advising of a consenting physician. And I don't know if anybody position is going to tell athletic trainer to treat heart disease or anything like that. This deal strictly with injuries. And I don't think this house needs to lose. These fact of that. And that's all I've got to say, Mr. Speaker. And as as the author said, it's a good bill. The gentleman's yielded well, I think. That concludes our comments on House Bill 314. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none of the previous questions ordered, is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none of the committee's substitutes is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? But here, here's none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes, all those opposed. We'll vote no, and this clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. For what purpose is represented by a chair? Call them in, drink, worry? Stationed. Is it not true that the athletic trainers association is in favor in the House? The headlamp athletic trainer from Georgia Southern is in favor of this bill. Thank you, gentlemen, for what purpose is represented by a chair? The statement from the headlamp. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that HB314 will allow for clarity and efficiency within the profession of athletic trainers? The chair of the lady knows what she speaks. Have all members now voted? All members have voted this, so Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Own the passage of House Bill 314, the yeas are in 93, the yeas are in 77. This bill, Henry C., the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 197? House Bill 197 by Repsent of Hawkins, the 27th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 33, 46 of the Fisherhood of Georgia, and tentative relating requirements for certification, utilization of nationally recognized accreditation standards, and a website identifying nationally recognized accreditation entities. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Health. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Hawkins is recognized to present the bill, House Bill 197. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 197 has come about due to an issue that's been occurring over the years, where to ensure can question the medical necessity of treatment of medical or dental origin. When this occurs, we are not able to treat that patient with insurance coverage. I work, start working on this issue this spring and summer with the insurance industry, and I will say that I appreciate their work. Not all insurers were engaging in this, but I can tell you along the way I heard from a neurosurgeon and Gainesville, who told me that 30% of her procedures had been questioned for the medical necessity. That's a pretty high number. And the cardiologist who was treating me relayed to me about the same problem. So what this bill does is simply arranges a predetermined call between the insurer and the provider. So the provider is not treating a patient when a call comes in and cannot leave that patient, so the call then gets delayed. Or the treatment gets denied. This provides for a predetermined call or contact on website to get the medical treatment approved. And that's all it does, Mr. Speaker. Are there any questions? You have a couple to your left, representing Kelly. Does recognize for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman yield. Yes. Isn't it true, Mr. Chairman, that in committee, we heard far too many examples of where these health insurers, providers, are getting in between the doctor and their patient? And that this, by adopting this measure, will help provide patients in their healthcare solutions to Georgia's. That is true. This will help remove some of the delayed healthcare treatment. Thank you. To your left, representing, Blyssa Campbell has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield for a question? Is it not true that this bill will provide a formalized process for patients to directly connect with their healthcare providers in order to discuss their treatment, maybe their operations or medication, thereby strengthening relationship between patient and their healthcare providers? Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it does. Thank you for the question. Thank you for bringing this very beneficial bill for Georgia's. Okay. Representative Matthew, and you have several other questions. But I'm going to recognize, Representative Matthew, at the center, I'll go on your right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that this bill aims to delay treatment for our patients, and it will improve and enhance our patient care? Yes, it will. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. Mr. Bell. Gentlemen, you go for another question. Yes, sir. Representative Hethner has recognized for a question. To your left, right up the center. Oh. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Is it true that this bill does offer better relations between providers and patients, but it also does not interfere with any veteran's care in this state? All of their care remains intact. Yes, ma'am. It does. You're correct. And thank you for that question. Thank you, sir, for this bill. One more question, Dr. Nisa. Dr. Nisa, Representative Jones. I got it right this time, then. The lady's recognized. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, he does. Thank you for this bill. Is it not true that in the event a patient's insurance doesn't cover their prescription? The patient could now speak with their health care provider to ask for alternative suggestions. Therefore, reducing potential costs of everyday Georgians may face. That's a very good question. The answer is yes. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, you manage to get all the health care professionals on one team here. That's pretty awesome. You may have no further questions. Well, I'll ask for your valuable consideration. Thank you. The gentleman is yielding the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none the report the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 197, the yeas are 174, the nays are zero. This bill can receive a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 7777? House Bill 77, my representative, Franklin of the 160th and others to be titled back to men art before chapter 6 of Title 40. The fiscal to Georgia and Title relating the right of way for operators and motor vehicles. So as the revised responsibility of motor vehicle operators when encountering a funeral procession. This bill I'm referring to the committee, I'm motor vehicle, second committee recommends a dis bill, do pass. He is from Stilsen. General from Stilsen, down in Bullock County is recognized, representing Franklin to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. So colleagues, I rise to present House Bill 77 to you today and this bill you've heard last session we passed out of this house, this body. It went to the Senate and it got passed out of there, went to the floor and just ran out of time. But this is again the funeral procession bill and what it does basically is when you are, when you have own coming traffic for the funeral procession, you have to pull over to the side of the road to let that go by and just give them the right of way. For many of us we do that normally, it's a natural thing that we do but there's the growing population in certain rural areas. Some people don't know to do that and they haven't been doing it. And what it's causing is it's causing a public safety issue because the S courts for that funeral procession is being encountered with own coming traffic at times. And so we want to make sure that nobody gets hurt in the future. There hasn't been any recorded injuries that I know of but there's been a lot of almost. So we just want to make sure that everybody's safe and secure in Georgia. So ask for your considerable vote on this bill and if there's any questions I'm happy to dance from. Representative Punoi is recognized to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with the gentleman you? I am. So just a quick question. Isn't that true that this bill will provide for greater courtesy and safety, for all those involved and also just show more respect for those that are grieving? It absolutely will. I appreciate you stating that. Thank you. Gentlemen, has to have further questions. I want to thank him. I think this shows the ultimate respect of a life lived. So thank you for bringing this bill and provide safety as well.

So thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker, you're the well. Is there an objection to previous question being ordered? Here in none the previous question is ordered. Is there objection to a range of the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none the report the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? All members voted for what purpose is represented? You're the rise. Parliamentary incurred, Mr. Speaker. The State's inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that House Bill 77 aims to clarify existing traffic laws to ensure that funeral possessions can proceed safely and without unnecessary interruption on two lane highways? Gentlemen, those are what he speaks and additionally adds an opportunity to show folks to allow folks to show their respect. Have all members voted? All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 77, the yeas are 171, the nays are two. This bill, having received a request, that constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the House Bill 144? 144. House Bill 144 by represent of Newton, 127 of the others being taught on act 2, amend chapter 7, a total 4080, the fiscal to Georgia annotated related income taxes. So as revised, the tax credit for certain medical perceptor rotations, this bill, I refer to the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Martin Newton is recognized to present the bill. Representative Newton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's good to be with you all today. HB 144 expands and continues an important program in medical training across Georgia. Many of you know we're 40th in the nation and a number of physicians per capita. We know that may have effects on maternal mortality, mental health conditions, and others. The good news is this legislature has been working hard to expand the number of physicians in Georgia through various measures, expand the number of nurse practitioners and PAs as well. And this is an important part of it. As you know, Mercer has had a recent expansion of their medical school into Columbus, Athens, now has a growing medical campus, the Medical College of Georgia's expanded campus. Class sizes and we've added it, Georgia Southern and Savannah, a new medical school. We also have new nurse practitioner and PAs programs. A crucial part of your training as a physician occurs in a tertiary care hospital. That's where you get the rarest conditions and the most serious things. But it's also an important part is the hands-on training you get out in the community in rural areas, urban areas, just practices directly with patients. And instead of a long line of residents and others between a med student and a physician, you're one on one with that physician. And that's what House Bill 144 continues. It continues the program we have now of medical preceptors. There is a tax credit program for the physicians and nurse practitioners and PAs who agreed to take in a student in training and keep them for a month. There's a credit of $1,000 or $750 for that month-long training. It's an important part of how we train physicians. It's an important part of the hands-on part of what we do. We have added in this bill, Dennis, as well, that are willing to take in. We've got a new dental school at Georgia Southern and Savannah, as well. So we need our dentist to do the same idea that they can train dental students who need to get some sort of community practice. So that's what House Bill 144 does. It removes an expiration that would have occurred next year. It tends it to 2030, does limit it to $6 million a year. It's an important part of us getting the moving forward in the medical care fields that we need to have the number of physicians, PAs, and nurse practitioners. They're well trained in the community, as well as in our major hospitals and acute care. So I hope you'll feel confident supporting this measure. House Bill 144. Jim, one has a question. Rept. Any butner to your left? Is your recognize for a question? I certainly do. It is. Okay. Isn't it true that we've been putting an awful lot of resources into making sure that we have larger classes of medical students and that when they go into the communities, these preceptorships help us keep those students in Georgia rather than leaving them going other places? The ladies is absolutely right. In addition to the work we're doing in graduate medical education, GME, that residency training, they'll be able to rotate in a rural area or with a community physician in an urban area is priceless for both their training. It's also an important way that our physicians are able to give back to those who are coming along to replace some of us that are closer to retirement than others. So I appreciate the question and the support. Yes. I hope everybody will vote for it as a good bill. Thank you. Thank you. I think I can recognize for a question. There's German yield. Certainly. Isn't it true that providers that participate in this program takes away from their patient time and gives that to the student and their education? You're absolutely right. It gives them a real world experience with the electronic medical records, electronic health records that we're all required to learn. That takes time for the physician and the staff, an extra computer. There are some significant costs involved in efficiencies if you will on bringing some in with you. But I'm just glad that hundreds of my fellow physicians are willing to do it. They did it when I was a student many years ago and I look forward to the ones who are doing it now. Thank you. Gentlemen, has a further question, but I have a question for him. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, if you're yield for this question. Certainly. You have a colleague that's worked. I've done a lot of work on this one. And I want to thank before the members of this House and I know you, I think you're joining me in thanking Chairman Butch Parrish for what he's done to make sure that graduate medical education is successful in this state. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know you've worked an awful lot on this initiative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're right. We do build on the shoulders of others and many of the builds we do here. This is definitely one way we look forward to continuing with this body support. Thank you. I bet he votes yes on this one. Let's see what he does. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered after the gentleman yielded the well? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Have no rise. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State you inquiry. Sir is it not true that in 2024 the graduating class from Augusta University's medical program we only maintained 12% of that student population in our internal workforce. And I am supporting this bill because we look forward to these efforts improving those percentages. Lady knows what she speaks could not agree with her anymore. For what purpose is represented? Jordan Ridley-Rise? He-waste. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 144 the yeas are 171 the nays are two. The bill, haven't received the records at cost to show majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of House Bill 129? House Bill 129, my representative, canton of the 170 second to be a title of the act to amend Code Section 485, 7.4 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's related to preferential assessment for bona fide, conservation, use property and bona fide residential transitional property. So it's to remove a limitation on lease property. This bill will have referred to the committee on ways of means that committee recommends disbilled and duke pass. Who are representative Chaz? Ken is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have House Bill 129. This is a topic I have a good bit of experience with and that is our conservation use laws. The same bill you might recognize it passed almost unanimously out of the house last year and never got caught up in the Senate. Just got hung up on Sonny Die. It also came out as a recommendation from the Senate study committee this year on the preservation of farmland. The bill incorporates all the original Kuva qualifying restrictions for eligibility, but it does add some flexibility for our non-family farm entities. You are seeing a little bit of a shift in our farming practices these days from family farms to farm operations who are owned by folks that are not related by a bloated marriage. That's the qualifying fact under a family farm. But the key component to the language is that the land must remain in agricultural use. That's the key component of the Kuva laws. The goal in crafting this legislation was to maintain and strengthen the integrity of the conservation use law, but also provide some leeway in the code to reflect the reality of today's farming operations. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker. I'll ask for your favorite consideration. I'll stand for questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. I yield the will, Mr. Speaker. Jim, as yielded the will, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Very none. The report of the committee is agreed to, shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted for what purpose is ripped in the NISA Jones rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Just date you inquiry. Thank you. Is it not true that this bill provides family-owned farms with greater flexibility by permitting leases to non-family members without jeopardizing their conservation use status? I'll say to the lady who certainly read the bill and knows of what she speaks. The purpose is representative Meeks rise. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Rule 133, I ask to be excused from this vote. Gentlemen, we'll be so noted in the record. All members now voted. All members voted. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of House Bill 129, the yeas are 165. The nays are 7. The bill hasn't received the requisite constitutional majority as they're four past. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 465, 465? House Bill 465, by Representative Gillier, 160 second and others being titled an act to amend Article 7 of Chapter 3, Title 35 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tate, ruling the statewide alert system for missing disabled adults, so as to provide for the autism missing person alert system act. This bill ever through the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security, that committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative from Chatham County, Representative Gillier, is recognized to present the bill. Give the gentleman your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My brothers and sisters, I present to you today House Bill 465. This is Georgia's bill for Georgia's people. Many people every day we come into this house and we really don't know what individuals are going through. I am the 10th child in a family that has been girded by a lot of love, but my youngest brother is a good person that I have watched and shadowed as a big brother. He suffers from Down syndrome and autism. Last year, he was probably an instant away from losing his leg and I reached out to one of the members here to ask for some help and guidance. Sometimes he would even wander. I prayed that he would not wander and we would not be able to have another casualty. This is Georgia's bill because there are so many individuals that have a family member, whether it is a child or whether it is an adult that might suffer or I'm not going to suffer, it might be walking in their life with autistic qualities. This bill is a saving lives one at a time bill. Let me just share with you, there are other cities that this bill mimics in the matter of Maddie's law and this is a bill that simply gives an alert system to help us find our loved ones quicker if we gravitate and get lost and most of them gravitate to highways and waterways unfortunately. Let me read two individuals that we were unfortunate to lose. In 2024, there was a 16 year old named Connor Mathis who had autism. He went missing from a church camp on Jack O'Lyle in Georgia and despite a massive search by law enforcement and volunteers, Connor's body was found the next day. The search was complicated by Connor's autism which may have been made harder for authorities and volunteers to understand his behavior or how to approach him. In 2024, there was Kaira Williams, a young boy with autism, he went missing from his home in the cab county Georgia around 6.30 pm. In despite search efforts by law enforcement and volunteers, his body was found around 2.30 am and upon just feasts away from his house. This bill is Georgia's bill and saving lives because we can help others find their loved ones and help law enforcement with the tools to find them quicker. There are other states and cities such as Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois, New York, Houston, Texas and Phoenix that have established this law. I'm asking for your favorable consideration and saving lives one at a time in initiating this autism missing person alert system in Georgia. Mr. Speaker, if there are any questions I will entertain them at this time. General, I have a couple of questions to your left. Representative Petrie is recognized for a question. How you owe it to the gentleman? My friend, is it not true that individuals with autism when they're missing have a high propensity as you pointed out to migrate to water, very dangerous and moreover, a lot of people don't understand because of their lack of social skills are often highly subject to human trafficking. Is that not true? The gentleman knows from what you speak. And there's a gentleman you owe for one further point. I'd yield to the gentleman. Is it not true that having information about individuals specifically with autism to know their special traits allows law enforcement to more easily find and know how to deal with those individuals once they're found? That is correct. Thank you. Thank you. Holly, to your left, is it recognized for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you owe it to the gentleman? Thank you, sir. Is it not true that this bill, once its past, will allow for our law enforcement officers to be able to get really good instructions about how to search for these individuals with autism, particularly even those who may go to water. A go to places around there that are very hard to find. This is not allowed them the ability to do that. The gentleman, Bolly, knows from what you speak. This will help save lives and help our greatest law enforcement help save lives also. Do you further yield? I yield. And is it not true that this bill, which requires for personal care facilities to be able to reach out within 30 minutes that they find that that individual has autism, get them the help that they need as soon as possible? I am confident that this will, and it is under the jurisdiction of the GBI, and I think that will help us feed up a lot of the surges from convenience stores to public service announcements and the like. The gentleman knows from what he speaks. Well, as a former gymnastics instructor for autistic children and why WCA, I appreciate you bringing this bill. Thank you. Mr. Hilton, do you relapse his recognize for a question? Thank you Mr. Speaker, is gentleman yield? I yield to my sweet state. Is it not true that we have a son with Down syndrome and his name is Chase, and we should not have named him that because we have been known to chase him. We do have several friends in the disability community who have experienced exactly what this bill is for, and is it not true? This will help these families out tremendously. The gentleman knows from what he speaks. Great Bill, thank you. Thank you. I represent a hearing to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? A yield for the lady. Thank you so much for this bill. It's personal to me as I'm a former educator, so I really appreciate this bill. Is it not true that individuals with autism spectrum disorder face unique safety risk when they are go missing, making it critical to expand Maddie's call to include them? The gentleman lady knows from what she speaks. It mimics and plugs right into Maddie's call system, and it's been successful for those that have been disabled, and I'm sure it would be very effective in helping us save lives for those with autism. Again, thank you so much for this bill. Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker, I know it is close to a much time for some folks. I ask for everyone in here if you have a family member or know someone to vote in favor of House Bill 465 saving lives one at a time. Mr. Speaker, I yield the welcome. We thank the gentleman for the bill. He is, you are the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no end, Mr. Clerk. Will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Carlton, how are you? I'm parliamented in. Quarer, Mr. Speaker. The State of the N Quarer Sir. Isn't it true that those with autism like my granddaughter Camille may become so intensely focused on something of interest that she will lose track of her surroundings? I know that gentleman personally knows how it can impact the families. Thank you for the question. The gentleman knows of what he speaks. Fort Purpose is representative Hitchens, rise. Parliamentary inquiry. The State of the N Quarer Sir. Isn't it true that the State of the N Quarer Sir has 13 helicopters all that are equipped with forward looking infrared and they spend 30, 40% of their flight time looking for lost people including those with autism, Alzheimer's and just people who are lost in the woods? I'm sure the gentleman with his past knows exactly what he speaks and we're fortunate to have that resource. I would just say patrol does a marvelous job, public safety. patrol Hitchens is doing a great job leading that organization and now all members voted, all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 465, the Yees are 172, the Nays are 0. This Bill here in the City of Records, the Constitutional Majority is therefore passed. We're going to break for lunch but we have a couple of announcements about lunch so I'm going to recognize Representative Gaby-Coyay for an announcement. Representative Coyay, Chairman Corbett and Representative Moore, excuse me, just a Coyay. I'm sorry, those are into the day. This was about lunch. Representative is recognized.
