TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning everybody. If you would please come in and have a seat and we'll we'll begin our meeting.
I'm going to ask Dean Green to open us up with a word of prayer when I talk to him. It's more than asking to be sure and put a little emphasis on patience today. So Dean.
He did ask me to say that, and he also said for those members on the wall that the plate
will be passed directly after.
Let us pray.
Dear Father in heaven, we thank you that we have you and the light of your spirit to guide
us today.
And we will find, oh Lord, that we have a great task before us, and we do pray for that
patience and we pray that when we leave here that your will will have been done.
We thank you that we may live in the moment of your spirit that we will take each moment
and know that it is important in the lives of individuals.
And as we serve the people of this day, let us be mindful of our duties and responsibilities.
Father, we just pray that you will be with us each step
of the way today.
Bless us now, Father, guide us and direct us in all things.
And we just pray this in the holy name, amen.
Thank you, Dean.
Before we get started this morning,
I'd like to recognize the leader of frustration.
He wants to make an announcement.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, in addition to this being a very exciting day
due to being Sonny Dye, we also have a special day
because it is Leo Chanci's birthday, the incredible.
OK.
Leo, just want to thank you for your great work,
making the Rules Committee run.
So effectively, assist in the chairman
and hope you have a great birthday.
Thank you, Mr. Leo.
I can't say enough about Leo and Ms. Lewis and Dan in our office up there.
They really have done a terrific job for us.
Thank you so much.
Okay, I'm going to call the rules standing committee to order right now.
And we're going to recognize Chairman Anderson to explain House Resolution 885.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Resolution 885 is a resolution calling for a House Study Committee to look
the elections procedures in the state of Georgia as I took over the
responsibility of chairing our governmental affairs committee which I've
sat on for the previous four years and I know that we have we've done a lot of
work in elections to promote integrity we've had some seeing increased
participation increased confidence in our elections but I do feel like it's
time for this body to study the procedures the policies and everything around
our elections process in this state to determine how to proceed and go forward with
legislation in the future. And, Mr. Chairman, I would ask for the committee's
favorable consideration. Okay, we've got a couple of questions for you.
Whip Barring. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Anderson, have we ever done study
committees before filings or passing and acting some of these ominous election
bills, whether it's SB 202 or others, and can you recall when is the last year in which
we did not pass legislation that impacts our elections? Because again, I think my understanding
and concern to a certain extent is, you know, we are doing all these things without necessarily
understanding the impact of some of these rules in which I think it may be, I recognize
the intent of this but it this also gives me concern quite frankly as to you
know what this may result in given all the past actions that for some
members of my community you know they've been you know harmed to a certain
extent. Okay and thank you for that question and the question basically gets to
the whole intent of this committee. This is my fifth year serving in this body
and in the five years I've been here we have looked at and attempted many
elections, law changes and considered many bills. In the time that I've been here, I'm
not aware of a study committee. I do know that Senate Bill 202 came from a special committee
on election integrity, which looked in depth at the concepts that were proposed in that
bill and eventually passed into law. So I do think it's high time that we take a close
look at the entire procedure. Okay, we have a question of representative Evans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the Chairman of the podium. It seems to me that if a study
committee is just going to have members of the legislature, which this one proposes, then
it would make more sense for the standing committee to just have a series of meetings.
But since there seems to be a desire to have a study committee, would you be opposed to
amendments to direct that there also be members of the committee that are not legislators
and that we make sure, for example, some that I'm thinking of would be election board
chairs or election board members from our counties and making sure that we spread those
out between Metro, Middle, North, and South Georgia, also perhaps some lawyers who specialize
in election law and there may be other stakeholders that we want to include, would you be amenable
to such amendments?
I, of course, am amenable to the will of the committee and the intent of this was to have
the speaker select amongst the House of Representatives, the members he would prefer
to see in this, of course, with consultation.
So to your question directly, I'm standing here presenting this request and at the will
of the committee.
Thank you.
Okay.
Lady Hughley.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
was getting to my question as to why the committee couldn't just study it on its own, but since
I do have the mic, I would like to ask the chair to think about not imposing new rules
in an election year because we don't want citizens to participate and not be confused
about what the election procedures and laws are.
So that would be the only thing that I request.
Also, I would request that possibly making an amendment
such that there would be equal representation
on this committee of the minority
so that we can have all perspective at the table
when we do this deep dive.
Okay, I'll put Jim Jones at a question.
Yes.
Do you say, Mr. Chairman, that it is most common with how study committees that they are comprised of legislators, not non-legislators, and then you rely on the very persons that have been suggested from all walks of life that could give input but would not be officially on the committee so that you would have more flexibility?
Thank you for that question and I would agree with that the study committees I have served on and chaired in the past have been comprised of all House members however the intent of the study committee is not necessarily with a predetermined in game is to study the subject matter to accept testimony from the experts and my fear is if we invite outside experts or particular bodies we're going to leave people out and we're going to leave a perspective out.
The best option is to have the legislative body as the committee and then the testimony comes from those people so thank you
Chairman Martin
Mr
Chairman
Isn't it true that there are many things that have involved in the election process that don't directly
Interface with the public and isn't it true that I've received many calls
And I think you and I have spoken about the logistics of the back office of how the ballots get from one place to be counted
security of the ballots before and after the counting isn't that what you're
talking about in lines five through eight that those things are not public
facing but very important to the public isn't that not what you're trying to do
here okay we've heard the explanation of the presentation on House
resolution 885. Do I hear a motion do pass? Have a motion to pass and a second is
their opposition. Excuse me. Okay what's your amendment? Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd
like to ask the committee to consider two amendments and I can put them in one
motion or two. Put them together. Okay. It's easier. On lines 20 between the
representatives and as determined, insert the words with equal numbers from
majority and minority parties but otherwise. So the tenants would read the
committee shall be composed of a number of members of the House of
Representatives with equal numbers from the majority and minority parties but
otherwise as determined and appointed by the speaker of the House of
Representatives. And then the second part of the amendment would be to insert
after that period, the Senate's, the speaker shall also appoint citizen members representing
at least the following. Three election board chairs representing Metro, North, South,
and Middle Georgia counties. And the purpose of the first amendment, Mr. Chairman, and members
is that unlike a lot of study committees, I think it's even more important that we have
equal representation among the parties because we're dealing with elections and we want
there to be integrity in the process.
We want to ensure absolute fairness.
We want to ensure that the public accepts the results,
not as a partisan effort, but as a joint bipartisan effort.
And then the reason for the county election board members
is that we do so much that ultimately becomes the job
of these individuals.
And so while sometimes, and I expect this committee would hear
testimony from all sorts of stakeholders,
we would want these county election board chairs
from these various types of counties to be represented.
so they could be involved in the entirety of the discussion
to make sure that they get all their questions answered
and perspectives considered,
so we don't put undue burden on them.
And I know I have served on study committees
where like for example, on higher education,
we had representatives from both TCSG and the region.
So this is certainly not unorthodox
and I would say is just respectful
the fact that we'll be passing potentially
talking about changes that will impact them.
And so I would move that as a motion for the consideration of the committee.
Okay.
You've heard the motion.
Is there a second?
Okay.
Now we'll have any other discussion on that.
Okay.
We will vote on the motion.
All those in favor of adding the amendment to the resolution will say yes.
All those opposed will say no.
No.
Noes have it.
Okay.
We're back to the motion to do pass out of the committee on House Resolution 885 all those in favor say aye
Those opposed. We know
It carries so it will come out of the committee with a do pass recommendation
Thanks, sir. Thank you. All right now. We're going to adjourn the rules standing committee and
convened the committee on rules
that will set the calendar for day 40.
One item of housekeeping.
I would like to have a motion on Senate bill 260
that it be returned to committee.
Be recommitted.
Have a motion and a second.
Any discussion?
All those in favor say aye.
Any opposed?
It's back in the committee.
Okay, now we're ready to take requests. Yes, ma'am, chairman.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Happy signing day. We're here. We're finally here. I am here to represent Senate Bill 91. It's on the third page up at the top.
And what this bill does is it melds two measures together.
I bring before you the measure that was adopted March 6th through the house and it stalled
over in the Senate.
This is a supplemental metagap bill for patients with Lou Gehrig's and end-stage renal disease
helps them to be qualified for Medicare under 65 and then that way they can buy Medigap
insurance for transplant, kidney transplant.
The other piece to this is a measure that helps men under 65 be able to have prostate
exams and some education attached to that.
Okay, you've got a question for you, President Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author here.
Just a question.
Did you research and see whether or not this bill singled out
pharmacist or how it looks over the board?
It doesn't, it won't affect the pharmacist at all.
This is just Medicare for people under 65.
and then the prostate piece is for under 65, too.
But it doesn't affect pharmacy
or the drug piece to Medicare.
Okay, don't see any other questions, thank you.
It is a substitute, yes.
Did you have another one?
Pardon me?
No, sir, that was two pieces, thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I've got SB 179. It's on page three toward
the bottom. This bill requires students to take a computer science class or a CTAE course
embedded with computer science beginning in the 2031-32 school year. It changes the
reimbursement cost of tuition for the Georgia virtual school because that has not been
adjusted since 2012 and it requires private online virtual schools to report
enrollment of students to the students home school district. This is so we can
better track chronic absenteeism and this is LC 492411S. Okay, don't see any
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Good morning.
I'm here to present HR 304, which proposes a house study committee to look at the health
care costs of smoking.
I want to first in particular thank some of the co-sponsors who are here who have supported
this issue for at least the past five years including doctors, Newton and Hawkins,
Chair Cooper, Chair Stevens, Dean Green, and also across the whole way Senators Albers,
Huff Settler, and Robertson.
So what this study committee would aim to do is look at the costs incurred by the significant
burden of smoking in this state.
This could include looking at Medicaid costs, cost to Medicare and private insurance,
also looking at geographic distribution and variability in how these costs are incurred
and borne.
So impacts on the workforce, impacts on children, asthma rates, school absenteeism, and if it
is the will of the community to look at also the healthcare costs of vapes, which as we
know is more born in younger patients.
Ideally, we would identify areas for intervention and for cost saving and also possible readily
generation for the state.
I'm happy to take any questions.
Okay.
And don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Jim Clark.
Thank you, Chairman.
I've asked for a Senate bill of 101, page three, on a modified structure.
And Senate bill of 101, it's the original and my original house bill, 87 language that
we passed, almost unanimously, minus two votes.
It allows those who need orthotics and prosthetics to be able to get additional ones so they can
do just simple things like go shower.
So it got kind of late and open the Senate and so the sponsor let me take out his original language and put mine in
I'll be glad to answer any questions on that one
Okay, don't see any questions. I have one more house resolution 817. It's a house study committee on drones another bill. We passed out
The bill number and this would just it got held up in the Senate and this would just dig more into drones
Now security keeping our community safe and just ask for house resolution 817. Any questions?
You have a question for you. You're heugly.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Oh, on your 101. What was your bill number that we're replacing here?
House bill 87. That was the orthotics prosthetics. Thank you. Okay. No more questions. Thank you.
Yes ma'am.
Good morning Mr. Chairman, members. This is for House Resolution 753. It's a house
study putting together house study on improving access to internal medicine in
rural areas with the challenges in those areas being getting health care into
the rural areas consistently getting doctors into the rural areas
consistently and perhaps being able to bring a mobile unit and see what that
looks like. Okay don't see any questions thank you. Yes sir we do Kelly. Thank
you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee I'll be asking for a committee sub
on Senate Bill 10 to the LC481626S. That simply does is codifies and
clarifies the way that judicial officers are selected and appointed in judicial
So I have at least 15 superior court judges.
Passed and you did share a committee unanimously.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
That's your favorite consideration.
Here we go.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm asking for a committee sub for Senate Bill 218.
I'm also going to sub 218.
This is cleaned up language for the prosecuting
attorney's qualifications commission.
What it does is it moves, I'll take the highlights.
moves the commission from the PAC prosecuting Attorney's Council to the AOC
Administrative Office of Courts to solve some conflict of interest issues. It
clears up that a state employee, the D.A.R. judge who is on one of the panels may
be reimbursed by their office or by the P.A.Q.C. meetings but not by both. It
cleans up that the rules, the rules were not approved and adopted until April
the first 2024, so the cases that they're hearing won't be before that process or that
time period. It fixes that they hired an executive director, where the law actually says
director, clarifies the appeals process, says that it starts with a Ph.U.C. then is
appealable to the Superior Court, the Appellate Court, then the Supreme Court. And then lastly,
it modifies the confidentiality for the DAs and solicitor generals so that they can find
out about complaints made against them but dismissed before reaching the public
stage. It also specifically addresses their concern that if a complainant
publicizes that they filed with the P.A.Q.C. that they can tell the DA or the
solicitor what's going on so that they can respond publicly. I'd have happy to
answer any questions.
Do you have a question here in the
I'd received a call from some of the sheriff's regarding when portion of this I
I guess that last section are you familiar with their concern?
Yeah, so this is why the big reason why we're doing the amendment
and committee it was amended and it was added to all lawyers
and good standing carry a gun in the court.
We would just to the back to the latest Senate had originally.
OK, thank you.
OK, I don't see any more questions.
Thank you so much.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman, if you read that yesterday's report
It's pretty sick before we get it.
It was, my people are still going over it,
but yeah, it was a lengthy journal yesterday,
so hope to have it done by 10 o'clock.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee
honor to present a House Resolution 816 on page two
of the blue sheet.
This creates a study committee with two focus areas.
Number one, creating a abuse registry
for our at-risk populations.
And number two, how to improve service delivery
of state resources to individuals with disabilities.
Okay, I don't see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Okay, any members of the committee?
Chair Lady Taylor.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, committee.
I'd like to ask for House Resolution 847.
And this is to do a House Study Committee on the Funding for Public Health.
And it's just, we put a lot of stress on our public health and we want to make sure they're getting the funds they need.
Okay. Chairman Martin, you have a request?
Go ahead.
House resolution 429.
As we passed earlier this year, the move toward next generation 9-1-1
in Georgia is going to have extended expanse.
Landline phones are going one way so we're just gonna we would suggest we would look at how to fund that system in the in the go forward in the future for Georgia
Resolution 887 which would help evaluate our education code and kind of look at the cumulative burden
and what maybe we can do to clean up any obsolete measures
that are impacting our public schools.
Thank you, Chairman Erwin, for his help with this.
Okay.
Kevin Newton, you have a request.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the committee, I bring H.R. 593,

to look at both maternal care, prenatal care
and pediatric care, neonatal, including the transfer
arrangements of making sure which ones are the right size that are long-term
sustainable and how we how we fund these in such a way that that strength
them scare in particular across rural Georgia and some challenging areas.
Okay, Kelly Dipsy.
Yes, good morning Mr. Chairman. House Resolution 611, House Study Committee for

studying chronic absenteeism since COVID,
chronic absenteeism is what I'll tell you all time.
High of over 22% of our students.
Okay
Let's see
Leader ifstration you had a request
Thank you, miss chairman. I'd like to present proposed committee substitute SB 207 this legislation deals with licensing
Awards consideration of criminal histories
What this substitute would do would narrow the bill to
to firefighters who may have criminal histories would allow the board to consider the circumstances
of those past criminal convictions.
It's in the spirit of criminal justice form, but it's very narrowly tailored bill to
area of firefighters.
That's for the committee's favorable consideration.
Okay.
Chairman Powell, did you view your item?
I'd like to ask for SB 204 as a substitute came over from the Senate deals with criminal
procedures that the DAs may use accusations of it in the grand jury on certain offenses
that aren't serious, violent, felony, sexual offenses and some of those types.
Second part of this is we're bumping up the preemption requirements on second amendment
laws to put teeth back into that that seems to be eroding and the substitutes on the
desk. Okay, thank you sir. Okay, let's set a calendar for today, day 40, under modified
