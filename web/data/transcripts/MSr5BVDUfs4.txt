As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the Seventh House District, representing John and Chastain. I've given him a little leeway too. He has a little couple of introductions he needs to make in addition to the chaplain. Representative Chastain. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues, and I hope everybody's having a really good start of their day today. Really excited to be here today to introduce our chaplain, my pastor, Brother Denny Hawkins. I want to introduce his wife, Amy, that's here with him this morning. And my wife, Stacy, who many of you know in the chamber. And I also got special, two special guests with me up in the gallery this morning. My mom and dad's here. Welcome, mom and dad. Thank y'all. Appreciate that. Thank you. Deany has three daughters and two beautiful granddaughters. I've known Denny for many, many years. Plates and church leagues off-ball against him many years ago. He's an extremely hard worker for his church. He works a plus, he works a full-time job. And he also has a heavily involved in a prison ministry back in Blue Ridge. Our church is helping hand church that we built a little over 30 years ago. And Denny has been our pastor for the past, approximately 20 years of that Denny has been our pastor. And what I want to say about Brother Denny this morning before he comes up. And all of that 20 years, I mentioned this at our Pastor Appreciation Day last month that we had. But all those 20 years I've never seen Brother Denny unprepared to stand before his church and bring a message. And when I say unprepared, I mean he's, he studies over it. He prays over it. And he asks for the good Lord above to guide him as he brings a message to our church. And there's no doubt in my mind that he'll be, it'll be the same way this morning. So it's an honor to be here, an honor to introduce Brother Denny Hawkins. Well, good morning. First I want to thank Speaker Burns. I want to thank each and every one of y'all. Brother Johnny, I want to thank you for just the mention of, if I'd be willing to come and stand this morning and open with a little bit of scripture reading and prayer. And I know this is common for y'all. And I want to say this. I want to thank God that it is common. With the work that you have to do, it should be heavily stressed that we need guidance. My mom and dad had 11 kids and they believed in guidance, the old time guidance. And we understood that with certain actions, came certain consequences. So we also realized that in life that you needed to work for things. And this morning I hear just humbly. I don't deserve to stand and mention the name of Lord, but by his great grace. I'm saved by that grace. I call the cordon of that grace and would simply just like to share a little bit with you today. I'm not very good at writing things out and going along with it. I try. But usually I, I, I, veer off course, you might say. But I do realize that I've been given a time limit today. And that's for y'all's benefit. But I do want to say this morning again, I'm greatly honored and humbled to be here. The second thing that I'd like to say is I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your service. As you represent the many people across our great state. And I know you do it well. You wouldn't be here if you didn't care about your communities. And thirdly, I want to say this. I realize with the service that you do, it comes with great personal sacrifice at times. There's things that you have to let go at home to be here for the important things you need to do. And I know it's tough. But as I prayed and saw the Lord's guidance on what I might say, especially in a short time frame, there was one thing that I felt just kept coming across to me that Lord would lead me in is just simply the, the need for a servant. The need for somebody to be willing to do for others, to stand for them, to speak for them, to hold the line. And I know you're here representing your districts. And I want to say this on behalf of our representative. He's my friend. He's my brother in Christ. And as he said, I've known him for many years. And I trust him. I can be at home and blurried to your journey and not worry about what he's doing here because I know he's not here on a selfish motive, but seeking the betterment of our community. And I'm sure I could say the same about you. But the Word of God says in Matthew chapter 20, verses 20 and 21, then came to him the mother of Zebed, he's children, whether sons worship in him and desire a certain thing of him. And he said unto her, what will thou? And she said unto him, grant that these my two sons may see it, the one on thy right hand, and their other on thy left and thy kingdom. Verse 24 says, and when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. But Jesus called him unto him and said, you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercised dominion over them. And they that are great exercise authority upon them, but it shall not be so.

among you. But whosoever will be great among you, letting be your minister, your servant. And whosoever will be chief among you, letting be your servant. Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered in two, but the minister and to give his life a ransom for many. And that being said, James and John were the sons of Zabidi and they were seeking a higher seat, a request and after all they sent Mama. I mean, who's going to refuse Mama? Jesus just simply responded you, you actually don't understand what you're asking. That's not mine to give. As the other disciples were aggravated about the request and no doubt we would have probably been the same way. It's selfish, it's self seeking. And after all they've followed their Savior and just saw him only serve. And as they were angered and moved with indignation, the Bible says that Jesus called them together and he said, society has a way with those of the authority, exercise authority. If they're not careful, they use that and they can oppress. He said, but that's not what it's going to be with you. He said, if you long to be great, if you desire to accomplish something, if you desire that your name would mean more than just anything common, he said, serve. Be more concerned about others' needs than your own. Stand when they can't stand for themselves. And after all, as we read on Jesus said this, even as I came not to be served, but to serve. What a greater example do we have? Then Lord of all, humbly, taken on the form of a servant. That being said, I want to turn right quickly. I told my wife, I might get you to make a gesture at me when my time is running up and then we can't sell that on the way down. Because I don't know what that gesture might be. But I just want to say this quickly. The apostle power says in a Philippians chapter 2 verse 3 says, let nothing be done. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. Don't be selfish. But in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves. And you're here today for that very purpose. Not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. If you're going to think, think this way. Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took on him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient under death, even the death of the cross. See, those that believe what this word says, we can't escape the command that the Lord would give us and that's to humble ourselves. I've heard some say, you know, we just need the Lord to omel us. Be careful with that. Actually the word of God says, humble yourselves. We humble ourselves how we honor ourselves under the mighty hand of God. We are in wherever all of his authority, but yet in his great authority, what did he do for us? He took on the form of a servant and he humbled himself and he became obedient. And this wasn't easy if you think it was easy, just spend a little time reading the prayer and get simile. But the Bible said he became obedient and he humbled himself even to the point of the death of the cross and what great sacrifice. And as I prepare to close here this morning and as we get ready to pray, I know I do this at church, don't stand yet. May we be reminded this morning that the greatest thing that we could ever accomplish in this life is not self-seeking. If you want to do good in this world that we live in, we don't need more people pushing authority. We need those that are willing to serve, to help those that are around them, to be what they can't be for themselves and to speak, what has to be spoken. Again, I want to thank you. Thank you for your time this morning. And when I'm done, I'll have some pictures taken and he'll all be just a great experience for me, but it's work as usual for you. I don't know what the day holds for you. It may be a long evening. I pray you have a short day, a good, productive day. But know this that we realize that you're sacrificing a lot and we're praying for you. Brother Johnny, I've seen a lot of things do sacrifice in this short time. And I thank you for your community's better. Now load. We just stand as we pray. Our most kind and gracious Heavenly Father, we come to you this morning grateful. Grateful Lord that you know our needs before we even ask. Father, if we but humble ourselves before you today, God, we know Heavenly Father, Lord that you'll lead us and you'll guide us and you'll direct us, Lord in every decision that we're to make. Lord, we pray for every representative that's here. We pray God for their district. We pray for the people. God that they are standing for. God, we pray God for the hard choices and decisions that they have to make. And again, God, we rely on you, Heavenly Father, Lord, to lead us and those things and to lead them. Now, God, we thank you, Lord, for this opportunity. We thank you, Lord, for this time that we've been allowed and we pray God above everything else that in this time, Lord, we pray that we just simply honor you. Lord, let your word be that which is most important to us that we go to, Lord, for the greatest wisdom. Help us all to work together. Heavenly Father, Lord, to better our state. Lord, it would grow and better our nation. Thank you, Lord, for each one that's here. And thank you, God, again, for this opportunity. And Christ Jesus is holy name we pray. Amen. Would you all pledge to thank you? Ligileges through the flag of the United States of America, to the Republic, which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Okay, members, you probably want to listen to these morning orders. In fact, I know you need to listen to these morning orders. What do you build? You all are rowdy crowd this morning. So, we have some important morning orders. We have a time limitation on morning orders. I'm going to extend it just a little bit. You're going to have two minutes. When that red light goes off, you need to finish up. Or I'm going to cut you off. So, we need to move on with our business for the day. So, at this time, I'm going to want to recognize Chairman Todd Jones and Representative Kennerd for a morning order. We won't start to you clearly throughout the representative. I can promise you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. We wanted to make sure that we were acknowledging today. Today is mental health day at the Capitol. And I want to thank each and every one of you for your support in terms of the efforts that we have made in the General Assembly. I want to thank the Governor. They are so many Georgians affected, not just by mental health, but by also by substance abuse and our ability to make a difference in their lives. I think it's truly one of the most meaningful things that we will do while we're here at the General Assembly. I'd like to pass it off to my colleague, our co-chair, or the mental health caucus, and he'd like to recognize a few people in the gallery. Yes, we want to recognize some of our leaders in this mental health and sets us through space, namely Commissioner Kevin Tanner, Jeff Breedlove, Kim Jones of NAMI, and Roland Bain. A couple of years ago, we put a big stake in the ground with HB1013, but that was a good start. We still have a lot of work to do as we decriminalize substance use and mental health and redirect it to the health issue that it truly is. One and a half million Georgians suffer for some kind of mental illness. And so we want to continue to move the ball forward. And thank you for your support. Commissioner Tanner will be at the South Steps. At 1 o'clock if you'd like to get a picture in your support of mental health. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, members. Chairman Hawkins, nice tie. Looks good. Now you have some friends in the gallery, I think. I do. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we have members of the Georgia Dental Association visiting us today at the Legislative Weapons Day. Would you all stand, please? Thank you for what you do for the patience of Georgia. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We really appreciate y'all being here. Thank you for the service you provided to Georgians. Got a chance to visit with a number of you this morning. Mr. President, good to see you. Glad you're here. And the first lady of the Dental Association. I'm down in Monticello, Georgia. So it's good to have y'all. Thank you for what you do. And we know that our oral health is key to our physical health. And we know that and we appreciate the service you provided, Georgians. Thank you. Come back again. Good to have y'all. Representative Hilton. Recognize for a morning order. And you have a friend as well. You got a couple of friends. There he is. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're joined today by the conservative policy leadership institute, CPLI. CPLI trains Georgia leaders to shape public policy debate into government according to conservative principles. We have several esteemed members of this body who are graduates of that program, including Beth Beskin, Mayor Michael Caldwell, Buker Epps, Bert Reeves, Lynn Riley, Sam Teasley, and the folks behind me. So if they are in the chamber, stand to be recognized. Thank you, Class of 2024, CPLI, for joining us here today. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Welcome to the People's House. Thank you for that announced for that morning order. Okay. Representative Kendrick Bennett, Willis, and Representative Higley. So Representative Kendrick, you go to the talking. Yes. I'm always glad to hear you. And you too, Representative Bennett. Do you think so? Thank our regrets. See you there. No, I won't. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. We have a special, special guest in the gallery. And I'm joined up here again by my sororities. The source of Alpha, Kappa Alpha sorority, and corporate it. But let me recognize and commend Yannis Emyr, and congratulate her on her inclusion in an auguro essence power 40 list. And continue standing. So she grew up in Atlanta. It was a long time home owner and resident in people's towns. She spent nearly a decade working for the Coca-Cola company, where she was instrumental in creating and implementing disaster relief strategy. And she is currently employed as interim head of communications in Moet, Hennessee, USA. And she, because of her acumen and community service, she was included in S's 2023 power 40 list, and this is 2023 power 40 list, is celebrating those who are moving our culture forward, all while making local, national, and even global impact. And her generous spirit was encapsulated in a quote that she put in essence that says, I get so excited when I remember that the essence of my role is to inspire and encourage people to collaborate and to celebrate. So again, let's get for a round of applause for her outstanding accomplishments. Thank you so much, House, and we'll take a picture down in the gallery. Congratulations. That's awesome. Beautiful dress too. It's good to have you. Leader Beverly, you ready? Leader James Beverly is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker, and good morning. I stand before you today to recognize constituents of the Great, the greatest House District in Georgia, House District 143, and making Bibb County. Today is mental health day to capitalize we are aware. I'm reminded of the great work that we've come together across party lines and we're going to ask to address mental health in Georgia under the leadership of the honored Speaker, Ralston, a legacy that I know is being carried forward now by the honorable Speaker, John Burns. I'd like to ask the participants of River Edge Behavioral Health Group and other guests from making to please stand. All right, Mr. Speaker, they must be somewhere else. Mr. Leader, this is an important one if they entered the gallery before our days over where we'll certainly recognize them. Thank you, Speaker. Just in conclusion, I just want to talk just real quickly about River Edge. It serves more than 10,000 Georgians annually. I want to thank the dedicated, highly trained staff for the work they do day in and day out. Mental health care, as we all know, is a crisis in Georgia. Too many people are struggling and silence. We owe it to everyone hurting, everyone who feels alone to make sure that they know there's help available. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians can't see a doctor right now for mental health or anything else. That's on us. The preacher today said, speak what has to be spoken. So I'll leave you with these words. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians just got kicked off Medicaid due to no thought that they're own. That's on us. Expand and Medicaid is the least we can do. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yielded well. Okay, members, you know the rules. Thank you, Mr. Leader. We'll recognize those folks if they get back in here. So let's keep an eye out on them. So let's see, Representative Rees, Representative Marin, Representative Roman. This is pretty cool. We all, this is going to talk about a former member and have their recognized. Let's give him just a second to get down, Representative Rees. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Speaker Burns. We've got Coleman, Brooks Coleman Middle School STEM students here today up in the gallery. I want to say something about Chairman Brooks Coleman. He is a neighbor and a friend of mine. I look up to him a lot. He's doing well. He says hello to you. His grandson Patrick Mock. He's proud of working in the budget office here at the Capitol. He was a school teacher, a school principal, going at county school official and then served this body over 20 years. And he has a middle school that bears his name. These eighth grade STEM students either went to Chattahoochie Elementary or applied to be STEM students at Coleman Middle. This time next year they'll be at Duluth High School, but they are learned about the people's house today. And we welcome you here, students. Stand up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. And welcome to the people's house. Appreciate that recognition. Cheerleading camp. You recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's an honor for me to stand here today with Chairman Dickie to welcome the members of the Upsen Leadership, sorry, Youth Upsen Leadership. I think I may have gotten that all wrong again. Youth Leadership Upsen. We're glad you're here because the program that exists there helps to identify future leaders and expose them to experiences just like this. What it's like to be in the house chamber. So thank you today. If I could have them stand and be recognized. Thank you. And thank you to Madison for all she does for the Upsen Chamber. Thank you, Madam Chair. Welcome, young people. We're glad you're here. And thank you for what you're doing. Members, we have, I want to give a special attention. We have an invite resolution that Representative Townsend will talk to us about it. In just a moment, we're going to ask the clerk to read the caption. But Mr. Clerk, you all know our rules on invite resolutions. It has to be of, this one is in the cases of worldwide significance. So I'll let the caption inform us on that. And then the representative, then Representative Townsend, will recognize our special guest and recognize her. Mr. Clerk, you'll read. House resolution 810 by Representative Townsend 179th, green to 154th. Each of you, the 166th, glad any of the 130th year to the 150th second and others. A resolution recognizing and commending Katrina Barranco. Chair, we'll recognize Representative Rick Townsend to introduce our guest and give us a little background here, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my privilege to introduce a friend of mine, who's International Quantice President. First, we're going to actually over 40 years in the state of Georgia for Georgia to be International Quantice President of over 400,000, 450,000, Colombians worldwide. Katrina is a resident of Albany, Georgia. She's serving a one-year term for Quantice International as International President. She was elected in June 2023. Katrina served on International Membership Committee, so she has service and partnership, vice chair of the Audent Finance and other committees internationally. Katrina has been a member of Quantice for over 30 years in Albany, as it's President and Secretary. She also serves as membership chair and she is a former teacher and current business owner in Albany, Georgia. She's a member of the Chamber of Commerce, of course, involved in many nonprofits such as March of Dyerms, Albany Technical College, Foundation, and the Liberty House. She's won the small business, been a small business of the year in Albany. She's an amazing person. She's had one rule in Quantice. She taught me how to open up clubs across Georgia and across the states. Basically, there's two things you have to learn about Quantice. First, there's no secret handshakes. That's important. No secret handshakes. Second, you have to like kids. Our focus is all about youth and children. If you don't like kids, you don't need to be a Quantia. So anyway, she's married to David. She has one son and daughter-in-law. We have two special guests with us, Dewey Smith, longtime international trustee, lives here in Georgia as well. Brent Leslie Kern, a governor of Georgia, amazing individuals. Really, a more amazing person is my friend Katrina Branco, international president for Quantice International. Thank you. Thank you. You're a side man. I'm curious for a question. Thank you. Thank you. It is truly an honor for me and for Quantice International to be here today to shed light on an organization that has been a beacon of service and community impact for over a century. As a matter of fact, on Sunday, Quantice celebrated our 109th anniversary. We are a global organization of volunteers that improved the world, one child, and one community at a time. So thank you so much for the privilege to be here, to receive this, and thank a special thanks to my fellow Quantian and good friend, Representative Rick Townsend, for helping make this happen. We are all delighted. But I have to brag a little bit about the Georgia Quantists. We are in 80 plus countries and nations, but I'm going to brag about Georgia, because that's who we're here and actually don't tell the rest of Quantice, but Georgia is my heart. The very first club in Georgia was in Atlanta in 1918. It was started. 43 Atlanta Business Professionals got together, decided they did want to accept the membership of Quantice, and so it was formed on June 11th of that same year. And I will tell you that that club, that Atlanta Club is still going strong with 200 members at this time, and I can only imagine the impact that that club has had on the children and their community. As a matter of fact, Atlanta still is the six largest club worldwide in Coenacinna National. In Georgia, we do make a huge difference. I'm going to brag a minute. There are so many clubs I could, but we have a club in Tattinale County that started a camp several years ago. They provided for 50 kids one week in the summer, and the first year they had it, they realized the kids didn't have the right clothes for that camp. So now, every year, they have clothes and what that every kid needs, all 50 kids to be there that week, and the cost for those kids is free, so we are very proud of what they do. And I could go on and on. There's so many stories all over the world, but I can tell you, those stories always include smiles on kids' faces and tears in parent size, because they know that coenians have given their children a chance for a brighter future. But coenacinna is more than just a service organization. It's a network of individuals who believe in the power of community. It's about neighbors helping neighbors, creating a ripple effect that transforms lives and lives in our communities. So again, I thank you for this opportunity and honor. And by the way, visit a local coenacinna club. We'd love to have you as a member. Thank you. Thank you so much. No, that was great. So members, I hope you know, we can't do everything for everyone in this state. And great service clubs. Like Cawana's new great work. But Lehman, excuse me, represent Franklin. Oh, you remember Cawana's in Bullet County? You're not. But chair lady, tank? You will be now. Yeah, I just recruited one. Chair lady, tanker sleep served here many years was a powerful member of the State'sboro Cawana's club. And they do great, great work down there. I'm from me with that. And I led one thing to this, two things. 238,087 members now, 238,088 members when Lehman joins. And so seven million, 300 hours dedicated to service work around the world by this great organization. Thank you. Congratulations. International President Katrina, thank you. Thank you. Thank you members for your attention. We're going to ask the clerk to read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Congratulations, the House and County Bears baseball team. We're winning the 2023 GHSA Class 6A State Baseball Championship. Honoring the FBI, Atlanta Citizens Academy Alumni Association. Commending the Atlanta Alumni Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.

Congratulating and commending the 2024 Georgia single parent legacy builders recognition and awards finalist. That completes the reading of the Village Resolutions. Is there an objection to adopting the Privileged Resolution? Chair, here's known and the resolutions are adopted. Here's my dilemma. We have 10 afternoon orders and we have 15 minutes and this timer won't break it to a minute and 30 seconds. So we're going to ask the members. Keep your comments as brief as you can but certainly make sure you get your job done and we'll give you two minutes. Chair Lady Dempsey, I think you have some video and audio here. Is that right? From all the way from Rome, Georgia. Chair Lady Katie Dempsey. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, even though it's an afternoon order, so I'll say good morning to each of you today. You have already heard from Chairman Jones, Rep. Kinnard and Leader Beverly that this is the day that we observe mental health day at the Capitol. And I know that each of you join me with wanting every Georgian to know that it is okay to ask for help when they need it. We have indicated professionals at the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities under the leadership of our former member, Commissioner Kevin Tanner, are focused and working to build up our crisis care infrastructure. The first step in that continuum of care is a call to 988, the nation's suicide prevention hotline. We'll spend just for a moment. We all need to be very much aware with the Chair Lady's discussing right now some port of all of us in this room, our families and the people we represent. Ladies and Recona, continue. Thank you. I want to thank each of you for the ways you have supported through the House budget, Georgia's own crisis line over many years, G-Cal, the Georgia Crisis and Access Line. It is the bright star in this process across our nation. We were ready to pick this up and are leading others in how we can do it. In the coming weeks, you will see advertisements around our Georgia promoting this tremendous resource. And to help each of us spread that word and help people find access to the resources that they need in their individual communities. This morning, I'd like to direct your attention to the video screens for one of these messages that you will be seeing. This one features our very own First Lady, Marty Kemp. I'm Georgia First Lady, Marty Kemp. As a mom to three daughters, I know firsthand how hard it is for kids these days. They're facing a lot of challenges that we didn't face growing up. And it's not just our youth. If you're thinking about suicide or worried about a loved one or would like emotional support, help is available 24-7. Call or text 9-88. I'm here to tell you it's okay to not be okay. There is hope. Call or text 9-88. It's confidential. Please join me in helping to get this word out that it is one call away 9-88. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Thank you, Chair Lady. I bet we all do a newsletter at one description or another. It's a good message to get out. 9-88 can save lives. Representative Nullowicz has recognized for... Now, you're fine. Take your time. Representative Nullowicz. Thank you, everyone. Earlier this week, you received information on your desk about cervical cancer in Georgia. Last week, when we were here working on the budget, there was a group of advocates and physicians from across Georgia who were here to mark the annual cervical cancer awareness day. We honored several pediatric practices throughout Georgia who have very high rates of the cervical cancer vaccine. We know that in our lifetime, we will be able to eliminate cervical cancer. And that is indeed a miracle because we also know that in Georgia, we have one in five women who don't receive regular screenings for cervical cancer. So we know that if we can spread the word about the HPV vaccine, which can eliminate 95% of the cases of cervical cancer, in addition to oral cancers, head neck and throat cancers, a lot of different cancers that affect both men and women. It was a wonderful honor to have so many folks in the Capitol last week and to be able to share this information with you this week about cervical cancer awareness in Georgia. Thank you so much. Thank you, Representative. That is a very important issue. Representative Wade is recognized for a very, very important announcement. No, excuse me, afternoon order. I'm sorry. This will be an order to hope she appreciates it. Thank you, Speaker. Folks, I believe in giving roses to those that deserve it. And I'm blessed today to tell you about a great constituent, one that I've known my entire life. My mom, today is her 77th birthday. She was born in January of 1947 and she was born in Washington, D.C. to a as a daughter to a chief master sergeant United States Air Force. And in the mid 60s, after being in 13 schools, she landed near Warner Robbins Air Force Base. And she would agree with leader Beverly, that area of the state is a great place. But she moved to the best district, which is district nine, and she's been there ever since. But in all seriousness, my mom is a person that showed me all about service. She spent her time as an educator. She worked as an actual, I found this out literally just a few months ago, that she went to make phone calls and door knocks for a former governor. And I was let her know I get to serve as a floor leader with his nephew, Mr. Gamble. And she also served as a GAE teacher. She served as a GED teacher. She also donated her time and became a naturalist for Amicala Falls State Park. And so yes, my mom is a snake handler too. But not in the Baptist Church, we've grown up.

But in all seriousness, I'm very proud of my mom. And I know that all the parents in the room have always felt blessed about having their children. But I'll tell you what, the blessing of life is to have a great mom, a happy birthday. We love our mommas. They love us back a lot more. All right, members. Would you give your attention to the lady about the other way I represent gladdening? If you would join me in standing. Good morning, colleagues. I come for you today for dual purpose. My primary reason is to pay tribute of love and respect to my 43 year old baby sister Janet, who passed away of suicide 36 days ago. My second reason is to honor the significance of her life by giving voice to the clarion call of mental health awareness. My sister Janet was a beautiful, sensitive, vibrant young woman who was intelligent and very well educated. She loved to cook and she was a subject matter expert to her employer. She was most proud of her role as mother to my four handsome nephews whom she mostly home school educated. For my oldest nephew, it was from first words all the way to the Air Force. And one day out of the blue, I get a call on the Tuesday before Christmas that put me on a whole different path of discovery and awareness. A path of awareness of the imminent mental health crisis we face. A path of awareness that suicide rates among African American women and girls are on the rise in double digit figures. A path of awareness that suicide rates among adolescents in all demographic groups and all genders are experiencing greater risk factors and trending higher. Part of the tragedy in my family experience is the data clearly indicates that we are not the only family experiencing these disinormous grief. The grief of no warning indicator, the grief of no window of opportunity to help, the grief of not another chance to say I love you. How I address that grief now becomes my why. Making the decision to move forward from awareness to advocacy. Advocacy to remove the stigma and shame associated with not being okay in communities like mine all over this state. And the best support for the bipartisan efforts of this body to ensure that there are resources to support mental health wellness for all families in Georgia. If you hear of or you know of someone who was struggling, please encourage them to call 988. Thank you all my colleagues for all of your phone calls, all of your texts and all of your prayers of support for me and my family. Thank you Mr. Speaker for this time and I yield the well. Thank you. Representative Gladden we all love you and we stand by you. We're so sorry for your loss. And we appreciate your message this morning as well. Representative Lepton is recognized for and after an in order. You're good. Take your time. The lady is recognized. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm sure some of you have heard a few of us had a hearing at the beginning of the month on maternal mortality. Doctors, physicians, scientists, professionals and advocates and regular citizens gathered and shared an avalanche of facts and studies, legislative priorities and real life stories. They are working hard to be part of the solution to maternal mortality in this state. All of the facts and legislative initiatives they presented for us to champion have been presented to you. Perhaps you didn't see the links that were left on your desk the first week of session. You can see me if you need those links because they are a real treasure trove of information. They are incredibly useful and they will inform what you might hear requested in the future. The people who spoke to us that day wanted and needed to be heard. But most in this chamber have not yet heard their stories. One of the reasons I believe I am here to serve is to use my voice for those who will never be able to stand in this well, to say their names and to tell their stories. This is Dee's story. Dealybed in a small town in Georgia, she was pregnant with clear symptoms of preeclampsia. She presented to her doctor. Her doctor said, please go home and don't be so dramatic. You are fine. Her symptoms persisted. She went back to the emergency room, where she died the next day of a massive stroke waiting for care. She was declared brain dead and her child was delivered post-mortem. That is Dee's story. Shalong was 38 years old, a woman with five degrees, including a double subject PhDs. She worked as an epidemiologist at the CDC, but died three weeks after giving birth to her first child from complications from high blood pressure. A preventable death? That is Shalong's story. Our attention belongs to those women in harm's way. From lack of care, those women who tell their stories that we offer, those stories who suffer yet pick themselves up and work towards being part of the solution. They are neither our props. To tell our stories, they are the genesis of our actions. I thank you today for your attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We say we hear you and we are here to serve you women. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Ladies, you are the well representative Hutchinson. Here she is. I ask her where she had been on these. I was convalescing. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am not sure if anyone knows, but today is student ambassador day with the Governor's Student Ambassador Program. And today, even though they are not in the chamber right now, we have a group from Brookwood High School, which is in my district. And I would like to welcome today, if they can hear me somewhere, if they come in, welcome to the house. Our student ambassadors from Brookwood High School. Thank you, and I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. And when they come in, they are certainly welcome. Representative Bell, recognize for an afternoon order. Gentlemen, is recognized. Thank you, Speaker, for the time. It's an honor and a privilege to always stand before you, colleagues, members of the house. Today, I rise to speak about homelessness. Yes, I was at an opportunity to go to my first prayer caucus. And we prayed, we worshiped, but I kept thinking about what would Jesus do? I couldn't help to think about what would Jesus do once, if he ever passed the Presbyterian Church, where we can see hundreds, well, I may be exaggerating, but it seems like we can see hundreds of people there, starry, hungry, suffering from hypothermia, mental illness. Who knows what it may be? But I say, what would Jesus do? As we pass all those citizens of Georgia, what would Jesus do? As we watch them suffer, and within equities, that we would never see in our lives, what would Jesus do? Now, we use that name quite often in this well, quite often in this state, but I'm not sure if we are following in his footsteps. And that chairs fires me. Now, I can't quote scripture, but I know James 2, verses 13, roughly through 24 says, faith without works is dead. And it seemed like we had a lot of faith in their prayer breakfast. It seemed like we had a lot of faith in the Word of God and what that means to us, regardless of what nationality or the creed we come from, whether we're Muslim, whether we're Hindu, it seemed like we had a lot of faith, but the work lacked. And I'm not standing here to chastise anyone because I believe that all of you are smart individuals. I believe that all you have faith in what Georgia can be. I believe that all you have faith in when you're coming down here that you're doing God's will, but make sure that you're doing God's will, the will of the people, the will of Georgia, because we can stand here with a $16 billion surplus. And you can look at it's about $20 billion to eradicate homelessness in Georgia that represents about 1.5% of that. With $2 billion, y'all, we can eradicate homelessness in Georgia. Now think about this, that a legacy that you would like to lead when you pass and say, you know what, I eradicate homelessness in Georgia. Let's think about that legacy and I rise. Thank you for the time, Speaker. Okay. Let's see, Leader Beverly, did your group get here yet? Leader Beverly is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is a great day in the state of Georgia because of Georgia. Optometric Association is here today. I want to acknowledge my colleagues if you're always staying and having chamber give you all a hand for what you do for the state of Georgia. And no, Al, you're not getting any free glasses. I also want to acknowledge this is 120th year in existence. And it's the first time we have an African American president, and the condist, Dr. Nacondis Gamble, stand up, y'all acknowledge her. She's a fantastic president of our organization. And thank you very much. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, River Edge is in here. River Edge from making Georgia here. No, they still haven't shown up. I'll see you guys some time today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Y'all do well. Now, that's awesome. Congratulations to all. We've met them president. Congratulations. Thank to all you doctors at what y'all do for us. Certainly, it's critical to our well-being and our quality of life. So thank you for being here today. We appreciate y'all's support and y'all's care you give to Georgia. Thank y'all very much. It's the day to day. It is today. Okay, representative doctor. I will have Zana announced, but it's important to us. Good morning. Today, and this month is actually National Blood Donors Month. So in recognition of that and in recognition of the fact that we are actually experiencing a critical blood shortage all around the country, we have our Gold Doned Blood Drive. We usually try to organize two per session. So a few quick things is that every single blood donation can help up to three patients. There are many complex problems that we can't solve easily here. This is one of them that actually is pretty easy to solve. It takes about 45 minutes. I just gave this morning. I'm probably smaller than a lot of you. If I can do it, I think you can handle it. You can do it. The other thing is that if you gave blood at our last blood drive, you can give again. We deliberately timed it to them to be eight weeks apart so that if you donated last time like me and like the speaker, it is time to donate again. So thank you so much for your service both in this chamber and in the bloodmobile and appreciate your work for our patients. Representative, you're nice and I am. All you whims go give blood today. Thank you. Thanks for those announcements this week. Representative Sharper, my friend from Val Dosta, Georgia, Lams County, you have a message for us? Yes, sir. Thank you, Speaker. Let's hear it. I'm going to try to use my three B's. I'm going to be brief brilliant and then be seated. But what I'm going to say today, guys, I'm just hearing an spirit of encouragement to let you guys know that the reason that we're all here is to represent our constituents back home. It's not about our agenda. It's about the people's agenda. A lot of times, these people don't care how many bills you're passing, if you're chairman, all these different things that sometimes we can get into our individual selves about. But the people are here to know that you're fighting for them. You're fighting for them. People don't care how much you know. They really move into what how much you care about them. So I just want to encourage everybody here just to remember that we are here for our people to represent our people. So don't lose yourself in trying to really be all that you can be as a solo hero. We're here to work as a team on both sides. At the end of the day is what did we do together to really make a difference for all of our citizens back home. So I'm just encouraging everybody. I'm here and I want to see us to do the best that we can for our people. We have two hands. We have one to receive with and we have one to give with. That's what we must do. Give our constituents the best version of ourselves of that we really care for them. Thank you Speaker. That's very, very powerful. Thank you, Representative Sharper. I could not agree more.
