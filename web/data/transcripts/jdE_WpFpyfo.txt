Okay, very good.
Well, let me officially open this urban affairs meeting.

If not, we can go next door.
But of course, I can do that.
But if you want to hear us in action, you can stay.
And I would love for you to stay.
I would love for you to stay.
Okay.
Excuse me?
Oh, no.
We're not on the legislative floor.
However, over in the house they are on the floor, so if you go to the fourth floor and
sit in the gallery of the house, but I hope to see all of you, we don't start to want
a clock.
And I'm going to introduce you, and we might have some food, but then I think, oh, we
haven't food.
Here we order food.
Uh-oh.
Oh my goodness, so I'm going to have to call and order some food.
I'll do that.
Maybe the only thing you can order at the last minute is pizza.
Everybody eats pizza.
We'll order that.
But anyway, that will come a little bit later too when I finish this meeting.
But thank you, Mars Brown College.
I'll be back with you soon.
Thank you.

Okay, okay, like you're welcome to stay now, but I understand thank you.

Okay.
All right.
I'm going to ask me a question so I can start with what you want me to do.

Yes.
You want you to come in and open us up for prayer?
No.
Come up to the mic for that one.
Maybe our heads.
Heavenly Father, we praise your holy and righteous name

We thank you for this day.
We will rejoice and be glad in it.
We will find your will for us in it,

Bless us and help us to open our minds and hearts to do the right thing for the right people in
Thank you very much everyone for being here, we are officially opening the meeting of Urban Affairs Committee and
And Sonja Hopper, David Lucas, Immanuel Jones, Nikki Merritt, and Senator Raman, all members
of this committee.
And three of them are in the building right now and they're going to come back four in
the building.
They will join us as we continue, but we're being streamed and it's being recorded.
So everyone will get a chance to hear the comments that we have to make today.
So I called on you, Ms. Henry, because you have been with me through the former meetings
that we've had, and you have a personal testimony that you want to make, because when you first
started out, you said you didn't realize the problems that others so many have in this
state with this, but you don't have to tell us all your personal things.
I will, but you can't give us, you know, over a few high level overview and I'm happy
to be able to participate in it James and thank you and I did share this with her this
this morning that I'm living proof and living witness of the flaws in the system.
So a couple of years ago, I entered into a home ownership lease purchase program with
a company that claims we buy the house, we give you three years to purchase it from us,
you're the homeowner, but you're not a homeowner, you're a winner, just like everybody
else.
part is at least agreement.
Last year due to COVID and different situations,
Senator James, the state of Georgia doesn't pay me.
Senator James pays me a stipend out of her pocket.
And because I am self-employed, I do have other contracts
with other clients.
And sometimes they renew and sometimes they don't.
And in the middle of COVID, I had COVID.
And so one of the jobs that I had, I had to resign from
because I was sick.
So that impacted my income.
And I was making my rent payment.
My main payment, I paid it on June 7th,
and I remember the day specifically,
because I got a notification for eviction on June 9th
from that company, saying that I failed to pay my rent.
Two days.
No, it was 37 days late.
Prior to that, I tried to contact somebody,
I do have email documentation, who do I contact, how can you help me have lost my job,
incomes being impacted, and other type of loan situations you can usually put that payment
on the back of the loan. Is that an option? And in this particular program, a percentage
of the lease payment was going supposedly
to a savings account for me.
So at the time when I decided to buy the home,
I would get that money back.
And additionally, I gave them just about $10,000 to move in.
So you got a ton of my money.
And so I said, is there any way that you or can we
take some money out of the savings account
to cover that payment?
They told me no.
They weren't willing to help me.
And by the time I got a hold of somebody,
she said, no, your accounts and litigation,
we can't even talk to you.
So I had a higher in attorney,
and he said, just keep making your rent payments.
So I did that.
In September, I started getting payments back from them.
They said, oh, by the way, our client
doesn't want your money anymore.
It's not accepting your money.
If the clients had accepted your money,
I thought they're supposed to give it back to you immediately.
I don't know any place where they hold on to your money for four months,
and then say, oh, by the way, we want you gone.
So I've been fighting with them this whole time.
Back in November, I got a notification and said,
we want, now we want you to pay your rent.
So you think, hey, my money baby, we want you to pay your lease now
into the court registry.
And if you don't pay it by a certain date, the first of the month, then we're going to get a
rid of possession on you. I paid it November, paid it December, January. I was a little bit late,
so I called and had my attorney call them. I said, I'm going to be late making the payment. Can you
let them know? I still need to make a payment. They said, we don't want your money. We refuse it.
We want you gone, they got a rid of possession that month.
Not willing to negotiate, not anything.
We want you gone, we want you out of our property.
Yesterday the marshal showed up at my house and so on and so
that's why I spent my day doing packing my stuff and moving at the end of this.
I'm saying all that to say, when you get in that type of situation,
the first thing people first of all you can't realize oh my god how do I get here and then people
are embarrassed you don't want to ask for help because we're all of those we should be able to
handle our business but sometimes you you need help from people and you've got to reach out
to your resources I get calls like I just said to you every single day from people saying hey
Senator James I know she's got these bills we've got to do something about this issue that
another late she said I was three days late on my rent and they put a
eviction they got a rid of possession against me and now I got to move what
said what's that what that is doing to our homeless population everybody might
not have money in the bank so they can move all over again or at the drop of a
dime so it's and it costs money to move you know you got to move your things in
or you got to move your things out you're paying a first deposit last deposit first
must rent that's expensive and if people and so it looks like corporations are buying properties
they're paying cash for them and they're renting them out and they're leasing them at an
exorbitant amount and if you miss a payment or if you're late they start to make their rules
they make their rules up as they go on. Even though it's not in it was not in your
Not at all.
Are these agreements?
They haven't made one repair on that property.
The air conditioner went out three times.
I paid for it out of my pocket because when I notified them,
they said, oh, somebody get back to you within a week.
And it's two weeks, and the air conditioner was out,
and it's like 89 degrees inside my house.
And nobody can live like that.
So I had to pay somebody out of my pocket.
It's still never got my money back.
When I initially moved in, the sink fill in.
I was like, oh my god, how did that happen?
So I said, you can't talk to anybody.
I said, request about a week and a half later,
somebody contacted me back.
Well, you can't live without a sink, your kitchen sink,
and there's no way possible.
So.
And we're talking about an exclusive area of town.
Absolutely, an exclusive area of town.
And it's not the area of town, it's the corporations
who are, I just think it's predatory in my mind,
who are treating people like cattle.
So Senator James has been so gracious and kind to take up
this issue and people out there know it.
So that's my other contact in there,
because she's willing to address it.
And I told her, I will give my testimony.
I'll say it to anybody who's listening.
That something has to change.
If we don't get back to where people are important to us,
it's going to be a problem.
I'm willing to take any questions, Senator James, do you have any questions for me?
No, I would like to, first of all, say I'm so sorry.
Secondly, and when our members have just come in, he didn't hear, we were talking about
problems with rent and leases, and we're going to talk about HOAs briefly as well.
Oh, there's one more thing I wanted to add.
So I was given a personal testimony of a catastrophe
that has happened to her.
And it's the same thing before you say that,
that Nikki Randall, our member, has come to the well
and talked on, and she has also developed
in legislation for it, because unfortunately,
it didn't just happen to you, too.
Absolutely.
It's happening.
It's happening, as we speak.
She gave the statistics and everything,
but she's in another meeting,
so I'll make sure that we can share your information
with her.
Yeah, absolutely, I'm happy to do it.
So there's another thing.
So remember, flashback to May of last year,
I still have an active court case.
So yesterday at Senator Jameson,
so gracious, we call him Magistrate Judges
and all kinds of stuff.
And I said, I don't even have a court day,
nobody's even notified me so when does that go happen two or three years from now
they said oh no you're on the docket for when may so still to me that's
unconscionable for an issue a year old that we just now getting to I mean I
just don't even understand how that's that's okay that does things have to
make sense to me that doesn't make any sense unfortunately in this law
Absolutely, nothing fair is not fair.
Well, what should be fair is not fair.
Unfortunately.
And I know the law is the law.
And it's a subject to interpretation,
but there's some things to me as I was calling around trying
to get some relief on the attorney told me.
He said every law is, what did he say?
Is makeable.
So what he was saying, if there's a law that says
We can evict you on this day that he said there's a counters law
Again that can counteract that because nothing is holistic and pure is what he's telling me
I don't know Jason's I mean Nathan's
forehead is wrinkle, but that's what he was saying every law has something that can counteract it
so
Having said that I'm thinking there has to be something that can be done not just for me
But for all the other door hemorrhage in the world
What if you don't like me, what if you don't have a Senator James at your resource?
I mean, you know, at your disposal that I can call you any day, time of the day, or night.
What about those people?
Thank you. Again, I'm very sorry about it. We are going to look into this and add this to the
things that we've already received from so many people all over the state. This is not just an
issue that one or two of us have. We've heard from so many people. In fact, Senator,
the rent control people have emerged on this whole capital. So many times they've been
over at all the city council meetings in Atlanta and they've been coming over here and
they've been talking to all of us sending us emails. So this is an issue that should
We have some priority that we need to make sure that we do something about it.
So do you have any questions?
No, it's not a question.
Just a comment.
I don't think this issue will be in the city of Atlanta.
It's all over the state.
You know, we have a serious issue in this country, basically, in a lot of different places.
So there's definitely some issues that we need to listen and come up with some kind of
solution to help.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm so happy to meet you.
Okay.
Well, Sonja's going to come back too, so it'll be just us sitting in here, but the others
are listening to it, and it is streaming.
So thank you very much for your comments.
Absolutely.
And I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like Ms. Marge, I'm going to have all the
stopby bigs as well.
I'm going to have to change.
You know, I'm going to have to change.
It's sad that we have to even find a way to smile about this.
This is no smiley matter.
Absolutely.
When it happens to you, so I mean, that's
why we're having these meetings so that we can look
at what we need to do for reforming rent and rent control.
I think we have one of our Mr. Mullins going to come up
can tell us about what he has been talking about
and it falls into your category.
I just wanna say thank you for your leadership
and thank you for the opportunity to share.
Okay, thank you very much.
Y'all wanna both come up together.
You wanna come up first, Margie?
I was supposed to be going to break it back.
Okay.
So Miss Margie McLeod.
Thank you very much.
You want to see your t-shirt need rent control.
I don't know if everyone understands why the prices continue to go up and nobody has
stopped.
So you go ahead and tell us.
I know that you've been an advocate and you own your house, but you've been an advocate
to help so many. A lot of the Atlanta public schools, bus drivers and cafeteria workers
and teachers come with you and you veteran too. And so you have brought all of the groups
that you are part of to speak with me and others about this. So can you briefly tell
I was going to give you about three minutes.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I took one uniform off and put it on another one.
I was in the military for 20 years and one day.
And I wear this proudly, because when people see this shirt,
you give it me hope.
You give it me hope.
Rent is going so high, $400.
Go all way up to $1200.
This is everywhere.
This is also Midtown.
God, I'm gonna say, he was a Caucasian.
He said, my rent went up to $1,000.
It's not about color, it's about.
If you don't have like what my saying is,
if you don't, if you're not green, you don't fit in.
And it have to stop.
We could do this.
It's not about land laws, I'm not against land laws,
But how can you go up 100% or 300% on red?
In fact, everybody, in fact, your family?
In fact, my family, seniors, getting put out
of senior soon, for $36 because they can't afford.
People is being displaced, schools is closing down
because guess what?
Families don't have nowhere to go.
What is the solution?
We have to do this.
Reputably, we got to work together
because it's affecting your home also.
Not just my home, your home.
You got grandkids, okay?
I hear people telling me, my daughter,
I can't, my son, we can't afford to rent out here.
It's too high.
You got mothers as prostitute.
You want to believe it or not?
Because they cannot pay the rent.
You got students also.
So what are we going to do?
That's why I'm here.
I'm not going nowhere.
And you keep saying it can't be done.
We got to change it.
Every other state is changing it.
Why George, you can't change it.
Ray, George, on my mind, that's what we need to do.
And I'm not giving up because guess what?
You are hurting also.
You landlord, the development binder,
how are you gonna let somebody come in here
and buy up a whole block?
If you overseas, I've been in Europe.
They will let you do that.
The Chinese are seeing here.
And I just left yesterday from housing authority,
the people that is in the housing,
They push them up, they go up on the red.
Oh yeah, tenor rights.
Okay, that's good, you got it.
But guess what the landlord's saying?
We're gonna go up the red.
If we got to fix anything and you don't know
that they can't afford,
when you know me wearing wedges of $5 and 15 cents,
you got people here is leaving
because they can't afford the red
and they broke for y'all.
They right here and they go for them.
They can't, my man, man, say he leaving also
Because guess what, he can't afford to rent.
So what are y'all gonna do?
You wanna say what you can't not do?
You can.
Whatever other state could do it and we can't do it.
Who, who's in that pocket?
You know what they say?
We know.
We tell them what to do.
That's what the developments are saying.
So please pass this bill sending 125.
We need it.
Change has to be made.
So let Georgia be the change.
That's what I'm saying.
Because the people's crying out there.
Homeless is increasing.
It's increasing.
I know you're very passionate about this.
And so many of us are, thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Margie.
And you got firing your bones, even.
So we can understand, because we've
heard from so many people before you.
But please, now we're gonna get the history of it.
So please come up.
Introduce yourself for the record
and give us your testimony, please.
And thank you very much for coming.
I've had an opportunity to talk with you,
to be on a TV, you know, with you.
And you really educated me when I thought
that I knew everything about this issue.
So please share with us if you can something about rent
controlled and where it started and what we can do about it
now, what your opinion is.
Thank you, Honorable Senator Donzella James
and other committee members.
I would like to speak to you today about the situation
in Georgia and how we arrived at this point of having
the challenges of increased rent.
My name is Rodney Mullins.
I'm a former military officer,
studied at United States Military Academy at West Point.
Then went on to receive my masters and business
and work now helping people in a different way.
I help my country in a different way now.
I deal with a lot of disabled veterans,
a lot of citizens that are struggling now.
It's my way of giving back.
But I want you to understand how we arrived at this point.
At the end of World War II, the veterans were returning
and the Georgia State Legislator said this is a challenge
because many veterans could not afford to pay their bills.
So they implemented rink control.
So rink control was a policy in Georgia until 1972.
In 1972, the real estate lobby came here.
They lobbied the Georgia State Legislator,
and they were not from here.
It was a national real estate lobby.
They targeted all the major markets, LA, Miami, New York,
Seattle, all the major markets, and they passed legislation
to remove the ban on rent control.
They lobbied the Georgia State legislature, and they won.
In 1972, there was a ban on rent control.
So local municipalities, rural counties,
as well as urban counties, could not control their rent.
What this did to local municipalities, local counties,
making county, Bartow, wherever you might be,
Fulton County, what it did was it hamstrack, hamstrack, hamstrack, it handcuffed them because
they could do nothing about rising rents, but what it did for investors allowed an investor
from China, an investor from LA, an investor from New York to control your market.
So what that did was that allowed foreign investors or out-of-state investors to take control
of this market, which was the design for lifting the ban on
rent control.
So they were very successful, because now the Federal
Deposit Insurance Company, FDIC, has stated that Georgia
has less than 2% areas that are considered affordable.
All across the state, citizens are struggling,
particularly our veterans, they cannot find affordable living and it's not just affordable
it's low income because what goes on in some areas, the formula for AMI is computed
with conglomeration of several municipalities so you might have an upper echelon district
that's computed in that formula so someone that's living in a rural county their average
income is combined with someone that makes $95,000 a year.
So now, all of you understand, ma'am, so you have that aggregate number.
When you increase that aggregate number, 30% is going to be bigger.
Now if you have a number that stratified based on census tract, which the way it should
be done, then the people that are looking for affordable housing would have a chance.
So now they can't even get government programs because the average media income is so high
and if they make just $50 or $25 above the allowable range, they don't receive any assistance
with housing.
This is a dilemma.
The same action and the same rationale that the Georgia State Legislature took after
The World War II is the same demand that we need now to lift the ban and repeal the
ban on rent control.
What it would do to rural counties in urban counties, rural counties would now have control
to make its difference.
Right now, local municipalities, city councils, county commissioners, they cannot do anything.
Georgia is controlled by out-of-state investors.
So our children based on the numbers that I've analyzed for the past several years, Georgia
is controlled by out-of-state investors.
They are here.
They're coming hard.
We're being traded on the start market, conglomerates of properties here are traded
on the New York Stock Exchange.
So the Georgia State Legislature has to make a decision.
Now if you look back at the thought pattern of the Georgia State Legislators after World
War II, they put a ban, they implemented rent control because their population was struggling.
They had a major challenge with World War II.
But we just got out of a challenge, too,
it's called the pandemic.
It's called COVID-19.
We are in our Katrina.
If we don't live this ban on red control,
and repeal this challenging law,
then more and more people will be evicted.
And they won't have options.
So it's not like before we could just find a cheaper place
because you can't control it.
If I'm an investor from a different state,
I don't care about the children here
because I have no connection.
If I'm from LA or if I'm from China
and I'm trading on your county which they are,
they're in pretty much every county in Georgia,
then I have no connection to the heartbeat
of the children in this state.
Is that what we want?
Do we want the children of this state
to be controlled by investors
that have no love or no connection to this community?
That's why I'm here testifying today
because our veterans are challenged.
Everyday citizens are challenging, challenged.
And we will allow people to be evicted,
it leads to teenage convictions.
Because when you disrupt a home in a rural county,
And in the city, children lose hope, and they go into an uproar.
So that's why we are requesting, and that's why I'm here to testify today.
I appreciate all of you and the service that you've given our country and our state.
But this is a serious issue.
We are in a economic pandemic, a housing pandemic, a COVID-19 for housing.
As people are living in their cars, we have veterans that are living behind buildings.
Veterans that come to me and talk to me, fellow veterans, they say, Rodney, where can
I go?
They're looking for room in houses.
Room in houses are becoming very popular in Georgia.
People are living in rooms.
And you all are blessed.
And that is very exorbitant too.
You pay what $100, $200 a week for one room in the bathroom?
We've seen them go as eyes 175 to 225.
So if a couple is married, send it to James.
What we've seen is much more.
We have some veterans and some citizens that are paying for a room
up to $700 to $900 per month for a room.
It's real because they know they can get it.
no control on the marketplace.
And what I'll tell you, we all love capitalism.
But when I studied capitalism in business school,
it says make as much profit as possible.
It then say, make considerations for veterans,
make considerations for children when you pursue your money.
The values and principles from capitalism
has to come from us.
Because without any virtue, without any love,
Capitalism can be extreme.
We can be extreme with market investments.
It could possibly be for an apartment.
It could be $2,000 one day.
In some parts of Georgia, you have for one apartment.
One bedroom apartment is $2,300.
I promise you it is.
So we all love capitalism, but we need some love in that capitalism.
We need some virtue.
We need principles in that co-efficient and that form
in one of those variables.
And you are that virtue.
You are that love.
That's my testimony.
And I appreciate all of you.
And I hope that you will support SB 125,
and which is designed to repeal the ban on rent control.
Because rent, if we did not take charge of it,
or at least free the local municipalities
to do something about it, that you
see more evictions and the last thing I'll tell you when I talk to several
attorney friends of mine they said Rodney let me tell you a secret a lot of
firms are hiring additional lawyers just to handle all of the evictions that
they anticipated because they anticipate in Georgia in 2023 there could be in
in some region seven to eight thousand evictions per month, seven to eight thousand. So I appreciate
your time. Thank you, Senator James, and any questions I entertain.
Yes, we would like to ask a few questions. First of all, thank you very much for the very
informative review, overview on what has happened and how we got here. But can you tell me,
I've been talking to many mayors and City Council persons to see what they want to do.
And they say we have no control and even in Atlanta they're saying we have so many vacancies
because the rental on condominiums or apartments have gone up to $5,000 in some of the key places
in just downtown Atlanta, but the people who,
when they find out who owns it,
they are from other countries or from other parts
of this country.
And they have no vested interests.
And when they have a vacant apartment,
they can use it for taxes, for taxes.
So it helps them, they don't lose.
only the citizens, the people who are renting lose.
So, what have you heard on this or what can we do?
I know if we lift the prohibition against it,
then it'll allow mayors and city council
and county commissioners who have talked to me.
They said that, yes, if we could lift it,
But it doesn't have to be a constitutional.
You have to repeal, you have to.
That's what I was going to ask our legislative council.
Don't we have to have a constitutional amendment
to take, to lift the prohibition against rent control?
It is in the Constitution.
You want to expound on that, please?
I will say that in talking to several government elected officials, what they told me sent
it to James is that they want to do something about this, but they are challenged with
the ban on rent control.
They want to do something because they see their local constituent struggling and they
They are begging for something to happen, but they can't do anything.
So they told me that if we can get it passed the state, they said we want to do something.
They said we can get passed this ban on rent control that we immediately would do something
about this issue, because their people, their constituents are clamoring, are coming to
them saying we're living out of our cars, or we're living with family members, or basically
some of them are have gone to there's rental of campers there's a lot of new
phenomenons going on people living in campers we have found people living in
storage units the secret oh you heard about that too Senator James people are
living in storage units because they're out they get four clothes on are evicted
from their rental property and and they put their things and then they had a
the key to it and they have to go and sleep on top of the furniture and oh I get all
choked up because I'm very sensitive to all this now because I'm talking to so many
people and I know plenty of these people and these people have jobs. They just couldn't
afford to continue to pay the rent and I also some of the elected officials are saying
that is changing the demographics of their area and so whereas they could win for years.
Now it's changing the demographics and the only people who can afford some of these apartments
because they've gouged the rent so high that every minimum wage person or a person who
who gets a middle class amount of money can no longer stay there and so as a result their
voters are going and other people who don't know them or big companies are sending people
here you know who work out of Georgia but don't live in Georgia.
So do you have you, I know you talked to a lot of people so can you say something to that?
Yes, I speak to the number of people every day.
And many of them have told me that,
and also elected officials, the number of elected officials,
and they've told me they've seen the demographics
and the citizen profile of their region changed drastically
because what happens is when a person loses their address,
the system, they become in limbo in the system.
So a number of people are living in hotels.
And that becomes a challenge for the children.
So that also becomes a challenge for the population
count for that school district, if it's a Title I school.
So what happened, you have now a school bus has actually
started stopping in hotels.
There's a new phenomenon that children are being picked up
at hotels.
What the challenge with that is children
need a permanent address.
And sometimes that's a challenge because if you don't have a permanent dress, that's
difficult even to get registered your children for school.
So this is creating a ripple effect.
The elect officials are just requesting stability.
One thing I hear them saying is rent stabilization.
They need to be able to stabilize it.
So in Georgia, the rent is rising.
It's in the top four in the nation.
as far as the increased rate of increase in rent,
Georgia's in the top four.
So, but also, the challenge is,
but wages have not spiked up at the same level.
So statistically, you have a gap,
you have wages plateaued,
but then you have rent going up.
So you create a statistical and a financial gap
in the haves and have nots.
And so you have a lot of people struggling.
So, and a lot of elected officials want to do something
if they could only have this a ban on red control repeal.
Thank you very much.
Members, we've been joined by Senator Emmanuel Jones
and you already heard from him.
All right.
And let me say this, we're not against landlords
because I know my late husband and I had more than 10 houses
that we rent it for years and years,
but we never gouge to people.
And we got renters in who didn't want to leave the property
because we kept it up and looking good.
And until he got sick and then he's in heaven now,
you know, that's when I stopped being a landlord
and had to take care of my husband and let that go.
But I met with so many people who were landlords
in the same category with me who did take care of that property.
So again, we need to, I'm thinking about also going
and talking to the Georgia Real Estate Board
of different apartment associations and see
if they can't encourage people who are members of them
to also stop gouging.
But the gouging we found out is really coming
from the outside companies that live outside of the country
or outside of the state of Georgia.
So do you have any questions?
Comments?
The only question, but a comment, you know, this is a thing.
For testifying, this is the issue that I said earlier too.
Not necessarily, we have a lot of good landlord
in the state of Georgia.
I was in landlord.
I had some places I know that doing the COVID,
I had some tenant, dinner, and pay rent,
I didn't even charge him, it's okay, it's fine.
But not everybody like that,
especially the problem we have now,
that our state investor did the major problems.
I don't know what we can do,
but we need to work on that.
The create investor court position coming from outside
causing the problem for us.
Now one thing, right.
And thank you, Senator, one thing I will tell you,
The state of Florida did do some states
are addressing the issue of out of state investors
because it was becoming a phenomenon.
I know for a fact, Florida was inundated with foreign investors
so they began to place limitations on LLCs
that are owned by foreign investors
because Florida was like number one for several years
and the market rate was so high that poverty was skyrocketing.
So the Florida State Legislator took an action to limit the control of that state from
people that are disconnected from the community who don't have a concern about the day-to-day
life of the children, of the families, of the businesses.
You know, also, oh, no, sorry, but it was to you that we got to do something about it
for sure, but the thing is, you're talking about eviction, my concern is even if forget
of a conviction. The people working right now, working class folks, working restaurants,
convenience store, break and even find a place to stay. Forget about eviction. You don't
have a place to stay. We have a shortage of people for working regular hourly jobs. You
can't really afford, you know. That's my concern too. I mean, that's one thing. It's not
a Atlanta issue. This is all around the state of Georgia everywhere.
And all over the world, because even in Nigeria,
I was talking to the people who came to our diet
as per day, and they were saying that they were having
the problem there because China came in
and bought up everything.
So now, they don't even hire the Nigerian community
to even work in their companies, oil, whatever they doing.
They've come over there.
This is not my words.
They say they rape the country.
and that they're gouging even other people
so they have to stay outside, families.
So it's not just happening here in the United States,
but so we need to look at the different foreign countries
that are coming here.
And hopefully this committee can look
at the best thing we can do to take more control.
Because that's all we're trying to do.
You said one word, stability.
And that's what we need to do, have more stability in our rent
with all of the people who are a part of us.
Yes, yes, and that would do it.
Of the state of Georgia.
And Senator Jones, did you have a statement of question?
I do not met him, Chair.
Thank you for choosing that information with me.
I apologize for being late in Tarty,
But I had another event I had to attend this morning.
And I've heard the comments shared by a chair lady.
And I too have property that I lease out, by the way,
lots of it.
And I understand these issues and concerns.
And I'm always sensitive.
And I believe landlord should always
be sensitive to the needs of the tenants.
Because after all, there are the ones that
we're the ones who just own it but they're the ones who spend their time at
effort and raise their kids in these properties so thank you for bringing
this information forward. Thank you Senator Jones. Thank you very much and we
have Jody Williams is gonna be next thank you sir we're gonna call on you some
more I'm sure because this was supposed to be also a HOA meeting but time is
of, you know, we're going to have to end pretty soon. So we'll try to have another meeting
to talk about what we can do about HOAs. And we end next Wednesday. So it might be after
the session since this committee cannot do anything until next January anyway legislatively.
But we might have a call on you and thank you very much, very much. I know you do it voluntarily
to, although you might have some clients, and I appreciate you.
Thank you.
Yes.
We appreciate you.
Ms. Jody Williams.
Oh, you're here.
How you doing?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
and relatives and even my clients, whose rent is so high that they are moving like one
situation where the persons rent went up to $1,700 and they had to move and they are living
in their car until they can find another place.
You know, it's dangerous out there the way the rent is out of control.
So we really need this ban lifted.
So if you all can do anything to help, and I notice sometimes when you talk to some
of the senators because they have this state ban, you know, they feel like there's nothing
they can do.
But if we can be heard, that would be step one.
If this could come out of the committee, that would be step one.
So don't be afraid to help the people because that's what this is all about helping the
people.
We appreciate that.
Anybody have any questions?
Okay.
Your points will take and we are going to continue to work on this.
You know, I've been told by many of the other legislators
when I tried to get them to come and work with me.
I own property.
I'm not going to do it.
I said, this is not about you and why you handle yours.
It's about the trend that has gone on all over
and especially in the state of Georgia.
And so we need to look at how we can reform this rent.
I'm also a property owner, but I have friends, clients.
This is just out of control.
Something must be done.
My niece went up $400.
She don't have any place to go with her son,
so she have no choice.
So this is really needed.
they're even putting the elderly out of their apartments
because they can no longer afford it.
Right.
It's getting to the point that you're
going to have the wealthy, the middle class, the poor,
and the tent people, because that's what it's coming to.
They're going to be a group of people,
the people who live on the streets.
I see people now with their children living outside
on the streets.
It's getting ridiculous.
We must do something.
What kind of state are we if we can't help the people?
Or if we're not even concerned about the people?
And that's all I have to say.
And I really appreciate you all listening.
Thank you.
Are there any questions?
You know, we are convening these hearings because we know that it's a serious problem and
we appreciate, oh, excuse me, don't leave.
Anyway, he's with the alumni for Mars Brown yesterday evening.
He didn't make his statement.
He was saying to make a statement because he and his wife don't live in, it's not just
a metropolitan and land area.
You know, some people who live in Georgia, 30 miles away, you know, are experiencing this.
And their companies are coming there, big companies, corporations, and bringing thousands
of jobs.
And so these corporations are being forced now to use a part of their property to build
some apartments and allow the people who work for them to rent from them because they
won't be able to rent a decent place and they're building townhouses, you know, maybe
on own a couple of acres of their property and that's what he was going to talk about.
And you know, he did come to me and tell me about it.
So we are going to continue to investigate and talk about it.
And this is not just a meeting to talk, is any more, but we're going to try to come
up with solutions.
Even on my interstate corporation committee that I'm also, I used to be the chair, but
now I'm the vice chair.
We had a meeting last year on this and we were told to do something about it this year.
And that's why I did the Senate bill 125, but it didn't come out of committee.
And it was to lift the prohibition on the rent control.
So we are going to take one step at a time.
And I'm so happy that we have our members who are also interested.
The members of that other committee are also interested, Senator Harborson and Senator
Freddie Power-Sims.
And then what they do is they come here to Atlanta for the session.
So they are renting apartments, short-term, or either they are least one.
And when they're out after a few months, then they rent it out.
But you know, they're having problems like you've never heard of.
You don't, I mean, even though you have been bringing this and Ms. Margie-Bake, there's
been bringing this issue and so many people to us.
So it's on the minds and hearts of us.
And so we have to find a way to address this very important concern.
This was addressed once by our Judiciary Committee when Senator Stone was here, so that
might have been about five, six years ago that they had it.
And this kept coming up, but out of the whole thing that he passed, it wasn't addressed.
So maybe we have to revisit his legislation and see what we can do senators to address.
Thank you very much for your comments, and I know you got to go back to work.
What was Stone?
What was...
Senator Stone has retired.
Right.
What was the...
When it re-control, it was re-control.
Oh no, it was Renner's rights.
Renner's rights, I believe, because you're new.
I'll find out.
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon, I don't know if I may have done that.
Sure.
Around what time of the event in history as a state was that I was on the 70s was a state?
Oh no, no.
He just did a rent.
He wanted to revise the rent, reform the rent.
And this was, he was just five or six years ago.
He just left.
Senator Stone is your age probably a little, but he stayed here almost 10 years and then
he left what about four or five years ago.
So we can look back and find out and I'll get, please make sure we have a way to reach
you and we'll make sure that we do that.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
That's going to be the end unless I see Gordon Draves coming in, were you going to speak
on rent control or HOA?
You just wanted to listen.
Okay.
Thank you.
And I know we've been talking about it too.
Thank you.
So this is not an issue about just the 35th District or Dunzella James, but it's all over
our state.
Yes, it is.
And it's not against landlords at all, since all of us are landlords too, or have been
for many years. So we just want to do what's right and make sure that we give our
elected officials who are municipalities or counties have control. They
won't control. And we always stress local control, you know, all the time on
our decisions that we make here. So, you know, the demographics have changed and
Some of the people are not going to get reelected because they have people who have moved in, who don't know them or won't vote for them.
And they're going to get other people.
And then not to say anything's wrong with other people, but they might not have the same values as the community.
And then we're going to move on from there.
Okay, I just want to thank you so much for the bill, Senate bill 125, and I think you did a really great job, you know, with the time frame that you had to put it together and present it.
So thank you so much.
Yeah, very welcome. I'm sorry I didn't come out of committee, but maybe another hearing or something will help to get it out of committee before it dies at the next year.
It's still alive after this session and next year.
So we hope we can move.
Oh, I got your name on it.
Margie, knew you were coming, so she put it down.
OK, is it anyone else who wishes to speak on this issue?
Dr. Faroqi is coming.
He's with our Mars Brown Group.
But his son, your son, even addressed this issue
when he was the city council person over here.
Tell us his name.
I'm not, yeah.
I'm E for Rocky.
He addressed this and they tried to change it,
but then that's when they came to me and others
and said, you gotta lift the prohibition
in order for us to take control.
So, does any of the lobbyists in about, oh, they gone?
Most of them go on now.
Did they want to say anything?
No?
OK.
Hearing none, thank you everyone for coming.
And we will adjourn officially now.
Thank you very much.
You
