TRANSCRIPT
----------
You are looking at a live view from under the gold dome where this house is working hard
on the 28th day of the legislative session.
Good evening and welcome to our special crossover day edition of lawmakers.
We have a great line of guests tonight for live interviews.
They include Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones, Democratic Minority Whip Representative Sam
Park, and Republican Senator Sam Dullazal.
But first, let's get an update on the day so far from Capitol Correspondent Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna.
Cross every day kicked off with Governor Camp signing his first piece of legislation this
session.
When the mad dash to pass legislation started up for the day, with the Senate passing three
bills related to school safety.
SB 17, also known as Ricky and Alyssa's Law, named after two victims in high school
shootings, would mandate mobile alert panic systems for schools to alert local responders
to emergencies.
The other part of this bill is a school mapping piece, and very simply all it does is require
that every school property in the state be mapped so that data is provided when an incident happens
in real time. Our folks and friends in the public safety community know where to go to find the
assailant, where to go save lives, where to evacuate people. The bill passed unanimously.
Senate Bill 61 would add new charges that a student could be prosecuted for in superior court
including terroristic threats.
I think it's important to point out at this point as well that the bill preserves the existing
authority for a DA at any time before indictment after investigation and for cause to decline the
prosecution and superior court and bring the case to juvenile court for those between the ages
of 13 and 17. Democrats were less enthusiastic about this bill as it passed 33 to 22 along
party lines. And Senate Bill 179 requires the sharing of a student's disciplinary history
when transferring schools and holds parents legally responsible for not disclosing a current suspension.
It will require from sixth grade to twelfth grade students would be required to take a minimum
of one year class or training on suicide awareness and prevention. Also youth-based violence prevention
and either being recognized as a student
is potentially going to harm themselves or someone else.
It passed 54 to one.
Senator Colton Moore offered up his first bill, SB 163.
The bill would rescind all local city and county laws
over guns and other weapons,
and entrust the power of regulation exclusively to the state.
When citizens in northwest Georgia go to a place like Savannah,
And there is a mayor there who has put in ordinances
that violate their Second Amendment rights,
my piece of legislation simply says
that those citizens, just like your citizens,
have a right of tort to sue those governments
for violating those rights.
The often ostracized Republican took his time
answering questions from the podium.
Mr. President, I just want to make sure
I've had one opportunity in five years to present a bill here.
If there's any more questions.
I will be happy to answer.
You just want to feel some questions, don't you?
I want to make sure this thing passes.
And in this case, it was enough, as the bill was passed 33 to 23 along party lines.
In the House, members contemplated an income tax cut for Georgians.
House bill 111 would change the flat income tax from 5.39% to 5.19%.
Republicans say the surplus allows the state to put more money in the pockets of taxpayers.
While other states are raising taxes on their citizens, and while we're facing sky-high
prices and can least afford it, we are doing the opposite here in Georgia. We have a
surplus budget, and we are able to put money back into our taxpayers.
But some Democrats say the tax cut disproportionately benefits the wealthy.
The top 20 percent of earners will receive nearly 80 percent of the total tax savings
with millionaires receiving thousands of dollars and benefits annually.
Meanwhile the bottom 60 percent of Georgians, those earning middle class or lower incomes,
will see less than $6 a month in savings.
The bill passed 110 to 60, mostly along party lines.
also unanimously passed HB 112, a one-time tax rebate of $250 for single taxpayers and
$500 for married couples.
And, Gwyneth Delegation members debated HB 657, which would annex more land for the
newly formed city of Mulberry.
This bill is about annexing 45 small parcels into Mulberry.
All of these parcels are in my district.
Some Democrats say the issue should have been dealt with on the local level.
This process works, it has works, and it recognizes that while bills must come through
the legislature, we respect our local governments and will not force things down their throat.
The bill passed 98 to 76, an a mostly party line vote.
That's my capital report.
Later this show, I'll speak with House Minority Whitsam Park and Senator Greg Dullesall.
Donna, back to you.
Over a turn to Sarah later for some interviews, but first I want to introduce our guests
in the studio who will offer analysis of the legislative action.
First, someone who has spent several across over days in the Georgia House, former State
Representative Terry Anula Witts from Smyrna, she was first elected in a special election
of 2017.
Also, here is someone else who understands state politics.
Martha Zoller is a columnist and author, host of the Martha Zoller Show on WDUN Radio.
ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the ninth congressional district. And I want
to thank you both for being here. Thank you, great to be here.
So let's get started. We're at the 28 days. 28 days so far. I can't believe it. So what
are your overall thoughts about how it's been? This has been a very different kickoff to
the biennial. So you know, the legislature has two years in the biennial. This is the
first year of the two year period, which is good. Something that doesn't cross over tonight
and something that doesn't pass by Sinai Dai,
you have a whole other year, it's okay.
But there's the biggest difference
looking at this from a house perspective
is how much faster things are going.
You know, the 23 session,
when the next, the first panel,
we had a brand new speaker,
we had lost Speaker Ralston,
we were really as a house coming out of a collective trauma
and Speaker Burns, you know,
he needed to get up and running,
get his office up and running,
we had a lot of new members,
almost one-third of the house was brand new.
So you have a, you know, you lose institutional knowledge,
you have a lot of people who don't even know
where the bathrooms are.
And so it was a much slower start this year.
I was almost surprised at how quickly things got moving
in the, you know, in the, in the house.
In the Senate, I was less surprised,
but the house, things really got off to a quick start.
All right, Martha, your take.
I think the point that you made is a good one
about John Burns because he now knows
where he is and what he's doing.
And of course, at the beginning of the session, he had Terry England as his chief of staff.
Of course, Terry had the terrible accident is doing much better and Chris Riley stepped
into that place.
But there's an opportunity for him to really get things done.
I think it's the leadership of the governor, really.
I think this state of the state was the most direct about what he said his goals were.
As far as tort reform, as far as tax reform, that kind of thing.
And I think I've seen the Senate and the House working a lot more towards that because
he used political capital in a different way than he'd ever used it where he said, this
is what I want.
And if I don't get this during the session, I will call a special session.
So I think the House and the Senate have been hyper focused on getting these few things
done.
We definitely had the governor involved from the very beginning.
Yes.
Okay.
So we'll get back to you guys in a moment.
now to the Capitol, where Lieutenant Governor
Bert Jones is standing by.
We're going to head to the Capitol now.
Where Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones is standing by.
I know it's a busy night for you as President of the Senate,
so thank you for being with us, Lieutenant Governor.
Donna, it's good to be with you.
I appreciate you doing this show tonight.
And, yeah, it's been a long day, but we're almost done.
And we've got some good things on today.
Well, let's talk about that.
The day started with good news for you
with the passage of three school safety bills
that you've championed after what happened
at Appalachia High School in September
that sold in the death of four people.
So, understand, you had a conversation
with a juvenile court judge, a sheriff, a superintendent,
all to get their views on schools
and how to keep them safe.
So, tell us about that that helped push this legislation.
Yeah, this is something I was actually talking about, you know, two years ago before we had
the tragedy at Appalachian High School talking about that, we had some soft spots with
our school systems, and we needed to be for security at both from a personnel standpoint
as well as from securing buildings as well, so what we did today is not only did we sign
the budget that had 50 additional million dollars that we had put into the governor's
budget today.
But we also had some measures put in place that would help pay for resource officers and
help locals pay for security measures that could, that would automatic lock systems and
automatic, you know, 911 calls and things of that nature that we got, that we got finished
today and that's been a prior to your mind for the last couple of years and obviously
what happened at Appalachian really amplified that that need to do it at the state level.
Yes well I want to talk about the more contentious of the school safety bills and
among other things it adds terrorist acts to the list of offenses by Juvenile's 13th
17 years old can you they can now be tried as adults so Democrats opposed it saying it
criminalizes youth, what's your take on that?
Well, I mean, you don't have to look any further than the
the young man that committed the crimes at Appalachia. I believe he
was 14, 15 years old and and and you know he he committed four
murders that day that that that he he seemingly was
competent and and what he was doing knew exactly what he was
doing and I think a person that get to that age bracket then they are well aware of the
consequences of their actions and so trying them as an adult is something that I was
forward definitely.
Well the two other bills that dealt with school safety received overwhelming support.
One of them, Ricky and Alyssa's Law, will require mobile panic alarm systems in schools.
Can you talk about that a little bit?
Right.
Well, it just goes back to just trying to do what we can to help secure facilities best we can.
During the Appalachian, they had resource offices.
They had emergency checkpoints and also 911 call centers.
And because of all those things that they had in place,
Unfortunately, we had four deaths,
but the response time on those from the time,
the first shot was fired to the time
that they had that young man in handcuffs
was literally a minute and 20 seconds.
And they had a lot of these procedures
that we're talking about now in place.
And even with all those procedures that had in place,
there was still an opportunity for somebody
to commit a violent crime.
So we want to beef up the security best way we can,
but we also believe that it's up to the locals
to determine what is in the best highs and best use
at their school systems to determine their security measures.
So anyways, so I say all that to say
that we're putting all these resources in place,
but we're also leaving a lot up to the locals
to determine which ones they'd like to do and not do.
And I'm sure the school systems appreciate that.
My last question is how long do you think
the Senate will go tonight?
I don't know.
We had some bills that went longer than I was expecting
as far as the debate is concerned.
And we have about 34 bills available in the calendar
on the calendar for the night.
and it would just depend on how quick the bills go,
whether or not we get to all of them or not.
Okay, well, we'll be watching.
I wanna thank you so much for joining us
on lawmakers tonight.
Have a good evening.
Donna, always good to be with you.
Thank you for having me.
All right, Terry, your thoughts.
So there is not a person in that building
who doesn't wanna make sure that our schools
are as safe as they possibly can be.
What I'm gonna be curious in hearing,
especially as this bill is discussed,
and debated in House Committee,
are the practicalities of actually implementing this.
You know, I think about my daughter's high school,
which is a very large high school in Cobb County,
they have the panic alarm system.
It's worked, it's been tested, they do drills,
they've had false alarms, but everything
has worked the way it's supposed to.
But the other reality is they've got a couple
of dozen doors on this campus.
How do you enforce this?
How do you actually implement this?
How do you make sure the districts have what they need?
It's great if they have the money to buy the alarm systems.
They also need to be able to do the things they need to do
to get their infrastructure,
to get there, like just the practicalities.
Go please.
A lot for the schools to try to figure out.
Okay, thanks.
We're going to go back to Sarah.
She is standing by at the Capitol
with Senator Greg Dullesall.
Sarah?
Pretty seen the Senate pass dozens of bills today.
What other bills are you hoping will pass?
We have bills coming up for health care.
We have bills coming up for our military veterans.
We have bills coming up for literacy.
I think we're gonna be here pretty late tonight.
the house is working hard as well.
They've passed tax cuts or deal with sports betting right now.
So it's an exciting day already here at the Capitol.
And so last week the Senate announced efforts
to investigate former gubernatorial candidate
CCC Abrams in the New Georgia Project.
So you'd be part of that committee.
Can you talk to me a little bit about that?
Yeah, we were very surprised to hear on the heels
of the largest ever fine from the Georgia Ethics Commission.
Conversations coming out of DC,
potentially some other involvement with CCC Abrams.
So we want to know what happened
with Georgia's campaign's finance laws
in the 2022 election,
24 election,
and the appropriation of $3 million
of dark money into Georgia's elections.
We got a lot of questions from his Abrams.
Thank you, and is there anything else
that you're watching?
Are you feeling so far about how tonight's going?
You know, this is a fun day.
I love the fast moving pace of today.
I've got a bill on the floor in about five minutes
to help doctors and optometrist prescribe medicine
to those in need.
So we deal with a broad swath of things here
in the Senate and certainly excited to see what the surprises
will be before the end of the night.
Well, thank you so much,
and we'll have to keep an eye on that bill, Donna.
Thanks, Sarah, we'll be back to you in a moment.
So that was an interesting conversation.
Sports betting, he said they're talking about it right
now in the Senate.
Yes, and I think what's interesting about that
is that I don't know, 10 years we've been talking
about sports betting, I think that is it going to happen?
Is it not?
I think probably it has the best chance this year.
However, it's looked all day like it's never going to make
sea daylight, so we just don't know what's going to happen
until they get to these final bills.
It would be interesting to know what's going on right now
there. What are you thinking?
It will. I know it's made it onto the rules calendar.
The house is a little different from the senate.
The senate has one rules calendar.
What you see is what you get first thing in the morning.
They had the rules meeting yesterday.
The house will have rules meeting in the morning.
They'll have one at lunch time.
They might have one at dinner time.
Sometimes they have them at nine, 10 o'clock at night.
So that this is why now sports betting was not on the calendar this morning.
We woke up a lot of things happened and now it is on the calendar.
I hope it passes.
I've been a longtime supporter of sports betting every year.
I was in the house.
The Atlanta Braves were in my district.
Atlanta was in my district for a while.
They're practice facility.
I've always been a supporter of it.
It is happening anyway.
It's happening.
You know, these people are using VPNs.
It's working.
We might as well collect revenues.
Addiction is going to happen regardless.
It is a tragedy, but it is something that does happen.
but now we'd have some funds to actually address it.
Well, and getting it to the voters to decide,
I mean, I've been a slip personality
about this issue over the years,
but I will say that what we have right now
with the lottery and people are playing games online
on the lottery right now, it's not sports betting,
but you're already doing legal, virtual gambling
in Georgia, it sounds like it could be the next step.
Yeah, and that's been the big argument
that that's, it's already happening,
why not bring in money into Georgia?
Exactly, it's happening,
and these are very regulated industries.
You look at co-AMS,
the coin operated in news machines
that are legal in Georgia,
have been legal in Georgia for a while,
they're probably one of the most regulated
of all of Georgia's regulated industries.
So these things are happening.
You know, we have the all-star game,
yeah, coming back to Georgia,
this spring, sports betting,
I don't, you know,
there's two parts to this, right, too.
You have to approve sports betting,
then you have to have the constitution.
and the voters will ultimately be able to decide on this.
So we won't have this in place for the all-star game
if it passes, and I hope it does.
But the World Cup is coming next year.
This is an opportunity.
We have numbers on the revenue that we lose in Georgia.
Every time there's a major sporting event
because other states are getting this revenue
or nobody's getting this revenue.
It's regulated, this will go to the lottery,
it's going to be overseen, it's going to be more money
for pre-K, more money for hope.
I think hope is probably the most popular thing
that the state has ever done.
And it's good.
I think it's a good thing.
Yeah, we've seen a lot of bills, but this is the one
that everybody is like, will we, or won't we?
Will we see it or not?
I think what's interesting, too, is that it doesn't seem
to be the kind of social, conservative movements.
Some things have been introduced with riffs,
some things have been introduced on other things.
I spoke today at the March for Life,
that Georgia Life Alliance sponsored,
and one of the things we talked about,
there wasn't a lot going on under the gold dome this year
on that.
This gambling could be where all the energy goes.
OK, well, wait and see, he talked about a lot of other bills
that passed in the Senate today.
And the Senate has, actually, I have the list here.
There is quite a few.
You saw that the Lieutenant Governor said
there were quite a few still left to go through.
This is going to be a busy night.
Anything in particular that you're looking at?
Sports betting is a big one that I'm looking at.
Because again, I think that it is long overdue.
overdue. This is something that we need to do for Georgia. The other issues that I'm looking
at, you know, some of them we're going to see in the next 12 days, right, between now
and signing die. The thing, a lot of the issues addressing transgender youth, youth sports,
things like that. We're going to have a lot more debate about that as those move through
the House. There, I don't think the House has passed out anything nearly as controversial
as, you know, I don't think the Senate can expect nearly anything as controversial, but
I know that the things that I am looking for tonight, you know, really the big one is
sports betting.
I think if it can cross this hurdle, if it can get through the house, which is never
done before, it's made it through the Senate, hasn't made it through the house, I think
that is going to be an issue to watch.
Yeah.
Well, and the really big things have kind of gotten through.
You've gotten tort reform through one side.
You've got the tax cuts through one side.
It's going to be really interesting to see how all of this plays out because the kind
big initiative. Certainly we got the final budget which still will have its past one house
won't we'll get through the other but there's a lot of work to do but it does seem less
controversial. Everyone I talked to you today as I was going through the Capitol was like
it's so quiet today it's so quiet yeah it was a very different energy today than what you normally
have and I think that goes back to what I said initially were the governor and the speaker
and the lieutenant governor had a lot of control over this agenda this time.
Yeah.
There is.
And I think in terms of the energy of the Capitol, there's a lot of waiting for the
other shooter fall.
You know, I was there on Tuesday of this week when several of – several of pretty
contentious bills were being debated on the Senate floor.
There were a lot of activists there.
It was pride day at the Capitol.
And there was a contrast between the energy and the mood there today and how it was earlier
this week.
But I think as things ramp up, especially as the House is discussing some of these more
controversial measures, we're going to see a lot more people.
Okay.
Well, we're going to hit back to the Capitol where Sarah Callis has House Minority Whip
Sam Park.
Thank you, Donna.
Representative Park, we saw the Democrats
at a press conference about an hour ago,
talking about some priorities for working families
you're hoping to get through.
Can you hit some of the highlights?
Absolutely.
Georgia Democrats, we remain focused on focusing
on lowering costs for Georgia families,
on expanding access to health care, to education,
and of course, ensuring safety for all of our communities,
certainly from gun violence.
Unfortunately, from the Republican Party, from Republicans, we are seeing a lot of really
extreme divisive cultural issues that do nothing but continue to divide people.
And so you spoke on the House floor earlier today against proposed tax that for Georgians,
can you explain that to me?
Absolutely.
So there are two bills, one 11 and one 12.
Georgia Democrats, we all supported House Bill 112 because that provided tax rebate that
was fair that provided $250, $375, $500 back into all Georgians' pockets, $111, that's a
tax cut for the rich. The way in which it was structured, $500 million would go to the
top 20% of earners while the average Georgian making around $50,000 to $60,000 received $6
a month.
Well, thank you so much for being here, Donna. So much, Sarah. We don't have a lot of time,
But I want to get some final thoughts from each one of you, so I'll start with you, Martha.
Well, quickly, I'm watching John Kennedy's bills on absenteeism in schools, as well as
changing the way we do superintendents, which is a maddubnic bill.
So those are the two ones that I'm watching closely.
Okay.
What about you?
I'm disappointed that with all the talk that we've had about school safety, whether it relates
to the alarm system, whether it relates to sports, I'm disappointed we haven't had more
talk about meaningful, common sense gun reforms.
and it looks like we're not going to have that today.
I don't think that that's happening this session.
And we did see the Senator Colton Moore
had his bill that dealt with the Brady Law
which will eliminate everything dealing with Brady.
Yeah, and I actually saw him with a little bit of a sense of humor
which is not something you usually see from him.
So maybe we're seeing a turning tide.
Yeah, we'll have to see. That was all in the Senate.
Any thoughts on that from you?
I don't think that something that the vast majority of voters in Georgia would really
embrace.
Okay.
Well, and we get to see what's going to happen in the House and the Senate with each
of these bills.
Last year, some of the bills passed in one chamber and never made it anywhere in the
House.
And sometimes they get substituted later.
So I'll be popping some popcorn.
So yeah.
We'll do that.
And then this stripping begins.
That's it.
Well, yeah.
Taking the bills out.
Thank you both for being here today.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
That does it for lawmakers tonight.
When each chamber will start looking at legislation passed on the other side, that's when we begin to see which bills will actually become laws.
Have a good...
