representative chair lady Beth
camp
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
members I am honored here today to
introduce my friend Billy Smith Billy
Smith is the pastor at Christ Chapel
community church located in zebulun
Georgia and he has been there for 20
years he is the founder of the church um
Christ Chapel has six locations in
zebulin Hamilton Hampton fville The
Pavilion and Barnesville I can assure
you that Scott
um Hilton knows where none of those
places are but I can assure you they're
wonderful places to be um Billy Smith
has been married to his lovely wife Tina
for 28 years and they have four children
Cole Laney Max and Ruby and Max is
joining us today I just wanted to speak
a little bit about Billy Smith um a
quote comes to mind a friend is one who
overlooks your broken Vents and admires
your flowers
anyway um at Christ Chapel there's a big
sign on the wall it's lit it's lit up
it's beautiful and it says saved people
serve people I think that is
probably one of the greatest things I do
love about Christ Chapel is their
dedication to serving the community and
um and loving people where they are and
accepting people when they come in quite
honestly I can't think of a more
welcoming environment to come to On Any
Sunday morning and at this time I'd like
to introduce Pastor Billy
Smith Mr speaker thank you sir
absolutely good
morning thank you representative camp
for those kind words Mr Speaker thanks
for the opportunity uh I'll be brief
with my remarks today uh you probably
heard your pastor say that before too
but I mean it I'll be brief I want to
talk to you just for a short few minutes
in the way of a devotion about four O's
the letter o in the alphabet
opportunities opposition obedience and
outcomes opportunities opposition
obedience and outcomes uh in the Old
Testament there's a Biblical character
named Nehemiah um he had been exiled
from his home after a war and the walls
of his town that he lived in and he
loved Jerusalem had been burned and
broken and they were laying on the
ground he got this news and he was
compelled to go back and help organize
he was a great leader organized uh the
effort to rebuild that wall in Nehemiah
1:4 it says when Nehemiah heard that the
walls of Jerusalem were still broken
down after a half century of the
completion of the rebuilding of the
temple he sat down and he wept uh most
of us have something in our life that
we're so passionate about that it makes
us cry or it makes us laugh we it gets
us up every day and it gets our motor
running and and those are opportunities
that each of us will have in life uh one
thing about opportunities uh you'll have
sometimes more in life than you know
what to do with there's a biblical term
concerning opportunities I think it's
important for us to understand it's
called
uh the ability to discern discern is
like cognitive like I have a mind to
make choices but there's a spiritual
component about that also about being
led and everybody in this room you have
opportunities every day we have to
decide which one of those are from God
and which one of those are just good
opportunities that maybe we should pass
on Nicodemus or excuse me Nehemiah could
not pass on the opportunity to go home
and rebuild the walls he saw the
opportunity and he seized it uh
unfortunately opportunity has a
companion every time there's an
opportunity there's always opposition
I'm sure you're aware of that when you
have an opportunity and you want to do
something great you want to make a
difference opposition always shows up
even the Apostle Paul in the New
Testament 1 Corinthians 16 and8 it says
that uh I'm going to stay on on here in
Ephesus he was pastoring and preaching
in Ephesus uh because a great door of
effective work has opened for me I have
an opportunity but then he goes on to
say but there will be many here who
oppose me and every time there's an
opportunity in life there will always be
opposition Nehemiah goes back to
Jerusalem gets permission from the King
that he is serving to go home and he
gets back there and he meets with
opposition a guy named tobiah another
guy named sand ballot and they had
friends cronies bully bullies that
wanted to intimidate the workers and the
force that he had gathered to rebuild
those walls I just want to remind you
that opportunities come and when you
seize them when you take advantage of
them there will always be opposition uh
the other o is is obedience when
opposition comes we have to decide if
we're going to stand firm um and our
stance do we have grit tenacity are we
consistent will we stay with it uh what
I find in scripture is from Genesis to
Revelation there are men and women in
the Bible who obeyed who obeyed God and
every time they obey God it seems to be
a systematic structure in Scripture that
blessing follows obedience and
unfortunately cursing and Hope
hopelessness and a lack of Joy follow us
when we don't obey God we have to decide
after we had this great opportunity we
experience opposition will we remain
obedient in the call in the in the
opportunity that God has given us the
fourth o is outcomes uh I've learned a
long time ago I don't always control
outcomes I wish I did I do control the
opportunities that I take I control my
attitude and my heart with opposition
and how I handle that I control whether
or not I'll remain obedient to that
opportunity or that call but I've
learned that God is responsible for all
outcomes I've worked hard a few times
and still failed I haven't worked as
hard as other times and had great
success in life outcomes really belong
to God Nehemiah went back organized used
his leadership skills rebuilt the wall
and the Bible says he rebuilt those
walls in 52 days him and his Partners in
that in that in that passage of time to
make that wall uh go up and be able to
defend their City 52 days if Genesis
World Records had been around they' have
went over there and made note of it I
can't believe this happen so quick now
God controlled that outcome but there
are other areas in our lives where we
have made plans and uh we have worked
hard and it didn't turn out the way that
we hoped so we leave that in the hands
of God I start where I'm at I use what I
have and I do what I can and I let God
do the things I can't do I hope the four
O's today will help you opportunities
opposition obedience and outcomes would
you stand today and let's go to the Lord
in
prayer we do want to remember uh the
young lady that lost her life Miss lak
and Riley our hearts are heavy for that
family today I'd also like to remember
Trooper edner who lost his life last
week work in a accident scene it's been
a hard week for Georgia and uh God still
loves us he still wants to take care of
us father I ask you today for for wisdom
and discernment and understanding help
me to realize that all my opportunities
come from you you're good and generous
and gracious God when those
opportunities come with opposition help
me to know how to handle that and keep
my eyes fixed on you give us all a
god-sized courage today to obey and walk
obedience out we celebrate today God the
outcomes no matter what they are thank
you for loving us caring us caring for
us and uh thank you God for being our
biggest cheerleader you're smiling over
us today would you bless what happens in
this room today I pray those things in
The Wonderful Name of Christ amen let's
pledge allegiance this morning I pledge
allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America to the Republic for
which it stands one nation under God

Raleigh
chairman we hour and friends if you
wouldd like to join chairman at the
podium you're welcome chairman we our is
recognized thank you Mr
Speaker colleagues today I'm going to
ask you for some Grace I typically pride
myself in keeping composure when
speaking from the well and I acknowledge
today that I may
fail right now I stand Here representing
a district a city a university that is
experiencing a wide array of emotions
from grief to anger and everything in
between Wyatt Banks and lake and Riley
to the rest of the state these may may
just be two names heard on the news but
to my community there are a son and a
daughter a friend and a sibling a soryy
sister and fraternity brother a
classmate and fellow
dog while these two situations are woven
together by grief in a shared Community
they're unique in the shortcomings and
failures that highlight for this body
and and for all elected officials it's
evident there's work to be
done and there will be time for that
there'll be time for discourse
legislation accountability but that is
not today I believe we all can agree
right now as the time for honoring these
two beautiful young lives robbed of
their bright future
Wyatt Banks was a freshman and member of
Kaa Sigma fraternity he was a political
science major whose future may have
crossed paths with any one of us in this
room he took academics seriously was a
member of the Terry College of Business
and Morehead Honors College one of his
fraternity Brothers stated Wyatt
diligently excelled in academics as a
member of Morehead Honors College and
was always eager to help his friends in
school School whenever they needed it
someone else said he had a radiant smile
and contagious
laughter Wyatt's positive impact on his
friends and family is
evident I would like you to I'd like to
ask you to join me in a moment of
silence to honor Wyatt banks in the
light he brought to those around
him Lake and Riley lak was 22 a nursing
student a runner a member of alpha Kai
Omega sorority and a Dean list student
lak's roommate said she never met a
stranger and she exuded kindness and
acceptance to anyone she
met her family said she's amazing
daughter sister friend and overall
person and will be missed every day it
is evident that lakan's life was spent
in laughter and
love I would like to ask you to join me
in a moment of silence to honor Lake and
Riley and the light she brought to those
around
her I know that several of us in this
room have sons and daughters who
recently attended or graduated from the
University of
Georgia so this tragedy hits close to
home and honestly I can't begin to
Fathom the Heartbreak these two families
are navigating and I hope you will join
me in covering them with prayers in the
weeks to
come but for every single person in this
chamber hug your loved one call them
check on them cherish
them don't let busyness of a be the
thief of the precious time we have left
together life is too
short I'll leave you with this my
district my community and the University
of Georgia are all resilient and strong
when times get tough we come together
and lean on another lean on one another
just like our student body is doing
today as they gather on campus for a
vigil in their
memory while time will continue we'll
never forget the precious names Wyatt
Banks and lake and
rley if you could join me in one final
moment of
silence God Rest Your Soul thank you Mr

morning I recognize that you're in the
midst of a busy legislative session so I
will keep brief my
remarks and here in the house I'd first
like to take a moment to honor the late
representative Richard Smith of Columbus
rules committee chairman who passed away
last
month I know Mr Speaker that he was a
dear and personal friend of yours a
dedicated Georgian and public servant
and it's a heavy loss for this
chamber over the weekend I spoke with
Augusta University president Brooks Keel
and ug president Morehead to convey from
my family from my office on behalf of
the whole state our shock and
outrage at this appalling murder of lak
and Riley in Athens and in solidarity
with her family and with the
delegations from Athens and
Augusta as I'm sure you will several
times throughout this day I'd like to
ask that we join in a moment of silence
in recognition of the loss of this young
woman her life cut too short and in
support of her family and loved
ones
thank
you now let me express to you what an
honor it is to visit you here in this
chamber where legislation is debated by
The People's Representatives who are
empowered by free and fair elections to
make the laws and this process of
representative government is essential
to our freedom the same Freedom
protected every day by the brave men and
women in uniform who defend our Republic
so I'd like to ask every military
service member and Veteran in the
chamber please to stand and to be
recognized and thanked by all of us for
your
[Applause]
service
my message for you this morning is that
I'm here to work with and alongside you
most of our constituents don't wake up
every day defining themselves as
Democrats or Republicans and neither
should
we and I think we all recognize that the
hatred and Division in our
politics are tearing this country apart
yes we can have principled and
passionate disagreements but we're
Georgians and Americans before we are
Democrats and Republicans and that's why
I don't invest my time in controversy
and notoriety but in building the kinds
of respectful bipartisan relationships
in the Senate and the kinds of close
working relationships with local elected
leaders here in Georgia that Empower me
to get things done for our
[Applause]
state that is the approach I'll continue
to take whether assessing threats to our
national security from my post on the
intelligence committee or working with
all of you and local Business Leaders to
implement the bipartisan infrastructure
law which is the most significant
investment in America's infrastructure
since the Eisenhower
Administration or fighting alongside you
to help Georgia's Growers gain greater
access to world markets for georg's
agricultural products it has been a
pleasure to work alongside so many I I
representative Robert Dicky here
chairman of the house Agriculture and
consumer affairs committee we have
worked closely together to advance the
interest of Georgia Growers I saw
earlier representative Yasmin Neil with
whom I continue working closely to
advance the interests of tenants across
the state of Georgia please know that
there is nothing too small if you don't
yet have my cell phone number I want you
to call me I want you to text me
whenever my office and I can be of
service to you and I'd like to close
close just by taking a moment to urge
all of
us all of
us as so much attention has been focused
on the plight of the most vulnerable
children here in Georgia and across the
country in Foster Care Systems to unite
at the federal and state level and
Democrats and Republicans to pass the
kind of meaningful reform that can
protect these vulnerable young people
from the kind of abuse and exploitation
that they face both here in Georgia and
across the country I hope we can work
together to get that done I remain
committed to being absolutely accessible
to you my team and I are standing by to
address your District's needs and to
help you and your team succeed please
call on me and thank you so much for the
honor and privilege of joining you in
this chamber and addressing you this
morning thank you very
[Applause]
much
bless
next
bill clerk will read the caption to
House Bill 825 House Bill
825 House Bill 825 I represent of
Fleming of the 125th to being entitled
in act to amend chapter 23 title 47 of
the official code of Georgia annotator
relating the judicial retirement system
schols require certain counties that
comprise single County judicial circuits
to supplement the retirement benefits
paid to the Circuit Superior Court
judges this bill have referred to the
committee on retirement that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee
substitute chair recognizes
representative Leverett to present the
Bill thank you madam speaker ladies and
gentlemen I'm pleased to present to you
house bill
825 um this bill uh is not only um a
great bill it's a source of some really
good Georgia
trivia um if anyone ever asks you what
is the only single County Circuit in
Georgia where the county side is located
in an unincorporated area of the county
and the county governing Authority has
constructed one or more permanent
satellite cour houses in the county you
will now be able to all them with your
trivia knowledge that is Columbia County
that's the only county in the state this
bill applies to apparently U this would
have been a local Bill several years ago
but the uh legislative Council now
contends that even a retirement bill
that just impacts one county has to be
passed as a general legislation so we're
amending a section in the code and by
adding a paragraph here that applies a
DA retirement for this one circuit based
on and it's a single County Circuit
based on the supplement paid to that da
so this has absolutely no impact on
State uh coffers it is not a bill that
will apply to any other circuit in the
state except for the Columbia County
judicial circuit the county endorses it
supports it and has requested it as has
the da
and I would encourage your favorable
consideration of this bill you have a
question the chair recognizes
representative Clark for a
question thank you madam speaker does
the gentleman yield yes ma'am so right
now this only applies to Columbia County
but in the future if a county did create
satellite because it's very specific
then they would be swooped into this as
well correct well almost they would have
to first of all have unincorporated
County site I'm not aware of any other
County except for Colombia County that
has that and they would have to build
satellite cour houses within the county
thank so I I don't think it really is
likely or feasible that it would ever
apply to any County other than Columbia
thank you thank you chair recognizes
chairman Carson for a
question gentleman yield I yield Mr
chairman thank you Mr chairman I I just
wanted to ask a question is it not true
that in addition to not affec affecting
any other County but Columbia county is
it not true this does not have any cost
to the state of Georgia at all is that
correct that is absolutely correct I
want to thank you for bringing this
legislation thank you thank you thank
you Mr chairman for hearing it there are
no more questions thank you madam
speaker ladies and gentlemen I would ask

House Bill
827 House Bill
827 House Bill 827 by representative
Smith of the 18th and others being
titled an act to amend code section
16820 of the official quod of George
annotated relating the livestock theft
so to provide for increased penalties
and to provide for related matters this
bill ad referred to the committee on
Judiciary non- civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee
substitute chair recognizes the newly
married representative Smith to present
the
Bill thank you madam speaker pro team
you're very kind uh today members I
bring to you house bill 27 and just to
let yall know what this would do this
would enhance the penalties for theft of
livestock in the state of Georgia these
enhanced penalties will help producers
of livestock and animal products from
theft of their very livelihood so what I
will let everyone know is this since
2019 you have seen the price of all of
your cattle uh that includes not only
cows Hogs chickens uh Guinea if some of
y'all still eat that here in the state I
know my great grandmother did but anyhow
uh this bill would help us to make sure
that those who are subject to theft of
livestock that we can lock these folks
up and that the penalties would reflect
you're looking at a price of cattle uh
anywhere from a good Cal calf pair
you're looking at right around
$1,800 Black Angus at least Bulls going
for much more than that but uh let me
explain to you with small farms versus
large Farms this cost to small farm arm
you're looking at supplemental income
for many folks especially north of I20
uh this is a huge detriment you're
talking about people going without when
they have their cattle stolen uh I also
want to Mark out or make sure that I
point your attention uh we added a
section to the bill and committee
requested from the Department of
Agriculture to actually allow the
Department of Agriculture if there's an
agricultural Nexus and some kind of
crime that they would have the authority
to enforce that uh We've actually got
some ongoing cattle rustling
investigations going on it's not just
limited to cattle rustling but this
would give them the requisite authority
to clear up the code section to make
sure that they can protect our livestock
as well as our agricultural products
here in the state of Georgia so Madam
speaker protim that is the bill and I'll
stand for any
questions you have a couple questions
the chair recognizes representative
dunahoo for a question to your left does
the gentleman you I do is it true no one
has come on my farm and stole any of my
honey bees you know I I would believe
that to be true and that if they had
they'd have been in for a warm welcome
that's right chair recognizes
representative Clark to your left for a
question thank you madam speaker does a
gentleman yield I do for a question um
so in this bill I noticed that the fine
goes from being
$1,000 to
$10,000 that's a
1,000% increase was there is there a
reason why the increase is such a large
amount that's a deterrent effect I will
point the G lady to historically they
would hang you for these sort of
offences if you stole livestock so uh I
I know it seems like it's uh very very
uh steep increases but uh I will remind
the general lady that used to they would
hang you for these sort of offenses this
is also to reflect the increased cost
like I'd mentioned earlier that uh the
fine needs to at least match uh a little
bit more than what the cost of the
livestock would be because if you let's
say that you went and you stole a whole
herd you're well over that $110,000
amount yeah did the J in further yield
one more question so if you um sto a
whole herd yes that would make sense but
what if you just stole one and I don't
um condone stealing anything but if you
just stole one cow would that be the
equivalent of increasing this fine by so
much it just seems like a very big jump
so I'm just trying to understand the and
I appreciate my informed colleague and
your question I I would say this it does
come down a lot of times to the
deterrent effect I think the fine is a
lot more civilized than going back to
Hanging folks for this offense well I
can definitely agree with that um thank
you thank you with that Madam speaker I
appreciate the good questions and I
would yield this well and ask this
body's favorable consideration the
gentleman has yielded the well is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered the chair hears none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to adopting the committee
substitute chair here is none the
committee substitute is adopted is there
any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill chair hears none
the report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the
machine there appears to be
parliamentary questions standing between
one bill another bill in lunch and us um
and they have
waved have all members voted
have all members
voted if so the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of the bill the a
were 156 the Nays were 12 the bill
having Reed the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed clerk will

most likely to commit these crimes what
will the 7.4 million be used for

Behavioral Health and also it will serve
communitybased violence intervention
prevention programs the funding requires

someone that is a behavioral health

[Applause]
HST Mr Speaker I know we got a long day
and we're racing towards crossover this
week so I keep my remarks to a minimum
even though the budget before you is
historic in size representing more than5
billion dollar in new Revenue the final
conference committee agreements that you
see before you aren't really that
different than the original document
that passed this house just a few weeks
ago the budget was placed on your desk
at
1207 not long after the confere signed
the document and I trust that you've had
time to review the relatively few
conference agreements I'd like to
mention a few of the
highlights before we talk about the
changes agreed to in the conference
committee report I'd be remiss not to
begin with a few of the governor's
recommendations that this House and
Senate agreed with an unprecedented $500
million Strategic investment in the
employees retirement system to improve
the funding ratio and the long-term
Financial viability of the system $300
million to provide a one-time salary

employees and teachers to continue
efforts to improve and stabilize the
state's Workforce $66 million for the

per DM increase for County correctional
institutions effective April
1st eliminating Contraband at our state
prisons is a priority of this governor
and both
Chambers working together with our
Senate colleagues we were able to
provide
19.7 million Dollar in new funding for
additional security measures at prison
facilities
Statewide These funds will be used
immediately to begin implementation of
these protection
measures the House and Senate agree to
provide the Department of Agriculture
with $100,000 in planning money and
$37.5 million for renovations and
improvements at the Atlanta Farmers

Geor Georgia Farmland conservation fund

infusion of $1.5 billion for
transportation and agreed to 98 million

existing project
pipeline $50 million in capital
maintenance for immediate resurfacing

Logistics infrastructure projects $250

increase to leverage Grant funds and
expand the program to 10 additional
school
districts to support Health the Senate
agreed to
$250,000 for a new fqhc startup Grant in
Cobb
County finally an item that I know is
important to many in this chamber the
Senate agreed to provide $11.55 million
to support the development of exhibits
for the annefrank education
center the there are a few
items of note that were not funded in
the house version of the budget that
your conferees have agreed to
include
$250,000 for the Department of
Agriculture for equipment and vehicles
to begin implementation of the Georgia
electric vehicle charging program the
house version had recommended a delay
and the conference position allows the
department to proceed with
implementation on a smaller scale than
initially recommended
$2 million for onetime Grants up to
$500,000 for the development of programs
of all-inclusive care to provide Home
and Community Based
Services a recognition of $10 million in
existing federal funds to be used for
character education programs in local
school systems $300,000 to provide
nursing faculty loan repayments this
addition helped support the nursing
education pipeline by incentivizing
nursing faculty to teach instead of work
in the field where they may make more
money $775,000 to support the
development of a donor breast milk Bank
Georgia is the only state in the
Southeast without a milk Bank this
Innovative program will allow Georgia
moms to provide life-saving support to

State Health Benefit Plan benefits to
retired injured in the line of duty
officers at the Department of Public
Safety these state troopers were injured
in service to our state and many still
have ongoing medical bills as a result
of their injury their current shbp
premiums are exceeding their retirement
benefits based on their years of service
the house fully supports this ad it just
came to our attention too late in the
process for us to include it in our
version
$250,000 to the state elections board to
support investigative
operations this function was first
funded in FY 24 budget and additional
support is
needed
finally a late
breaking and what one of the most
exciting items for me personally in this
budget is the
forthcoming changes or are the
forthcoming changes to the capital
complex earlier this morning the
governor revised his Revenue estimate
for the amended budget by $392
million to allow for renovations and
improvements to the capital
complex last
year in the budget we asked the Georgia
building authority to conduct a space
utilization study to assess the needs of
members and staff in the legislative
function the resulting study concluded
that new and upgraded space was
needed to effectively conduct
legislative business and serve the
public I want to thank Gerald Pilgrim
for spearhead spe spearheading this
project you
know A lot's changed since this building
opened in
1889 you don't have to take my word for
it just ask Terry England he was
here just making sure y'all are paying
attention in all
seriousness I don't tell you I don't
have to tell you that we're bursting at
the seams in this capital and across the
street in the
cob this budget provides a once in
a-lifetime opportunity to pay cash cash
in the full cost to protect the Safety
and Security of building occupants and
improve public access to the Capitol
Hill Complex with the construction of a
new legislative office
building as well as over $83 million to
restore the historical Integrity of this
building that was built so long
ago the legislative Services committee
which is comprised of members of the
majority and minority parties from both
Chambers recently voted to support this
project and we thank the governor for
bringing the revenue to make it
possible well I didn't hit every item I
certainly did hit highlights and there
are
many the budget
process the budget is a process and I'd
like to thank Rick Dunn with OPB and
chairman Tillery for the spirit of
collaboration in buttoning up this
budget as well as the staff of both the
house budget and research office and the
Senate budget and evaluation office for
crafting the document that you have
before you there's much to be proud of
in this budget and much good that is
being done with it I urge your favorable
consideration of the conference
committee report the house bill 9:15 and
Mr Speaker I will try to answer any
questions gentleman you for questions to
your left representative Kelly has a
question the gentleman's recognized for
a
question thank you Mr Speaker with the
chairman yeld yes sir Mr chairman isn't
it true that one thing we've heard is
there's a need in Georgia for more CDL
Drivers yes sir and is I experienced
that on I6 quite
often thank you Mr chairman will you
yell for one more question yes sir and
isn't it true that the over5 A5 million
that this budget provides for chattah
huchi Technical College in Dallas will
help us meet those needs in Northwest
Georgia you are exactly right thank you
thank you Mr
chairman gentleman further yield yes
sir leader Beverly right in front of you
has a question leader Beverly's
recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker to
gentleman Yi yes
sir I'd like to bring your attention to
section
16 Community Affairs Department
most specifically
80.1
z00 is it not
true that the increase in the one-time
Community Improvement Grants for two
thou to
$2,500,000 was set aside potentially for
democrats for small dollar amounts to
take back to the community to show that
they're working on their behalf is that
not true that that was included in our
budget yes further question yes sir is
it not true that it's been disregarded
again as it comes back across the aisle
so that there's no money to be found for
the Democrats who painstakingly brought
this to your attention so that we could
do what we need to do for our
communities so we worked with the Senate
and with the governor's office and DEP
Department of Community Affairs to try
to work this program out we could not
come to a successful conclusion on how
to make that work um
so I will be glad to discuss other
options that may be in this budget that
you see
now thank you Mr chairman I will only
ask for you to consider in the 2025
budget that we have a more robust
discussion that is based on integrity
and the members in this house can take
back to their districts something that
we say we fought for as well yes
sir be glad to thank representative
Panic to your left out in front of of
you has a question ladies recognized
thank you Mr Speaker does the chairman
yield yes ma'am Mr chairman I'm
referring you to uh
367.8 n yes that cut for
$450,000 on the Georgia Commission on
the Holocaust it was a request of two
million and the the gain the give was
1.55 yes does the gentleman further
yield I didn't what did you do you
understand I mean are you aware that
anti-Semitism has increased 360% since
October 7th yes do you believe now is
the right time to cut Holocaust budget I
don't well I I don't believe this is a
cut I believe this is an ad of 1.55
million for the exhibits of the
anrank uh to the commission for the
anrank
center does the G does the chairman
yield yes the request was to minut
million correct I think the request was
actually 4 million and we had put in and
after the conference uh in in Con in
conference with the Senate and with the
governor's office this is what was
agreed
upon it's still an addition of $1.55
million I have one more question the
gentleman would yeld isn't it true that
Governor Kemp has um been very proud of
the $6 billion Surplus he has and can't

more Mr chairman I'll take one more

down for a
minute we're moving on the rules

the gentleman in the well has to say if
you don't you can go to the any room or
that one or out
front chair recognizes whiper Chet to
present the Bill thank you Mr Speaker
and thank you colleagues I come to you
uh to present a very simple bill that is
not the
[Laughter]
case uh I have learned in the um this
this past year more about navigable
waterways than I care to know in the
rest of my life frankly um but I'm going
to give you a little history about the
bill and what the bill does um you can
recall sigy dive last year we passed a
bill Senate Bill 115 and what the bill
sought to do was to ensr gr the Public's
right to hunt fish in navigable
waterways now one of the things I I want
to point out for you all is this
navigable is a defined term in statute
it doesn't mean that you can just float
uh if you can float that's common term
navigable but the statute has a very
different term you must be able to
conduct Commerce up and down the river
at least some portion of the of the year
so what cinel 115 did was introduced one
of these doctrines it introduced the
public trust
Doctrine and over the ye over this past
year we had a special sub a um study
committee to um to study this issue
because it is a complex
issue the problem that came out of and
the excuse me the recommendation that
came out of that study committee was
this the recommendation was to remove
the words public trust Doctrine from
Senate Bill 115 while while retaining
the underlying purpose of Senate Bill
115 and that's what this bill 1172 seeks
to do one of the other recommendations
was to uh bring Clarity to whether or
not you can um trespass on somebody's
property uh when floating down a
navigable Waterway so that's is another
provision that we added into this bill
so you know all I you you all know that
I'm a fan of the language in the bill
and so I'm going to run through the bill
and uh try to explain to you uh what the
bill does and why the strikes were made
first thing I want to say to you is
this nothing in this bill does anything
to impact non-navigable
waterways right there's a distinction
here it's a property rights distinction
a navigable Waterway the property owner
typically owns from the low water mark
back in a a non-navigable Waterway they
typically own to the center of the
thread why is that
important because if you own to the
center of the thread in a navigable
Waterway then perceivably you own you
own the stream bed and then there may be
a problem with you walking and uh being
on the stream bed so nothing is nothing
in this bill changes what you can do on
a non-navigable Waterway so you you'd
likely been uh talking to or or gettinga
emails and text messages from folks in
the paddling community and they
testified in committee and their
testimony was that you're taking away
our rights well the law as it stands
today and if the P if 1172 passes is
that non-navigable waterways if you're
hunting fishing or floating you're doing
it at the permission of the property
owner you're not doing it at the a right
that was given to you by the state or
right that we've claimed that's a fact
that is how the law sits right now today
okay and so I want to make that clear
because everybody has come to me with
questions with regard to non-navigable
waterways this bill only impacts or
affects navigable
waterways so going through the bill the
first recommendation was we struck the
language for public trust Doctrine and
that's what happens on lines 11 through
15 well in on 16
through 19 we recited how the well this
is what I like to call a conclusion of
law in Senate Bill 115 we concluded in
Senate Bill 115 that we had the right
and we utilized the public trust
Doctrine as the means for saying that we
had that
right here on 17 and 18 and 19 we recite
the fact that we that the state retains
the ownership of the beds but it's
important to note in C Bill
115 that we delineated where the state
owned the beds if a if you had a pre-
1863 Grant so a Crown's Grant before the
state uh inherited the land or took the
land then you have a superior right this
is just common property law you have a
superior right so you got your rights to
the tream bed prior to the state could
even get the rights or give away the
rights so in in the event and and you
guys recall all of this um all of this
stemmed from a piece of litigation that
has now settled and the litigation was
um that the owner had a pre 1863 Grant
and had exclusive rights to the the
riverbed right all the settlement
settlement as I understand it and
speaking with some of the parties
involved is that the settlement is that
they folks can continue to pass through
they have exclusive rights to the fish
and they have exclusive rights to the
bed that was an agreement between the
state and this property owner this does
not impact that so what we've done here
has said that in a navigable stream
better bed excuse me not a better excuse
me in a navigable streamed the right of
hunting fishing and passage is extends
from low water mark to low water mark So
recall what I said at the very beginning
a navigable stream uh in a navigable
stream the property owner typically owns
from low water mark back so we've
recited exactly what the right is here
you have the right to pass you have the
right to hunt you have the right to fish
in a navigable stream bed no matter what
that's the only thing we've done we've
sought to Cle to clear this up now I
think you'll hear testimony about how do
you fish or how do you hunt or how do
you do any of these things without touch
impacting the stream bed well the fact
of the matter is there is nowhere not in
Senate Bill 115 not in anywhere in
statute that anybody has said that you
have a right to the stream bed there's
no no nowhere in in code that you can
find that or I can find that and if you
can find that please point that out to
me so what you're going to hear is that
we're restraining the right well we're
not we're not doing that I can tell you
from from my perspective I want to
preserve the right to hunt fish and pass
in navigable streams I have a son that
loves to fish for red breast I love to
fish for red breast I'm not a big duck
hunter at least on the river um and I
love to float and fish so it's not a
it's not a right that I want to
constrain what we want to do is clear up
an issue that is cloudy and it continues
to be cloudy we're trying to there's
another companion bill I have with this
and you probably already um had folks
reach out to you for this as I see it
this bill here 1172 clarifies what your
right is the following bill is going to
say where you can utilize that right
basically a presumptive a presumption of
the state's navigable Waters the last
piece of this bill is this nothing
contained in this subsection shall
construe to permit entry upon privately
owned lands adjacent to navigable
streams I can sit here and tell you
today that it's has never been the
intention of this General Assembly or
anybody in this body that I know of that
says that you should be able to float
down a river jump out of the river onto
private property and then sourn picnic
go hunt do whatever you want to do that
was the the biggest push back or
contention that I saw in the study
committee folks saying we we we're fine
with people floating we're fine with
people fishing we're fine with people
hunting on the river but we are not fine
with people getting out of the river and
going on the bank and so what this
provision seeks to do is clarify nothing
in this law allows anyone to get out of
the navigable Waterway and go onto the
property there is a name for that we've
already defined that what that is called
as trespassing that's all that's all
this bill does and I've said a bunch and
and uh I shouldn't minimize what I've
said this is not an easy issue this is a
a tough issue um but I I I I Tell You
Folks what we're doing here is
clarifying an issue that is very cloudy
and part of the reason that we're doing
this is because what we're having is
altercations on a river or stream Bank
you have folks literally I'll give you a
for instance you have a father and a son
floating down in a
canoe and you have a property owner
shooting at them now you guys you guys
Envision that now now this this this is
a real issue and if we do not clear this
up you're just going to continue to have
this problem and there's going to be a
you know some pain in doing this but I'm
telling you we have Rewritten this
language 15 times no less trying to
appease everyone here but ultimately
this is what you're doing you're
balancing private property rights with
the right to hunt fish and pass that's
all we're doing here and Mr Speaker I'm
going to yield to well unless there are
any questions and you have a couple of
questions very good uh chairman Corvett
to your right is recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker does
gentleman y yes sir is it not true that
the public truck trust Doctrine is an
area of law that has never been applied
to our freshwater rivers and streams
until
sb15 yes sir that is absolutely true and
I thank you for asking that question the
the public trust Doctrine is a doctrine
that is that has history in the United
States and in Georgia but on the
marshlands it Senate Bill 115 is the
first time the public trust Doctrine has
ever been overlaid onto the fresh waters
of the state of Georgia to my
knowledge representative mck Jackson
chairman Jackson has a question to your
right out in front of you thank you Mr
Speaker does gentleman yield to my
friend I do yes sir is it not true that
this was a learning experience on this
study
committee I I agree yes it was father do
you father yield yes sir I do is it not
true that this legislation will have no
impact on the assess rights of hunters
and Anglers but will provide additional
private property right protection to
some Georgians that is absolutely true
and thank you Mr um representative
Jackson representative ntz to your left
in the corner has a question does the
gentleman
yield yes is there any language in this
bill that could be construed as taking
or removing any existing rights that
repairi and land owners currently have
no and I thank you for that question so
it was posed to me that because we
recited um the right that you have uh on
lines 21 and 22 for the second time we
said but in such cases the Public's
right is limited only to such navigable
streams for passage and for hunting and
for fishing and it was posed to me that
because we said that twice that a judge
May interpret it different than what the
words say on the paper but I don't
believe there is any language in here
that says anything other than what it
says that you have the right to hunt
fish fish and pass on a navigable water
thank you for that clarification thank
you chairman Meeks to your right has a
question back in the corner thank you Mr
Speaker this gentleman yield yes sir I
just want to make sure that I'm hearing
you correct nothing in this legislation
prohibits or in or intrudes on my rights
to fish on a navigable Waterway is that
correct that's correct thank you m thank
you Mr thank you sir Mr Speaker we could
be I can do this all day but I will not
I'm going to yield the well your choice
yes sir I yield the
well you finally made a really good
choice thank you so
much and the wisdom of the rules
committee they have limited debate on
all of the issues before us this
afternoon so pursue it to house R
33.3 we have 30 minutes for those in
favor of this proposition 30 minutes for
those opposed and then 20 minutes for
the chair's time and 20 minutes for a
Minority Report we we'll begin with
those
opposed you have 30 minutes so there's
four of you signed up to speak against
the bill so I will let y'all divide the
time as y'all see fit representative
Jenkins is recognized to speak in
opposition to the bill representative
Jenkins
members of the House Mr Speaker friends
today I Rise an opposition of House Bill
1172 I want to begin by saying how much
respect I have for everyone who has
worked on this issue regardless of the
position they take
today um particularly to the whip uh we
don't see eye to eye on this but he he
certainly worked this issue to to try to
get me on board and and I have the
greatest respect for that uh so it's
it's with this uh spirit that I deliver
these remarks to you
today although 1172 affects all Georgia
Rivers I will focus my comments on this
issue to my River the Flint
River uh and quite honestly the way
House Bill uh or Senate bill at 115 came
about last year I think a lot of the
stuff I say I'm saying today we probably
would have already heard but uh I want
to make sure it's said in this chamber
last year the Monday before s die a
lawsuit was settled by DNR between the
state of Georgia and a property owner on
the Flint River this settlement created
a procedure by which any landowner
owning riverfront property in Georgia
could exclude the public from the river
with the support of the governor's
office we passed s SP 115 on sadaa to
correct this loophole created in Georgia
law by this settlement the bill
guaranteed that the public would
continue to have access to Georgia
Rivers and I'm so grateful to everyone
who made this legislation possible and
each and every one of you who voted in
favor of it this was ironically the 50th
anniversary of when then Governor Jimmy
Carter sent a letter to the core of
engineers directing them to cancel the
project to put dams on the Flint River
and preserve this River in its natural
state for the citizens of
Georgia to come to this conclusion
President Carter made several canoe
trips down the river one of which where
he camped at Sproul
Bluff the core of engineers evaluated
that one of the primary benefits of this
Reservoir project was
Recreation Carter disagreed he assessed
that there were eight large reservoirs
within 60 Mi of this River he also
assessed that there was a rapidly
increasing interest in Recreation on
free flowing Rivers particularly in the
pedmont it is the pressure from these
very recreational activities that caused
this River to be saved 51 years ago and
that are causing us to visit this issue
today
the decisions we make here today will
determine the river if the river is
available for the citizens of Georgia if
it will be lost to the
public the Flint River is truly special
in in that it's Georgia's only really
natural River and one of only 40 rivers
in the country that runs over 200 miles
unimpeded the fact that it is unimpeded
by dams makes it a remarkable sh bass
habitat in another ironic twist of fate
we're at another 50
anniversary 50 years ago today the or 50
years ago this year the Georgia house
attempted to move legislation to ask the
core of engineers to proceed with the
reservoir project over the governor's
objections although this measure passed
the house thankfully the governor Carter
was able to stop this in the Senate and
he was again able to preserve this
beautiful River for the citizens of
Georgia hopefully this time for good
President Carter assessed that saving
the Flint River to be the most
challenging task while he was governor
second only to the complete
reorganization of the government the
effect of this was to cancel a
hydroelectric Dam project in the middle
of one of the worst energy crises this
nation has known every single Chamber of
Commerce affected oppos cancelling the
reservoir project he also had to fight
the federal government I ask each of you
to consider this as you bear the
pressure you feel from competing
interest concern with
this last year I sponsored house
resolution 5 n this resolution was Rec
created before this settlement between
the state of Georgia and the property
owners on the Flint River and did not
contemplate this settlement I asked for
this committee because of the in in the
issues that were developing on the Flint
River with private land owners asserting
rights over the river that I feel they
didn't hold this conflict as the whip
said even escalated into gun violence uh
with a landowner serving a prison term
currently I also asked for the study
committee because Georgia law was vague
and confusing and contradictory on
fishing access before the passage of s
sp115 the Georgia legislature hasn't
acted on this topic since
1863 the president or the picture on the
board here is President Roosevelt
fishing at flash scholes near gay we
have to recognize that Roosevelt was the
president of the United States he didn't
just whip out an iPhone and snap this
shot it took a little work back then to
take a picture I feel that this location
was chosen above all others since it was
an iconic public fishing spot this place
was also where the Oki Fuki path if I
probably said that wrong of the Creek
Indian Nation crossed the Flint River
since the shs made a natural forward the
public has been on these shows since
before the state of Georgia as we know
it today we held the first Flint River
or the first river access study
committee a few miles from this location
in gay Ruth Nash the mayor of gay gave
the first testimony at this hearing her
family owned these very shs at one time
she recalled how every Saturday these
shows were like the Six Flags of
Merryweather County with the rocks of
the shs full of people of the community
enjoying the
river since that time this stretch of
river has passed from her family's
ownership and the new owner has
effectively barred the public from the
river here not long ago the Merryweather
County tourism board under threat of a
lawsuit was forced to remove any
reference to fishing from all literature
created from the newly created Flint
River water
Trail this River was set aside for the
citizens of Georgia 51 years ago growing
up in fat County becoming an eagle scout
in the Flint River Council spending my
summers at Camp Thunder and then
retiring from the Army to Maryweather
County this River has run through my
entire life I reject the false narrative
that the Flint River is a private
Waterway I know
better at the center of this discussion
is uh 448 5 the code section pertaining
to rights of adjoining land owners to
navigable
streams uh it reads as used in this trap
chapter navigable string means a stream
which is capable of transporting boats
loaded with Freight in the regular
course of trade uh mirr rafting of
Timber transporting wood shall not make
a stream navigable the discussion of
this law during the Committee hearing
became a focus on how big the boat was
that the legislature was talking about
at one point it was nothing less than a
coal barge being pushed by a tugboat and
interpreting this any St statute we must
prume presume the general assembly meant
what it said and said what it meant
toward that end we must afford the
statutory text that's plain and ordinary
meaning consider it contextually Etc
that's a passage from deal versus
Coleman 2013 I won't read the whole
thing all that to say the general
assembly did not say how lar how large
the boat must be it was important that
they would have if they thought it was
important and we cannot regard that that
that specification to be uh
an
Omission although the law doesn't speak
of boat size it does however speak in
plain language to usage traffic it
speaks of transporting Freight for whole
AP part of the year and it contrasts
this to occasional use of a river you
know with with floating logs and and
rafting Lumber something a land owner
does once in a lifetime the point is
that in 1863 when this statute was
passed Georgia was in the middle of the
Civil War history's first Total War
where transportation and man
manufacturing became military targets
just like formations on the battlefield
within a year Atlanta would be under
siege the state was in a dire financial
position and our transportation
infrastructure was strained navigable
Waters like any other thoroughfare had
to be maintained this statute and my
whole point with all this this statute
directs resources to traffic just like
the general assembly does today and any
other interpretation of this law ignores
the text of the statute the history and
it also ignores the history and customs
of our state
another I'll leave that out here let me
I'm I'm going to cut my comments a
little short because I don't want to run
out of time
uh so about a year after the passage of
this law the GE Georgia State uh
government appropriated funds to
facilitate navigability on the Flint all
the way up to Three Forks which is now
beneath the Atlanta airport whatever
boat they had in mind could make it up
the Flint River all the way to that
point another example of river Commerce
on the pedmont can be found in the city
of Campbellton in Campbell County uh
this count this the county seat uh was
moved to Fairburn in 1872 and this C
County was absorbed into Fulton County
in
1931 this this this County Seat had no
Railroad and relies solely on the
chattah huchi river for comment for
Commerce when this navigability statute
was passed uh the chattah huchi from
from camton to the scholes north of
Columbus is where cargo was freighted
where it finished its trip by
wagon the statute directed resources and
infrastructure to to traffic and in
accordance with the statute and other
laws and criteria DNR has done just that
in modern times with boat ramps on the
Flint River being about four to 16 miles
apart from above flat shs at gay
throughout the river to Lake simol
including the upper
Flint I gave this historical context
because another focus of the study
committee became REM removing the public
trust Doctrine from s sp15 uh this
Doctrine is found in English common law
it's a fin it's a foundation of the
North American wildlife management model
and it's also stated explicitly in
Georgia Code relating to saltwater
resources at the request of Industry
stakeholders I consented to this
removal however this bill goes too far
in other
ways
first off we do have a pending lawsuit
on uh relating to
sb115 it was filed by an adjacent land
owner uh so so there is currently a
pending lawsuit uh that the state of
Georgia is defending on this issue we
risk passing a bill that changes law in
the direct that is the direct subject of
a pending
lawsuit uh the bill also limits the use
of navigable Waters in an unprecedented
way never before seen in the history of
the state
it differentiates what the public can do
on navigable Waters based on whether the
property owner owns the stream bed or
not this requires the Boating public and
fishing public to have a knowledge of
property lines that they have no way to
know as they float Downstream we deal
with this same issue on our roadways we
have roads with deed rideways and others
that run across private property in the
case of roads without deed rideway the
public right to pass is based on the
fact that the easement exist across
private property a person driving down
the road cannot know who holds the deed
of the property they're driving on and
shouldn't have to care the road that I
live on begins as a deed rideway then
turns into an easement then turns back
into a deed
rideway only I know where the transition
occurs because I I know what my plat
looks like and I pay the
taxes and yes I also you know just like
just like the owners of submerged land
in the state of
Georgia the difference is in recent
years our Rivers have become far more
precious than our dirt roads in the
state leading to this discussion in the
general assembly navigable waterways are
the original highways of the state of
Georgia and they should be treated that
way so that we have Clarity and
consistency in the law let's not Tain
this process and limit access because of
unlawful activities on Naval waterways
instead we should focus on what is Naval
and what is not and exclude the public
from plac that are not
navigable in closing I want to say that
s sp115 was brought like all good
legislation to solve a problem it has
been the law of the land for eight
months and it really hasn't created any
problems uh as we consider HB
1172 we need to also consider the other
things that this bill does other than
remove the public trust doctrate from
Georgia
law we need to focus on codifying a map
of where the navigable Waters in the
state of Georgia lie so that Georgians
know specifically where they can navig
where they can pass in the state of
Georgia uh I want to thank the whip for
for passing uh for dropping legislation
to start that
process we cannot deny that George is a
very different place than it was in in
1863 when this legislation when this
legislature last visited navigability we
have to recognize that the Georgia
population has grown and that that this
issue does deserve the attention of this
legislature I urge you to vote no for
hb1
1172 and uh with that Mr Speaker I yield
the
well gentleman yield of the well
representative Scott is recognized to
speak to the
bill
okay thank you Mr Speaker you're good
take time today I stand before you to
express my deep concerns about House
Bill
1172 which aims to amend the chapter 8
of title 44 of the official code of
Georgia annotated specifically targeting
water rights the beer proposes to remove
references to the public trust Doctrine
which is a fundamental principle
principle safeguarding the interest of
the public in accessing and enjoying
Naval streams let us delve into why this
amendment is detrimental to the rights
of the citizens of
Georgia and the Integrity of our natural
resources first and foremost the public
trust Doctrine rooted in the common law
serves as a vital safeguard for the
collective interest of the people in
assessing and utilizing Naval strings by
removing reference to this Doctrine HB
1172 threats to undermine the
longstanding principles that Naval
streams are held in trust by the state
for the benefits of its citizens this
amendment essentially strips away the
protection that ensure our rights to
fish hunt navigate and engage in
Commerce along these waterways
furthermore this bill attempts to limit
the rights of Georgians by confining
their access to Naval streams solely for
passage hunting and fishing by doing so
it disregards the multifaceted roles
these waterways play in our lives and
local econom economies Nava stream
serves as quarters for transportation
avenues for Commerce and vital
ecosystems supporting diverse flora and
fer to restrict The public's interaction
with these natural resources is to
ignore the integral role they play in
our state's Heritage and economy
moreover by repealing laws that conflict
with this amendment HB level 72
disregards established regulations and
legal framework that have been put in
place to ensure the sustainable
management of our Water Resources this
Reckless disregard for existing
legislation could lead to Legal
ambiguity and disputes over water rights
ultimately jeopardizing the delicate
balance between Environmental
Conservation and economic development in
conclusion House Bill 1172 possesses a
significant threat to the rights of
Georgians to access and enjoy our Naval
streams by stripping away references to
the public trust Doctrine and limiting
the scope of our interaction with these
vital waterways this amendments
undermines the principle of equity
sustainability and stewardships that
should guide our management of Natural
Resources I urge you to stand against
this misguided proposal and uphold the
rights of the people to safeguard our
waterways for generations to come thank
you Mr Speaker and I yield The
Well the lady has yielded well
representa long Tran is recognized to
speak to the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise
to speak against this bill
if you take a look at lines 12- 15 it
removes the people's right to use and
enjoy all navigable streams capable I'm
not going to read the entire thing for
the last nine years I have taken a CB
Scout Pack down to Flint River for them
to Camp to
fish and what I teach these kids is the
air the water the fish the deer they
belong to Georgians they belong to the
state of Georgia for our use and our
enjoyment this creates Confusion by
removing those lines the public Doctrine
we create an imbalance to line 16 which
provides a person who owns a crown Grant
this is pro going back to the the days
of the monarchy you know we've had a
revolutionary war that should have taken
away the rights and given the rights to
Georgians to use the air the water the
fish and so I have very strict concerns
when it comes to Georgians using our
streams if you've ever seen 10y olds 16y
olds navigate our streams the boats can
be fairly large they can be very
small now the kids I have taken down to
Flint River they come from all kinds of
backgrounds different economic
backgrounds different ethnic backgrounds
and one of my fears is the confusion
this law will allow a person to say that
he justifiably shot a kid just trying to
enjoy our Parks because he believed the
kid was trespassing I as a former scout
master could not tell these kids what is
navigable and what is not this law
is too confusing so with that I urge
this body to vote no on house bow 1172
thank you Mr
Speaker gentleman has yielded the
well represented Mary margar Oliver is
recognized to speak to the bill
representative thank you Mr
Speaker I am a deep lover of the rivers
rivers and waterways of Georgia I'm also
a person who's made aot long time
observation of the way in which this
body interacts with that Courthouse
across the street and we have had a
longstanding rule Unwritten rule but
important rule that we do not interfere
with litigation that is ongoing about a
policy position that is very important
and complicated to
us the whip says that this bill is
brought forward to clarify the the
recent chaos of the courts and the
passage that solves certain chaos by the
passage of Senate
bill5 I say to my colleagues that this
does not clarify an important issue it
further muddies an important
issue I have uh spent most of of several
decades in private practice on the
Square indicator but all of my 20s I
spent in North Georgia rural Georgia and
in enjoyed almost every one of the
navigable rivers in a wide variety of
rafting and kaying I rafted bull SLO on
the chatuga river and if you don't know
what that is I'll tell you about it
because it was an exciting day today
last 23 years I've owned property on
fighten Town Creek in Fannon County
fight and Town Creek is a very important
contributory of the aoi river known as
the TCO River as it passes from Georgia
into
Tennessee I have also spent most of the
last 10 years on the River Keeper Board
of the alto Maha River so I have a
lifetime of deep deep and Abiding Love
for these rivers and
waterways the issue that I want to bring
to you is the way in which we are
further muddying Waters that do not need
to be muddied private shooting people on
the plint river is what began private
litigation that resulted in a settlement
as the whip said where private property
owners made a deal that served their
interest and in response the Georgia
General Assembly when that litigation
was over in
2023 this body with the Senate came
forward and passed Senate Bill 115 and
when Governor Kim K signed that bill he
went to the trouble detailing why he
signed it and highlighted the
significance of the rights of hunting
and fishing Georgia's waterways and the
Investments of tens of millions of
dollars that the state has made some of
you were here during Governor Sunny
Purdue's fishing uh in Go Fish Georgia
and that has been a significant economic
investment we have
made the whip says that that litigation
was ended by the settlement but the new
litigation that we've talked about again
is private property owners trying to sue
the state to recover some of the rights
that they believe they lost when we
passed Senate Bill 115 the state of
Georgia has made a motion to dismiss
that lawsuit so that issue is pending in
court right now we are Sweeping in and
trying to end that litigation in a way
that is going to further complicate and
make progress more
meaningful one of the things that
distresses me about the use of
1172 is that it goes back and forth in
my judgment between the issues of
fishing and hunting and the issues of
navigation and commerce the common law
right of public Trust incl included
Commerce and navigation and that is
what's raised the complication of the
issues about whether the kayaker that
falls out of her kayak can get on the
property safely to save herself and
perhaps her children that are with her
we are taking a step here despite an
enormous amount of serious good work to
further confuse the issue that I believe
was clarified by Senate Bill 115 with
the help of the governor was clarified
with
dnr's progress following
515 and taking a step that is
unnecessary at this
time I am further concerned about let me
go back to us interceding in litigation
that's
ongoing I think that the interpretation
that private property owner is trying to
make in
court uh that has been uh the state has
moved to dismiss is litigation if it was
allowed to go forward would further
assist in the strength that we brought
forward to help fishermen and Hunters of
Georgia through Senate Bill
115 this effort is not simple it is
further muddying Waters that don't need
to be muddied under a traditional
respect we have for not interfering with
ongoing litigation and I ask you to vote
no on
11772 for the purpose of giving further
security to the hunters and the Fisher
people of Georgia and also for the
respect that our governor has given to
Senate Bill 115 thank you Mr speaker
thank you representative Oliver the lady
has yielded the well that concludes
those opposed to the bill we'll now
recognize those in favor and we'll
recognize represent Al
Williams from down on the coast to speak
to the
bill representative Williams you're
recognized thank you Mr
Speaker um for reasons that some of you
know I was reluctant to come down today
because of some things happened in my
personal life but it's certainly
important I feel to speak to this
bill
now I served on the study
committee we went all over mostly North
Georgia and my first day there it just
occurred to me when I was in my hotel
room that God has a great sense of
humor I thought about
it said Lord back when the crown
grants and the state grants of
1863 were
done I didn't have a shot at not one
piece of this
land I couldn't get me a piece of land
and now Lord you've put me here to help
make a
decision and I got really
tickled it was doubly as
funny being one of only two
Democrats represent Jackson and
myself I think at first I felt kind of
like the Indians felt when they owned
all the land up
there must have been some kind of
feeling to leave that beautiful land and
go but they had to go they didn't leave
voluntarily so I had a lot of mixed
emotions but you
know whenever you start talking about
property
rights there a lot of passion on both
sides it's a passionate subject
and I like to break things down Calvin
schar used to say don't talk to the
giraffes talk to the goats and everybody
will understand it so in my SouthEast
Georgia
way I have an analogy I live on Highway
84 in Midway and those of you that live
down there know that Savannah is a
bedroom community of
Midway this I I thought somebody got
that after a while speak that's a joke
there y'all didn't get
it
but where I live is exactly six
miles from where Interstate 95 crosses
84 and in those six miles there is a
McDonald's on the left when you head my
way you can buy a Big
Mac some french fries and whatever else
and the
milkshake and the average person can
finish eating it by the time they get to
my
house and every weekend when Liv and I
get home the first thing we have to do
is clean up the ditch with all the mess
from
McDonald's and where it ends up does
happen to be private
property I don't have a problem
with the rights everybody the air
certainty belongs to
Georgia the only thing is once you leave
the air and the stream that's not yours
up on the
bank and anybody that has ever been in
anything public in Georgia knows how it
looks after people stop and enjoy
themselves very few people say let me
police this place up and leave it like I
found it
how would you like to own a home on a
beautiful stream and wake up every
morning having to clean
up be safe navigable waters are open to
everybody catch all the fish you want
it's another thing that bothered me Miss
speaker while I was on this
committee traveled everywhere saw some
of the most beautiful trout in the world
never got a real piece of Trout the
whole
time
they got a little embarrassed up in Blue
Ridge and fixed me some trout drip dip
and I ain't a dip E I wanted a piece of
fried
fish but how why is it so hard to
understand that you would want the
beauty of your property preserved if you
own lived on the
river navigable means the the ability to
move
commer
unimpeded and the navigable
river those that want to enjoy it can
enjoy it but it does not give you the
right to move on to private
property now I have
never you I didn't grew up living there
and hadn't visited much and when repr
Jackson and I were in North Georgia you
can understand understand why I didn't
visit much didn't get many invites and
sure didn't have nobody K to me up
there and as I sat around and looked at
folk fight over this navigable water and
private property it wasn't very diverse
up there either we didn't have a a local
chapter of nacp up there so it it it was
pretty well established that when the
Indians left that was the end of the
minority folk so but I defend the right
of those
to have private property and the right
to determine how it's
kept we've gotten it all twisted we've
got we we can make anything I had a
friend of mine said wherever there's a
mess he knew somebody that had a stick
and when you start with a mess and
you're stirring it you got a bigger mess
and land problems are a
mess I could
not I don't like like having to stand
here in opposition to some of my most
respected members of the democratic
party the minority I don't like it but I
served on that committee and I did not
oppose the resolution of the committee
and if I had opposed it I would have
been the first to speak against it today
but I'm not a
hypocrite I voted to move this Rec
recommendation forward into legislation
115 needed some straightening and
hopefully it will listen it's never
really going to be truly straight the
only thing more complicated than private
property is Cosmetology in
Georgia It's just
tough it's heavy lifting but I'm here to
ask you to think about the protection of
private
property and and and think
about me and po liby out there picking
up McDonald's paper rappers on our
property and when you do I would
certainly hope that you would move to
vote Yes for
1172 is a good piece of legislation it's
not the perfect answer but it's the best
we put forth so far with that Mr Speaker
I yield the well
thank you representative Williams we
appreciate your
viewpoints we do have a Minority Report
but is there any objection to the
previous question being
ordered chair is none the previous
question is ordered we do have a
minority report for up to 20 minutes
representive Stacy Evans is
recognized to speak to the Minority
Report so you can plan your day members
then we'll have 20 minutes for the chair
time after The Minority
Report thank you Mr Speaker good
afternoon
colleagues I am here today to speak in
opposition to House Bill
1172 before I get into the heart of my
remarks let's
all think about a couple of things as
I'm
talking why are we
here how did we get here what problem
are we solving who are we helping and
who who might we be hurting we could
just keep those questions in mind why
are we here how did we get here what
problem are we solving who are we
helping who are we
hurting stepping back Senate Bill 115
came to us because a landowner sued the
state and said he had exclusive rights
to fish a certain area because he owned
a portion of the bed of the Flint River
land owner Su the state only I can fish
here it didn't have anything to do with
the hilltop on the side of the beautiful
River it wasn't about trash being left
on the hill it wasn't about people being
on that hill at
all it was about people fishing in the
river fishing in the river and the
landowner said no only I have a right to
do that or only I have a right to give
you permission to do that that's what
the lawsuit was about landowner sues the
state
it was also not because an
environmentalist sued a landowner and
said that they were using too much water
from the river for irrigation or
anything like that it wasn't it was the
landowner trying to stop people from
fishing keep that in mind that case
settled just before s die last year and
it led
to understandable fear that other
landowners were going to do similar
things that they were going to bring
other lawsuits to try to block block
public access to our streams in our
Rivers so enter Senate Bill
115 Senate Bill 115 was a simple bill
there's not always simple bills this one
certainly isn't but Senate Bill 115 was
it just stated that under the public
trust Doctrine the public retains the
right to fish hunt and Transit our
navigable streams even where the title
to the stream
bed maybe belongs to a private party
that that private party has the bed but
in public trust so you can own the bed
and it's yours but you can't keep the
public from being in the water standing
on the bed while they're fishing um
things of that nature that's all it did
so after we passed in a bill 115 it's
been mentioned here there was another
lawsuit by another landowner saying that
they own the bed of a river of the river
of another section and also wanted to
prevent public fishing there and
challenging Senate Bill 115 so again
landowner suing the state trying to keep
people from
fishing not an
environmentalist not somebody suing
about trash on the hill no no one no one
disputes that ladies and gentlemen none
of these bills either s Bill 115 or this
bill is about trying to keep people from
walking up the hill while they're
fishing it's about being able to stand
in the Stream perhaps maybe your fishing
pole hits the bottom of the stream bed
while you're in the water
so how did we get here so the study
committee made the recommendation to
remove reference to the public trust
doctrine that was really it from the
study committee so anybody who is on the
study committee and you want to stay
true to what you did voting against
House Bill 1172 doesn't make you a
hypocrite because the study committee
just said remove reference to public
trust Doctrine House Bill 1172 does so
much more than that now even this public
trust Doctrine thing I don't really
understand the concern there but I know
that the study committee wanted to make
sure that farmers and everyone was
satisfied that this wasn't going to open
the door for environmentalists or other
to others to sue them and say you're
taking too much water from the stream
the public trust says you can't do that
um there was a case in North Carolina
that folks were concerned about this
fear was unfounded and we can talk about
those reasons but it doesn't really
matter no one I'm not opposed to
removing reference to the public trust
doctrine that would be fine um I don't
know anyone who's opposed to that really
honestly not not much
um what I am here to bring our attention
to and what I want you to focus on is
the study committee says remove
reference to public trust Doctrine just
reemphasize that people have the right
to go up and down these streams and fish
and hunt and if they touch the bottom
while they do it so be it no one's going
to be mad but and you still don't you
still don't get to go up on the hill and
no one's saying that do um but what 1172
does is
more I was going to tell youall about
all the reasons why the public trust
Doctrine fears were really unfounded but
you don't need to know that because no
one's against it right so we're just
going to move to what is the what else
of
1172
1172 removes the Public's right of
Transportation Commerce and navigation
on navigable streams that is in
lines 12 through 15 you'll see those
words are deleted the only words that
ever come back are hunting and fishing
so that's why why did we do that no one
has has told us that house buillt
1172 establishes that the public has the
right of passage for fishing and hunting
on navigable streams even where tidle in
the beds is in a private it belongs to a
private party but and this is the part
that's concerning if you if you would
look with me I know this can be a little
lawyerly here so pardon me but lines 21
to 23 if you could focus there for me
1172 is trying to say that the public
has a right of passage for hunting and
fishing on navigable streams even where
title to the bed of the stream May rest
with a private party but then there's
this caveat language in lines 21 to 23
that says
but is limited only to using navigable
streams for passage and hunting and
fishing and doesn't mention the right to
stand on the stream
bed now I doubt that I fish as much as
many of y'all in here but I don't think
it takes a PhD in fishing to know that
you probably need to touch the stream
bed to effectively fish so why are the
why is is that caveat there to only talk
about the use of the stream but not the
stream bed taken on its face the
language limits the right of passage and
hunting and fishing to only using the
water but not the bed
now we've heard that this is not a big
deal because Senate Bill 115 didn't
really address the issue of stream beds
either well I disagree with that but
assuming for argument at best Senate
Bill 115 was silent on this 1172 is not
silent it has a specific carve out that
gives you the right to the water when
you're fishing but not the
bed
why we heard at the beginning of the
presentation here that we wanted to do
two things today in 1172 eliminate
reference to the public trust Doctrine
okay fine again I'm not opposed to that
that's in lines uh 12 through 15 we can
do that but then we heard the second
reason that we were here today for 1172
was to bring
clarity about whether you can
trespass now I have read this bill 1172
way more times than I ever cared
to I don't see any and backing up the
only thing about trespass that I've
heard up here today is that you can't go
up on the hill and have a picnic can't
go and and take a take a nap I don't see
one word in how Bill 1172 to clarify
that the public has no access to the
land to the left and the right of a
stream I don't see that so the only way
I can think of that 1172 clarifies where
we can't trespass is that it's got a
carve out that says I can be on the
water but I can't be on the bed that's
the only thing I can think of in 1172
that clarifies trespass so if you're on
the water if you stay on your boat on
top of the water you're probably fine
fine but if your fishing pole hits the
bottom or you get out and you've got
your waiters and you are touching the
bottom I think you're going to be in
trouble so but if that's not the
trespassing that we're talking about
then why can't we get clarity in the
bill that it's the stream bed and not
just the water that's the question and
I've been asking it since committee and
I think it it it's helpful for for folks
to have the full context here this bill
barely made it out of Judiciary
Committee there was a tie and the tie
was broken
in favor of moving the bill along but we
had a lot of debate we heard from lots
of people who enjoyed our favorite
pastime of hunting and fishing and
talked about how they wanted to have
protections then we heard from the
Georgia Wildlife Federation Georgia Farm
Bureau Georgia Forestry Association and
Georgia Agri Business
Council I asked every one of the
representatives from those organizations
what it was their members wanted to
prevent that they didn't think was
already covered by Senate Bill
115 the only thing I heard from any of
those fine gentlemen that are there to
represent these
organizations was public trust
Doctrine so I come back
again why are we doing more and if we're
trying to
clarify where we don't want people to
trespass why is there nothing in 1172
that talks about the hilltops
the only thing I can find again is that
car out that says you can be on the
water but it doesn't include the
streamed and I then I I'm always
searching for the why and I know I know
so many of y'all are in here like that
we know that these organizations that
I've mentioned are wonderful
organizations I have the utmost respect
for them but we are all big boys and
girls in here and we know that these
organizations always have the Sportsman
side right they have the folks that are
um there to protect the nature side of
of what these organizations are meant to
preserve but in everything ladies and
gentlemen there is a business
side who wants to charge you who wants
to make money off of our favorite
pastime hunting and fishing ladies and
gentlemen that's what I think must be
going on here today because otherwise I
don't know why we're not talking about
the hilltops I don't know why we've got
this carve out and I don't know why the
Chamber of Commerce has put a letter on
your desk urging you to vote for this
otherwise nature focused Bill Mr Speaker
I yield the
well thank you
representative for yielding and your
presentation now we have 20 minutes for
chairs
time the chair of the committee from
which this bill came chairman Gunther
has recognized to speak to the bill have
up to 20 minutes or you can share thank
you Mr
Speaker well there's been a lot said
about the public trust Doctrine so I
want to address that
first um Senate Bill 115 was rushed
through the process it didn't appear
until the last day in the last
hours uh before it became came in here
to us for us to vote on
not going through that process the bill
wasn't properly
vetted the term or phrase public trust
Doctrine there's been a lot of
discussion about that but what is the
public trust
Doctrine there is some common law on it
there is some law Roman law on it from
what period of time are you talking
about the public trust Doctrine and
there's 50 states out there that have
some sort of public Trust doctr
out there which one does the state of
Georgia go look to to apply here that's
the problem with leaving public trust
Doctrine in this language the courts
will fill that void by going somewhere
else looking for law to put in that and
it didn't need to be that
way that was the the reason for the
removal of the public trust
Doctrine so what does this say
what you can do what this bill tells you
you can do is you can go fishing on
navigable streams you can go hunting on
navigable streams although I'm not a
hunter or a Fisher the only hunting and
fishing I do is golf
balls so with this you can go down the
stream on a tube or a canoe or whatever
kind of floating device you
want you can get out of that floating
device and step onto the stream of the
bed and you can fish as long as you're
doing it for passage hunting and
fishing that's what this is this is all
about the navigable streams and what you
can do on it and if you look at
it on line let's see we'll start at the
end of 16
where it says the general assembly
further finds that by common law the
citizens of this state have an inherent
right to use for passage and for hunting
and fishing all navigable streams from
low water mark to low water
mark So above the low water mark the
adjacent land owners own that land you
can't trespass on
that if you have a grant a a a crown
title or a state
Grant you actually own the bottom of the
river the Tera
Firma so this this is akin to an
easement for the public they have the
right to go on there for passage which
means they can float through if they get
stuck on a rock they can get out move
the boat and continue their their trip
or they can do it for hting or
fishing it is okay to trespass on the
riverbed the Tera Firma
there as long as you do it for these
purposes this bill simply
clarifies what Senate Bill 115
started and in my opinion created a big
mess and that's why this bill is here I
would ask you for your support I think
it's a good bill I think it helps
clarify the law we still have the issue
of
navigability that will come up later but
that is that is the I think the
remaining big issue on
this discussion that we're having here
so with that I'll yield the well oh and
yield my time to the chairman Whit
forette chairman has yielded the well
the remainder of his time to whip James
brette gentleman's
recognized thank you Mr Speaker and I
will be brief
I just come up here and do uh the
rebuttal right um and I've got to set
the record straight as I see it uh we
had a presenter present that the in
lines 12 through 15 testified that we're
removing the right if you continue
reading the bill 17 through 19 says
assembly further finds that the common
law by the common law the citizens of
the state have the inherent right to use
for passage and for hunting and for
fishing all navigable streams from the
low water mark to low water mark so so
where the gentleman is right we did
remove the right we we just recited it
in another part of the bill um this
ongoing litigation bar I'm not sure
where the idea came from but uh a g lady
was um mistaken when she said that that
litigation had settled uh when we took
up Senate Bill 115 Senate Bill 115 was
passed last year the settlement for that
piece of litigation just happened a week
and a half ago or two weeks
ago and also I was submit to you all if
we didn't do anything that wasn't was
under litigation we wouldn't do anything
in this house there we couldn't get
anything done there there we couldn't do
nothing there's so much litigation
happening around the state on so many
different issues we wouldn't get
anything done here if we couldn't legisl
over
litigation
um definition of cover um
the it was it was said up
here that this this this bill was not
about people on the hill and U I'm going
to give my friend Grace um
because she testified not being in the
study committee and hearing the litigant
say the reason I'm bringing this
litigation is people standing drinking
camping on my property that is the
reason the litigation was brought he he
specifically said that I don't care if
they float down the river but being up
on the hill just imagine this I'm going
to paint you a very I'm not a good
painter but I can speak it to you let me
paint you a picture you're sitting in
your backyard on the Flint River with
your family and friends enjoying a
Saturday having some sweet tea or water
or whatever it is you drink and you've
got four or five of my good friends on
your bank in short cut off um jean
shorts
no shirt on drinking beer casting saying
the most uh you know talking like we
talk on the river uh can you imagine can
you imagine that I mean this is this is
literally about that I mean that's what
was the initiation of the litigation was
so the litigant
testified lastly I want to I want to say
currently the the way the law stands
right now if we don't pass
1172 if you're on a non non-navigable
Waterway if you're floating fishing or
hunting then you're doing it at the
permission of the property owner this
doesn't change that doesn't touch that
area law it doesn't it doesn't um remove
any right
that's all right it was also said that
this bill says nothing about trespass
and I want to direct
you because I'm a big fan of the words
on the page 24 and 25 nothing contained
in this this subsection shall be
construed to permit entry upon privately
owned lands adjacent to the naval
streams specifically testimony was next
to the streams adjacent to me means next
to the streams you can trespass on that
land folks we're over complicating an
issue here we're reciting what the right
is the right for Georgians to hunt fish
and pass on navigable waterways even
where someone has a a title pre1 1863
you still have the right to hunt fish
and pass and with that Mr Speaker I ask
for your favor consideration and thank
you I yield the well gentleman has
yielded the well that completes the
discussion on house SP

previous question being ordered the

in the 156 to be titled act to amend
article one of chapter 3 title 27 of the
official code of Georgia annotated
relating to hunting so it's authorized
fluorescent pink hunting outer garments
this bill hav referred to the committee
on game fishing parks that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee
substitute since we're talking about
hunting and fishing
I thought this may be appropriate time
to hear from representative Hagen as she
presents House Bill 927 representative
Hagen recognized to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker um House Bill
927
um if you're
hunting in some cases you currently have
to wear 500 square in of blaze orange
this bill simply adds the option of
wearing fluorescent pink if you choose
to do so this bill passed unanimously
out of gamefish and Parks committee it
was subsequently recommitted back to
that committee where it received an
amendment that amendment is uh it
extends the sunset uh allowing for the
use of air guns when hunting in certain
circumstances Mr Speaker that is the
bill and I would ask for your favorable
consideration of this measure the lady
has a
question I she y for a question
representative
Beverly minority leader Beverly has a
question right there in front of you
thank you Mr Speaker uh this is G leer y
i do we talked about this before but
there are certain color blind anomalies
that people have and you could have a
color blind anomaly where you wouldn't
be able to pick up the color pink pink
color red color green orange can you
talk to me about how this bill would be
impacted with folk who have color blind
anomalies absolutely thank you for uh
bringing that up and I appreciate you
the conversation that we had about that
couple weeks ago uh so we had a
conversation about color blindness and
how the color pink might impact someone
whose color blind if they're hunting we
did some research and we found that it
is true that in with some types of color
blindness a person may not be able to
detect the color pink however we also
found that they cannot detect orange
either so our determination was that
that this bill um would not negatively
impact uh those hunting who chose to
wear the color pink there if it's
fluorescent pink and I do thank you for
bringing that up chair lady yel for
another question from the leader on the
other side of the aisle since they've
been talking rep chair leader f stration
excuse me is recognized for a question
lady y I do thank you for bringing this
measure isn't it true that this bill was
brought because it was uh recommended
the idea initially came up from a
14-year-old student in the district that
I represent Carly who had this idea
she's an avid uh Outdoors woman enjoys
hunting she had this idea and brought it
to you for introduction this session so
this is not only great policy it's been
a great uh Civic engagement opportunity
for a young Georgian to see the
legislative process work through isn't
that true that is absolutely true and I
thank you for bringing that up as a
former Middle School teacher nothing
makes me happier than to see um a a a
young person engaged in the process and
I actually um mistakenly assumed that
she did she did this research and
brought this forward as a school project
but that was not the case she simply is
passionate about hunting and wanted to
see this as an option um should someone
choose to want to wear pink instead of
orange so thank you for bringing that up
and I do uh thank her for her all of her
hard work in the research um and uh
bringing forward this idea Mr Speaker if
there are no other questions I would
yield the well and ask for your
favorable
consideration the lady has yielded the
well she did have one more question but

thank you Mr Speaker uh ladies and
gentlemen of the house uh many of you
may know I spent my career up until five
years ago when I sold I spent my
lifetime trying to keep people out of
Institutions and serve uh seniors in the
community and others with disabilities
particularly developmental disabilities
this bill I bring you today is a is a
department bill by the Department of
Community Health it is the enabling
legislation that allows Community Health
to develop and Implement a PACE program
now the PACE program the acronym is
program for allinclusive care for the
elderly and so what this is is a
capitated program and Innovative program
to provide all of the Care
that an individual needs in the
community as a age in place and uh to
avoid skilled institutional placement so
these individuals are all on Medicaid
they also are on Medicare they're duly
eligible and so they're already entitled
to nursing home care when we serve them
for less and give them a better quality
of life by keeping them in the community
is good for them and it's good for
taxpayers and that is what indeed this
program is all about I do want to
mention that um this this program is
already uh active in about 32 states
it's totally voluntary so individuals
choose this as a route like they do for
other waivers as an alternative to
Skilled institutional placement and uh
uh I do want to make sure that those of
you know that initially there are three
sites Chosen and that was done by an
assessment that the department did
starting last year they're going to be
there's going to be a site in Atlanta
site in Mon and a site in Savannah
initially and uh hopefully with success
they will move on to other areas of this
state and continue to give people
options to age in place uh when they are
on Medicade Mr Speaker I think that

the caption to House Bill
1218 1218 hpit 1218 by representative Le
of the 123rd to be entitled an act to
amend article one of chapter 5 of title
53 the offici code of George annotator
relating to General Provisions relevant
to probate so as to provide notice to
beneficiaries of a testate
estate the gentleman from Elberton has
recognized to present the bill
representative Leverett thank you Mr
Speaker ladies and gentlemen uh this
bill uh fits in with the old expression
of why do we meet every year to fix the
things we messed up the year before 12
18 is amending a statute that was
created by House Bill 91 which we passed
last year that bill uh created a new
section in the probate code to deal with
situations or try to try to protect
beneficiaries of Estates when the
executive that gets appointed absons
with the money it would require executiv
to notify the beneficiaries when the
executive is appointed uh the the main
intent of the bill is still preserved
but the fiduciary section of the State
Bar and and the probate judges requested
certain changes to that statute to make
it more effective and to strengthen it
so under the the law as passed last year
which is set out in the bill you can see
there parts of it are stricken the
executive would have to notify
beneficiaries that the executive had
been appointed within 30 days this gives
the executive more time but it it
preserves the the the portion of the of
the existing law that says that the
executive can be cited and fined or
remove mood for failing to comply with
that requirement um we also uh try to
clarify that notices don't have to be
given if the beneficiary acknowledges uh
that the the beneficiary has been given
a notice so it it if the beneficiary
just consents you don't have to go
through the formality of a notice we
addressed some other technical issues
about how you would notify a trust um
and um we also again we extended the
time by which the executive has to
report back under the under the um uh uh
old law it was affirmative Duty or it
was it was a procedural Rule now it's an
affirmative duty of the executive so we
think this makes it stronger in and the
probate judges and the fiduciary section
believe it's it's more workable within
the existing framework of probate
proceedings so that's the gist to the
bill um I will yield for any questions
Mr you have no questions thank you I'll
ask your favorable consideration House
Bill 1218 gentleman yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered chair here's none

Bill 1237 by representative canon in the
172nd and others to be entitled act to
amend code section
2811 of the official code of George
annotator relating the definitions
regarding agricultural commodity
commissions this bill I refer to the
committee on agriculture and consumer
affairs that committee recommends that
this bill do pass the gentleman from
down in motter representing Chaz Canon
recognized to present the Bill thank you
Mr Speaker I've been told to be brief
and I'll try to do that this is uh House
Bill 1237 this is a department of a uh
cleanup Bill short and sweep for the
Citrus commodity Commission in the
original bill it defined a citrus
producer as someone that owns or
operates at least five acres of citrus
fruit bearing trees soon after the new
commission was formed they determined
that it would would be much easier for
them to
quantify uh tonnage or weight as opposed
to acreage so what this bill does is
simply remove the definition of what a
citrus producer is under the commodity
title which is where it defined a citrus
producer by acreage and by doing this
it'll give some flexibility to the
commission to spell out definitions of
what is to be required to be a citrus
producer in the marketing order uh
rather than in statute uh this method ex
exactly mirrors that of the uh blueberry
commodity commission so overall a
cleanup bill it adds some clarity and
some flexibility and it's something that
supports a growing industry for our
state's number one business that's the
purpose of the bill Mr Speaker and I'd
like to recommend this bill do pass I'll
stand for any questions gentleman has no

Newton of the 127th and others to be
entitled act to amend Article 2 chapter
7 of title 48 of the official quod of
Georgia annotator relating the
imposition rate computation exemptions
and credits relative to income taxes
this bill have refer to the committee on
ways and means that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee
substitute gentlemen from the home of
the Masters a Augusta GA representative
Newton is recognized to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I
bring before you today uh House Bill
1090 this bills on a foundation that was
started a couple of years ago and the
fostering success act we know that
children that are in foster homes are
some of the most challenging situations
across our state that that are in such
need what we find out when we pass that
bill is that their needs don't end when
they turn 18 and they're officially out
of foster care so we do have the
fostering success act today's Bill house
1090 kind of augments and improves that
previous legislation it more clearly uh
assists former foster children ages 8 to
18 to 21 and it helps them make a
successful transition to adulthood um
House Bill 1090 does that with three
primary items it cleans up language
regarding eligibility of at risk youths
um who could benefit from this for
example um it allows uh youth who who
turn 18 or or in who graduate from high
school say in May they're not attending
a vocational school until sometimes July
or August so we changed attending to
enrolled we're just trying to clean up
definitions rather than leave kids out
there with no support no mentorship and
no U uh assistance uh while they're
waiting a couple of months there in the
summertime things like that uh Second
thing it does it it more clearly defines
uh what mentorship is there's NE there's
need with nutrition with Transportation
with housing um so many things that are
important but mentorship is a key part
of this and so it more CL better
clarifies what it means to be a mentor
and to be in in Li of a parent the one
who can help these these young youth uh
Advance second thing it does it opens up
the definition a little bit of the types
of uh corporations and entities that can
donate to this program there was a $20
million maximum we didn't even raise
half that with a regular income tax
there is a provision in here that allows
some companies that owe other things
like premium taxes to participate in
this program to help uh youth coming out
of that um finally this bill does put
some guardrails around the spending of
this money there's a lot of great
organizations that help foster children
the state itself has some great programs
and some great individuals uh that we
all know about that make such a
difference in these challenging
situations we wanted to put guard rails
to where this is new money that doesn't
just go for overhead somewhere but the
bill specifies that at least 80% of the
money will go directly to the children
uh at least 80% hopefully more uh so so
that they can adequately get the care
they need I appreciate your support on
this we I think it's a good step forward
I wish I could tell you about the
examples of kids that have been helped
by this maybe we'll get to that one day
I know representative Hutchinson does a
great job with that with us but I'd
appreciate your support Mr Speaker glad
to answer any question gentleman has a
question represent Kenard to your left
is recognized for a question is it
gentleman yield I do isn't it true that
in my transitional program for the
homeless that we get a steady stream of
individuals who have aged out of the
foster care system and they're often uh
broken by the system and measures like
this will help turn that around I think
the gentleman is absolutely correct and
knows of what he speaks thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well gentleman had
no further question as yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here's
none the previous question is ordered is

cease that practice cease but this is a
department cleanup Bill uh brought to us
from Dr Tumi and um it basically um
clarifies um rules and regulations
around adding definitions uh adding
certain drugs uh to the commissioner
standing order and revising outd dat
code such as um the requirement of the
the department to approve and issue uh
Mass Gathering permits which was put
into place way back in the uh in
response to the Woodstock Music Festival
so we felt like it would be a groovy
idea to uh remove that since it hasn't
been used in all these years Mr Speaker
I'll take any questions if there are any
I think you just answered them you have
no questions I'll yield the well thanks
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered to chair his done
the previous question
is ordered is there any objection to
agreeing to the committee substitute
chair here has none the committee
substitute is adopted is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill chair has none the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and Mr
clerk will you unlock the
machine
have all members
voted all members
voted
if if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of House Bill 10 28 the
Y's are 167 the Nays are zero this bill
having received the the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed Mr clerk will you read the
caption to House Bill 12471
1247 house B 1247 by representative
lever of the 123rd and others to be
entitled act to amend title 44 of the
official code of George an relating the
property so as to provide for a transfer
on death Deeds this bill have referred
to the committee on Jud Judiciary that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee
substitute chairman L is recognized to
present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen House Bill 1247 is probably
one of the most seemingly boring bills
that will be of the most consequence to
you and your constituents this year it
allows for a vehicle called transfer on
death Deeds this was first to my
knowledge proposed by representative Lim
some years ago and uh
I think it's a great idea it basically
allows you to execute a deed to provide
that real estate will pass to certain
beneficiaries at your death now you you
can there is a form of Deed by which you
can do that now it's basically conveying
a remainder interest in reserving a life
estate with a power of sale and a right
to counsel and revert but that takes a
bit of time and a bit of complexity to
draft in this code section the the the
the the statutory framework is
established where you can execute the
the deed and the form of the deed is set
out in code you can change the
designation or you can revoke the
designation and there's a process by
which the beneficiary can accept at your
death so this this simplifies it it
streamlines it and it's much more
accessible to people it it provides them
with a will substitute when they may not
have sufficient funds to pay for estate
planning or Preparation of what is a
fairly complex sophisticated deed so I
would recommend it to you highly I think
it's a great consumer uh protection and
a great consumer Advantage it's a it's a
a good vehicle to provide for your
constituents and it provides them an
alternative when they might not be able
to afford a more intensive kind of
estate plan so I would uh request your
favorable consideration this bill and I
will be glad to answer any
questions gentleman has a couple of
questions if you yield yes I'll yield
representative Reese represent Teddy
Reese has a question to your left thank
you Mr Speaker does the gentleman y yes
sir sir but isn't it true that in some
of my free time I write wills and
Healthcare narratives for seniors
through the Georgia Legal Services
Program and this would be a great tool
to help them and solve a lot of their
problems with trying to handle their
property upon their demise as we're fond
of saying this room the gentleman knows
of what he speaks and does the gentleman
further yield I'll yield yes sir my last
question sir for a question like that
I'll keep yielding yes
sir for my support on this bill can you
promise me I will not have to go back to
law school and learn how to write these
deeds and take the bar again yes I
promise you cuz we got the form set out
in the code for you yes sir thank you

have one further question after you
Legal Eagles completed your discussion
we're going to have some common sense
question from an A guy over here the
chairman of a representative dick is
recognized for our question thank you Mr
Speaker there gentleman y yes sir Mr
this is not an EG question but um if
there's a conflict uh with this uh
document and a wheel uh what has
president I'm sorry I didn't ask you
before but what takes president well the
the the the statute actually provides
that you can't revoke the conveyance by
a will and the will would take precedent
which It generally does if you if you
make a lifetime transfer of property
that you have left to someone in your
will the gift is considered a deemed
it's it just kind of lapses and goes
away the same effect here so you would
have you would have to execute another
deed or a change of of
designation thank you I hope some other
folks understood that but an
idea that was some of that legal legal
stuff right there I'm talking about the
answer to your question Mr chairman is

1100110 House Bill 1100 by
representative new the 64th and others
to be entitled an act to amend title 40
the official Cod to George annotator
relating to motor vehicles and traffic
so as to authorize the use of electronic
notifications and Communications by the
Department of Revenue to motor vehicle
owners relative to motor vehicle
registration this bill I refer to the
committee on motor vehicles that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee substitute I think the
lady knows a little bit about this
subject matter doesn't she she certainly
does representative kimly new is
recognized to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker colleagues I
appreciate the opportunity to talk to
you today about
hb110 this is an H agcy bill for the
Department of Revenue the motor vehicles
this bill does four things number one it
allows the Department of Revenue and the
Department of Driver Services to send
electronic notices or emails to
customers who choose to opt in to
receive notices customers like me
wishing to Pro to continue to receive
paper notices can still do that it is an
opt-in option only number two it
clarifies that all vehicles titled to a
government entity will have a plate
labeling it is a government
vehicle this does not apply to law
enforcement Vehicles this is for
transparency in tax dollars number three
it allows trailers to be included in the
definition of Fleet for vehicles that
can have the registration renewed in
bulk so the definition a fleet is that
you have a 100 Motor Vehicles or more so
this is uh would speed up the renewal
process
for those entities to renew their Fleet
and that is like uul Avis those are the
individuals the entities that would be
able to do so the fourth thing it does
is to provide statutory Authority for
the Department of Revenue to allow
electronic transfers of titles it's
setting the foundation for the future of
Georgia for E tiing other states are
already moving towards paperless title
and this would set us the the foundation
for the future for us to do the same
this this is what the bill does I would
ask for your favorable consideration if
there are no questions lady has a couple
of questions if you only yield I will
representative hugley to your left has a
question representative hugley thank you
Mr Speaker does the gentle lady yield I
will just a point of clarification so
you're saying all government vehicles
have to have a government tag if unless
they're law enforcement is that what
you're saying that is
correct well does the general lady
further yield I yield isn't it true that
some officials have taken the government
tag off for their safety and they're and
they've gone to just regular tags so
that they won't be identified or
harassed as they move around uh the city
or the state so that's that's a concern
that I would have is that not true so
this is for transparency and tax dollars
so taxpayers are paying for that vehicle
and so that way the the uh taxpayer will
know that that is a government vehicle
yes does the general lady further yet
one more time one more question yes
ma'am let me just bring it home for you
okay isn't it true that my husband is
the city manager of the city of Columbus
Georgia they took off his government tag
for his safety and gave him a regular
tag and you're saying that they're going
to have to go back and put the
government tag back on is that is that
the correct understanding that does
cover the scope of this bill but I will
say you probably do have a personal car
that he could probably
use lady yield for another
question can I yield the well sir you
may yes lady yield The Well the lady is
yielded the well is there any objection
to the previous question being ordered
chair has done the previous question is
ordered is there any objection to
adopting the committee substitute the
chair here's none the committee
substitute is adopted is any OB
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill chair he none the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the
machine
have all members
voted for what purpose does chairman
Mitchell
rise Mr Speaker isn't it true I wish
that the lady would have remained in the
well so that I could ask the
question isn't it further true that
judges clerks and others in the times
that we live
in would have to display their
government cars
Das uh there is a bill that is working
its way through the legislative process
now that would remove their ability to
list their personal property and and
some of us this if this bill were to
pass those judges Das and the like would
have to display their government
cars I'm sure the gentleman knows what
he speaks and evidently as you speak
there's another bill working its way so
hopefully we'll get to a good final
product product at the end of the day
all members voted Mr clerk will you lock
the machine
on the pass passage of House Bill 1100

957 House Bill 957 by representative pet
Tre of 166 and others to be entitled act
to amend article 3 of chapter 7 of title
52 the official Cod to Georgia and
relating to abandoned vessels show as
revised penalties for failing to remove
an abandoned vessel this bill have
referred to the Committee on Public
Safety and Homeland Security that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee
substitute representative Petri from
down on the coast is recognized to
present the bill chairman Petri thank
you Mr Speaker and I think we have a uh
visual aid here folks uh ladies and
gentlemen I bring you today House Bill
957 this bill was uh is brought to you
by myself and co-sponsored by my entire
Coastal delegation in this in this
caucus this bill deals with abandoned
and derel vessels so just let me uh tell
you a little bit about the problem uh we
have a multitude of abandoned vessels in
Georgia waterways today there are
currently according to
DNR 59 abandoned vessels you see some
examples here on the Georgia coast there
are 38 abandoned in vessels in Georgia
Lakes about half of these are sunken
some are uh some are above water some
aren't but as you can imagine they are a
real risk to Public Safety in terms of
navigating public waterways it cost the
department about 32 to
$42,000 to remove some of these as you
can imagine and that burden is now borne
by taxpayers and we don't really have a
line item for such removals in the first
place so to date what you need to know
is this to date the department has not
found a path to hold people accountable
for this my friends people are floating
vessels down here from other states and
floating them off into the sunset in my
district between sessions this year we
had a vessel from New Jersey that was
floating in the Skidway River the guy
floated it down here from New Jersey and
literally just walked away and left it
these are vessels that have no value
they're barely uh uh worthy of floating
any longer and rather than deal with
them appropriately they just float them
off into the high Marsh or in some cases
sink them in the channel this is a huge
problem for the Department what this
bill does very simply is once and for
all fix this problem this creates a
penalty it creates a criminal penalty of
a misdemeanor in a high and aggravated
nature first offense second offense a
felony and further it allows DNR some
other measures you'll see in here allows
them to revoke revoke vessel fishing
licenses and it allows the department of
revenue for an individual that does this
to revoke an automobile Li a driver's
license much as we do with uh some of
the other abandoned issues with uh cars
on highways so uh uh to my colleagues
here today this is a uh an issue of
great importance to us on the coast um
there is an exception you'll see in here
that came from the wisdom of
Representative Jaspers in the in a state
of emergency where you have a hurricane
there's an exception for that and uh Mr
Speaker I think that fairly explains the
conundrum and I'm glad to answer any
questions you have a coastal question if
you'll accept it yes sir Mr Speaker glad
to down the coast view chairman Saints
to your left thank you Mr Speaker does
the gentleman yield yes sir I yield is
it not true that this will allow some of
our friends in our Coastal delegation to
avoid sandb bars because they're not as
distracted by abandoned vessels I think
that's fair I think that's very fair
yeah one last question to representive
Franklin right out in front of you to
your right has a question thank you Mr
speaker thank you is it not true that
I'm a ship's Captain yeah is that's my
understanding and one of the very first
things I learned that our beautiful
coastlines are not a Dumping Ground that
that is right representative and indeed
people are using the Georgia coast today
and Georgia Lakes as a Dumping Ground
for this material thank you for the good
question thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the well I think that last B Captain's
that blue one up there in the top
leftand Corner maybe is this last boat
that's why you lost your license to be a
captain is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair here's none the previous question

the caption to House Bill 481 481 481
House Bill 481 by representative car
Carson of the 46th to be entitled an act
to amend article 7 of chapter 20 of
title 47 of the official code of Georgia
anotated the public Retirement Systems
investment Authority law so as to
provide for a fiduciary duty to invest
retirement assets this bill have
referred to the committee on retirement
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass by committee
substitute chairman of the committee on
retirement chairman Carson is recognized
to present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker and I know the
hour is getting late House Bill 41 all
this does is codify the uh fiduciary
duties and investment policies as set
forth by our Employee Retirement system
and the teacher retirement system these
uh fiduciary rules were adopted by their
respective investig committees in
September of 22 and adopted by the board
formally in October of 22 all it does is
mandates that fiduciaries execute their
duties solely in interest of plan
members and beneficiaries it ensures
that every decision they make regarding
retirement assets is made with the
well-being of those individuals in mind
it requires judiciaries to vote and
execute on all voting proxies in the
best interests of the investors it um
very simple just codifies the board
rules that are already been in place for
the past year and a half and it
represents a step forward and ensure the
integrity and security of our State
Retirement Systems and that all that's
all the bill does Mr
Speaker with that I will yield for a
question if there is one and if not I
will yield the well you have no
questions thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the well we do have a couple of members
that are opposed to the bill bill that
have requested time to
speak per the
rule from the rule rules committee we
have up they have up to 30 minutes we'll
recognize repes representative Sandra
Scott to speak to the bill
representative
Scott thank you Mr
Speaker today I stand before you to
voice my opposition to House Bill
481 a bill purply aimed at safeguarding
retirement Assets in Georgia while the
bill claims to prioritize the financial
interest of retirees it fails to
recognize the broader implications and
risk associated with the
provisions first and
foremost House Bill 481 seeks to ensure
retirement assets are managed solely in
the financial interest of participants
and
beneficiaries while this may sound
appealant on the surface it neglects the
reality that retirees have diverse needs
and interests that extend beyond
Financial
gains by focusing solely on financial
interest this bill could restrict
investment opportunities that may align
with retire
values and social
well-being furthermore the bill
impulsing stringent fiary duties
mandated fiduciaries to act prly and
diversify Investments to minimize risk
while prudence and diversification are
crucial the bill fails to acknowledge
the potential administrative burden
displaces on
fiduciaries the increas increased
bureaucratic herders could hinder timely
decisions making and limit the agility
needed to navigate Dynamic market
conditions
effectively additionally House Bill 481
prohibits sacrificing investment returns
for non financial interest such as
social or political agendas while
Financial returns are undoubtedly
important so too are the ethical and
societal implications of in investment
Decisions by prioritizing Financial
gains Above All Else the bill ignores
the potential for Investments to
contribute positively to societal
progress and environmental
sustainability moreover the bills allows
for the delegation of investment
management to qualify professionals
while expertise is valuable delegating
such responsibility introduce
complexities and accountability and
oversight there is a risk that fidu
fiduciaries may abdicate their
responsibilities without adade adequate
scrutiny potentially exposing retirees
to undo risk or conflict of interest in
conclusion House Bill 481 fails to
strike a balance between financial
prence and broader societal interest it
emphasized on Financial gains overlooks
the holistic well-being of retirees and
the community at large therefore I urge
you to cons reconsider this bill and
advocate for legislation that prioritize
the comprehensive needs and values of
Georgia retirees thank you Mr Speaker
and I yield the
well lady as yield of the well
representative Jasmine Clark is
recognized to speak to House Bill 481
one representative
Clark thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise
to express my concerns about House Bill
481 and to ask you to vote no on House
Bill
481 specifically at lines 39 through 40
this bill points out that Pension funds
or fiduciaries for pensions cannot um
and they cannot consider non-pecuniary
interests or Financial I had to look
that word up myself um but shall um and
these non-pecuniary interests include
things like social political or
ideological interests and so whenever
there is anything in a bill or law
there's usually a reason for it so I
asked myself why why were these words
specifically written into this bill why
would we specifically not want um
pension or fiduciaries for pensions to
consider these
things and I found some remarks from the
committee um the committee testimony on
this bill from a Libertarian lobbying
organization in which they accuse
activists and elected officials of
pressuring public pensions to invest or
divest from specific companies or
Industries so this is an overly
simplistic view that has the potential
of actually limiting options for
alternative Investments for Georgia
pensioners based on the assumption that
it is for reasons other than financial
reasons it is not Poss it is not it is
is is it not possible that divestment
from certain industries can be both a
good financial decision as well as good
social policy and if so who decides who
is going to decide what how these
fiduciaries are acting who gets to be
the final Arbiter on whether an
investment is non-pecuniary or not for
example many investment firms consider
environmental social and corporate
governance criteria also known as ESG as
a part of their decisions on investment
this do not mean it is the sole criteria
it is a part of the criteria that they
consider and if you take this into
account that does not necessarily
decrease the total number of potential
alternative Investments however the bill
that we are voting on today does have
the effect of taking certain alternative
Investments off the table lest an
investment company be accused of pushing
a quote woke
agenda additionally sometimes divestment
is the right thing to do do for example
in 2022 our government decide or our
governor decided to divest from Russian
firms after Russian's aggressive
invasion of Ukraine this bill would take
options like that for Georgia to stand
on its values it would take those
options away we could be en forced to
continue investments in firms and
countries committing acts that we do not
agree with why would we want to tie our
hands this
way lastly this is an essentially an
anti-climate change Solutions
Bill if you live anywhere in south
Georgia or places where you have been
affected by things like hurricane then
you know that climate change unaddressed
has the potential to cause devastating
effects on our economy increased
flooding severe storm STS drought can
cost communities lots and lots of money
so considering the impact of climate
change in our state's in retirement
portfolio is very much a financial
decision for our state we should be
doing the absolute most to make sure
that our alternative Investments are
going to give pensioners a good return
on investment when they retire labeling
certain Investments as quote woke or
assuming that certain Investments or
divestments are based solely on
political activism risk causing
pensioners to not get as much as they
could and even possibly lose
money I vote I urge you to vote no on
this legislation because we should not
be using this chamber and we should not
be using the law to decide who it who
gets to be uh who who we get to invest
in for um our pensioners and with that

the music world but he also made
significant contributions to race
relations born and raised in AUST
Georgia James Brown was deeply connected
to his hometown and used his platform to
advocate for equality and for Unity in
the time of racial strife and
segregation James Brown's music
transcended boundaries and brought
people together his iconic song Say It
Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud became an
Anthem for civil rights movement

their Heritage and stand up against
discrimination today remember James
Brown not only as a musical genius but

good thank you Augusta
delegation representative Lauren Daniels
is recognized for an afternoon
order thank you Mr Speaker um I would
also like to invite my Henry delegation
up here if possible um
and last week we lost a pillar in our
community
um some of you may know him as the owner
of Southern Bell
Farms Mr Carter was a man of many
accolades and he spent his entire life
and service in some form or another he
spent two decades on the Henry County
Board of Education
and I think it would be fair to say that
many kids including myself would not be
where we are today if it were not for
the service of Mr Carter and his efforts
to make Henry County public school
system one of the best in the
state he served in the military on the
Henry County water authority and
numerous other boards and was a deacon
in his church Mr Jimmy Carter had a
great passion for agriculture and he was
a farmer through and through he gave
himself fully to our community but most
importantly the way in which he loved
his family cannot be
overstated they say the measure of a man
is what he leaves behind and what Mr
Jimmy Carter leaves behind is a legacy
of service and a family who has followed
in his footsteps by their continued
service to our community please join me
in prayer today by lifting up his wife
Kathy and the rest of his family as well
as our community because he will be
dearly
missed
thank
you thank you
