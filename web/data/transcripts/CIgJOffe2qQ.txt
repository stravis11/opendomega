TRANSCRIPT
----------
Well, we have Governor Kemp available right now, so we're gonna talk more about this in a moment.
We are happy to welcome this show, the Georgia Governor, Brian Kemp.
Good evening, sir, and thanks for joining us for a few minutes.
Busy night.
Hey, great, great to be back with you. Happy signing day.
Thank you. I want to start with what you told or you plan to tell those in the
Chambers this evening. I guess you haven't talked to them yet.
No, we're fixing to go do that here in just a little bit when everybody gets back from
their dinner break and they're going to have a busy rest of the night but I'm looking
forward to getting in there and thanking the members of the General Assembly for a great
legislative session.
I mean we have had some really tough issues that we have worked on and debated but I think
it's been done in a really open transparent, fair way where everybody had their say and
that's the way it should be.
Obviously, from my perspective, we've had a great session.
They passed a great budget today,
and so I'm looking forward to the rest of the night
and also the rest of the year.
Okay, we've been talking about it here in the studio,
but one of your big priorities was to get torque-reformed
fast, you did that.
How are you feeling right now about that goal being accomplished?
When you were on the show last year,
you told us you were going for it, and you did.
Well, very, very excited to get that done as y'all.
We're just talking about very, very close vote,
tough debate, very tough issue.
People have been trying to get this done for,
you know, really the last five years,
you know, in modern times,
and really over the last 20 years,
there hasn't been a whole lot done.
So it's a tough issue to tackle.
But I think all the leaders in the General Assembly
felt like we had to do this.
I know from my perspective,
I felt like it was the one thing
that was really hurting our business environment here
and that other states were using this against us
because they have taken action on tour reform.
And so, you know, our main thing was to stabilize
the marketplace that was out there.
People cannot continue to live with, you know,
15 to 30% premium increases every year.
It's killing small business people,
killing working Georgians out there.
And so tour reform, you know, what we did,
I think will help stabilize the market.
And we're gonna continue to watch that,
you know, as we get out of session.
All right, so we've heard some people talking about this,
Is there a possibility you'll want to see insurance reform next year?
Well, now there's a lot of members of the General Assembly that were very concerned about some of the insurance companies
and, you know, wanted to take a look at that.
I kept asking people the whole session, hey, bring me something.
You know, if you want to legislate that, bring me to language.
I'm open to talking to all sides on these issues, to stabilize costs, but also to open up markets.
I mean, we got small business people out there, entrepreneurs and others that can't even
get insurance because of the way the market was here and the way the legal environment
was here.
So we wanted to bring some parity, transparency and fairness to that issue.
Now people want to look to the insurance companies.
I'm open to talking to them about how they want to do that, but my message to the insurance
companies is we did what we think was right.
I think they're very supportive of that.
And so now we're looking for them to get into this marketplace
and have more competition, which will help stabilize prices.
And so that's something certainly I'll be looking at
in the months ahead.
Okay, on another issue, given that the budget relies
heavily on federal funding, and we still don't know
where things are going to fall out when the state,
in the state when it comes to money,
you think there will be a need for a special session
to deal with the budget at all?
I think it's very, very, very premature to be talking about special sessions when we hadn't
even ended this one yet.
In regards to what's going on in the federal government, whether it's those other things
that the Congress is doing on ending COVID funding, I mean, look, they have to do those type
things.
We cannot continue to have the levels of spending in this country, especially things that
were related to COVID that quite honestly, when you look at the way the state of Georgia
his perform. I mean we haven't been you know relying on those things for over the
last two years. So you know I think they're making the right moves to make sure
that they worry and get down our debts and our deficits which will help bring
down interest rates and not burden our children and our grandchildren in the
future. And I can assure you that we have continued to budget conservatively
in our state even with this budget budget but we're also putting money back in
our taxpayers pockets with another billion-dollar tax refund that's going to send $500 to the average
family out there that's been paying taxes. We're low in our corporate tax rate. We're low in our
personal tax rate to continue to keep more money in Georgia's pockets so that they can fight
the high-cost environment that we've been over the last four years. And hopefully we're going to
see that continue to go down and have a better days ahead financially. So I'm very optimistic
about that, especially in the state of Georgia with the economic development, the jobs that
we're creating here, the amount of investment has been historic over the last three years,
so we're positioned as well as any state in the country to weather whatever goes on in
the U.S. or the world economy.
I know you said this evening isn't over yet, but I do want to know if you're already
looking toward next year at all, like you talked last year about tort reform for this year,
you think for next year?
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to,
I'm not looking forward yet to next year.
I'm looking forward to next year,
but look, we had a big agenda this year.
We had a lot to get done.
So we'll get this session done with tonight,
go into bill review and make sure that we're signing
or potentially vetoing bills that would be bad
for our citizens and then we'll start looking
on what we're gonna do next year.
but a lot different than we were in this position
this time last year talking about tour reform
and having to focus on it in the next legislative session.
Thankfully, we got that done along
with a lot of other good things
and we've asked out a great legislative session.
Well, I know that you are going to go talk to each chamber
and thank them for everything
and they'll be happy to hear from you.
But I want to thank you for coming to CS first.
I appreciate you talking with this governor.
Great to be back with you.
Have a good night.
Thank you.
Thank you, too.
