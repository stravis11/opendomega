Doorkeepers, please close the doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading, but I'll give you a little
prelude to our pastor today. So the pastor grew up in a little town in Middle
Georgia. He grew up with one of our members. That little town is called Micella
Georgia. The Dickey Boys from Micella Georgia's, Micella Georgia. So we're a
Forrest and and and out distinct was chairman Robert knew each other growing up and
They're rejoined here today
And so we're we're going to be I think it'll be a good homecoming for the two of you as y'all
Hear of what each other have been doing the last few years
Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the one hundred and thirty-second house district chairman Brian Prince chairman Prince
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I should have left Robert Dickey to introduce him, but they're a good deal.
Good morning.
It is good.
It is my honor to introduce my brother and my friend.
He's a graduate of the Fort Valley State University and a member of one of the greatest
fraternities in all the land, Calpa, Alpha Sa.
The Reverend Farge Dickey serves as a senior pastor of St. Paul's AME Church in Macon, Georgia.
He is married to the former Lydia Flower and they have three sons.
Colleagues, it has been said that those who require a long introduction probably don't
deserve one.
And those that deserve a long introduction probably don't require one.
Therefore, sit back and observe what happens when a child of God looks into the Word of
God and sees the Son of God and then shares the glory of God with the people of God.
God.
Hear ye, Him.
Good morning, everyone.
It is a wonderful day for us, amen, to be thankful that we are alive and to be amongst
the living and not amongst the dead.
For that we ought to be able to put our hands together and just thank God for an opportunity
to be alive.
I believe it meant to speak of burns and others, speaker prints, as well as a person that
I had an opportunity who was made an investment in his family and to my life growing up as
a young child in New Zealand, Georgia, and that is representative Robert Dickie.
God as I also realize the persons that are part of the districts that represent
the men, my part of the state of Georgia, brother James Beverly and sister
Miriam Paris. And we just thank God for their efforts as well. But as I bid
you greetings, amen this morning, I just say good morning to this beloved
assembly. And as we begin the challenges of our day to constitute the
values that form our great state. It is in prayer and with humility that I'll offer some powerful
words today that I believe will accommodate the conscience of decision that you will make today.
That's a profound statement attributed to the prophet Isaiah from scripture and it's attributed to
him as being the one who wrote it or had the idea but it was divinely inspired by God
God, as he declares a moment of redemption and reconciliation to a nation that was fragmented
from the very source of its stability.
Brothers and sisters, this declaration did not require a schematic of sorts, but it was
a God-given ability to do what's right.
And if done morally, ethically, and with integrity, we pray that the hearts of every constituent
represent or the substratum for everything we do in this mission of this special
session. From the scripture is Isaiah chapter 1 verse number 18 and listen as it
suggests that as a result of apparent differences amongst the nation, particularly
leaders, particularly leaders in this case, the dare should be a moment of what
is known as reasoning. The scripture says, come now and let us reason together say at
the Lord, though your sins are as scarlet, scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. As a faith leader and life coach, I believe
that reasoning with faith for the best possible outcomes is what makes every moment spent
in prayer or in legislation.
It makes it gratifying to the soul of every servant.
I declare your reasoning today,
assembly, that the mighty hand of God,
that it guides you with wisdom,
justice, and moderation.
Let us pray as we stand.
O our God, our helping age has passed.
our hope for years to come, our shelter from the stormy blast and our eternal home.
Lord bless every leader that's represented in this assembly today and cause their
hearts to overflow with love and joy for each other and the tasks at hand.
Lord you never said that life would be easy and with wisdom even the decisions can be
difficult. Teach us how to serve others better than ourselves. Let us trust each
other to see the good that we can do to better our state, our nation, and our
world. We can make a difference today that would make the great state of
Georgia the benchmark of how to get things done the right way for the
betterment of the societies in which we live. Bless them now with express grace
place to make the better world, the better place in general and Georgia in particular.
Give them divine providence over every thought, word, and deed.
God we declare in some of the great words a man of Martin Luther King, Jr. is that the
ultimate measure of a person is not where they are in times of comfort and convenience,
the measure you can measure them in times a man of stress and discomfort and difficulty.
So God, we thank you for this day and this session and we declare and believe it will
be one for the record books, one where people came together and made decisions that's for
the betterment of the entire state of Georgia in Jesus' name we pray.
Let us all say amen.
Amen.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
It's due to the flag of the United States of America.
And to the republic.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Some photos.
It's good job.
Pastor Dickey, thank you for those words.
I'm inspired.
I can assure you and I know you've inspired people all across the state thank you members
We're not going to unlock the doors just yet. We're not going a lot of doors just yet. We're
We're gonna take care of a little
Photographic business right here with Ben and then we're going to have a special treat
So if members will remain at your seats just for a moment,
we're going to do something special.
That was three handsome guys, what am I talking about?
So here's our posture right now.
Members please take your seats.
Let me give you a little introduction before you have the opportunity to view a really
neat video, pretty cool, that's impacted this historic place that we're so
honored to serve in. As you all know, you've been here over the course of this
past summer, there's a lot of work that went on here in the capital. And to
might as may sometimes, a lot of very difficult work that the contractors kept,
members who were here on taking care of issues, took care of the public. This
public building was never closed. Never closed. Our own Georgia building
authority moved forward with a capital painting project. I'm going to tell you a
little bit about it, but first I want to let you know it's an overall painting
project that was intended and has been a part of the overall preservation of this historic
building. It's almost as old as you are, but not quite. No, you can't. I want to introduce
some folks who were responsible for the work that took place here. They're up in the gallery
and when I call your name, I'll ask you to stand if you will.
The deputy director and chief of staff, Gerald Pilgrim.
We all know Gerald, Gerald Stan.
Hold your plows, hold your plows,
cause there's several of them.
He's the executive director,
but I'm gonna tell you this staff is awesome
and they all work very, very hard.
So I wanna acknowledge all of them at one time.
Gryffton Pasley, deputy executive director, Gryffin, thank you.
Danny Swan, director of maintenance and construction.
Danny, Jeff McDowell, Director of Maintenance and Construction, great work, guys, and
Daniel Powell, Director of Special Projects.
All right, now we can give these guys some applause because they work for us.
Some work, as many of these members have seen y'all's
persistence in working with these contractors to make
sure every detail was tended to.
Thank you so much.
You all went above and beyond.
We appreciate it.
Now, let me tell you our contractors work.
Cliff Harris, Cliff, you understand Cliff is a general
contract with Rayland construction, great job, great crew
you had here, and Kurt Dowling is with Denise Dowling and Associates.
They were the painting contractor, so Kurt, thank you, great work.
It looks great.
Thank you all.
Let's give them a hand.
Appreciate y'all coming in this morning as well, thank you.
I'm going to give you four or five bullets on the highlights of the project, then we're
going to view a quick time lapse video of the project.
This was pretty awesome, and this day in time, y'all.
This entire project was completed in just six months.
So this beautiful capital would be ready for the special session.
We did not know what's coming, but for the Christmas season, so it's so important,
And it is beautiful with the decorations of Christmas tree and the point setters.
Over 70,000 man hours involved, which is the equivalent to 800, 8,750 days.
Now y'all all saw this, and I knew it was awesome, but I didn't know how awesome.
Total scaffolding brought in weighed over 180,000 pounds that was standing up for the neighbor
the workmen to do their jobs. Rotunda scaffolding alone exceeded 160 feet and had 21 flights
of stairs. I'm sure all of you came in here and went up those stairs to get your exercise.
Now this was something that I think this project Gerald has to get it right and do it right
because maybe we'd not done it exactly right over the years but they removed over 20 layers
of paint from the walls and ceilings to get it back to where it should, where it looked
like it would be, or something we can be proud of, will have certainly be good for years
to come. 320,000 square feet of mesh installed. 40,500 gallons of plaster were used on the
project. 5,150 gallons of paint were also used.
That's a lot of paint.
That's a lot of paint strokes and a lot of spray on y'all, isn't it?
Safety was the focus of the project.
With no accidents, injuries reported from either employees, contractors are most importantly
the public as they continue to access this building.
And as I said, and I'm just confirmed by that bullet, more importantly, the capital
remain open during the entire project.
Ready?
Y'all take a look.
I'm amazed that the pains they took to protect this beautiful structure, marble and everything
is here doing this entire process was pretty awesome and took a lot of time.
You
You
Awesome job, that's six months and a lot
to work and a lot of inputs compressed into 120 seconds.
So thanks for putting that together,
together Gerald and you guys keeping that in place.
Thank you for your work, it looks great.
I think we can all agree with that.
It looks great and it will sustain itself
for many years to come as we bring our friends
and our visitors and our families
into this great beautiful capital of the state of Georgia.
So thank you again, we appreciate you guys.
So with that, doorkeepers, you may unlock
doors. If you would like to greet the chaplain, you can greet him in the
any room and when I would encourage you to do just that. We will move on with
the our business of the day. I want to introduce the doctor of the day, the
doctor of the day resides and represents the representative, Esther Pennick's
district, Dr. Deborah Martin. She will be pleased if you come down and visit with
her at the medical station on the second floor. If you don't need to visit her for medical
reasons, go by and say hi to her and thank her for being here for us.

And if we could all recognize him.
For the past several years, Deputy Consul General Fukunaga has been a dedicated and
thoughtful and committed diplomat and friend
to the state of Georgia on behalf of the nation of Japan.
And today, it was artisting to honor, to recognize him
as an honorary Georgia citizen.
He is departing Georgia soon to actually go to the embassy,
the Japanese embassy in Beijing, in China.
And I know that his skills with diplomacy and friend
Shoring will be very valued there in Japan on behalf of China.
And again, we are so happy to give him the honor of being an
honorary Georgia citizen, as special thanks to everything he has
done for this 50-year-long friendship between Georgia and
Japan.
Thank you.
I echo that, and thank you for your hard work.
I know over the last three years you've put in, we have
really strengthened our Georgia and Japan caucus.
And a lot of that goes to your hard work.
And we really appreciate that and look for continued success
and our relationship with Japan.
And thank you again for your hard work.
We really, really appreciate you and we'll miss you.

We'll start with Chairman Wiedauer.
He has some pretty awesome information he's going to bring to us.
So you're ready, Representative Weedauer, and Representative
Matthew Gamble has also recognized to join Representative Weed
auer for a really important announcement here.
Good morning, colleagues, am I ready?
You're ready.
All right, all right.
We all, I want to, one analogy I used down here a lot is I used
for George basketball, and I say all the time that it was great going on the court, but
it's always more fun bringing people on the court, right?
So I think about that when I think about the Georgia Civics program and the youth assembly
that happens a lot of times in this very chamber with middle school and high school students.
Matthew and I both have been very supportive of the program.
We try to get a little more exposure for them when we can, but this week, I also got
to introduce a Madam Speaker, Weed Hour, who my daughter became the next speaker, the
80th speaker of the House for the Georgia Youth Assembly.
But it's a great program if you guys want to know anything more about it.
Representative Gamble and myself would love to talk to you all about it.
But thank you.
Thank you.
She obviously gets her a skill set from her mother, there's no doubt about that.
Congratulations, Representative Weed Hour.
I know you're very, very proud of her.
And share with her if she can come and assist the speaker
any time she'd like to be more than glad to have her.
You're the same, we're a great, great program.
Representative Kennedy has recognized for
a afternoon morning order representative.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As you know, on November 19th,
We lost First Lady Rosalind Carter, but also on that same day,
we lost another important voice and influence
in the person of Bishop Carlton Pearson,
you see his image on the screen.
Yeah, Bishop Pearson found his home in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where he went to Oral Roberts University.
He started his church higher dimension,
which is one of the first mega black churches
in the country, thousands and thousands worship there.
Every week, he also launched the Azusa Conference,
which was a very high octane conference
in the 80s and 90s that highlighted
Pentecostal preaching and music.
It was also the launching pad for now several
national and international ministries
that found their launch at the Azusa Conference,
including TD Jakes, Joyce Meyer, Miles Monroe,
musicians like Donnie McClurklin, Gary Oliver, Carmen.
Bishop Pearson also had a strong footprint
in connection in Georgia.
There's several Atlanta Metro pastors
that consider him to be their spiritual father
and mentor, D.E. Park, Jim Swilly, David Alexander, John Scott.
I didn't have a personal relationship with Bishop Pearson,
but he strongly influenced my spiritual walk
with his teachings and his writings.
So his funeral is today and tomorrow in Tulsa.
Let's take a moment to honor him in this house.
Bishop Pearson, Rest in Power, Rest in Peace,
you change the world.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative.
My prayers go out to his family.
Representative Al Williams, he has some friends representing Frazier and representative
Higley are going to join representative weeps.
Now y'all listen up, this is something we should all pay attention to and I hope that
we will all participate in.
It's a great ceremony that he's responsible for and these ladies are responsible for making
sure occurs each year so listen up. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Before I proceed I certainly
won't extend my condolences to the Pearson family. I knew Bishop Pearson we share
the table for the trumpet awards in 2008. That blesses memory. We're here to
remind each of you that the annual E.C. Tillman Memorial Prayer
our complication.
We'll again this year be on the south,
in the south wing of the capital at two o'clock
on January the 7th.
Some of you are regular participants.
I wanted those of you that have not had the opportunity
to come yet to know that no, we don't take up a collection.
So you certainly can come.
We thank the speaker who will certainly be there this year,
and it's always special with this year.
We will certainly memorialize our former colleague,
Tish Nagisi, and this will be at two o'clock.
And so please come and enjoy this moment.
And the reason we don't pass a plate
is because these two representatives,
representative Hewgley and representative Frazier,
We finance it ourselves and we do take love offerings, but we, some of y'all know what
those are, but look, we look forward to seeing you.
It's a great day of celebration and fellowship, and it's the last time for the session starts
when no blood is let.
So you all can come and feel safe.
Bless you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Are you well?
I heard the rumor that you may sing this year, is that accurate?
I'm under contract. I can't sing in this. You meet my price.
Love offering. That's what you're talking about.
Y'all, I will encourage you to come. It's a great ceremony that's always
really meaningful on the message that's presented.
That completes our morning afternoon, afternoon morning orders.
Now we do have some announcements, we do have some announcements.
Representative Cameron, are you ready?
Representative Cameron has a special announcement as well.
And so we'll recognize Representative Cameron.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues.
I was asked to make this announcement this morning.
Please join the Governor, First Lady, and First Family

the Queen City, which is home of the honey
befest of every year.
So please join us Monday for this beautiful Christmas tree
from Walker County, Georgia.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Miss Speaker, I yield the well.
It's a beautiful treat.
Did you cut it down?
Yeah, I used to think that I saw it.
Come on now.
It is beautiful, thanks, and let your folks up there

Had two members I know of that joined yesterday, out on Mitchell Street, how many people

We will have another opportunity in the near future, so it's an important deal. I mean,
