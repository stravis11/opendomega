Yerter thank you Mr. Baker it's my pleasure to have Pastor Powell good hard from Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany Paul's been married to Breed Bell for almost 29 years and they have two daughters Shana and Kayley and they were not able to be with us today but Paul brought one of his members Chad Walgreens and Chad also serves on the the City Commission down in Albany and glad to have Chad with us today Pastor Powell received his BA from the University of Georgia his Masters of Inventory from southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary and his PhD from Adonai University he was the founding and lead pastor of Life Baptist Church in Las Vegas Nevada he's also published three books Paul has been the senior pastor at Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany since 2021 Sherwood is commonly known as a church it started the movies Sherwood movie for me they've produced movies facing the giants fireproof courageous war room and most recently the forest these are inspirational movies that people have seen all over the world Sherwood really does and Powell does a wonderful job manifesting to the harmony air and spreading the gospel to those folks Paul welcome to the people's house thank you representative Yerda for the introduction and also speaker burns for the invitation esteemed ladies and gentlemen and members of the Georgia House of Representatives it is an absolute honor to be with you all this afternoon I want to thank you all for not only what you do but for the people you serve and how you go about serving the people in the state of Georgia now in your role I am gathering there is not a lack of people offering their opinions and bringing complaints and many times making demands and as a Baptist pastor I can a hundred percent connect with that entire idea so anyway many times people do not understand the way to responsibility that you all are sheltering each and every day and the types of decisions that you're making that are going to impact thousands of people within your district as well as millions of people around the state of Georgia and I want to thank you for your willingness to serve the people in the state so as I was thinking about our time together I wanted there to be something that I could share that would have be a value to you to the role that you're in to the responsibilities that you carry as well as to the decisions that you make and very quickly the idea of the book of Proverbs came to mind the book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom and wisdom is more than knowledge wisdom is the right application of knowledge wisdom is what allows a person to live a skillful life that they do the right thing at the right time and in fact the very first four verses of Proverbs chapter one Solomon tells us the purpose behind the Proverbs and here's what those verses say these are the Proverbs of Solomon David's son King of Israel their purpose is to teach people wisdom and discipline to help them understand the insights of the lies their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives to help them do what is right just and fair these Proverbs will give insight to the simple knowledge and discernment to the young people for the person who is willing to study the Proverbs and to apply the teachings that they will find there are three different sets of benefits that Solomon describes to those who will study and apply these the Proverbs will teach wisdom and discipline that enables a person to live a structured and successful life everybody wants to be competent and effective and successful in what they do and Solomon is saying if you'll apply these that's exactly what will happen also the Proverbs help a person gain understanding so that they will do what is right and what is just and what is fair wisdom leads to right actions and just living and fair treatment and it really doesn't matter what person you're talking to what political party they're a part of what religious affiliation they might have or even personal world view they might have those are values that many of us hold in common and the Proverbs also will give insight knowledge and discernment to those who are young or inexperienced just a connection piece here I was 27 years old when I became a senior pastor and I'm not exactly sure who thought that was a great idea me for accepting the position of the church for offering the position but at that point in my life I thought I knew a pretty good amount about of a lot of things and over the course of the years I have realized how little I actually knew at that point in my life I needed insight and knowledge and discernment and here's the thing it doesn't matter how old we are right now our world has changed and so fast we are always walking into challenges that there has not been a forerunner going into we need wisdom and insight and discernment so 26 years ago I had a mentor come and challenge me

To read the proverb, the chapter in the Book of Proverbs, it corresponds with the day of the month. There's typically 31 days in the month, there's 31 chapters in the Book of Proverbs, and that was a challenge I took to heart 26 years ago. It takes about five minutes a day, but here's what I can tell you. Five minutes a day, you will find a little bit of wisdom will make a huge impact in your life. There are countless times that what I read in the Book of Proverbs that day helped me not make an unwise decision. There are days I didn't know what to do, and Proverbs 35 and 6 would remind me, trust in the Lord with all of your heart. Do not lean on your own understanding. See his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take. There are days I didn't think I needed anybody's help to make the decision I was about to make, and yet at the same time Proverbs 12, 15 challenged me, fools think their own way is right, but the wise listen to others. There are some days that people would say some really hurtful things, and I wanted to respond in light fashion back to them. And I read the Proverb of the day, and it says in Proverbs 12, 16, a fool is quick-tempered, but a wise person stays calm when insulted. A little wisdom goes a long way. When we seek God, seek His will, God has a way of getting the right word at the right time to help us make the right decision. Many times the question is not, can I do it? The question is, is it wise? I encourage you, take that Proverbs challenge every single day. Five minutes of time can pay off in a huge way. A little bit of wisdom goes a long way. If you would stand with me as we have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank You so much for this group, for who is represented, for the decisions that are being made, for the laws, the pieces that are being passed God. We ask You're blessing upon every part of it. May You give wisdom, discernment, and insight that will impact not only the families and individual districts, but also those throughout the state of Georgia. We thank You for what You will do in Jesus name. Amen. Thank You, Lord. If You would, as pledge allegiance. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Father. Thank You. That was awesome. Thank You. Members, we want to thank Brother Paul for that devotion. We, I will congratulate his house. You do listen a lot, and you exhibit great wisdom in decisions we make. So keep up the good work. Doorkeepers, you may open the doors. Members, you may join Brother Paul in our south any room. And thank you for His words today, and take a photo. Members, our doctor of the day today was invited to join us by representative Katie Dimpsy. And that is Dr. Gregory Harris.

As one is traveled a globe I can personally say that Georgia's rivers are one of our state's finest treasures and I encourage each and every one of you to take a minute and enjoy them. Our freedom of flow is big business in Georgia generating 1.1 billion in economic activity. Georgia streams and sports small businesses. Some 70,000 small businesses or 70 small businesses offer canoe kayak raft paddle board runners and hundreds of independent fishing guides depend on access for floating on the state 70,000 mile. Network of rivers and streams. Additionally there are three Georgia based manufacturers at manufacturer kayaks. Water based recreation means economic development in rural Georgia. Of Georgia's 159 counties 96% are home to streams that are capable of floating recreational vessels like canoes and kayaks. For instance in Gilmer County the whitewater stretches of the cardicay river are part of a 14.9 million a year local amusement industry that creates 263 local jobs and provides 2.9 million in income. So again welcome the boaters. Leader of the station is recognized for an order. Thank you miss speaker. I'm very excited to recognize House Resolution 430 recognizing the Poonjob language.

Bill 55 by Senator Hickman and the fourth and others to be titled back to a man title 34 of the Fisher go to Georgia and attend early in the labor and industrial relations. So it's to face out the payment of some minimum wage to persons with disabilities. This bill I've referred to the committee on industry and labor that committee recommends a dis bill do pass. Chair Lady Cooper has recognized to present Senate Bill 55. Chair Lady. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen this is a bill that we passed out of this chamber last year with a unanimous vote and I am very honored to bring it back even though it came from the Senate sides. In the 1930s the federal government came up with a program to help disable people intellectually and developmentally find jobs. It was meant to help them go out into their communities but unfortunately some people didn't found out that they could use them in almost like slave workshops paying them far less and as little as 22 cents an hour. Yes I said 22 cents an hour. We have eight of those programs out of 60 or so still functioning in the state of Georgia. This bill would do away with those programs and or have them adapt. They have two years with federal assistance helping them go from what they're paying now which most is about the lowest I think it's two dollars an hour and help them get up to the federal minimum wage of 750. That's what the program does. It's about dignity and fairness and making sure that people with disabilities are paid at least what we consider the bare minimum wage for all other workers. Mr. Speaker if there's no questions I will yield the well and ask for this chamber's federal vote once again. The lady has a couple of questions to fuel yield. I'll take a couple sir. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you so much for the bill does the lady you? Yes I will. So I appreciate what this bill is doing and I would love to support it and I do plan to support it but one of the concerns is a lot of individuals with disabilities are also on SSI and SSI has very strict rules about how much income you can have otherwise you would lose it. Does is there any concern that this might make someone who gets SSI all of a sudden ineligible?

Thank you for that question. No, there is no concern because this chamber and the other one and with the Senator of the governor has safeguards mainly our state's Able accounts which allows these people to make and save money without losing these benefits. So those benefits of Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are safe. Lady, you have one more question. Yes, sir. Rifts of DeHolly to your left. George Beck. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it generally yield? I will. Thank you. Is it not true that this bill not only do we pass it out last time, but the good news is that so many in the disability community know that by allowing them to take part in an integrated employment environment, we'll actually be respecting them and allow for them to finally be able to work a job to earn what most of us have in our first jobs. Is it not true? It is true. And I will tell you that this group of workers are often the very best you will ever get. They come through rain or snow to the office to work. They work long hours and they work to their very best ability and we should all be proud of the individuals in these programs. With that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. Thank you. The ladies, you to the well. Thanks to you and Senator Hickman, a good bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee has agreed to shall. This bill now passed. All in favor, the passage of the bill. Will vote yes. All those opposed. Will vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 5555, the yeas are 163, the nays are two. This bill having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 8888. Senate bill 88 by Senator Beardon, the 30th and others of the Meantile of NAC to amend code section 1562. The fiscal to George Annancer, the number of judges has superior courts. So it's a revive for fourth judge and the spirit courts is the Douglas Judicial Circuit. This bill I'm referring to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. A representative Kimberly Neu is recognized to present the bill, representative Neu. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. It's my honor to speak to you today about House Senate bill 88. This bill will add a fourth superior court judge for the Douglas Judicial Circuit. It also allows them to stagger the term and allows for an election in 2026. This legislation was requested on behalf of Chief Judge, the Chief Judge of Douglas County because Douglas County has not added a superior court judge since 1998. Since then, the growth of our county has doubled. The Judicial Council of Georgia based on the workload analysis recognizes that Douglas County is currently the second highest judicial circuit in terms of workload assessment. Our three judges are doing the work of 4.5 judges and have been for the past several years. We are in the budget for 2026 and this bill passed the House unanimously. Last year, it was HB884 and didn't quite make it over the finish line in the Senate. So Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and I'll take any questions. Lady has no questions. Thank you and I ask for your favourable consideration for SB 88. I yield the well. Ladies, you are the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to. This bill now passed all in favour of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those votes will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members vote of this so, Mr. Clerk will you lock the machine? All in the past, just Senate bill 88, the yeas are 171, the nays are zero. This bill here in the seat of requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of the House to Senate bill, Senate bill 145, 145. Senate bill 145 by Senator Burns, 23rd to be entitled to amend code section 1562. The fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the number of judges spirit court so is to provide for a six judge the spirit court to the August judicial circuit. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair, the newtons recognize to present Senate bill 145. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I did come for you with SB 145. It has to do with another judgeship which is adding a sixth Superior Court judge to the Augusta Judicial Circuit. That would be Augusta Richmond County and then Burke County as well. This legislation was requested on behalf of Chief Judge Glanville of Richmond County. The Judicial Council of Georgia based on that workload analysis we discussed a moment ago is the third highest in demand for an additional judge. We are in the 2026 budget for both the governor and the House for a six judge. I hope you'll join me in voting in favor of making this needed assessment for law enforcement and judicial needs. Glad to answer any questions, Speaker. The gentleman has no questions. Thank you. I appreciate it. I yield the will. The gentleman is yielded the will. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shout out this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk. Will you lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 145. The yeas are 172. The nays are zero. This bill hadn't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate bill number six six. Senate bill six. By Senator Patrick, a 30 second and others to be titled an act to amend code section 263, 22 of the EFISCO to Georgia and TATA relayed no other laws unaffected by the Georgia drug and cosmetic act. So it's authorized use of testing equipment to determine whether or not a controlled substance has been adulterated. This bill, I'm for the committee on health. I committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Sharon Cooper is recognized to present the bill. The ladies recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring you Senate bill six. As you know, we have an opioid problem in this state and this bill will give us another tool, our different tools to help fight against drug overdoses. As you might know, there are strips that peel can buy their fentanyl strips and if you test a drug that you're going to take and it has fentanyl in it, these strips will tell you that so that perhaps you won't take that drug and end up dying from it. Well, there are all sorts of other drugs that are just as lethal as the fentanyl that are being used to dilute the opioids in these illegal drugs and these strips are coming on the market and this bill would allow them to be sold to the public. The other thing it would do, it says that if someone has these strips on them, they're not considered drug paraphernalia and the person would not be charged with the becarrying drugs illegal drugs with them. So that is what the bill does and I would ask for your favor. We'll vote for this. As I said, anything we can to prevent deaths as long as somebody is alive, we have a chance of helping them overcome an addiction. When they're dead, there is no hope. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Ladies, you're the well. She had no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill hearing none the report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine. All the passage of Senate Bill 6, the yeas or 170 nays or zero, this bill here and you see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 276-276. Senate Bill 276 by Senator Eccles, 49th and others to be titled act to amend code section 49 for 148. The fish go to Georgia and in Tateau relating to recovery of medical assistance for third party liable for sickness, injury, disease or disability. This bill I refer to the committee on insurance that committee recommends a disbile do pass. Representative Gamble is recognized to present the bill and the gentleman is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate Bill 276 brings Georgia into compliance with federal requirements. The U.S. Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 requires states to have laws in effect that bar liable third party payers from refusing payment to Medicaid for a service based solely on the fact that prior authorization was not issued first. This is a bill that is being brought to us from the agency. DCH has requested this in order to be in compliance with federal law. As you know, Medicaid is the payer of last resort and only pays for covered services if there are no other liable third party payers. This could be a commercial insurance plan, a lawsuit settlement or workers compensation settlement. This bill will ensure that those primary payment sources cannot unreasonably deny payment to Medicaid for services for which they are responsible. This bill will uphold the integrity of the Medicaid program and increase the revenue to the program as payment by primary sources are unable to be denied based on a requirement for prior authorization. That in effect is what the bill does and I'm happy to answer any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration. I yield the well. General, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to. This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of Senate bill 276, the yeas are 168, the nays are two. This bill, having seen the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 109-109 by Senator Harborson of the 15th to be entitled to amend Chapter 25 and Title 33, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to life insurance so as to prohibit a policy of group life insurance from excluding or restricting liability for certain deaths occurring while an individual's on active duty. This bill now referred to the committee on insurance that committee recommends it dispelled due pass. Chairman Eddie Lumpston has recognized to present the bill. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I bring to you Senate bill 109. This is the same as House bill 182 that was passed unanimously by this body on February 24th. This is a Department of Insurance Bill that deals with group life insurance as it pertains to members of our armed forces. Every life insurance policy contains exclusions. An exclusion is a defined cause of death that is not covered by the terms of the policy and is clearly stated in the language of the policy. In most policies, the term active war is most often used to define this exclusion. However, in a group life policy, the term active duty is used. Now, a person can be on active duty and not be in a war zone. In fact, only about 5% of our military actually see combat. So the purpose of, in the language of this bill is to make it clear that simply being on active duty in and of itself is not a valid reason to deny claim. Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'll stand for any questions. General, has a couple of questions to your left. Representative Heffner has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. General, you. I do. Sir, does this policy offer both the potential that would not allow it to deny military personnel or to address gaps in coverage for military personnel who may be traveling in uniform in an off-duty status like in the airport that they are not performing a function of in a war combat zone. They are actually on leave traveling home. The term active duty can apply to whether you're actually engaged in some function of your job or whether you're off duty. The term active duty is a broad umbrella that applies in a lot of ways. And with an insurance policy, the exclusions that I'm referring to, particularly in this sense, active war is generally the one that we're talking about as being the issue that is of concern because you can be in an accident while being on active duty. And this stem from a situation where a person was on active duty, but was involved in an automobile accident in his hometown. So this makes it clear that just simply being on active duty is not a basis for denying a claim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for such a clear explanation. Thank you for the bill, sir. You're welcome. Representative Rees, to your left in the back. Recognize he's standing to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman you? I you. Sir, I want to thank you for carrying this bill for my colleague of the Columbus delegation, Senator Harvison, who worked with a young man in our community who indeed this did happen to the insurance company, the not his claim, under the military exemption, but he was nowhere near military duty at the time. So isn't it true that our insurance commission of work was Senator Harvison and others to craft this legislation so that we can protect our men and women in uniform that are operating on their personal business, but are being denied by insurance companies just because of their service to America. Gentlemen, knows I've what he speaks. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, has no further questions. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield well. I would appreciate your favorable consideration. Gentlemen, as you do the will, we do have a speaker to speak in favor. Leader Heagley is recognized. The speak to the bill. Members, give the lady in the well, your attention, please. Ladies, recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I come to speak the name of the young man who died and who this bill should be named for Sergeant Brandon Frazier. His father came by my office yesterday and his father was to thank us for moving this bill forward because his son was involved in an accident as he was home visiting the family. He was home. He's in the military, but he was home visiting the family at the time. And so Mr. Frazier wants us to remember his son's name, Sergeant Brandon Frazier. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone's favorable consideration and I yield well. Ladies and gentlemen, the lady has yielded the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor for the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no, Mr. Clerk. Will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted this, so Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate bill 109, the yeas are 172, the nays are zero. This bill has received a record. Cost of majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate bill 3535? Senate bill 35 by Senator Walker, the 20th and others to be entitled to amend code section 33, 24, 46, with the official code of Georgia annotated, relating to cancellation or non-renewal of certain property insurance policies. So if you increase the number of days of notice required to be given a policy of older, this bill evidence for the committee on insurance, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. We're going to straighten this ensure our stuff out here. I can tell, we're actually gamble to recognize to present Senate bill 35. Would you like to give the gentleman your attention, please? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senate bill 35 simply is a consumer friendly bill in the insurance space, dealing with property and casualty insurance. Right now, you have 30 days upon cancellation or non-renewal of your property and casualty policy or your homeowner's policy that you have to be notified. And all this does is give you additional time. So if you're insured, you're going to have a little bit more time to decide for whatever reason to cancel your policy. Now, rather than having the 30 days, you'll have 60 days. Part of the rationale for doing this, as you all know, the United States Postal Service has been a little bit slower in delivering mail. And so this will provide additional time for you to find coverage beyond the existing policy that you might have. So that's all this bill does is go from 30 days to 60 days and I'm happy to answer any questions. I'm going to ask you a job. You don't have any questions. I ask for your favorable consideration and I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you for the bill. Is there any objection? The gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Hearing none, the report of the committee has agreed to shout this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted this so. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the passage of Senate bill 35, the yeas are 168. The nays are zero. This bill has received the requisite constitutional majority as therefore passed. Members, that completes our rules, Calvary. Members, that completes our rules, Calvary. We're going to move on to afternoon orders. Members, if you'll join me in standing, the representative has a remembrance today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this past Sunday marked four years since the violent spot shootings, the Atlanta spot shootings, in which across three businesses, eight people were killed, six of them, AAPI women. And so if we can just take a moment of silence to remember those victims. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Trayan. The representative has a hand in the poll, the delegation. Chairman Dullet. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Give the gentleman a moment. Ladies and gentlemen, we had some severe weather in our state. So representatives are here to talk about and representative Anta Hanson will tell us about what happened in their community. So give him your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Late Saturday night and into early Sunday morning, Pauline County had a tremendous weather event. It was an EF-1 tornado that struck and touched down right in the heart of House District 17. About a quarter mile from my house. Y'all were blessed. There was no major injuries. There were no fatalities. And so we feel like the Lord was with us that night for sure. Wind speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. And it actually tracked the path of Mr. Speaker. I'm not sure how it did this between me and Representative Dullet's house. So y'all take what you will from that. But I wanted to thank the members who reached out to the members of our delegation who checked in on us. Offered their generators and their support. I know that some members of our community are still without power as many of y'all in South Georgia have felt so recently. And we're still trying to work on communication wires and all that. But I did want to thank the Pauline EMA and GEMA, first responders, DOT, former member of this house is now a DOT member who worked those roads with me almost every day. Y'all can see some of the damage that's up here on the board. It was tremendous.

Grace Stone and all the other EMCs that came in, they rushed the entire district to help us. Thank you so much. And thank you Mr. Speaker for the opportunity to say that. I don't know if these members would like to say that. I know it affected Rich and Gullah. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Jim, we're here with you. Thank you members. We're certainly sorry that it impacted your community, but we're blessed, no deaths, no serious injuries. So that's the blessing. But I want to thank you in your delegation and the members of this house. Anytime there's, there's weather troubles around our state, this house is always responded to the fellow members, 10 care of neighbors. Thank you for that. And I know that our Reptile Matahand has been a champion for helping folks all over the state, especially in South Georgia. So thank you for being so helpful to others.
