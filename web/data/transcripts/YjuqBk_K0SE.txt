meeting to order, please.
Senate Health and Human Services meeting.
A few in mind opens up in our prayers, Senator Hodges.
Please, your own mic number two, number three.
Pray with me, please.
I do have any further.
Thank you for the many blessings you've bestowed upon us,
especially the opportunity to be here today in this beautiful state and to attend
to the affairs of this lady in the Senate. I'll lead us in God, it's an all we do.
And we ask these things in Christ's name. Amen.
The volume was sort of low there, sorry about that, but thank you for your
prayer. Senator Hodges, we have two bills today. We have a Senate Bill 340,
38 in House Bill 181.
We're gonna go with the Senate this time,
first time that we've heard this bill,
but it's pretty straightforward.
Senator Williams, the floor's yours.
Hold on just a second, we got your mic going.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is probably gonna be the simplest bill.
You will see this year.
this session. Second page, line 37. We're changing the number 180 to 60. What this is is
a bill that refers to pronouncement of death and it changes the time limit. If someone
has been seen by their personal care physician, it has set up to 180 days but we're changing
that to 60 days. And this a lot can happen in a just a short amount of time. And a lot
of times your personal care physician would not be aware of health changes. It might occur
within just a short amount of time. So that's what this bill does. Big glad to answer any
questions.
If I could just give a little bit of background, Senator Williams and a few others, Senator
Kirkpatrick and a lot of stakeholders have been working on the death certificate and
the challenge many times that families have getting the death certificate.
And the reason that Senator Williams has certainly explained well in those meetings is that
the death certificate allows not only a finality in the diagnosis and so forth that you get
with that, but it allows them to do practical things like whether it's closing bank accounts
or closing, turning the cable off or Wi-Fi, whatever it is that they may be subscribed
to.
Many times it requires a death certificate to prove that.
You can probably elaborate that on more than I, but suffice it to say that it has been
challenge and we felt that this was part of the way to improve the ability to get the
desk to even get it done on a timely fashion.
Can you help us out, help us out there a little bit more?
Yes, so that explains it very well.
We've had about 10 or 12 meetings regarding desk certificates and you and Senator Kirkpatrick
both have been there and we've trying to narrow down the issues faced with families on the
obstacles of getting death certificates. A lot of times on an unattended death occurs out
of a hospital. A lot of times you don't have an issue such as a corner. But in the metro areas,
you have the medical examiner systems and this where the confusion seems to come that if someone
one has been seen by their personal care physician within the last six months, then they feel
like they should not sign the death certificate that they should have seen them within 60 days.
That may be on YouTube later today, so I got that.
That was a good move.
That was good.
I like that.
All right.
Five.
Got you.
Thank you.
I'd appreciate your favourable consideration, big glad answer.
We'll answer questions.
Thank you.
Senator Cessler has the first one.
Senator, thanks for this.
Just forgive me.
I'm just trying to get up to speed on the thinking behind this.
Because the thinking behind there being a number in this, and the term deemed to have
died unattended by a physician, I mean if I was seeing a doctor regularly, I'd been
in the doctor's office two days prior, there was a serious condition, obviously that gives
you the sense that you're being attended.
If I'd seen my doctor 50 days earlier, how does that change my circumstance, if I'd
die in bed, for example?
Well, what's the legal, I guess, the second part of the question is, what's the legal
effect of that versus, if I had seen my doctor, it was pretty much earlier?
Right now you have some medical examiners, the corners, that are holding to this 190 days.
So there's an argument between the personal care physician who's saying, I've not seen
this patient in five months.
I don't know what's been going on with this person.
Their health could have changed, they could have had the woulda maker, they could have had
a mild cardinal infarction and been immediately pronounced dead.
So just basically this is narrowing the scope and it's a starting point.
As one physician person made a comment, you know, I can see someone today in my office,
They may drop dead tomorrow without any warning and that still doesn't because I saw them
yesterday doesn't mean I know what killed them.
Now the other hand would be if someone is undergoing palliative care or they're in hospice
and they've been treated for some terminal illness, pretty much know what the prognosis
diagnosis is going to be.
For example, if they had under this bill, in 60 days is the new threshold to understand
that can accelerate things.
So if 35 days before someone dies, they had a full physical with their family physician,
for example.
Then the family physician would have an ability to just under the current law, has an
ability to speak into what the cause of death was as opposed to the coroner or medical
examiner.
Is that the way to lower?
Yeah, it's kind of that way.
What it's doing is telling the medical examiner that if this person has seen their personal
care physician within the last 60 days, then they need to consult with them.
They need to be consultation to figure out the cause of death.
But there again, what the misconception, a lot of times, is people think a death certificate
It's a legal document, it's not, it's just a scientific document, it's not a legal document.
But what it does do is give someone finality that they can proceed with filing life insurance,
closing bank accounts, setting up an estate, even the simple thing is cutting off a cell phone.
I understand the benefits, I'm just trying to understand just for myself and members of
committee the difference is if it's after 60 days in the medical examiner
pretty much has no option they've got to deal with it. They deal with
themselves if it's been within 60 days medical examiner in the position
talk they kind of come to a conclusion it's a two sort of a two-person
conclusion as opposed to medical examiner by themselves. I brought them
here. Right. Any other questions from the committee or discussion?
All right well I guess we're ready for that. It sounds good. Senator Lucas for do pass and second by
Senator Setsler and any further discussion all those in favor. Let's raise our hand. Okay I
think that's unanimous there. All right thank you. Thanks Senator Williams and I don't need to
to ask you who's carrying it because you're a senator,
you'll be carrying it on the floor, so okay.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, thank you, Senator Ways.
And again, I want to shout out, give them a shout out
that we've been working on this issue.
And I think this is one of those,
a piece of the puzzle that's going to help
with timely death certificates.
I think this is going to help.
Yes, sir.
I think so, Tony, I thank you again for your assistance.
Certainly, thank you.
already. So we are, we now have House Bill 181 by Senator Townsson and we had, we heard
this bill last year and it went to, we passed it and it went to rules and did not make it
to the floor so this bill has already passed the House and is over for here for us to reconsider
it.
So I hope that we don't need to go through the full discussion and testimony relating
to that.
What I plan to do is have Senator Chounson present the bill and if he has someone he wants
to testify and then I think one other person wants to testify and maybe has an amendment.
So we're going to let the will of the committee rule here and we're going to discuss this if
we need to and vote on it if we get to that and Senator Townsend, the floor is yours.
And you're welcome to sit here or go up there, whatever you'd like to do.
Okay.
You're full of that microphone close to you and I think that would do.
Is that better up there if that's you know if the the leaders want you up there has better so we're I'm good with that the other thing
I want you to point out we did have a change
the
The summary of the bill which was in your folder just had a change in the date
we we we quickly made an adjustment and made the
and passed out everybody.
So if you see, that's why we did the new summary.
And it says this bill becomes effective on July 1, 2024,
if it's passed.
Now the bill itself, the summary,
the bill itself had the correct date.
We just had the incorrect date on the summary,
but we're all kosher now.
Okay.
Thank you, Senator Watson.
It's a privilege to be here again.
Again, thank you for the last year.
Pass it in.
And thank you, the rules, Senator Brass,
you guys passed it last year and just fell short on sunny die.
But when I'm back and appreciate being for this committee,
basically as you remember, I'll keep it short, I know.
But this is a constituent base bill down in Glen County.
I live down on the coast.
We had two people affected by cratum.
One eventually ODed on it and committed and died.
The second one became psychotic,
one up in mental health institution.
And so those two are constituents.
And once I saw the bill, I'm a former educator.
So I didn't know much about it until I started doing the research.
Then I saw some credible sources like Mayo, Cleveland Clinic and others who went out and spoke
against it and had some real concerns about the safety of it.
And the more we dived into it in the house, as you remember, we had 11 to 12 hours of hearings
on it.
Was that freshman didn't realize there's going to be a long hearing like that, but over I think five different committee meetings we got out of the committee made some good compromises talk with the both sides, the American
Credit Association and everybody else involved and made some where it's more of a regulation tight bill now instead of total banning it original intent was to ban it and then we started regulated and you will see the regulations in there that we all agreed to it one time.
last year and then we also decided to put some penalties on the manufacturers because there's some there's a law now
But it's no teeth into it. There's a you can't really enforce it so the manufacturers can do that what they want
We want to make sure Jordan's put something in their body and they know what they're getting to the highlight main thing is proper labeling and
Proper dosage that's that's the main part of the bill put it behind the counter make sure 21
story I stopped on the way home on the coast you know you get I-16 you have to
drink your diet coke at M&M's and just to stay awake in I-16. Stopped at
Shell Station and there was Reese's Cups, Skittles, and Cratham Cupcakes.
Cratham Cupcakes at the counter. Now I'm not saying the store attendant would have
sold the kid or whoever wanted the Cratham but it was right there for the
taken and so it's like that's not good. So things that we've got in this bill
now will take care of that and I appreciate everybody agreeing to that and
there's some that's what the bill is. We went to multiple negotiations last year
we went in front of the Ledge Council agreed on everything and so I'm
positive about the bill constituent based as you know you guys are senators and
you'll do anything for people back home if it's a problem so that's what we're
doing and supporting our community back home.
So that's the main part of the bill.
I was approached this morning about trying something else.
Personally, I like this bill.
Hope we keep it the same way.
But I'm at the will of the committee.
And I appreciate what you guys do.
And I respect y'all very much, and I'll answer any questions.
I know I do have one constituent here, not constituent,
but she's a Georgian, she, her husband was affected by
credit, and she'd like to talk if she could.
And then Jeff Breedlove, and one of our recovery experts,
if you have time, he'd like to speak as well for sure.
But that's up to the Will committee,
and we'll go from there.
But any questions for me, I'll be glad to answer anything at all.
I have a question, but I can wait for that.
OK, we'll do that.
We'll sort of hold questions and start back.
It's probably the thing to do.
OK, yes.
That'd be great.
If you wouldn't mind, go ahead and introduce yourself up at the podium, please, and thank
you for being here.
Can you see me?
Good, afternoon.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Senate.
Thank you so much for being here today, and thank you for passing the first bill.
This is my former husband that passed away October 22nd, 2020, actually three years and
three months ago today.
And I got a call on October 22nd and it was his work calling and they said Bill collapsed,
it worked.
And he told me he was taking a product that he had found that it was working, that he
felt like it was helping him sleep, it was great.
was under the false pretense now that it was to a health
under the health product, that it was natural.
And so he took that and he took a drink of a energy drink.
So what cratum doesn't talk about the regulations,
they don't actually tell you what you can and cannot
take with cratum. They don't say you can't take an energy drink with cratum because it
has too much caffeine in it. They don't tell you that you can't take cratum with tea
because it will kill you. They don't tell you that it's lethal when you mix a monster
drink with it and cratum at the same time. They don't tell you that. And that's the problem
that we have is nobody knows.
Everybody's a guinea pig right now that's on cratum.
They're guinea pig because they don't know.
They could actually, I don't know if you guys heard,
but the panera bread, the whole thing about the panera bread,
these two young teenagers were killed
because of the caffeine and the lemonade.
So if we don't know what's in that lemonade,
how are we gonna tell about cratum?
So I'm just trying to show you that.
So I got the call and I said,
please put me on FaceTime.
So I literally watched and my girlfriend worked for NBC
and she got behind me.
I said, I need you to video this FaceTime
as the paramedics worked on my former husband
while he was passing away from cratum.
And when I tell you that had I not had my friends there,
I don't know what I would have done
And they took him away, though I watched the whole thing,
I begged for his life.
It's all on video.
And it was probably one of the worst moments of my life,
begging for his life, knowing what was going on.
And at the time, I was trying to find jets to take me up
to North Carolina where he was.
I was trying to find all these things.
And I was trying to get a hold of my daughter
so that she could talk to her dad for the last time,
not knowing what was going on.
And out of frustration, again, not knowing what was going on,
I got a call.
They said that he had a stroke-like activity.
And then he had a seizure-like activity, stroke.
And then when the nurse called me, she said,
I'm sorry, we lost him to cardiac arrest on the table.
And I don't know about anybody in this room,
but if you ever had to tell your child
that their dad or mom is never coming home,
no, if you have, it's awful.
And I had to do that.
And what she said when I got home, how's dad?
How is he?
I said, baby, he didn't make it.
He didn't make it.
So I'm asking you today to make sure that no one else, no child, can be looked at
at freedom.
And by the way, there's a new freedom out called train wreck.
If that doesn't speak volumes to anybody in this room, train wreck, okay, I hope that
it resonates with you all.
Um, anyway, um,
let me share a appreciate that.
Do you mind, uh, uh, uh,
sharing us with your last
statement where you're from?
Um, Peter Goughner,
and I'm originally from here in Atlanta.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you.
Uh, I appreciate your, uh, testimony.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Um, uh, yes, uh, I'm sorry.
You have a question, uh,
chairman Huff's set.
There is on.
Yes.
Thank you.
And just a question that the cradle
that your husband took.
Was that a synthetically altered?
Was it have a certain brand name or?
I cannot speak about the brand name right now.
But it was, I can tell you that it was the night before he
passed away.
He switched from a capsule, some capsules
to a powder form.
OK.
Any other questions?
Thank you.
I'm sorry we're doing.
Thank you for being here today.
Thank you so much.
You know, in the last, gosh, the last two and a half years, I know you've put some
Doug into this and understood this.
In your research, what have you found about the commonality of the frequency about someone
taking powder-based cratum or powder form, and then an energy drink and having a cardiac
Is this something, is this, is this, would you represent this as kind of a one-off unusual circumstance in the literature and the data?
Is this happening other places and share what you found with us if you could?
So I've been doing a lot of research.
Um, late nights, early mornings, and I found that that is basically the order it goes in.
If somebody takes, like, for instance, there was a young man, I think it was Pennsylvania.
He was drinking tea, he put it in his tea.
And the next 20 minutes later, he was on the ground,
having like seizure-like activity.
So it kind of goes in that order seizure stroke cardiac arrest.
But in the end, it's cardiac arrest.
So to answer your question, it is kind of,
it's those characteristics of the seizure-like activity.
The end.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You have a phone call.
Oh, I didn't know if you needed me to stop.
No, I had a follow-up question.
I just was communicating with the chair.
Oh, no.
So anyway, that's what I've read, and that's
what I've discovered in my research.
And that is my opinion from my research.
So the concern is that there's a,
whereas you might have some data that suggests
This freedom is not serious, or I'm sure we're in here, someone say that it's a low
level effect, no danger, perhaps we would hear that by itself.
Your concern is when it's taken with other customary daily products, not some odd thing,
but something as simple as an energy drink or tea, you're saying it's the coming together
of those things that makes it particularly dangerous in ways that public doesn't understand.
I am saying that as well as saying that
freedom is dangerous one by itself.
If there's been studies done that say that
you can't even make it with freedom at all.
So, freedom by itself is lethal.
And if you just Google freedom,
you'll find that as well, sir.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
You should.
So, we have three people that have signed up.
I didn't realize that we had those.
I mean, Jeff Breedlove, Eli Kose, Kose or Cohen or Mac Hadal, I mean, if you, I think they
may have testified in the past, anything you did, you got some nods, the spread love
you did, is there, if there's anything further to add, then, you know, we had one more
or to testify, I was keeping you in reserve,
then we're good to go.
And Ms. Keen, you had a gentleman that you wanted to...
No, he did not testify.
Yeah.
Is that Mr. Hadal?
Yes.
Okay. Great.
All right.
Mr. Hadal, I had said that you would be able to testify.
And if you would...
Senior Fellow in Public Policy,
American Cradle Association.
Okay. Is that it?
That's it.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity.
My name is Matt Cato, Senior Fellow on Public Policy with the American Creative Association.
We represent the 15 million consumers plus in the United States who safely and responsibly
consume freedom.
We understand, I'm sorry, my apologies, thank you.
We support completely adequate and responsible labeling on products to assure that consumers
who purchase a cradum product are able to see the ingredients in that product and the
directions for safe use, serving sizes, the number of surveys be taken during the day,
and this legislation goes a long way to expand that safety profile.
It is desperately needed in order to stop what we see with the current situation, but
for the ten other states that have passed what we call the Cradum Consumer Protection
Act, it is unregulated throughout the United States.
The FDA did a rush to judgment back in 2012, based on a report of there being nine deaths
in Sweden in a 12-month period, ostensibly from Cradle, and they ordered an import
alert and that led to a 2016 request for scheduling under the Control Substances Act
to make it a Schedule I substance.
That was denied by the Drug Enforcement Administration for lack of information.
They then submitted the second request in 2017 that was reviewed by the Assistant Secretary
for Health that was Dr. Brett Jawah in the Trump administration who rejected and withdrew
the FDA's second recommendation for scheduling, calling it embarrassingly poor evidence and
data.
Again, the FDA had rushed to judgment, calling Cratum dangerous.
They went to the World Health Organization to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, of
which the United States is a treaty partner, and they petitioned them to ban Cratum internationally
at a much lower level or standard for doing so,
and a 12-member group called the expert committee
on drug dependence, experts on substance abuse
and addiction throughout the world unanimously agreed
there was insufficient evidence
in order for credit to be scheduled.
Now that doesn't mean the credit is 100% safe.
It means that it doesn't meet the criteria
for banning credit and we think
that consumers need to be protected.
We have petitioned because we represent consumers,
not the manufacturers.
85 different companies and given them to the FTA with documentation on improper marketing
of cratum. The FTA has refused over the last three years to prosecute a single one. There
are products out there that are dangerously adulterated with synthesized alkaloids that
increase their power and they are causing problems. They need to be removed from the marketplace
and this legislation will ban those kinds of products from being available on the marketplace.
those nine deaths in Sweden that started all this with the FDA.
They later ignored the fact that there was a peer reviewed published article done by
researchers in Sweden that found that, in fact, that cratum product that killed those
nine people, called Krypton, sold throughout Europe on the internet, was laced with Odess
Metal Tramadol, the powerful opioid that makes Tramadol, and that's what killed those people.
Now you will hear reports of cratum deaths and sadly you heard the tragic circumstance
here.
There's a lot more that we need to know about this.
I can assure you that if there were credible death cases
that could be attributed to Cratem alone,
that the FDA would be all over that,
and they'd be making a third recommendation for scheduling.
But just last two weeks, the FDA was ordered
in a federal court case in the state of California,
where an importer of Cratem was indicted and pled guilty
to falsely labeling the product,
and the judge wanted to know from the FDA
why they believe the credit is dangerous.
And the response from the Assistant US Attorney
to the judge, and he said, then I quote,
the FDA refused to come to provide us with witnesses
or documents to support our position,
as well as witnesses and documents
that might be inconsistent with our position.
The reason they, the FDA, gave was they have not yet
made a determination regarding whether
the credit is dangerous.
I have that document to share with the committee
if you'd like.
The important point here is that the FDA has just recently
included a dose finding study on cratum.
They initiated that in 2021, take a little time
to get there, spend a lot of our taxpayer money.
They've now determined and dozed humans with cratum
that it's safe now to do what's called a human abuse
potential study.
We're going to determine what the addiction liability
or dependence liability of cratum will be.
That will take a few years, but in the interim,
we need to protect consumers.
And so we're asking you here today
to actually accept this bill.
Now, we had made a recommendation
that rather than criminalize a retailer,
because we're already in this bill
putting credit behind the counter,
rather than criminalize a retailer,
let's make it administrative fine
if they make a mistake in selling a product.
We hope you accept that.
New science, based on some of the data
that I've just suggested to you,
has shown that the level of seven hydroxymetrogenine,
which is a metabolite because of the drying process
and the plant should actually be 2%,
rather than the 1% that was in the bill.
Scientists tell us that if you limit the amount
of seven hydroxamotrogenine per serving,
which this bill does,
that you will provide adequate safety for consumers.
We recommend this bill.
We think it's important.
We would like to see the amendments that I've suggested,
but freedom today is being consumed
by millions of Americans.
Johns Hopkins University documented it
many are using it to get off of opioids.
It's saving their lives.
I've been in dozens of hearings around the country,
heard from hundreds of freedom consumers
who've said exactly that.
It's saving my life.
People that use freedom that's not adulterated,
not synthesized that is adequately labeled and that is properly packaged and processed
it is helping people.
The fact that people use Cratum with another substance, the main Iraq, there is a system
that's available in the federal government called the MedWatch system.
Any consumer or medical professional can report to the FTA any of those interactions.
And when the FTA sees a cluster of those things, they identify it and they issue regulations
to say that warnings have to be put on those products.
We support that system.
And we think that the referrals should be made here.
I'd welcome any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Hanna.
I'm sure I'm glad you are supportive of this bill.
So anybody on this committee, besides Dr. Kirkpatrick, heard of the med watch system?
We've got, and we should have excluded, yes.
All right. So one, one non-health care, you know, the two, the three health care
people have, medwides. But I mean, I think that's the point. I've got some hands
back there. But the, I'm glad you support it. And why don't we bring
representative Townsend? I think I had elevated you to the Senate. But sorry
about I apologized for that so I kind of like our local
senators if that's okay. I got you. He's no offense this
room. He has my favorite. He's looking for the votes on the
committee. I got you. So we appreciate that. And I think
why don't we have a we on you want to say something first
represent Townsend. Well, you want to say that this will make
sure we regulate it correctly. I think we have all the levels
earned out last year, we went through multiple discussions,
multiple agreements, and then kept negotiating.
I just want to make sure this isn't another delay.
I got you.
But one thing too about the testing and like that,
if we had time, Dr. Norman out of the University of Georgia
Pharmacy School supports this bill,
actually supports banning what your committee kind of talked
about last year, of credit.
He's a research instead of Georgia,
that works for the state of UGA.
That's probably the best guy you can ask on credit.
And so he would disagree with that argument we just heard.
I got you.
I don't want to get Mr. Breedlove upset.
No, no, no, no, he's giving me the live back thing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do you mind yielding the mic for?
Yes, sir.
How many minutes do you need, Mr. Breedlove?
And he's two minutes.
We've got you on the clock.
There you go.
All right.
Jeffrey love for the Georgia Council for Recovery, person in long-term recovery.
This is a constituent issue statewide in every district.
There was 11, 12, 15, 20,000 hours of testimony last year.
People from across the state came in good faith.
Four moms came and testified.
Business owners in Georgia testified.
A diversity, a holistic voice was heard.
And we all were working in good faith on the current language.
Nobody's come to any of those people with this new language.
Nobody has.
So you talk about consumers?
We all worked in good faith.
It's consumers that will buy the product in the store.
The GBI testified some 930 deaths
that the GBI, not the FDA, not the federal government,
our government knows some 900 Georgians have died
because of this stuff.
I don't put my faith in the FDA.
Put my faith in GBI.
Put my faith in UGA who testified that they've not ever
tested a product in the state where it was on the labeling
matched up with what the scientists found out.
So do respect.
Nothing should be done to delay what's
in the best interest of consumers.
People worked in good faith with you.
And this language was agreed upon by a diversity
of your constituents.
Nobody knows.
They're a good, faith, small and big
and medium-sized business owners in Georgia
who are the backbone of our economy
and are the backbone of our state.
We're not talking about the good guys.
The cratum cupcakes?
I've been in all your districts.
I've seen those products.
Are you gonna play Russian roulette
that the bad actor who puts something out
And it kills another Georgian.
It doesn't deserve the strongest penalties possible
that are in the current version that we've all agreed to.
All I want to say is you've had many, many Georgians
get to the point where we are today to move forward
in a positive, honorable, transparent manner.
This new language is not that.
And we've got one question.
Yes, Ms. Briello.
Ms. Briello, thanks for being here.
Which LC version are you supporting specific?
I'm trying to understand we've got a couple bills
in our package.
The most recent version that was a, I'm sorry.
LC 33, 9513S.
Is that right?
That's not the...
I'll yield to the author of the bill.
Yeah, that's correct.
I'll see you get out of here.
There we go.
How about that?
Is that a good answer?
There we go.
And I do thank the committee for allowing me to have a minute.
So what we have in our packet is the original.
And then we have this, the new date, you know,
from that perspective.
The new date, you know, from that perspective.
You simply want to get more, more, more, more, more.
I don't want it too urgent yet.
Can you read that out?
We don't have a minute off of it.
Wait a second.
We have the substitute.
If I set a minimum set of substitutes, I apologize.
OK.
So what we're going off of is LC 540306S.
Yes, sir.
That's the one that all the work was put on to,
sir, by so many Georgians.
This is new to everybody, by everybody.
I mean, everybody that came down and took time
out of their lives and traveled from across Georgia
to participate in the process,
participate in the process for that language.
Let me just clarify here, we're all clear
on the committee of the LC number, right?
So what he's referring to is an amendment that came up
and that's what may be offered
and I was gonna allow the amendment to be offered
and discussed.
That's what he's referring to.
The committee will vote it up or vote it down
and that's what he was alluding to.
Correct, sir?
And we don't have that amendment.
That he's right.
We didn't have it. It was alluded to earlier. We don't have it yet, but we will. I presume.
And I was going to thank you, Mr. Breedlow.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Representative Townsend, do you have anything further?
Yes, sir.
All right. Let's go ahead with Senator Brass.
Okay. Number two.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
All right.
Now that the drum roll is over and the amendments coming out, I
have some questions first. So up on lines 26 through 28 processor. So right there
you're capturing pretty much everybody from the manufacturer to the
retailer and everybody in between. Is that the manufacturer's got the
penalties? He's got the manufacturer's got the Mr. Minter the first time.
First time when I fell any of the second time what about the retailer the
retailer got a misdemeanor yes sir the but the the retailer is grouped under
processor according to this definition if I'm reading this correctly correct I
need to get a copy of my second yeah yeah and so you you've
group under process or you've grouped manufacturers, distributors, retailers because they sell you've
grouped everybody in one lump sum and then under first offense is an aggravated misdemeanor which
is pretty severe. I mean aggravated misdemeanor you're putting a lot of you're putting that on some
years crown. You're talking regarding the retailer, correct?
Regarding the retailer, right. And to my knowledge, if you look at other industries where
the retailer is responsible for controlling the point of sale to underage or not, then
I don't know of any other where else where we do that. And that's my concern is because
a lot of times at the retail level, you know, you're talking about an hourly employee who
most of the time they don't know what they're selling, they have a job to do and I sell.
And we're going to put a requirement on them that, okay, you just don't sell it to somebody
under age, which is fine, but I just feel like an aggravated misdemeanor at the retail level
is pretty severe.
I understand that.
That's where my concern and, you know,
you're talking about locking up, you know,
an hourly employee who may or may not
have a whole lot of education.
And I just think if, I just think we ought
to be consistent with other laws and other industries
that are out there, specifically at the retail level.
At the process or level, I've got no problem
with what you're trying to do here.
And I fully support your bill.
I just do feel like at the retail level
that I think we should back off that at least a little bit.
I mean, you know, another industry
that you can compare to is the tobacco.
You sell tobacco, there's chance that you can lose your license
and there's like a tiered system.
And that might be a good model
to look at at the retail level only.
I respect that, Senator Brass, thank you.
One of the things we had in there,
and maybe we didn't word it correctly,
is willingly and knowingly.
So if a person purposely, even though they knew,
they'll see the liqueurs of the most dangerous kind,
the extracts, that's the kind that people get hurt from.
You don't know which pigeon your body,
and that's what this bill's all about,
is to make sure if a Georgia wants to put something
in their body, at least know what they're putting in
at a certain dose, give them a heads up.
And so if a retailer purposely knows,
say this bottle of cratum is not labeled, it's just says
cratum or whatever else, then that's why that part was in
there. I believe it's line 96, but that's where it goes
there. So if we need to change that, I totally
understand, because we're not after the retailers, unless
they purposely violate the law and knowingly, purposely
saying the heck with right now, we're not allowed to look
where it is. 106, I apologize.
But again, I've just felt you're grouping retailers with the distributors and the processors
and the manufacturers.
And I just, I think it's a totally, I think they're two totally separate groups, to be honest
and I hate putting them.
Okay.
Well, there should be some penalty, and I mean-
Can we lower the Mr. Mayor's fact?
I mean, I'm, like I said, I'm not after the retailers unless they knowingly purposely
doing it.
Well, so I guess, and maybe I got a question for ledge counsel.
Do we need to define retailers?
Retailer defined somewhere else in code?
Or can we just simply say the person at the point of sale?
I don't know how to word that exactly.
But I think they should fall under maybe the same laws
that we do with tobacco sales.
which, if I remember correctly, is...
Well, I think that's probably where we're going to have to do it
unless it's defining code somewhere else.
Yeah, I mean, I agree.
I think you're going to have to take out
on lines 26.
You would have to take out the word sales
and you would have to take out the word selling.
And then you would need to define it.
And then we come down later on and put what penalties would occur to them and I'm and I'm okay with saying if they knowingly and if they knowingly sell it, then yeah, they should they should maybe get the full penalty look at line 45 D.
This is no purchase. I'll offer the sale Cravenestate unless such a product is behind the counter in the area accessible to the store employees or in a secured location, which is only accessible with the
With the intervention of a store employee again, I mean if that I don't I don't see how that protects the retailer
I'm maybe I'm I mean, I'm certainly no lawyer, but
They're in the rules chairman. No, I respect that
So that's
Thank you Mr. Chairman, offer to the author, yes sir, I mean to frame this, you know if
you're selling smokes to cigarettes to some kid and that's a misdemeanor, we're talking
about something that has a life implication here, you have life and death involved in this.
So I would offer to the gentleman for the 28th, I mean the issue should perhaps be not
to drop it down to a misdemeanor where the fund is no higher than $1,000, but frame it
so that the language and the behavior is clarified.
If you violate it, you're committing a high aggregate misdemeanor.
You can handle it on the language knowingly, the level of the offense that leads to an
high aggregate misdemeanor versus the act itself.
In my belief, the thinking behind making a high-nagra is a meeting with a $5,000 potential
fine is appropriate because you have life and death here.
It's not just selling cigarettes or not just a status offense.
We have a person here who's husband died as a result of drinking it with an energy drink.
So in my view, leave the high-nagra at a misdemeanor in place, but make sure there's a knowingly
element that when you do these things and you cross that threshold, then you get into
that high and aggravated threshold.
There's two ways to handle this, the threshold,
there's a penalty.
I think the seriousness of the heavier warrants
the high and aggravated,
we just get to make sure the language is right
to get us there.
And you said it better than I did.
I'll show you a picture if you can see it.
I'll be glad to pass the phone around.
Basically that's a cratum with the red bull display.
Well guys, so basically, if you know where I'm going,
thank you, Representative Townsend.
Ms. Cretan, do you have the ability to make those changes on the fly or do we need to revisit
this issue on Wednesday?
I think that's the question.
I think I need to look up retail or retail or I think I'm going to go online with you
or I think about retail.
Do we need to, can we recess for say, well, we've got six minutes, can we read the
Do you need 10 minutes or do you want us to come back on Wednesday?
Okay, I think that's reasonable.
Yes.
So, as I said earlier, we will let the will of the committee,
and we've got a little divergence of opinion here,
and I'm certainly happy with that,
but I think that we can come to a reasonable way to get there.
I can certainly see both sides from that standpoint.
I think coming up with what Senator Sessler and Brass
and you know what, we didn't get any of the lawyers
on the committee to weigh in.
I'll tell you what, this has been a great day
and we're going to finish before three o'clock.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So we're going to come up with language
that I think we can all agree on.
And then we're going to come back here on Wednesday
and we'll try to do that first.
So if everybody can have their thinking caps on
and sort of just touch base with me,
I had a time if you have any questions all right you have some questions okay we're
going to make some adjustments all right so if there's no further business meetings
This adjourn will revisit this on Wednesday.
Thank you.
Okay.
