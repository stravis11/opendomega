you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you We'll please report to the floor of the house. We are going to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Well, good morning everyone. That's better than yesterday. One day closer to Friday, right? We will begin our day today as we do. Each day we will scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. I'm not introducing the chaplain, but I do have a thing or two I want to say about him. A former member of this body has served his country and his state, served everywhere he's been with courage and conviction. And I thought it only appropriate that on this day when we are honoring our friend, Chairman J. Powell, no one else could be chaplain other than the one we have. And yes, I have a confession. He is my friend. He is my friend. He is stood by me when few would and I don't forget things like that. I could go on and on, but I won't. I will introduce to you the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman England to introduce the chaplain of the day, Chairman England. Good morning, colleagues. Good to see everyone. It would appear that we are starting off a week of pastoral augurs. We had one yesterday and we have got another one again today. It brings me great pleasure to bring today's pastor of the day Congressman Doug Collins. I'm going to tell you a little bit about him and then I'm going to tell you a little bit about him. Former colleague of ours as the speaker mentioned, he arrived here on the scene in 2007 after reapportionment and a few changes. He decided to leave us in 2013 to go into Congress. He's Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, deployed to Iraq in 2008, came home from there, basically about 72 hours and was sworn in for the next session of the Georgia General Assembly. As a bachelor's from the University of North Georgia, has to his master's in divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary and its jurisprudence doctorate from Atlanta's own John Marshall Law School. Native of Hall County, we've talked a lot about criminal justice reform over the last several years in this body and across the hall. But we've also seen many great strides and efforts made on criminal justice reform in Washington DC as well. Our pastor of the day has been one of those that has taken that issue to heart. He was one of the chief architects here in the Georgia General Assembly and has been one of the chief architects of criminal justice reform nationally as he worked in Congress. He's married to Lisa, many of y'all know Lisa, they've been married for a little over 30 years, three wonderful children, all of whom I consider friends, Jordan, Cameron and Copeland. Copeland's here with us today. Copeland's standing up, let everybody see you. He took his height after his daddy. He kind of looks like he's standing up when he's still sitting down. He's the tall. Now I'm going to tell you about Doug Collins. Met Doug Collins after I'd been here for about two years and we quickly became friends. Worked on a lot of things together, a lot of meaningful things together. As a speaker mentioned a while ago, there were times that he stood by him and there's certainly been times he stood by me. We've cried together, we've laughed together, we've prayed together. Doug served as the secretary of the appropriations committee my first year as chairman and there were many mornings that he understood and knew the loan that was on me that any given particular day and he would just appear in the doorway and say brother, we need to pray. We would hug and huddle there in my office and as a good Baptist decan does, he listens to a good Baptist preacher, prayer prayer and we did that. Here's my Saturday, fall Saturday afternoon, a huge A game partner. We sat and enjoyed the games together. A lot of folks think that we're in deep conversation about some way, the political matters but we just act that way so we can watch the game and be kind of left alone. But I can't tell you how proud it makes me of the job that he has done representing Georgia. The way that he has worked across the Isles and Congress, the way he worked across the Isles here in this house. It was evident in seeing him come in this morning, the number of you from both sides of the Isles that went to have you picture made with him and greet him because he's someone that we seriously all love. We may not always agree on things but the one thing that I was told 16 years ago when I arrived in this house, this becomes a family, it becomes a brotherhood, a fraternity, a sorority, whatever you want to call it. And when it's all said and done, one of the proudest things that I will be able to say and take home is that I can call Doug Collins my friend but more importantly my brother, ladies and gentlemen, Doug Collins. Good morning, everybody. All right, one more time, get you fired up. I remember sitting there before. Good morning. There you go. If I can't get it speaker can, we'll go with that. It's good to be back. It's always good when I come back in here. And when I come back in here as I've heard from the speaker this morning in Terry, the discussions I think for those of us who have had the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee and the Georgia House realize that prayer starts when you start looking at the budget for all of these and prayer we're honed especially as Secretary coming in there saying what do we do? Because we were in those times when things were interesting as we went through this chamber. What I noticed even then and I noticed even coming in here today is there's a sense of duty, there's a sense of calling, there's a sense of honor. And I can't think of one though as I look and I keep coming back and as I've come back I look at chairs where faces are not anymore. I look over here and I can remember. Mr. Metis. I can remember being here as a young one and looking at Mr. Metis and him not caring if I was young one or not and as he told me one day just shut up and vote. Okay, John. I still hear that sometimes. And today I'll speak a little bit more in just a minute though about Jay Powell who had such an impact on my life. But I hear to also challenge you as well. Because I've been going through life in the series of parts and the things that I go through I think we all go through. We share something here that's hard for others to understand. We're in that fish bowl so to speak. Everybody ask us questions. We're looked at in DC right now. It's chaotic and crazy and that's sort of, you know, if you look back to even the founding fathers they were sort of the same way. But at the end of the day it's about the people we serve. So this morning I just want to take a moment and talk about setting some stones in your life. Joshua chapter four. The writer says and he said to the sons of Israel when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what are these stones? Then you shall inform the children saying Israel crossed this Jordan on dry land. For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until he had crossed until you had crossed and just as your Lord your God had done to the Red Sea which he dried up before us we had crossed before. That all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty so that you may fear the Lord your God forever. I have a question for you today. You may be working on bills and you may have things that you're going to do today but there's a bigger purpose here for all of us no matter where we serve. If you don't believe that just ask the people who voted for you. Is there a bigger purpose for why you're here? But I want to teach you also maybe a lesson that I had to learn the hard way. When you're in the midst of it, when you're in the midst of session, when you're in the 40 days when you're through this state the rest of the time and your families and your life and your businesses, there's something that starts to happen and it is called the clock and the calendar. Some of you may have heard me talk about that but for personal life it begins to move forward and then you all of a sudden turn around how many of you and just maybe in the last two weeks have turned around and said where did time go? Been there. Where did time go? Are you kidding me? It's almost the end of January. Nail? We're in 2020. Nail? Wasn't it just last year we were doing this or that? And what the children of Israel began to understand and what they said to teach was to place these stones that they took from the Jordan River when they crossed over and they put these stones out there to teach us and to teach others that this is what God has done for you. This is how he guided you in times of past. How many times have we needed the guidance for the future when all we really needed to do was turn around and look at our past because God is faithful. He never will let us down. I heard this saying a long time ago, God is not mute if we're not deaf. God is not mute if we're not deaf. He speaks to us in many ways. So the questions I have for us today just simply what are the rocks in your life? Maybe I throw out some suggestions for you or they're rocks in your family. Have you sted the rocks out for your family and your immediate family? For me that has been a challenge over the last year and a half I have lost my mother and my uncle, cousins, a brother-in-law. And I question, how do I remember them? Because I do funerals all the time and I tell people that the funeral is not necessarily for the person there. We're here because someone died but the reason we're really there is because they lived. I question you, how many of you are living in your families? Are you putting the rocks down with your family? Are you making memories? My wife, God bless her. When we were pastoring. We didn't have a lot. Still don't have a lot. But back then we had three young kids and of course everybody after church wanted to go out to get something to eat but we always had something going on. And my wife always wanted to make sure that we're happy we had something to eat and the kids were happy. We would go up to the drive-through and my wife began to call that picnic in the car. I said, well, okay if that's what we're going to do but the kids got into it she would get into it. It was a time when we get a cheeseburger and a happy meal and a toy that we threw away by the time we got home but it was called picnic in the car and I can tell you today if I call Copeland Copeland could talk about picnic in the car. It's a rock. It's something we touched on on. It's something we go back to when life is hard when it's not going the way you want to or maybe it is going the way you want it to. You can go back and you can touch a stone saying our family came together over a cheeseburger. May not sound holy but if God's in it it's all holy. What about your teachable moments? What you believe? Those are rocks in our families. And for some of us in this room including myself there's rocks in our life called mistakes. Mistakes that we made. Things that we should have said or things that we did say and we should have said apologies and in my case I had to just real recently because I said something was wrong and I apologize for it. That's a rock in my life. Is it a painful rock? Yes. But it's a rock in our life. Each of us have those rocks. Don't hide your mistakes. What I have seen so many times in people you want to move on from your mistakes. I told them to move on and forget them. Don't forget them learn from them. If you're not making mistakes you're not doing anything. If in this body you've never made a mistake I question why you're here. Because if you're not making mistakes you're not trying. I tell my interns and folks who work for me all the time. Blown more your planet and if you're not making if you're not trying if you're not making mistakes then you're missing the rocks that God I believe is trying to teach us with. Things and work for here. Are you making those rock moments? Are you stacking them and remembering the things in work that is taught you, the things that God has given to you? Are you counting your blessings as the song goes? Name them one by one. Those rocks that keep us going. But here's the point that I want each of you to realize today. I was here before and I've heard this before so I'm going to try it. I know we like to do this. Look to your left. Look to your right. See I went left first. Okay come on. Give me a break. Yes some of y'all will catch that on the way home tonight. I know you will. My, I'll try. I'll try. Okay. But what I want to tell you is the rocks now are in this room. The rocks that I want you to focus on the most today are in this room and for me I can go back to teachers, Miss McCall and social studies in North Hall High School who instilled in me that you can do things that you can grow beyond where you're planted. You can grow out of North Hall High School and do whatever you want to do. I'm just a tripper's kid from North Georgia who is now having the ability to address this body this morning. We can come a long way when people believe in you. Miss Mary who worked for me for 11 years just passed away recently at Chickpea Baptist Church. Everybody needs a Miss Mary in their life. Miss Mary was that one. She was a little bit, she was a good bit older than me and as a young pastor I would come in and I have those good ideas. How many of you got pastors who have good ideas? Bless them. Just pray for them. And also cut the conference budget. Don't let them go to conferences. They come back with these ideas and I'd come back with ideas and Miss Mary quietly in her own little way. She'd come back and she said, well Doug that's a really good idea but I think we need other things to do. The bust, the bubble and I would just go, okay. But then when she knew I was trying she was always at one behind me that I never had to turn around to wonder if she was there. It's mentors in her life. And what's John Metta's as I spoke of earlier is Penny Hauston who sent me, I'm going to get through this. I went to Iraq as a member of this body. I told a former member Tom Gray sitting right back there in the back that I was going to Iraq. Didn't know what was going to happen. Leaving my kids and wife we went and I remember one night I had been out because I worked the night time in the flight line. And I came back in and there was a package for me. It happened to come after a few weeks in which I had saw people lose body parts, lose their life and send them home. And I opened this box and I had no idea who it was from but all of a sudden I saw the House of Representatives in Georgia this letterhead and I'm saying, what is this? And I opened it up and for an old boy in the middle of Iraq to open up a box of peanuts I couldn't have been happier in the world. We went and found a coat. We dumped a minute and we dropped and I hand him to everybody that came by. That is a mentor. That is somebody who makes a mark in your life. That's a rock in my life. And then you have the speaker who is a rock in my interior. I can go through this whole room. I can see my hall county friends and family here. But then there's Jay Powell. Sitting right back there Lee or you're at. Jay came to the legislature and to his frustration he got seated next to me. Here was a lawyer who was accomplished. He did things. He knew how to do things. He knew how to accomplish it. The speaker being a lawyer there, all this. He sent me. He said, Jay next to me. Someone who actually joined this body while I was in law school and finished law school while I was a part of this body and was just starting my law practice when I came back from Iraq. I had more questions for Jay. I can't tell you how many orders and court orders and lawsuits and everything else we discussed on those tables right back there. And the funny thing about it was Jay would be on his computer. He'd be doing stuff and I'd say, Jay, I got a question. I'll never forget one day he looked at me. You've seen this. He had his glass on. He leans back, pulls the glasses up and says, what have you done now? I said nothing. I just got a question. He said, okay, what is it? And then one day I'm sitting there and this is mentors and each of you can be a mentor. My question is, do you mentor the people next to you in your life? You're here for a purpose. You don't sit next to each other not to get to know each other. Find those places in time to mentor each other, learn from each other. These are where all Americans serving the state of Georgia, we can learn from each other. And Jay Powell, thank goodness. Talk me. One day we had one of those long days, we had full day and he finally said, I was trying to write a lawsuit. It was a complaint that I was writing and I was messing it up every time. And Jay was patient. He kept going. He said, no, you got to write this. So I finally handed to him. And about five o'clock we had not got a supper break. He finally looked at, he said, do you have the paper? I said yes. He said, hand it to me. He took the papers that I was working on. Took them to his desk right next to me and he began to write in long form the whole way out. He then turned around after 30 minutes and he said, here, copy. He was through talking. But his words spoke volumes. Jay Powell, chairman, father, friend, mentor. When I come into this body and I think about things like we just have talked about, I think about those who have affected me. I think about the fact that there are seats that will turn over and there will be new people here and that not any of us are promised another day. And my question for us is, is the old, pro-Variv Chinese proverb said that everywhere we go, we're like pieces of chalk. We leave a mark where we go. So my question for us is our legacy. They'll all be excited about you being here and people will be happy that you're there representative. But at the end of the day, are they putting a rock down and remembering what you put into them? Is your mark making a mark on them just as each other should be making a mark on each person here? When you remember that, you remember God has given us each more gifts than we can take. The only question is, is we'll remember those seated next to us and those that we serve outside this body to say, thank you and I remember where I've been because it determines where I'm going. God bless you. Would you pray with me? Eternal God, you are more amazing than we could ever hope or wish. I pray one thing for this body that I love dearly. In this capital, you give servants in the hallway, you give servants across the hall, you give them in this room here, you give our constitutional officer our governor, our lieutenant governor, great responsibility. And I pray for each of us today whether observing or participating. That when things are going maybe the way we want them or maybe the way we don't want them, I pray that we will each remember that you are God and we are not. That we remember that there is nothing in this world that has been missed or forgotten or you're not concerned about. I pray for each of their families here today. I pray that they leave those families and come here that you would bless them and guide them. I pray that you would give them moments and rocks in their lives that they can point to their children and their grandchildren, their nieces and nephews, their husbands and wives, their partners and everybody that they come in contact with, that they can know that where they have been helps God to where they are going, that you are always calling us to you. And Father, we love you more than we could ever imagine. Even when we don't admit it. Give us peace today. And in the moments of silence, simply yell at us because you're not mute when we're not deaf. Let us hear from you. And thank you for the memories of those that have touched our lives. And for this one. Thank you for J. I am better because of him and what you have done through him. We're sitting Christ and we pray. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic.

I will ask Representative Bentley to join me at the podium. Clerk will read the text of House Resolution 961. House Resolution 961, my representative Ross, on the 7th Burns, the 159 Jones, the 47th hatchet of the 150th Kelly, the 16th and others. A resolution dedicating the Ways and Means conference for him under the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives to Representative Alfred Jackson J. Powell Jr. and for other purposes. Whereas the State of Georgia mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished citizens with the passing of Representative Alfred Jackson J. Powell Jr. on Tuesday, November 26, 2019. And whereas Representative Powell was born on November 18, 1952, Equipment, Georgia of a loved son of the late AJ and Mary Powell. And whereas a member of the State Bar of Georgia, he practiced law with his long term business partner Bill Irwin in Camilla, Georgia. And he served as judge for the Municipal Court of Camilla as president of the Mitchell County Bar Association. And as a member of the Mitchell County Law Library Board of Trustees and the Georgia Institute of Continuing Legal Education Board of Trustees. And whereas an active member of his community, Representative Powell held various executive roles with the Camilla Chamber of Commerce, received the Citizen the Year Award in 2001 and the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008, and served as a faithful member of the Camilla Rotary Club. And whereas a dedicated and venerable public servant, Representative Powell served as Mayor of Camilla from 1996 to 2007, he was elected the Georgia House of Representatives in 2008, where he represented the House District 171 until his passing. And whereas a part of the service in House of Representatives, Representative Powell served as chairperson of these appropriations subcommittee and public safety, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Rules Committee. And whereas he was united in love marriage to his wife, Deedra, and was blessed with five remarkable children, Jessica, Erica, Elizabeth, Nicholas, and Isabella, and one wonderful grandson, John. And whereas he gave inspiration to many through his high ideals, morals, and deep concern for his fellow citizens, and the devotion, patience, and understanding he demonstrated to his family and friends were admired by others. And whereas he was a person of magnanimous strength with an unimpeachable reputation for integrity, intelligence, fairness, and kindness, and by the example he made of his life, he made this world a better place in which to live. And whereas Representative Powell's significant organizational leadership talents, remarkable patience and diplomacy, keen sense of vision and sensitivity that needs of citizens of this state have earned him the respect and admiration of his colleagues and associates. Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives that the members of this body dedicate the Ways and Means Conference for a month of the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives in the honor and solemn memory of Representative Alfred J. Powell Jr. and authorize a placement of an appropriate plaque so dedicating such conference room. They say that time is the great healer of wounds and hurt. Well, I'm still waiting. Not a day goes by that I don't look over there for Chairman Jasper's is sitting and look for a day Powell. And oftentimes I catch myself reaching from my phone to call him. I know we have celebrated his life at an amazing home going and Camilla back in late November. And I have never seen as many members of this body at a service like that in my years here. Both parties. He would have liked that. J. thought that working across the aisle was what we all ought to do. He thought that was a good thing. We've made it a bad thing. And we're no better for it. But we are better because he touched our lives and he touched this house in this state. J. Powell was just a good man. A great leader. I told the people of the congregation down at Camilla that day and I may have said it in this body. You know, we have reached a point that my dad never would have dreamed we had got to when you have to tell people how principled you are. He never had to do that. You just knew it. And he had a strong sense of right and wrong. You know, he would tell me what it was. And sometimes I was on the wrong side of those messages. But we're here today to honor his family and also to dedicate the Ways and Means Conference Room. And I tell you why we're going to do that. Because that's he loved that committee. When John Meadows passed, I was struggling with who am I going to get to be a Rose Chairman. Because that's a unique position. You don't make any friends there. I think Dean Smiley would agree with me. You probably made more since you left there haven't you. So my number one advisor said one morning, you know, I don't know what you're worried about. The perfect guy for the job is Jay Powell. And I said, he wouldn't leave Ways and Means if I drug him out from down there. She said, I don't know, you want to call him. And I did and it worked. And I'm going to put him back today by naming that conference room for him. He would like that. He probably wouldn't like us to put Alfred Jackson on the plaque. Though would he did just thinking of that when the clerk was reading the resolution. But I just want to say to this family that I love so dearly. Thank you for sharing him with us. This is not an easy job for any of these men and women. And I know the further away you are from home, the tougher it is. And I understand that. And he was a long way from home when he was here. But thank goodness for this state and for young people to come along later. He was here. We're honored today to have all of his children appear Jessica. Elizabeth, her husband, Parker. Y'all didn't bring John, did you? And Erica, Nicholas, Isabella, and Deidre is wife. And I just want to say on behalf of the house how much we love him and we love y'all. Thank you very, very much. Before I recognize Deidre who wanted to say a few things. And I have no idea what she's going to say. I want to recognize Representative Bentley who has a presentation to make. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The measure of a man is not how did he die, but how did he live? Not what did he get, but what did he give? And I would love it. Representative Jay Powell gave so much to this house and to this great state of Georgia. And his life and legacy will be forever cherished by his entire family and all members of this house. So on behalf of Speaker David Roliston and all 180 members of the Georgia House of Representatives, we would like to present this keepsake blanket to the Powell family in memory of our beloved Jay Powell. Thank you. Thank you very much, Representative Bentley. It is my distinct honor and a personal pleasure to introduce it. First to present House Resolution 961 to Deidre Powell on behalf of the Powell family. And to recognize her to say a few words to the House, Deidre Powell. I feel as though I should tell you right off the bat, Spiro told me I could say whatever I want to. So if this goes sideways, you can blame him. Thank you for letting me speak today. I'm going to stick to notes since I'm not a public speaker. Nearly all men can stand adversity. But if you want to test a man's character, give him power Abraham Lincoln. On behalf of our entire family, I want to thank you for your continued prayers and kindness to us. Our time on earth with Jay has ended too soon. For his daughters Jessica, Erica and Elizabeth, their loss is immeasurable. For my Nicholas and Isabella, that strong and steady hand is gone. For you, his house family and friends, a bridge that connected many roads is missing. The speaker is correct in saying that Jay loved this house. And he wanted this body to excel in everything you do. He had promised me 10, not good, but great years. And as our anniversary approached, he had already begun his annual victory lap. And he said a few days before he died, six out of ten, maybe. Which of course forced me to say, you know, I'm not sure we can count a couple of those. It's technically great. So maybe, you know, just keep working at it. You know, just to keep him humble. Because the truth is, every day was great. And we thought we would have at least 20 years of every day. Jay used to say all the time that with his family's extraordinary genes, and my family's ordinary genes, that it would all work out in the end together. And again, quoting Abraham Lincoln.

In the end, it's not the years of your life that count. It's the life in your years. And I am forever grateful for the lifetime of blissfully true happiness we had. And in honor of Jay and his total dedication to this body, today my prayer is this. That we all make every moment count. Find unity with each other. Strive for compassion and understanding. Laugh every day. Be that missing bridge. Thank you so much on behalf of our family for this wonderful tribute. This was all a surprise and we're overwhelmed right now for your loving support for us. And I'll close with this just to let you know that God indeed blessed the broken road that brought us all together here because of this most wonderful, irreplaceable man. Thank you. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You Okay. The House will come back to order. House will come back to order. We're going on to morning orders. All members will please take your seats and show respect to the members in the well. Chair recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Eddie Lumsden. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, you yield well. Okay, here's the situation. We have many, many reps that have signed up for morning orders. We have five invite resolutions. So I'm going to limit morning orders to one minute and then the mic will be turned off. And that will be applied on a bipartisan basis without respect to where you live or anything else. Chairman Lumsden. Good morning, colleagues. Yesterday in Air Force E118, surveillance plane crashed in Afghanistan with five crew members on board. While details on the crash are still forthcoming, we want to send over our thoughts and our prayers to those loved ones and those serving with them. Will you stand with me for a moment's silence to honor those brave airmen? Thank you. Chair wants to recognize on the floor of the House. Apparently we have this must be homecoming day here in the House. Congressman Collins, we have former representative Melvin Everson's here. Former representative Bob Smith is here. Former representative Amy Carter is here. Chair recognizes for a morning order. Chairman Bonnie Rich. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleagues. Today is a special day here at the Georgia State Capitol. This Korean American Day, which commemorates the arrival of the first Korean emigrants to the United States in 1903. It is the 117th anniversary. Today, nearly 1.8 million Koreans call America home and I am proud to represent more than 1,500 Korean Georgians who call District 97 home. In 1882, the United States and Korea signed a treaty establishing a peaceful relationship, friendship, and commerce. In December of 1902, the first Korean emigrants set sail for Honolulu Hawaii to officially establish residency in the United States. Korean Americans have played an integral part in the US from entertainment to law, to medicine, and to technology. America's relationship with Korea continued to strengthen during the Korean War, where America allied with the Soviet Union to liberate Korea from Japanese control. Today, we take a brief moment to recognize and express gratitude for the contributions of these Korean Americans and the contribution of the American soldiers who participated in the liberation of Korea. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Lee Hawkins for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is the Georgia Academy of Audiology Day. We have audiologists up there in the gallery. Thank you all for coming today. The American Academy of Audiology is also the national organization, and a number of these members or members of that. And all audiologists are very important healthcare providers. They provide evaluation and treatment options for patients, old and young alike. For us older folks that have tonight's and ringing of the ear, they can help us. But even more importantly, they help our school children in learning their subjects and studying, helping them being able to hear. So thank you for all you do. Chair recognizes Chairman Shaw Blackman for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members, please join me in welcoming the Georgia Speech Language Hearing Association group as it is their day here at the Capitol. Would you please stand up and let us thank you. As that is my wife's chosen profession, I just want to thank each of you for being advocates, for your discipline and the patients you serve. You work tirelessly to invoke the prevention diagnosis and treatment of communication and hearing disorders. And I've witnessed firsthand the ability that you have to make lives better. So thank you for that and thank you again for the work you do every day to advance healthcare and educational services in your field. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. You'll be well. Chair recognizes representatives Williamson and Kirby for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my honor today to rise and recognize today as a touchy day at the Capitol. A touchy manufacturer was founded in 1910, manufacturing generators. Today they're over $100 billion company with over 300,000 worldwide employees building everything from auto parts to NECA reactors to life saving medical products. Their mission is to contribute to society through the development of superior original technology and products and their slogan is powering good. I know for a fact this is a good company. They're great corporate citizens in Walton County, Georgia, where they've been manufactured auto parts for over 25 years. They're great citizens in the state of Georgia and frankly the great citizens of the world. If you would join me and honor them with a round of applause for a touchy manufacturer. Thank you so much. Chair recognizes representative Stovall and Chairman Ken Trill for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. We're excited during the last week of January because it's National School Choice Week worldwide. And I'm wearing my yellow scarf all this week in recognition of it. We celebrate given parents access to the best K through 12 education options for their children to include traditional public online public charter, magnet, private and home school. Georgia has made advances in giving families options. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Glanton for a morning order. Chair recognizes representative Watson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be really brief. But before I get into my official morning order, I need to tell my wife happy anniversary. I'm getting myself out of the doghouse. We've been married 14 years and eight of those I've been here at the Capitol with you guys. So thank you for your support, Emily. I love you and the girls and we'll see you Friday. But today is Georgia Economic Developers Association Day at the Capitol. The Georgia Economic Developers Association is one of the leading organizations for economic development professionals in the South Eastern United States. GEDA serves as a resource for economic development professionals and as a strong voice on issues affecting policies and regulations on industry here in Georgia. Today, GEDA's membership exceeds 700 practitioners from across Georgia and reflects the multifaceted nature of economic development in our state. The organization celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013 and it continues to evolve into the leading professional association. I want to thank these individuals for being here today and thank you for what you do under the gold dome. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Bernal for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to wish my brother Kevin Hammond's indetroid happy birthday. Is he watching us? Sorry to say it must be a slow day indetroid if he's watching us. Maybe not. Chair recognizes representative Kendrick for a morning order. Good morning, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I'm giving you your black back for today. Because every day is a day for black history and I want to talk to you about the Tulsa race riots. Also known as black wall street massacre that took place from May 31 to June 1 of 1921. This riot began over Memorial Day weekend after a 19-year-old dig rolling a black shoe shiner was accused of assaulting, seropage, a 17-year-old white elevator operator at the nearby Drexel building. And what ensued was a fight between the black and white residents. About 10,000 black people were left homeless and property damaged amounted to more than 1.5 million.

the state and 750,000 in personal property equivalent to about 32.25 million in 2019. In 1996, 75 years after the riot, a bipartisan group in their state legislature authorized the formation of the Oklahoma Commission to study the race riots of 1921. Thank you, that's your Black Ferry fact for today, and I'll see you next time. Chair recognizes Representative Holly for a morning order. I shall. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Rise the day to commemorate the 100 year anniversary for the City of Stockbridge. This once sleepy bedroom community began from assembling a local settlers seeking to organize near the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad originated from what was originally old Stockbridge, 300 miles north, and getting its, it's got its name from the respected professor, Levi Stockbridge traveling through the area. We know of Stockbridge to be the home of the earliest legislator, Mr. Representative James Coker, as well as the birthplace for the father of the civil rights movement, rather the father of the father of the civil rights movement, and that is Martin Luther King, Jr. Senior, as well as NASCAR, Champfield McCulloch, and the Multiplatinum Recording Artist Rock Band Collective Soul. Stockbridge, which remains the largest city in Henry County, and certainly has the level of developments happening over the years. We've seen that this is a city that is coming together and more unified today. So if you all please rise and give a welcome applause for the 100 years. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today I want to introduce you to Margaret. Margaret is a child who's 12 years old and she is ready for adoption in Georgia. Margaret is a loving and assertive girl who likes to be in charge. She enjoys playing with baby dolls and dressing up. She also enjoys coloring, swimming, and watching TV. She needs a loving adoptive family who provide her with one-on-one attention, support, encouragement, structure, and nurturing that she and every other child on this planet needs to grow and thrive. Our family will also need to support her desire to maintain her relationship with her brother who has been placed separately from her. We're going to see Margaret. We'll see Margaret later. But keep Margaret in your prayers. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Glanton for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House good morning. I rise this morning with my colleagues who represent districts with large populations of Korean Americans, including in this group are the co-sponsors of the official resolution, recognizing and commending the Korean American community that would be presented by Representative Sam Park and others later this morning. As the author of the resolution, I recognize my co-sponsors, Representative Sam Park, Representative B. Wynn, and Representative Brenda Lopez-Rimero. Also joining us this morning is Representative Al Williams and Representative Chairman Bill Hitchens, who both served in Vietnam. On your desk this morning, you should find a designer silk pouch. Inside that pouch is a decorative Korean tradition-motived pin brooch. It's nice. This gift is compliments of Dr. Lee Shrieve, of the Mission Agape, and members of the Korean American community. We hope that you would wear the brooch or pass it on to someone who will. Ladies and gentlemen, the House would you join us in welcoming members of the Korean American community, including members of the Korean American Vietnam Veterans Association, who fought bravely alongside American military men and women in the Korean War and the Vietnam conflict. Would you please stand. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you very much. Consumadal. Chair recognizes Representative Allen for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I have to say happy birthday to my mom. But also today is a dictionary recovery day at the Capitol. Substance use disorder and mental illness affect millions of individuals of all races, ethnic backgrounds, and genders, as well as their families and friends. More than 25 million Americans are building a life of recovery with 800,000 people recovering from substance use and mental illness across Georgia. Today is designed to acknowledge all of, encourage us all that freedom from mental illness and substance use disorder are available and possible. And to remind Georgia that with the organizations like the zone in Marietta, the Georgia Council on Substance Abuse, and many other recovery centered organizations around the state, that there are many pathways to recovery. It changes lives and it saves lives. It's good for the community. It's good for Georgia and it's good for business. I stand to remind us that recovery is real. Now, the most important voice in recovery is the voice of the community. And today in the gallery, we have Georgia to our each on their individual journey of recovery. And I ask that they stand and be acknowledged. And lastly, on your desk, there's a replica of a joint federally funded campaign between the Department of Behavioral Health and Development Disabilities and the Georgia Council on Substance Abuse that was designed to combat stigma. Around the state, these billboards were placed, as well as commercials, to encourage people to seek treatment and to embrace their recovery journey. So please enjoy that gift and Mr. Speaker, thank you for a yield of well. Chair recognizes Representative Jones to introduce the Doctor of the Day. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I want to thank you for your service to the State of Georgia and for everything you do for patients and physicians in the state. And I also want to say on a personal note, I have particular appreciation for this body. My grandfather, Ralph McClellan, was actually a legislature here for 12 years between 1956 and 1968. And I'm told, second row on the right, second or third chair, and was his spot. So thank you for everything you do and thank you for having me today. The House will be at order. The clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 959. House Resolution 959 by Representative Gamble, the 15th Stevens-Thommer, 64th Rogers, the 10th Burns, the 59th Smith-Thommer, 33rd. A resolution commending the Georgia House of Representatives and the Georgia Economic Developers Association on their efforts to improve the economic development of the state of Georgia and for other purposes. Chair recognizes Representative Gamble for an invite resolution. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House were honored today as you know, today's economic development day. And we certainly don't take that for granted. And we've already heard some comments mentioned a minute ago by Chairman Watson about what economic development means. We set the tone here at the state house in the legislature, but these are the boots on the ground that we are going to be able to honor and recognize today. And that's our economic development officials in all 159 counties throughout our state. And so joining us today from the Georgia Economic Developers Association is Mr. Sean McMillan, Misty Martin, Missy Kendrick, Dan McCray, and Al Nash. Would you please welcome them to the House today? And Sean's going to share a few words. Thank you, Representative Gamble, Mr. Speaker, members of this body. What a privilege it is as a native Georgia from Little Millageville, Georgia, to be in your presence in these unbelievable chambers here. I just want to say thank you very much for all that you do to enact sound policy for the Georgia Economic Developers Association, 700 members in our fantastic state that have made Georgia the number one place in which to do business now for six, seven years in a row. So please keep it up and thank you for all you do. Clerk will read the caption to the House of Resolution 960.

The resolution, commanding and congratulating Dr. Angel Cabrera as the 12th president of Georgia Tech and for other purposes. I'm not going to say it. Chair recognizes representative Reeves for an invite resolution. You know Mr. Speaker, there was a game the last Saturday in November this year. Do you remember it? If you call it a game. You know we looked good in the first half. But it didn't go the way we wanted and I just want to say something. In 2002 when that last game in November occurred and we were on the wrong side of a 51 to 7 score. I actually, and a lot of you in this room know this, but I quit wearing the color red. I swore off a primary color because of that game. And this year as I sat there in the fourth quarter and watched and watched and watched and something really devastating happened, it was 52 to 7. And so I didn't know what to do. I already swore off a primary color. And so I actually had some people recommend to me that maybe I should start wearing red again after that. I don't know what to do, but that was a, but we looked good in the first half and we're coming back around. Mr. Speaker, I promise. Members of the House, it is my honor and pleasure to introduce somebody that I have gotten to know over the last several months and spent some great time with the new president of Georgia Tech, president on hell, Cabrera. He came to Georgia Tech from seven years at George Mason University where he helped take George Mason to a top tier, tier one research university in the Carnegie classification, which is a big deal. Prior to that, he had been at other schools and was the dean of the business school in Madrid. He has been named the young global leader by the World Economic Forum, a star of Europe by business week. He serves on the board of the National Geographic Society and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and has also been active with the Georgia Tech Advisory Board for some time. He is one of our own. He earned his master's and his PhD in psychology from Georgia Tech and his undergraduate and another master's in engineering where at the University of the Add, at University Dad, Politechnia. Did I get that right? Politech. I knew I was of Madrid. So he is married to his wife, Elizabeth, who he met in grad school at Georgia Tech. He has got two kids, one of whom is at Georgia Tech. It is my pleasure to introduce president on hell, Cabrera. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you, Representative Reeves and thank you, Speaker. Rotson, thank you all the members of the House. What an honor to stand before you. What an honor to be back at Georgia Tech, where my career started 28 years ago. This is a dream come true. The Atlanta and the Georgia, I have encountered on my way back, is even more exciting than what I left. It is absolutely great for business. It plays that has become a hub of innovation and I am very proud of the role that Georgia Tech has played in getting us there. Today, Georgia Tech, thanks to the investments that you have supported over the years. Georgia Tech stands up on the top five public universities in the country. It is one of the most research-intense institutions in the country. It is helping educate thousands of our best and brightest students from across the state, but also attracting some of the very best and brightest students from other parts of the country to Atlanta, and helping and encouraging many companies to set up a shop right here in Atlanta. As I tell my colleagues, Georgia Tech has one and only one shareholder, and that is the state of Georgia. I remind everybody so you can count on me that every decision that we are going to be making is going to be always made from the standpoint of what is it that will help the state of Georgia. I very much look forward to working with each one of you in advancing Georgia Tech and the rest of higher education in the state. Thank you so very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. I want you to look what can happen sometimes. You try your best to raise kids upright. I want you to look what can happen. Worked under the majority leader, you know, and went to Georgia, and look at this. Look at this. I want you to look at this. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 956. Chair recognizes representative Sam Park for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In honor of Korean American Day at the Capitol, we have some special guests joining us today. The Council, the general of the Republic of Korea, Young John Kim, President of the National Unification Advisory Council, Eric Kim, President of the Korean American Association of Greater Atlanta, Mr. Yoon Chul Kim, President of the Korean American Foundation, Michael Park, and it is a personal honor to welcome my friend Sarah Park. Sarah was recently recognized by the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, for her efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and to serve the Korean American community. I hope you all would join me in giving a warm welcome to Sarah Park who will share a few brief remarks. Good morning. My name is Sarah Park and I'm a confidential executive assistant to the County District One and Vice President of Korean American Coalition. There are over 2 million Korean American across the country, nearly 150,000 Korean American calls Georgia home. We are shaping the history of our nation with our heritage, talent, and spirit. First Korean student came to Georgia 100 plus years ago and today the average Korean American in Georgia has 2240 years of living history. Now the influence of Korean American existence in all aspects of our life, from politics to industry, entrepreneurship to volunteerism, culture, and education. We will continue to strengthen our economy and enrich our culture and civic life, especially during this very important year with 2020 census and election. We Korean American like other groups of immigrants that arrive in the United States before us, seeking a barrel life and opportunity have thrived on our new homeland due to strong work ethic, family bond, and sense of community. As they were raised during the miracle of Han River when Korea rose from the ashes of Korean word to one of the world most developed nation. And Korean immigrants established a home in a new land through resilience, tenacious effort, immersed sacrifice, which became the bedrock for our children and future generation of a Korean American and Georgia. Thanks to our share of values, which include heritage, equality, and faith. We can be the bridge to work together in a cross the aisle. All life matters. Everyone is welcome here. Korean American comes from all walks of life and together we can make Georgia number one for small business while extending Southern hospitality to all. Korea is the third most-booking language in Georgia and there are currently second and third generations who benefit from a great education system that will help share the brighter future together. For example, there are some of us walking towards to join Seoul and Pyongyang Summer Olympics in 2032 brings peace to Korean Peninsula as well as for the better world. Korean American Day serves to commemorate the first step of the long and prosperous journey of a Korean American in the United States. Together, let's keep up the fight for Georgia and put Georgia first. Thank you again for this opportunity and thank you for all that you do. God bless United States America. Thank you.

I know Louis and my sheriff is going to come up and introduce him and talk about him a little bit, but he played Georgia from 1987 to 1990.

Thank you, Sheriff. We might step in over. Thank you for allowing me to speak today. I appreciate y'all honoring Mars Lewis. We inherited Mars Lewis.
