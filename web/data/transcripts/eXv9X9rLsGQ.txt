TRANSCRIPT
----------
My name is Rob Leverd. I'm chairman. This is the subcommittee of rules on law superform and we're going to start a meeting here in one second. We've got one member not here yet but I think he's on his way. If there are any members of the house in the room who would like a place to sit there are some seats up front if you want to come move up front and sit in some of the chairs that's fine. I'm going to go ahead and before we get started here just recognize Chairman Newton to give his word of thanks. Pray with me. Father you promised to give wisdom to those who ask for your wisdom as we deliberate important matters for Georgians help us to hear you and into act accordingly. Thank you for this time together. Jesus name, amen. Thank you, Chairman Newton. Ladies and gentlemen so we've for those of you haven't been with us we've had a few days of meetings already. I think someone said 12 hours or some number of testimony so I think we've heard the testimony want to hear. Senator Kennedy the sponsor of the bill has sat here with us during each of these meetings and I have asked him to wait until the end here to sort of give his final comments on the bill so I'm going to recognize him now to come speak to the bill and then I've got a substitute I want to put before the committee and we may have some amendments to be made on that too. Senator Kennedy if you'll go ahead and get started. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee get after an offer. you put into this so you've been very patient. Yes sir. The calls you have been very patient and heard from a lot of members of the public that have had input on this and this committee has heard a lot of facts, a lot of testimony, a lot of opinion testimony. I'm not going to hopefully bore the committee with a recitation or reference to all of that but I want to try to focus our attention on a few things, at least in my remarks and try to bring, I hope, hope, will be some clarity as to what this bill does and very importantly, what it does not do as it has stated, as has been stated during the course of these many hours quite frankly, things that this bill purports to do that it simply does not. I want to highlight the efforts of the committee, the stakeholders and the interested parties on both sides because at the end of the day what we are all here about, those of us that have a vote and those of us that serve in the legislature or in other roles here is to have a good final product of legislation for the state of Georgia. I want to remind the committee that these efforts began really two years ago. When the governor's team began researching and holding conversations about this topic and gathering input from a wide variety of stakeholders across the state about what language ought to be in this bill, well, why? What was one of the reasons that this got brought to a head? Well, it's several things and this committee has heard about many of those but I would tell you one of the issues that I think is most telling was one of the final comments that one of the witnesses made about how to describe where we are and what got us here. And I think the answer is to some degree what describes where we are here is the number one state on the judicial hellhole list. Now regardless of who produces that opinion, regardless of what metrics are used to arrive at that number, it's all relative. What we know is we are the worst of all 50 states. That's very telling. That's alarming. That's a wake-up call. So the governor's team started soliciting information from folks from around the state and before Senate Bill 68 was filed, there were meaningful discussions that were held not only leading up to and what was formed ultimately to be the bill that I dropped as Senate Bill 68 but also those conversations continued. And as the governor stated in his state of the state address, he said that tort reform would be his number one priority for the 2025 session but he followed that by saying I will continue to negotiate in good faith and he absolutely has done that. And we have seen that because the bill that I presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee was a substitute that had changed several of the provisions of the nine original provisions dropped and in fact one section was completely removed from Senate Bill 68. That removal and all of the changes in Senate Bill 68 that were made were all as an accommodation for concerns that were raised by the plaintiffs bar or GTLA or folks that basically opposed the concepts of the bill. Well, after the bill passed out of committee and as it moved on to the floor and again in the spirit of compromise and again trying to make the bill better it was amended again after listening to folks whose clients and cases may be affected by the bill. Senate Bill 68 was adopted by the Senate with a substantial revision and came out of the Senate off the Senate forward with bipartisan support. As you have referenced Mr. Chairman, this committee has heard I think over 15 hours of testimony and feedback from the public and from various folks. Furthermore, the substitute before you today intends to strike a balance and address concerns for both sides of the issue. The substitute bill that I understand is before you clarifies language throughout the bill guards against the misapplication of provisions to protect all parties to a case and further protects the rights of victims to ensure that the vulnerable are protected throughout the course of civil litigation. I want to talk for a minute about some of the testimony that we heard. Again, as I said, this bill and what you have before you committee to vote on was not created overnight. Many legislators have been actively working to get tort reform and some measures because of the problems that were known to be growing for many years. The governor announced tort reform as I said is number one priority and they've actively worked to craft a solution to balance what is an unbalanced civil justice system. We spent last summer also hearing from businesses at the governor's direction and leadership from big business, small business, health care industry. Every day Georgians about the need to balance our civil justice system. And with the culmination of all factors that I mentioned above I believe that the bill you have before you is a carefully crafted compromise. However, notwithstanding that this committee has heard testimony over the last few weeks that if Senate bill 68 is passed, slum lords are going to take over the housing market in Georgia. Georgians will be less safe. Georgians will be discriminated against. Planets will be unable to sue businesses or insurance companies ever again. Folks, that's not what Senate bill 68 is about. It's not what it's trying to accomplish. It's not what a plane reading of the bill would inform you of and it's not what it does. Let me talk about section six. Mr. Chairman, on the what we call premises liability and a few responses. I want to start with a testimony. This committee heard regarding section six. And the problem with our current framework is a lack of framework. And that lack of framework which in essence produces a lack of predictability and a lack of predictability equals a lack of stability. And part of that, most of that stems from the current structure we have, which is not from statutory direction from this body, but rather more that is found in case law focuses on one issue and that is foreseeability. You know, there's always some foreseeability in a criminal activity. However, just because an act is foreseeable does not mean that a business owner has the sole ability to control or stop that activity. And to address this ambiguity that we have in the law, Centerville 68 seeks to strike a balance between actual knowledge and constructed knowledge by using both of them in the bill at two different times for the analysis. If you look at lines 227 through 228. Mr. Chairman, my lines may be a little off. I'm not sure that this that includes the the sub that was from today. The provisions under section section six. I believe it's 227 to 228. Where it imposes constructed knowledge for assessing the risk that has occurred. Right below that, you will find with a portion of the bill talks about the actual knowledge of the prior acts. That's just logical. It's cominsensical. It imposes duties in a way that is fair. It's reasonable to require owners to have actual knowledge of prior acts, which would be established through many different ways. Documentation, police reports, formal complaints, however they may be filed or documented. The bill also allows for constructed knowledge, which of course is a lesser standard than actual knowledge as it relates to the risk of future harm that may be created. Think about our current premises liability standard as a policy question. If forcibility is the exclusive standard of negligence. Why would any entrepreneur, any investor, anyone that wanted to bring their capital, their resources to Georgia invest in a high crime area? Well the answer is they wouldn't. They never would. For example, Atlanta News First reported the story about an affordable housing complex in South Fulton County that is suffering from skyrocketing insurance premiums due to Georgia's vague premises liability laws. This complex has gone on, has gone to great lengths to try to protect its tenants and trying to protect its investment. And along with empowering regular regimens or excuse me, employing regular regimens and security guards. The complex has stalled over 100 cameras, spending $18,000 per month just to monitor the premises. And regardless of these efforts, their commercial insurance costs are roughly up 600% in two years. Just like any other cost, guess where that cost is going? It's getting passed on to the consumer. It's getting passed on to the tenant to live there. In the form of a court, of course, increased rent. Well, let's look at another example. How about an affordable apartment complex on Cleveland Avenue here close to downtown? At this location, the owner is known so far as employing a robotic security dog to help try and deter crime. When that complex opened a number of years ago, the owners of the complex were paying roughly $50 per unit for insurance coverage. Now, they're spending over $1500 per unit. Well, don't take it from me. Notwithstanding many of the folks that came and testified before you over the last several days, the last month in Atlanta City Councilman representing the City of South Fulton stated that Georgia's current laws are not only hurting businesses, but preventing vital resources such as grocery stores and affordable housing from expanding into his district. The councilman cited the negative effect that lawsuits have had and are having on local grocery stores and their inability to be able to operate because they can't get commercial insurance. Additionally, this committee also over the last several days has received some feedback about the landmark CDS case that I have alluded to as well as many other folks have alluded to as well. In that CDS-V car Michael suit, the one that's generally referred to the $42 million verdict, 95% of the blame was a portion to CDS or an after hours shooting in their parking lot with 0% of the fault being assigned an apportion to the one who had the gun, aimed at someone, pulled the trigger and shot them. They were assigned 0% of fault. This is a sad but yet firm reminder of why we have to rebalance and we have to have guardrails in the statutes that we pass so that others know whether it's juries following the law or businesses that want to make sure they're in compliance, have some stability and predictability going forward. In a comments were made about the dangerous environment around CDS and how the CDS verdict was justified and how passing the bill would completely disregard the impartial conscience of a jury. I'd like to ask this committee though, who creates the law? Is it random juries around the state in different venues with different fact patterns and different judges? Is it one Fulton County courtroom jury or is it us? Is it us? Do we have that responsibility? Of course we do. I want to point to you and read to you just a couple provisions from Justice McMillan's concurring opinion in the CVS case. You'll hear the court struggling in dealing with the very issue that I am describing for you and that which I'm asking us to fix. If the end you'll see who the Justice says needs to act. The majority's attempt to craft a standard that would require the existence of prior substantially similar crimes before imposing liability has the potential to increase the liability of proprietors, landlords and property owners for the criminal acts of third parties and will most certainly result in more cases going to trial with a concomitant burden of attorney's fees and cost and loss of time and other resources and litigation. Further, another quote. In other words, the way that Georgia courts have interpreted the reasonably foreseeable close quote exception with all that swallow the general rule that a proprietor has no duty to protect and vites from third party criminal acts. Because essentially any circumstance would be sufficient to create a jury issue as to reasonable foreseeability and a proprietor's duty. Another quote. To what extent and under what circumstances proprietors should be held for third party criminal acts are decisions best left to legislatures, which can consider the policy and practical implications, especially in high crime areas of increasing such liability and the cost of doing business. Let's take another look at a concurrence from Justice LaGrua and Justice McMillan and Justice Colby joining in this quote. These cases present a challenging issue regarding the scope of a proprietor's liability to invite ease when the criminal conduct of a third party causes injuries to set invite ease. I write separately because I'm concerned about the impact of these laws will have on those who reside in such quote high crime areas close quote and who could face the harsh and mounting reality that businesses faced with an increased exposure to liability because of the very area in which they have chosen to do business. We'll cease operations or raise their prices to offset the cost of additional security measures. I would urge the general assembly to consider these issues as they institute laws imposing premises liability on businesses in this state. And finally the majority opinion itself says in rendering our decision we are mindful of the economic and policy arguments advanced by the parties. But such considerations are reserved to the general assembly. This court is bound by what the law is and not what the parties or members of this court think it should be. Members of the committee I believe that the opinions of the highest court in our state highlight the concern that we all should share regarding the pitfalls of our current system if we as a legislature do not act. When we talk now about section six and specifically as it came to be discussed in the sex trafficking contact. This committee heard countless testimony surrounding the evils and tragic circumstances of what or the horrific circumstances that flow from human and sex trafficking. It's been said that the provisions of sp68 will enable or involve them the act of sex traffickers and the actions of sex traffickers across the state. This tragic testimony from victims is actually why we passed O C G A 51 156 in 2021 which fundamentally mirrors the federal trafficking victims protection reauthorization act the federal act of 2003. Current Georgia law already has specialized specialized remedy for these horrific acts and that's why the Senate substitute specifically referenced this code section to make sure that it was clear that nothing about Senate bill 68 in any way should would or could operate to impair the victims of sex trafficking from being able to pursue whatever remedies they chose under Senate bill 68. Because 51 156 holds those who quote knowingly benefit financially or by receiving anything of value close quote from sex trafficking. It includes hoteliers who turn a blind eye to this activity on their property. That was in many respect at the heart of what we heard from some of the very compelling witness testimony. The bill does not require the hotel or hotelier to be a co-conspirator for liability to attach or for there to be a recovery. I believe the bill before you today clearly emphasizes that the intention of sp68 is not to harbor enable or turn a blind eye in any regard to such this rotesque activity and conduct. I have to add to this and remind my fellow legislators and many of you have been here for quite some time and most all at least for six years that the governor camp and first lady Marty camp have champion protections for sex trafficking victims. Let's take a moment and look at what our first lady has done during her tenuous first lady just in this area alone. She has aid suggested or worked to author and passed nine different bills involving sex trafficking and to stop the horrific behavior of human trafficking. Senate bill 158 and the quote anti human trafficking protection response act. Senate bill 430 that was in 2019. Senate bill 435 in 2020 the quote survivors first act close quote and on and on House bill 823 in 2020 House bill 911 in 2020. Senate bill 333 in 2021 Senate bill 34 in 2021 Senate bill 461 in 22 Senate bill 42 in 2023 Senate bill 370 in 2024 and pending this year as she continues to fight for people that are the victims that were talking about in this particular section. Senate bill 42 as Marty camp our first lady continues to fight for this. So yes it does cause one to bristle when there's been suggestion from people that somehow a bill authored by governor Brian camp. It was married to Marty camp would suggest or certainly offer or put his name on a bill that would do anything to reduce the recovery and remedies available to sex traffic victims and human traffic victims. But don't take my word for it. I want to read to you a filing submitted to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia that came across my desk. This filing sign by a member of the bar. And of course there are obligations on us bar members when we sign a pleading to make sure that it meets minimal requirements for candor and truthfulness. Quote fortunately Georgia has followed the federal government's lead in recognizing that actors other than the actual traffickers and johns were participating in promoting facilitating and benefiting from the selling of sex and sex trafficking through the passing of Senate bill 33. With a passage of Senate bill 33 now codified as OCGA 51156 Georgia now joins those states in providing trafficking victims the option to pursue civil suits. Again, those are not my words. That is a quote from a complaint in a lawsuit filed in federal court authored by one of the members of this very subcommittee. While this case is ongoing the complaint says it's better. The complaint says it better than really I ever could. Georgia has strong protections for trafficking victims and it allows them to recover for their injuries and to punish the bad actors involved. Senate bill 68 does nothing to limit that recovery. Additionally, the substitute bill further addresses any concerns in this area. I also want to address the argument regarding the definition of quote negligent security as has been argued or suggested to encompass claims against employees or agents such as those that we heard about from the case against the YMCA. I want to be clear this bill does not preclude a prohibit any of those claims filed by the presenter who testified very sympathetically, very passionately and very understandingably before this committee. But that witness that presenter successfully brought claims regarding and under counts of federal sex crimes, state sex crimes, state negligent hiring, state failure to warn, state negligent security and punitive damages. Out of all of these claims only one of those calls of the vaccine was addressed in the bill and that is of course the negligent security one. Further, we talked about nuisance and we heard about some discussions of that and the lawyers spoke about it as well. With regard to the nuisance claim argument brought up in the testimonies, negligent security does not preclude nuisance claims. Nucense claims however are not designed, the remedy personal injury claims and bringing a personal injury claim such as a nuisance claim is just repackaging a personal injury claim by a different name. That's why lines 181 includes nuisance claims, not to block true nuisance claims but to ensure that attorneys cannot creatively plead their way around the standards within Senate Bill 68. I get it, we've been here a long time talking about a multi-page bill, it's got eight sections, it's complex. But what we have done is an attempt to codify a body of law and introduce a workable framework to provide stability to businesses and consumers while ensuring fair compensation to those that have been wrong. The notion that restaurants and housing providers and other businesses will simply somehow stop providing security if SB 6.80's past is off base or really more absurd. The vast majority of businesses have to operate well to stay in business and they are protecting their customers and their employees. But what they're also asking for is clear and reliable standards in order to serve their communities and their businesses and their patrons and their customers without the threat of lawsuits being filed for actions of a third party that are largely beyond their control. I'm going to move now to section 7 of the bill and talk a little bit about banning damages. I believe it's originally online 363 section 7 addresses truth and medical damages providing transparency to jurors in evaluating their damages. Section 7 was amended in a Senate from what was originally dropped as the governor's bill so that the jury can now see both numbers. The basic argument was the plaintiffs were saying wait a minute the jury ought to only see the rack rate, the retail rate, the hospital even though it may be a multiple of what the actual reimbursement about needed to go to the plaintiff is. Of course those that are seeking some relief were saying wait a minute shouldn't it be the actual number? We're talking about a concept of reimbursement what needs to be paid to the plaintiff so that they are reimbursed it's part of the special damages analysis that we talked about. They need to get and should be paid every dollar if liability attaches every dollar necessary to make them whole but not a dollar more than that. What you see here is a compromise again that says let both numbers go to the jury and then it's up to the lawyers to with their process both sides let one let them try to convince the jury which is the correct number. There were some suggestions of misinformed or misguided witnesses that even wanted to talk about this is going to limit the amount of damages but nothing in the bill is a cap on the medical damages or restriction of what the plaintiff can recover. Section 7 allows the jury to see the court rack rate as we talked about but again I want to remind you nothing about the analysis of what we're talking about at all touches upon the non economic damages that is the pain and suffering none of that is addressed confined modified or touched by this bill. We also heard testimony depicting how 68 provides an unfair benefit to those without insurance and that a defendant would somehow get some sort of undue windfall and we heard we heard arguments that strained common sense even made by some of the lawyers has to say well it's okay for the preventive.

be paid more than they actually ought to be paid because, well, they've got to pay a lawyer. They're not being made whole because of attorney's fee. That's an entirely different issue. That's dealt with another areas of the code. But I do want to raise a few points. I want to remind the committee that the purpose of special damages, as I said, is because they are specific, because they are calculable to a particular amount. They are there to address what ought to be the correct reimbursement amount. Second, just like all of us, I suppose, when I purchased my insurance, I did so that in the event that I had a medical issue, I would be protected from the financial burden that that may produce on me. And it would at a minimum, hopefully at least reduce that obligation. So why are we all of a sudden pretending as though a person, any of us, whom that may be, purchased insurance is getting no benefit for what they pay for until a lawsuit occurs. It just doesn't make sense, does it? Well, of course not. Because we acquire or procure that insurance and we enjoy and expect the protection that it provides during the course of that policy. But regardless of any benefits conferred by the presence of insurance or lack of insurance, is it not reasonable for the jury to have both amounts so that they get a full picture and can make a proper assessment? Ultimately, the provisions of Section 7 allows the jury to consider all of the relevant evidence. So we trust our verdicts. So why is there so much opposition to simply telling the jury the truth about the evidence? Seems to me it makes sense in the world they ought to have all of that. And then Mr. Chairman, Section 8, the last section of the bill involving bifurcation. You know, some of the claims that have been made about trial bifurcation, I want to remind everyone that bifurcation has always been in there. But it's been optional. It's not been one that the parties could elect to employ and ask that in fact the case be tried by bifurcation. This provision simply that's in Section 8 of Senate Bill 68 gives an option to attorneys in specific situations. In a medical malpractice case for wrongful death, for example, a defense lawyer might want to bifurcate the trial because the liability portion is complex and almost entirely based on the testimony of experts and medical practitioners and testimony from the members of the disease family is unnecessary to prove the liability section. But many have shared concerns about the victims testifying multiple times in a bifurcated trial. And generally, it would be unlikely for lawyers on either side to want to press a victim of a traumatic injury multiple times. Regardless, the substitute that I understand is that's before you today addresses this issue by allowing some discretion in this regard. And by the way, this is not a groundbreaking concept, this idea of bifurcation in civil procedure. North Carolina currently bifurcates any case with alleged damages over $150,000. This reasonable change is not crazy or as out of sorts as some folks have done before you'd suggested. Then I want to address some comments about this Florida insurance report and I want to briefly talk about what's happening in Florida. So the testimony provided did a great job highlighting the stark differences between Georgia and Florida and how a headline from a Miami Herald is being incorrectly interpreted. There are key differences between Florida's insurance market and our insurance market that have been lost in the name of the claim of fraud. First, the investigation has stated by the Florida speaker is about domestic insurers in Florida writing homeowners policies. These are not the type of policies that the businesses in Georgia are begging for a fair opportunity to defend themselves from frivolous claims. But there's another reason that we should not give credence to the notion that the insurance companies that have provided the information upon which we have relied is somehow part of a problem or that they are lying about it. And the answer is House Bill 1114. The reason that I'm confident that the insurance companies are not lying about the scope of the problem is the legislation that we all passed last year. House Bill 1114 focused on the claims level data, claims level data. That's not how Florida did their analysis. But we did it here by focusing on the claims level data connected by the office, excuse me, collected by John King's office of the Office of Insurance Commission or through their examination process. And House Bill 111 collected data independently and that data was then analyzed independently. House Bill 114 has the accountability measures built into it, including detailing this legislation's effect in future rate filings. The governor's office made sure that accountability and independently verifiable data was present before we started this process. I know many that were looking for and hoping for some port reform in 2024 were a bit disappointed that this was going to be postponed for a year. But the wisdom and value of that, I think, is seen in the governor's very thoughtful approach and offering House Bill 1114 that then allowed for the data to be collected so that it informed the bill that you have before you now for consideration. That effort along with numerous negotiations ultimately concludes in where we are here. I want to, just about done, Mr. Chairman, I want to mention something about how there's been a reference to insurance companies and it in discussing it, we seem to have lost side of the fact that insurance companies in some respects are like many other businesses, some would say it's like any other business. You have your cost inputs, you have the revenue that's derived from the sale of whatever the product is, and then you have a resulting profit. But for those cost inputs, what is beyond question is that the overall litigation cost are rising, that the frequency of litigation is increasing, and that the competition in the insurance marketplace is fleeting. The cost of litigation is just like any other cost for business, it's ultimately passed on to the customer. The last thing I'll share a little story when I first started working on 1114, which was the governor's bill I carried it last year, in a conversation I had with John King about how his office oversees insurance companies and insurance market in Georgia, and of course we're going all that, that's very specific and beyond what's necessary for here and we don't have a time board anyway. But I asked John about Commissioner King, about businesses coming into Georgia, those that want to be here, those that are leaving, those that want to leave, those that are reducing the amount of their business exposure here, those that are making decisions to not renew policies, those that are putting more exclusions into their policies. But specifically asked to new companies that would come to Georgia, I asked the question, what do those metrics look like? And the one he said to me that really caught my ear and puzzled me at first was this, he said, well, one of the things we look at is to make sure that they're not pricing their products too low. So Commissioner, why would we care that they're pricing their products too low? I mean, Georgia's get a cheaper insurance premium, right? He said, yeah, but we want insurance companies to be financially healthy and here for long haul so they are able to pay the claims. And if a company comes into Georgia underpriced their product and then can't sustain the payments of legitimate claims that are made, that ain't good for Georgians, is it? I said, no, sir, it's not. Just hadn't quite thought of it in that exact way. Mr. Chairman, Georgians from all across the state have come to us asking for some reform. We've heard testimony from hospitals, business owners, truck drivers, people that work in those industries, attorneys and more that just want to run their business, they want to provide for their families, they want to live their lives without the unnecessary worry of losing everything they've worked for because of an unfair treatment and a civil justice system. This bill has worked its way through the legislative process and as it continues to do that, I wouldn't encourage this committee to not forget about the hundreds and hundreds of faces and people who came each with their own story and their background, who stood on the steps here inside the capital when this bill was announced. They weren't here for politics, they weren't here for greed, they were just here for some relief. They were here because they were asking you and me for the vital and urgent support that they sent us into this building to provide. We owe each of them a duty to act. I would ask for your favorable consideration. In our governor, our lieutenant governor, our speaker have all been very clear since the bill is introduced. Our aim is to craft a bill to provide relief while preserving the opportunity for plaintiffs to have their full day in court. If you carefully consider the language of SB68 and go through the exercise of applying it to the actual language of this bill, not just cherry picking words and trying to get wrapped around the axle with things that aren't found in the bill, it's my hope that this committee will see this bill simply for what it is. It's a thoughtful approach intended to balance our civil justice system. We've heard the testimony and I hope one thing is shined through that the fact patterns of the events presented to this committee meet the standard to try a case under our current law. I want to assure the members of this committee that under the provisions of Senate Bill 68, these cases, of course, can be brought. They'll be heard and those that have been wrong will be fairly compensated. Chairman, I think I'll stop there. I'm at your subject, your direction. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. I've got some lights blinking. The concern I have is we've got about 30 minutes and we're going to get kicked out of here and I've got a sub I want to go through and some amendments we need to consider. And we keep the questions very short. Okay. Representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Pro Temp for the 40 minutes of commentary today. I have just two questions very short. The first one is a two-part question. Yes or no, some of the data that you were referring to from the insurance industry that you said verified the concerns was part of that the King report from Commissioner King. Yes. Some from the King report and some from others that we spoke with at the office of the insurance commissioner. Yes. And are you aware that the first page of that report says the contractor who prepared it did not independently verify the insurers data and did not perform any verification procedures to determine the completeness of the data provided by the insurers. Therefore the contractor makes no representations regarding the accuracy and integrity of the data and information submitted by the insurers. I would expect that language to be there. If you think about the model what was unique and the reason we had to pass H. Bill 1114 in the first place was that we were seeking data and information from insurance companies that is not readily available or publicly available and that which they thought was proprietary and private to them. So the contractor who sought the information and got it from the very sources there is no way to back check that. There is no concern that we couldn't check what we were being told and we just accepted that face value. Well first of all the model is set so that they were getting proprietary information. There is not yet another source behind that to go to. We were getting the proprietary information number one. Number two if you have some reason to mistrust that this would be the first I have heard of that. Of all the time we spent thinking about this bill and all the questions you have asked about the Office of the Insurance Commissioner you have never suggested that to be the case. So this would be an entirely new area of concern that I am hearing for the first time from you or anybody else. Well in fairness it has been a concern I have had for a while and my ability to ask you questions has been truncated. My last question as you mentioned in your closing comments there that the business community came here and they stood on the stairs with Governor Kemp not in greed. I want to make sure you didn't mean to suggest that any of the probably hundreds at this point of victims that have come here to share their stories. You are not meaning to suggest to this committee that those victims were here for greed where you. Well I am suggesting is just what I stated which is to address the issue that many have suggested that this is all about insurance company greed or big business greed or Georgia business greed and that is not why they came here. They came here because their businesses are closing. They can't afford the insurance premium. They can't get doctors into the state. We heard doctors come testify to that. So that is what I am talking about is to address I think a misplaced narrative. I will be kind and call it a very misplaced narrative by some and suggesting that is what is going on and that is what is driving the Senate Bill 68. Will you understand that certain people have accused the victims of that too and I just want you to stay on the record here. You do not believe that the victims were here in greed. Do you, Senator? I don't think they were, do I think they came to testify in greed? No, I don't think the victims came to testify in greed. Thank you. No, in fact I think most of them had already had their case in the end court. Exactly. They have nothing to gain or lose from this like many of the business community and insurance witnesses that we heard. Thank you. Well, no, that is not a fair way to end that because again, the reason I made that statement is because of the false narrative that is being put out there that some of the businesses are here just for greed. That is not the case. It is about the existence of being able to maintain a business and it is about folks hardworking Georgians that are trying to make ends meet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Senator Pro Tem. I did have a question about the Negologant Security portion of the bill. You described the underlying concept of pinning down what would be reasonably foreseeable for a business and that is what you are endeavoring to do as it relates to third party criminal acts in the way that this language is drafted. Do I have you correct? That's not all of it, but I just talked about that part. Yes, that part. Yes. I think that's fair. Yes. The question is, once you, and I am not going to get into all of the layers of what would make something reasonably foreseeable, but let's say a property owner has specific information that there is a serial rapist hitting apartment complexes, you know, coming down the street that that particular hotel or apartment complex is on, would in let's say for example that that serial rapist hits that the owner's apartment complex in assaults one of the residents. Would there still be a requirement, despite that very specific knowledge, just go with me with this hypothetical, that the crime be the result of a physical condition? So is it knowledge to the down to the owner has to know it down to the identity the time and the place that the crime could happen? And there has to be a physical condition that is the reason why the crime happened? Madam Representative, I think we started analyzing, at least what I heard was sort of one portion of the bill and you have brought in other portions of the bill into that discussion and that analysis and quite frankly, I don't think I can answer that question. Let me, let me face it better. Let me face it better. Let me face it better. We walk through the hole. Let me, let me face it better. So the idea is that the landowner has to be on notice or the crime has to be foreseeable. Correct? You're speaking of current law or as proposed? Both. Well, as, as I've said, and I think we agree for see the, the crux of how the cases are being focused on now, the guardrails is foreseeability. I understand. But also in your bill, you attempt to define and tailor what would be considered foreseeable for an owner. Is that true? In part. Yes. In, okay. If you can direct me to a line, I'm happy to look at it. Sure. I'm referring to, let's see if I have the, I don't know if it'll be yours. If your lines are the same as the sub, we just got, my sub does not have numbers on it. Okay, let's go here. If we start at 224, we start talking about what is reasonable foreseeable. Do you see that? Yeah, let me get, excuse me. It's subsection one. You said 224? Yes, in the sub. Okay. Okay. And do you see where there's a discussion about what, what is defined as reasonably foreseeable for the owner or occupier? I'm, I'm sorry, I'm trying to, these are new line designations for me and I'm trying to look at my materials and correlate that to 20 or, you have the new sub. I think I do, Mr. Chairman, is it 492355S? Yes, is that the sub, okay? No, sir, no, do you have that, my, do you have the sub? Yeah, I'm sorry, my working notes are, you know, what I've worked with. So it's line 224. Yes, on the sub page 10. Page 10. Yes, sir. Okay. Mr. Chairman, can you tell me if this section was changed? There is, there are some changes in the sub. Does it apply to this section? It would apply to this section. Okay. It was, but the physical condition paragraph is three and that, there were no changes in that paragraph. And the FB is where there were some changes made. And I gather the latest question is primarily to the presence of the physical condition. Yes, sir, in addition to, so I'm trying to understand if, if the owner or occupier manages to have the level of mens rea or knowledge that you have detailed in lines 224 through I guess it goes to 240. Does the, and if the crime happens, they know all the things that you list out that they should know. Let's assume that is true. Okay, they have the knowledge. I'm sorry, can you say that again? No, I'm assuming the knowledge is there. It can be met. Assume that the knowledge that you have laid out, the standards that you have laid out that would satisfy, reasonable for seeability for the owner. And that is met. Okay. Crime happens. Would the injured victim still have to show, in addition to the fact that the owner had the knowledge that the incident was a result of someone exploiting a specific physical condition? I'm looking for that physical condition language within this. Can you point me to that line? Yes, sir. It may speed things up. Yes, sir. It's line 242. It starts at line 241 of the sub. So I think the answer to the question is, section 51351, which begins with paragraph 4N1 and goes through 5. Those are all conditions. And, right? Because of AND, it's found at the end of paragraph 4. So if the owner has this high level of knowledge as is detailed in the sub, and the incident that they have that knowledge occurs on the property, but it doesn't happen as a result of a physical condition, whatever that may be. The owner, occupier, could not be held responsible despite their knowledge? Well, if what you're saying, I think I know what your question is, if we're going to base this, when you talk about knowledge, then you're circling back to the fundamental of foreseeability. And if we're going to say that that is the only requirement, no, we are trying to put additional parameters and guardrails on when someone is responsible, legally liable, for negligent security. And if it's foreseeability alone, that's not enough. It requires these additional provisions. Thank you. One more question, Mr. Chairman. Let's do it quickly, because I'm running out of time. Real quick. Stand on the same topic. So when you say physical condition, is it the presence of a physical condition or the absence of a physical condition? Well, it's not me saying physical condition. You're a irreversible. I'm talking about your bill. Right. So when you say in lines 241 to 242, exploiting a specific physical condition of the premises, is it a physical condition that exists or a physical condition that doesn't exist? So for example, if it exists, it's a broken gate. If it doesn't exist, there's no gate. I'm trying to understand it. I don't think it's limited to. And I know that's been part of the discussion topic of a specific, like a broken lock, some issue like that. But I think we're looking at it too narrowly in that regard, because it's not just one specific item. It can be looking at the circumstances that create the physical condition that the plaintiff is alleging. Can you give me an example of a physical condition that you have in your mind? That would depend on the circumstance of the... That would depend upon the location. That would depend upon what's there. That would depend upon what's not there. It would depend upon the surrounding area. It would depend upon the people that are there. So I don't want to try to answer your question, but I don't want to play games in trying to start mentioning things that are... It's based on some hypothetical in my head that's different from what you would have. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I will respect the Chairman's desire, even though I have more questions. Thank you. The Chair greatly appreciates the ladies' anticipation, the Chair's wishes. I got two more questions. Chairman Newton, I think... Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll try to be brief. I appreciate your explanation of collateral source or just trying to get the truth to the juries. One of the most eloquent letters we've gotten from it, we've gotten obviously a lot of the emails about this, hundreds, four hundreds against, dozens against. One of the most best arguments was something that we should... In collateral source, we should allow information about leans, and I know it talks about letters of protection. And then the second thing was... What about the... What do we use as evidence of what an average reimbursement or a fair price was? And just to read off of that, two things. On leans, I think two years ago, we prohibited a healthcare provider to follow leans unless they've already filed the insurance and been turned down. And most healthcare providers do take health insurance. I know somebody who's called... Another opponent of the bill has called them bad actors who get those that just establish an entity just to take personal injury cases and come up with a whole new price list. But the specific that was asked in this defense attorneys who opposes the law, he said, we should have an evidence of average reimbursement rate accepted by medical provider for full reimbursement in non-litigation cases. Isn't that really what we're trying to get to with the jury? There's a list price number and then there's the amount to fully reimburse and get a paid and full stamp on a bill. Yes, sir. That's exactly what it is. Because again, going back to the thought flow is it's an item of special damages, which is specific for which if there's liability, we want to reimburse fully the plaintiff. And so they get every dollar of that reimbursement, not a dollar more, not a dollar less. And so that amount in your example, yes, would be that, which was necessary to pay for the insurance company to pay or whoever the pay or was to pay the medical provider. Exactly would be those two weeks, it wouldn't be three months. Yes. Thank you for letting the jury know both numbers. I think your compromise was a good one to let them know that list price, but also to let them know the amount to get paid and full. I think that was a good start. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Williams, you have a question? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It would be the last one. Thank you, Senator. Yes, sir. I've got a question kind of tied into two. I haven't gotten it straight. I just need it straight and for me. I'm trying to figure out still how we can 11 straight years be ranked. Number one to do business in and a hellhole state for insurance. It's kind of an optimal one. That's the first part. The second part is everywhere I've researched the top seven states that are referred to as hellhole states. Georgia is never mentioned. Can you tell me how do you reach this information and where can I find? Because when I look at Search Magazine, what big companies are looking for, the panthers toy. After 25 years in economic development, I've never had a company deny me and Georgia because I'm toyed. Straighten this out for me, please. Sure. Thank you, great question. As to the last comment that you made, you've been in the business of economic development. More so than me. I have done it a small amount in a few very limited roles. I will tell you with increasing frequency and with increasing severity, companies are talking about the problem with the civil-torch system in Georgia and being a reason that Georgia is not as attractive or something of concern. Let's further look at it. That's going to depend on what kind of business. Right?

because some businesses are going to be more subject to or potentially victimized if you will by our toward system. Some would remain largely untouched by that. So I would say that for number one, number two. The two metrics we're talking about are different in that those metrics as I understand those markers to determine how one gets to be number one state in which to do business are not the same metrics and markers as used to determine how or where one is on the ranking of 50 states of the judicial hellhole list. So we're talking about not entirely different metrics but they're not the same. So that's how they can exist at the same time. And with regards to the publication, I'll be happy to sort of get that looked up. I think it's the American tort reform association. I think is the entity or the publication. Sure. Yeah. That's like Santa Claus like Christmas. Well, well, that would be the case but the problem is if we had 50 Santa clauses, that might make sense. But the problem is there's no reason to believe that they're going to want to ding Georgia more than any of the other states. So it's not saying they're not independently saying y'all got it bad in Georgia. They're saying y'all have it the worst of the 50 states and that's why at the top of my comments, I made the point that regardless of what the metrics used used for that, we're the worst of the 50. And so that's the wake up call. Last thing I'll say to answer the question is to your point, I fully agree with you. Even though the metrics are different for the two, I would agree with you that we can't remain at the top of those lists, both of those lists for very long. We can't because the two are so inconsistent with our ability to continue to track business if we do have that problem. But again, admittedly, it would depend upon exactly what kind of businesses that would be subject to the imbalance in the civil justice system. Yes, sir. All right, thank you. All right, thank you everybody. And thank you, Senator Kennedy, for your time and effort. And I appreciate everybody with their attention to the issue. And I know some of you wanted to follow up and you did not my request. And I greatly appreciate that. I've got about 10 minutes to thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to members of the committee. Thank you, Senator. So I have a sub that I've given distributed to the members of the committee. What I'd like to do is go over it and just explain where it differs from the as passed bill out of the Senate. And then I think, Representative Evans has some amendments to that we'll consider. And I actually have three little cleanup ones that I want to put. I will request the committee consider. So just going through the sub, it's LC 492355S. So if you want, this is basically Senate bill it's a 68, but it's got the following changes. So if you turn to page three on line 42, at the very top of the page there, the phrase, the issue of damages has been inserted. And then the paragraph two there from lines 45 to 50 is new. That basically clarifies that while you cannot argue non-economic damages until closing, you can argue it in both your, when you have a closing, you have an opening and a concluding argument. So you can argue it in both of those, as long as you argue it in the first and your argument has to be consistent between the first and the second closing. Also paragraph E, lines 55 through 58 were also added. And that is just saying that in Vordire, that's the portion of a lawsuit where you're questioning people who could be on the jury to determine whether they are inclined one way or the other. You can ask them if they could return a defense verdict if the evidence demanded it, or if they could return a plaintiffs verdict in excess of some amount if the evidence supports it. So the idea is, I just have got some feedback from Trollers, that's a question you like to ask in Vordire to make sure someone's not predisposed one way or the other. And so we try to make it clear as long as you don't throw out a specific amount, you can still ask that question. In section two, there are some changes on page five. At the top of the page in line 93, they are right before, after the provided in this paragraph, was stricken, that was stricken in the old bill too, the phrase of the filing of such motion appeared. So the 90 days ran from the filing of the motion, when I was just changing that to say it's 90 days from the conclusion of the briefing on the motions of the court as a chance to at least consider the briefs. And we added a same change on lines 97 and 98. It's within 90 days following the conclusion of the briefing. We also added in lines 101, to 102, a phrase at the end of the that sentence just saying that the remedy of the court to modify the state doesn't preclude any other remedy available if the court does not timely rule on the motion, such as a red mandamus. So it's trying to make it clear that if the court doesn't rule, you're not limited just to ask in the court again to modify the state. The next change is on page six, in line 121, that line did read the 60th day, so this is when you can voluntarily dismiss. It's staying at 60 days following the date that opposing party serves an answer, but it previously had read the 60th day following the date the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment, whichever occurs first. We've taken out the summary judgment, so that would not trigger that 60 days running. So it's just the end. And then we replaced all that phrase with just an answer there. Section four, there were no changes in section five, down at the bottom of page seven lines, 165 through 168. We added a phrase just to highlight the fact that the statute is being revised so that it is permissive. It is not mandatory. The statute, even as revised under Senate Bill 68, would not say that the evidence has to be admissible. It just can be admissible. If you notice on lines 161 and 164, the word may is used. That's not new. That was in the bill originally. So we added a phrase just to sort of make it clear that this paragraph provided, however, this is lines 165 through 168. This paragraph shall not prevent a court from determining the admissibility of such evidence, pursuant to code section 24443. That's sort of the balancing test, or any other statutory or common law rule of evidence. In other words, the court still is going to have to make a determination if the evidence is relevant in that particular case. In section six, in page eight, on lines 184 and 185, we have tried to narrow the scope of the definition of negligence security so that it does not catch some other claims that people were concerned it might impact. And actually, I do have an additional amendment to propose to that as well. But we deleted to keep persons or on or around any premises safe from wrongful conduct just to say keep the premises in good repair and safe from the wrongful conduct of good persons. And actually, we're going to, there's a concern that in good repair, might unduly impact land or tenants. So we're going to request a motion to amend that part as well. Then on page nine and lines 213 to 14, we changed the definition of third person so that it would, you know, it's basically defined as anybody except for the owner, occupier, or security contractor. We added to that any one under the direction control or supervision of an owner or occupier or security contractor to make it clear that injury from someone that's an employee of the owner is not covered by this. This is where it's sort of a complete stranger. Then on page 10, we made a number of changes. On line 227 at the beginning of that line right after the B, there was a clearing convincing evidence requirement that would have applied to all of the following three elements. The little Roman number one, two and three from lines 229 down to 238. We've stricken clearing convincing evidence on line 227 and then clarified on 230 and 233 that then the, when the owner occupier has to know that is actual knowledge. So we've added, had actual knowledge. And then on lines 235, 236 and 237, there we did put the clearing convincing standard so it would apply only to that third prong. If the owner occupier knew or should have known by clearing convincing evidence so it's just to the sort of imputed, not actual knowledge, but imputed knowledge or constructive knowledge that the third person was or could be on the premises and if the owner occupier had actual knowledge it said new previously there so we just made it clear that's an actual knowledge requirement. Then on page 12 and lines 276, 277, after the code section reference that's the civil cause of action for trafficking, the concern was if you just reference that code section you're not including some of the other ways in which those claims are brought. And so we added or any other applicable law or theory of recovery otherwise recognized by law including not limited to negligence and nuisance to make it clear that any kind of claim involving human trafficking is not limited or impacted by the statute or by the bill. And then I think our next change is section 8. So this is the bifurcation section. We tried to clarify on lines 420, this is on the page 18 now. Line 423, 424, that if you have a right to bifurcate and after the first trial they determine that the defendant is liable then we move into the compensatory damage phase and we just added towards immediately with the same judge and jury to make it clear that you don't take a recess for two months and come back and try to retry the case it's supposed to all just proceed one right after the other and we did the same thing with respect to the final, the punitive phase on 428 and 429 we added immediately with the same judge and jury. And then 434 to 441 we added a basically an exception two exceptions. If someone files the election the court can reject it or overrule it if the other party files a motion to request that the case not be bifurcated based on one of these causes here and the first one is the subparadural one begins on 437. The plan effort, the plan is legal guardian of a minor. The minor was injured by a alleged sexual offense and would be likely to suffer serious psychological or emotional distress as a result of testifying more than once in a bifurcated proceeding. That was to address some of the concerns that we heard from some of the witnesses and then number two is kind of a small case exception if the minor controversy is less than $150,000 so the idea there was just to to provide in cases where there's not as much in controversy you don't have to do bifurcation and so those are the changes on the substitute. No, I'm sorry. Okay, so what I would like to do, I want to next consider the proposed amendments but I'd like to I think properly put the substitute before the committee so the chair will entertain a motion to pass Senate Bill 68 by substitute LC 49 2355S. I have a motion, we have a second. All right, now representative, I believe you've got an amendment that you've distributed to us that you would like the committee to consider. I do and before I present it which I appreciate Mr. Chairman you calling on me. I do I do have three specific questions about your sub and also given that you have forecasted that you have a couple of amendments to it that could impact my amendments if we're following Robert's rules to a T we are only allowed to amend each section once and I put all my amendments into one at your request for speed and I just want to make sure that none of them if we consider smaller amendments to your sub that just some assurance that my amendments will not be called out of order. No, I don't intend to call yours out of order. I intend to vote. My amendments, if you know if the committee would like I can go ahead and describe what mine are. I don't think it's appropriate to I was going to let you go first with your amendments before I put mine but if you would like to know what mine are I'm glad to describe them to you. Up to you I'll do however you want you. I just wanted to make sure that my ability to move in amendment was preserved. Well why don't you go ahead with your amendment. Thank you Mr. Chairman. The amendment was passed out to all of you when you got here and it's again at the request of the Chairman I put these all into one and a lot of them are self-explanatory and I won't I'm going to try to be as brief as I can because I know that the hour is late but section one on anchoring simply seeks to clarify that advocates will still have the ability to argue non-economic damages. There's some confusion on my part in the current sub with the use of the word unspecified in board dire only allowing the attorney to talk about whether a jury a jury has any bias issue with issuing damages above an unspecified amount. That doesn't seem to help the ability to argue my amendment would take care of that problem. The amendment would also ensure that for a plane of who doesn't work outside of the home like I say at home mother that the value of that person's life could still be argued to the jury where I believe under the current sub it could not. Section two seeks to address the unlimited state issue we heard testimony and I will agree with Senator Kennedy on the fact that a motion to dismiss lingering for six years is certainly an outlier but a motion lingering one to three years is not and is typical and I'm really worried about the ability of evidence to be preserved for memories not to fade and for a plane of not to languish while they can't get their case moving to get the care that they need and that good claims will die on the vine simply because of time and so the amendment in section two would lift the stay after 120 days so you got 90 days under which we're saying by law and half said for a while that judges should act after 120 days to stay lifts but certainly the defendant could move to keep it on if they wanted to. Section three addresses voluntary dismissals under the sub party would only have 60 days after the start of discovery so 60 days after the answer to make a decision about whether they wanted to voluntarily dismiss their claim let's say they learned something in discovery they want to save everybody time and money and move on. 60 days is just in reality is just not enough time. Discovery opens you send you send in orogatories fancy word for questions for the non lawyers you get the party gets 30 days to answer typically the defendant will ask for an extension so let's just assume though that you don't you got 30 days to get your answers you get your answers usually the documents that support any answers sometime on a rolling basis after that you're certainly not going to have them in 30 days then that doesn't even give you the the fact of being able to have anybody under deposition so 60 days into discovery is nothing and the amendment in section three just says that the dismissal can happen anytime before the pre trial order is entered so it still wouldn't allow you to go up and dismiss the trial which would address the issue that we heard still address the issue that we heard section four has a small change on attorney's fees the amendment does to to say that the agreement can be offered the fee agreement can be offered as proof but is not conclusive just leaving some discretion there for fact finders section five addresses seat belts and I appreciate the work on the amendment in the sub from the chair but this tightens up a little bit more and make sure that we're only letting seat belts come in when it's relevant to the cause of the accident and also just making sure that we're not an outlier here mr chairman there's only three states in the whole country that allow anything near what is being proposed in the sub and that's California West Virginia and Louisiana so that's what section five does the amendment in section six seeks to address the negligent security case I want to talk about a couple of points here some of which chair lady Miller brought to life in questioning with senator Kennedy right now you could have the you you could meet the standard under the sub you could meet the standard of foreseeability that knife fights my breakout that there would be gunfire that there may be rape and still not have a claim because the rape the gunfire the knife fight didn't have anything to do with a defect in a physical condition no broken gate no busted out lights the amendment would make it so that you have that expectation and the business owners know what they need to do so that foreseeability has those guardrails that the Supreme Court seem to suggest and that witnesses have asked us for but you don't cut out a class of claims just because there's no defect in a physical condition so that's part of what amendment six does to I also want to note here I appreciate what the sub does in attempting to make an exception for victims of sex trafficking and making sure that their claims remain the amendment proposed in the package would certainly make sure that is true because you wouldn't be tied to this physical defect issue anymore and it's important that we have the amendment particularly in section six Mr. Chairman because despite what I am sure are great intentions in adding the language related to sex trafficking victims it is not going to help and I want to I want to be very specific here and if the if the members want to look at the sub with me quickly was looking at the track changes because it's easier but not even get my line numbers when the sub you would be talking about lines 275 277 that's right thank you Mr. Chairman so members of the committee can see online 275 and 279 the sub is attempting to limit application to two areas starting online 275 limiting application to sex trafficking cases on 279 attempting to limit or exclude contract cases the languages and how those two categories of causes of action are excluded are very different and it's very concerning and again I don't know no no dispersions here but when you say nothing in this code sections shall limit the ability of a claim to make a claim in nuisance trespass relating to negligence or nuisance related to a sex trafficking case that just means don't limit it more than you limit anyone else and a judge applying that is going to apply this new law if we pass the sub in 68 and it's not going to apply it any different it's not going to limit sex traffickers any more than it's going to limit anybody else and so that doesn't actually help the victims online 279 you can see if you were actually trying to carve them out you would do something you would have to do the same language that you have for carving out the contract claims that you will not that this article shall not be construed to limit or otherwise a claim and if the intent is to carve out the sex trafficking victims then you would need to use the same language that you use for the breach of contract claims so the amendment that I'm proposing would ensure that that's not an issue the other reason that the amendment that I'm proposing is important and I want to be clear this is a team effort putting these amendments together we combined them but I'm moving them the other reason that is important is while I also appreciate carving out sex trafficking victims I have a hard time looking at the mother of a rape victim who was raped in a stairwell I have a really hard time looking at the mother of a child who may have been their apartment may have been broken into and that little girl was raped in her bed she's not a sex trafficking victim the girl in the stairwell is not a sex trafficking victim but they are no less of victim and how do I look those mothers in the eye how do we as members of the subcommittee in this august body look them in the eye and say we value one more than the other so my amendment ensures that we're treating all victims equally and that's another reason why I believe it's important Mr. Chairman section seven seeks to address the unfairness that some of us believe occurs because of section seven that's the collateral source rule this amendment would just ensure that you're going to put the full bill in issue and if you if someone paid that for you you might be able to take that off but if it was paid for because of a contract that you paid to get the value of then you don't take it off the other reason that I believe the amendment in section seven is important and this was brought out during one of the hearings let's just let's forget the bill for a second trying to apply a collateral source to estimate the damages that a plane if you have insurance might have for future medicals is just too many hypotheticals to make it realistic in real life if you're going to take off the value of insurance you're assuming that insurance is going to cover it you're assuming that insurance is going to cover it at the same rate you're assuming that this person is going to be able to keep their insurance it's just too many assumptions and so that's another reason why the language that we are proposing in section seven of the amendments is important section eight on bifurcation is again an issue of fairness and efficiency let's don't bring victims twice let's also don't create confusion in how you can prove liability in phase one when you know to to nerd out on on a law school hypothetical for a minute you can't get liability unless you have a tort you can't get a tort unless you have damages so if we can't talk about damages until phase two that's a problem I appreciate the attempt to again carve out something for sex trafficking victims on bifurcation in section eight but again I would ask why just them why the mother of a sex trafficking victim not the not the victim or not her not the family of a victim of rape or some other sexual assault and why not the mother of a son who's been murdered why are we okay with asking her to come back twice I also think that the $150,000 limit there is just not going to help a lot of victims and also it's not going to help the efficiency of the court and with all appreciation or respect to the state that was mentioned that does that it's only one I've ever heard of and again I think the amendment in section eight is important for efficiency and fairness section nine is just related to the effective date the way that the current sub is written is that other than section six and seven this case this bill is going to go into effect immediately it specifically says the current sub says it's the intention of the general assembly that all provisions of this act other than the six and seven shall apply to causes of action pending as of the effective date so effectively you could have a case in the middle of discovery but with a motion to dismiss pending what happens you just halt you're you're going to upend and cause inefficiencies and something that's already moving what if you've got a trial started that's not bifurcated what happens what if you've got a jury out that has has heard non economic anchoring it's just it's not it's also not been the practice of this body since in the I think this would be my twelfth session we always try not to put our hand in pending litigation and this does that more than any bill I've ever seen in my life and so the amendment the proposed amendment in section nine is simply to say that the bill goes into effect upon signature or upon becoming law without signature of the governor but it does not apply to any cause of action that hasn't yet accrued as of that it doesn't apply to cases that where the cause of action has already accrued and that's just simply for the sanity of the court system I think in the litigants that are going to be in the middle of a lot of cases the last thing I'll say Mr. Chairman is again I put these in a package I'm at your request and was happy to do it for efficiency I do believe I would like to think that there's interest in all in all these amendments in in some way perhaps by others on this committee but I think particularly with respect to section two and maybe even more so with section nine there could be interest and so I would just say if there is such interest I would implore beg encourage my colleagues with an R by their name to perhaps introduce this separately and then I would be glad to remove those from my omnivus package that otherwise I move to you now Mr. Chairman. All right thank you Reps and Mevins thank you for consolidating that we're over on time that's sort of becoming my reputation I think so I appreciate you doing that so a conservative old time the lady has moved those amendments to LC 492355S basically the amendments set forth in the paper that we've distributed to the members I hear a motion to amend in that manner to hear a second I hear a second all right let's take a vote all those in favor of amending LC 492355S say well let's let's raise your hand you can say I at the same time too okay all right and then all those opposed no raise your hand that would be cycle those put the temple okay so the the motion to amend fails now I would like to make well I would like to propose some amendments I only got to move but there are three amendments and I asked Reps and Mevins to do her amendments in one motion so I'm going to do the same online 179 of this sub there is a phrase at the end there that was left over from an earlier draft and it was just brought to my attention so online 179 the the after the word means the comma through the end of that line except is provided in sub paragraph B of this paragraph comma would be deleted because their section sub section B is no longer an exception additionally on the same page online 184 toward the end of the line where the words in good repair and appear we would replace that with and approaches the idea is to remove the good repair reference to try to make it make it clear when I'm trying to impact anything of landlord tenant law so that line would be arises from an alleged failure to keep the premises and approaches safe from the law for conduct of third persons and then finally on line 275

Representative Evans, you got to me on that one. After the word limit, we would insert or otherwise affect so that that clause would have a similar sort of intro to the one that follows it. So the line 275 would read, nothing in this article should be construed to limit or otherwise affect with an A. Any cause of action brought pursuant? So, is there any questions about that? Those amendments? I do have one, Mr. Chairman. Sure. What is the rationale for treating victims of sex trafficking differently than other crime victims, including other crime victims of sexual crimes? Well, I think it's just because of the the promise we place upon sort of the uniqueness of their plight. So I think we're just trying to and the frankly, I'm just trying to listen to the overwhelming testimony we heard. Trying to be responsive, you know, I did try to listen and that's part of the reason for that change. Now in defense, the Senate already had the exception in there, but I heard some practitioners say, well, the way it's worded, it needs to be a little broader. And so we've tried to make it broader to address their concern. Chairman Neut. No, no, no, I'm sorry. He had healed. Oh, sorry. Tagged me before you. I like him. Sorry. Two things. I do think just in response to the ladies coming about. I do believe there's signs posted in almost every medical facility regarding sex trafficking. I do think it's gotten, as you say, some special attention by this body because of its growth and its importance. Secondly, on line 438 of the sub, it does, it kind of takes another point at which there was some concern, which was other sexual offenses, this regards bifurcation of the recognition that testifying twice in those particular situations with minors or with sexual offense, whether sex trafficking or not. I believe this, this line 438 would include any sexual offense, not just sex trafficking, is that correct? Yes. Thank you, sir. Representative Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, really quickly. I'm just going to address one point, and that is what my colleague, Chairman Neut and just addressed, and that's line 438. To echo my colleague, Representative Evans' point, I do think the intent here is very good, and I do appreciate this carve out. I would just suggest that perhaps we strike by an alleged sexual offense and just leave it for any injured plaintiff, and here's why. There are cases, for example, a case in my experience where there was an awful car accident where an impaired driver caused a multi-death crash to include several young children. In the backseat of one of the surviving plaintiffs was her child who was severed in half by a seat belt. There are other cases that involve horrific tragedies and awful cases of victimization, I think, where requiring a plaintiff to testify over and over again, the juiced is simply not worth the squeeze. I think if we could just carve out any victim who would be likely to suffer serious psychological or emotional distress and give the plaintiff or the victim the opportunity to show that this would be, I think this would be a tighter and I think cleaner and more justifiable way to really get at what this section is trying to get at, and that is not retraumatizing victims who have suffered greatly who are innocent through no fall to their own. So I'm inclined not to allow that amendment because I would like to have a vote on the other amendment that I've solicited first, and I'm concerned that doing that would expand that exception to the point where it could swallow the rule. So I'd like to go ahead and request a motion on the amendments that I proposed as one amendment. Those are the three things to line 179, 184 and 275 first. I have a motion to have a second. So we've got a motion to make that the three amendments that I described earlier in a second. I'll go ahead and just call the question. All those in favor of that amendment signify by saying aye. All those opposed, no. All right, so that amendment carries. So now we have the substitute LC 4923 55s as amended. I think we've got the amendment effective. I've got the motion in second. So I will now call the question on recommending to the full committee that I do pass recommendation for LC 4923 55s as amended. Is that correct? Raise the motion. Right, so we've got you. So we'll have to get a new LC generated for the rules committee meeting, but for our purposes now that's I think that's the proper phrasing of the motion. So I have a motion second. Okay, so I got the motion in second. All those in favor signify by saying aye. All those opposed, no. Why don't we raise hands with the count all in favor? And those opposed? I have it. Right, the motion passes. All right, I think that concludes our business for today. I'm turning the room over to Chairman Parrish about 20 minutes late. So back everybody for your attention. That's the members of the committee. I don't know. I hope so. We've got a rules committee generated.
