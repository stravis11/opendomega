you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you them Rabbi, also known as Darshan Neet, Dr. Miriam Udel, is an associate professor of German studies and the Judith London Evans Director of the Tam Institute of Jewish Studies at Emory University, where her teaching focuses on modern Jewish literature and culture, and occasionally rabbinic literature. She holds an A B in near Eastern languages and civilizations, and a PhD in comparative literature, both from Harvard University. She was ordained in 2019 as part of the first cohort of executive ordination track at Yashivat, Mahharat in New York, a residency program designed to bring qualified mid-career women into the Orthodox Jewish Rabbinate. She uses the rabbinic title Darshan Neet, which means interpreter of texts, but will cheerfully answer to Rabbi. Rabbi Darshan Neet Udel is the winner of the 2017 National Jewish Book Award in modern Jewish thought and experience. She is the editor and translator of Honey on the Page, a Treasury of Yiddish Children's Literature, winner of the Judeaica reference award from the Association of Jewish Libraries. Her translation of Yiddish Children's Literature has served as the basis for a radio play and a puppet film released by theater Emory. Recipient of an NEH public scholar grant, Rabbi Udel is completing a book about how children's literature can help us understand the modern Jewish experience. I give to you, Rabbi Darshan Neet, Dr. Miriam Udel. For the little bit of history that we are making here together today, I would like to thank Representative Panich and Speaker Burns and all who are in attendance, including my husband, Dr. Adam Zachary Newton and our son Immanuel, who has missed PE, which is the most fun part of the first grade morning, and who is generally supportive of his rabbinic mommy, but was disappointed to learn that Chaplin of the Day has nothing to do with Charlie Chaplin. In the same breath, I want to thank the one above who in the words of our traditional blessing for special occasions has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time. This coming Saturday, Jews the world will read about how God parted the Red Sea for the Israelites fleeing ancient Egypt. We will chant from the parchment of the Torah scroll a portion of the book of Exodus that stretches from the middle of the 13th chapter, where their round about desert itinerary is explained, to the end of the 17th wherein the people experience crippling thirst and asymmetric warfare. The climax of this Torah portion and the reason why we refer to this week as Shabbat Shira, the Sabbath of Song, is Exodus chapter 15, the poetic song at the sea, a hymn of thanksgiving with which the Israelites celebrate their safe passage across the dry ground that God has opened for them in the very heart of the fearsome waters. Through this miracle of miracles, over a million souls pass from enslavement to liberty, a story that echoes through the ages to our own time, and surely a moment worth singing about. The song's rhetoric soars in any language, but I invite you today to savor the taste of the original Hebrew.

La Donai, and Yom Rulemore, Ashira La Donai, Kiggaoggaa, Sus Verochvo, Ramavayan. Then Moses in the Israelites sang this song to God. They said, I sing to God who has triumphed gloriously. Horse and driver hurled into the sea. O Ziv Zimradia, Vahili Lishua, Zhe Eliva Anvehu, Elohe Avi, Vah Aroma Menhu. God is my strength and might and is become my deliverance. This is my God whom I glorify, the God of my ancestor whom I exalt. Lovely, right? Adversity and then triumphs. Chick-chuck, as they say in modern Hebrew. And now you can all get on with the business of the people of Georgia. Well, not so fast. Because the rabbis, I am here to tell you, are bothered. When I say rabbis, I mean the sages whose discussions are recorded in the Talmud, roughly between the third and seventh centuries. And when I say bothered, I mean that they were intrigued and curious about something that they regarded as not quite settled in the biblical text. Here's the problem. At the time of the Exodus, the Israelites have been enslaved for exactly 430 years. God has spoken with their patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and has been revealed to their matriarchs, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. But as the young people say, it's been a minute. God's presence in Egypt has been obscured to all but Moses and his brother Aaron. How can the rest of the Israelites proclaim with such confidence, this is my God. How do they know what their God even looks like? The rabbis feel their way toward an answer in the Talmudic tractate, Sota, which offers a set of interpretive stories, or midrashim, about how these Israelites managed to elude Pharaoh's genocidal decree that all baby boys be drowned in the Nile, how they managed to survive until they could thrive. Like so many good things in this world, it came down to the efforts of women. In the merit of the righteous women of that generation, says one Rabbi, the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt. The Talmudic passage goes on to describe how the enslaved women would bring their husbands lunch in the fields, and in an act of sacred seduction would entice them to enjoy, and I say this with no disrespect to this chamber, a very happy meal. Nine months later, these women would give birth in the fields beyond the surveillance of their overseers, at which point, having few other choices given the murderous decree, they would commend their newborn sons to the apple trees of the field for safekeeping. Fulfilling to the letter, Song of Songs, Chapter 8 verse 5, which reads, Tachar Hatapuach or Arthichah, under the apple tree I roused you. It was there that your mother conceived you, there that she who bore you conceived you. According to our Talmudic passage, God would then send an angel to clean the newborns and to gather for each child two suckling stones, one flowing with oil and the other with honey, thus fulfilling the word of Deuteronomy 32-13, and he would suckle them with honey from the rock and oil from a flinty rock. In cradle-like pits under the sheltering apple trees, a generation of vulnerable boys were nourished and protected, this story is so powerful and resonant that it was rewritten in the Eastern European Jewish fusion language of Yiddish and published in 1961. The modern version by Levin Kippness goes into rich detail in imagining how this system of nurture operated. You can close your eyes and picture it if you like, as I read. The apple trees cared for the tiny baby boys, the blades of grass kept them hidden and bright-eyed angels with clear wings flew down from the heavens and angel for each and every child. They stroked the children's little heads so that their hair grew very long, soft and silky and covered their whole bodies. They gave every child a pebble in each hand, one a milk stone and the other a honey stone. After that, they dug out holes near the roots of the apple tree and padded them with grass. As a mother makes a bed for her child, they laid the children in the holes. As a mother lays her child in the cradle, they sang heartfelt songs, as a mother lulls her child to sleep. The great God, whom the Israelites would hail in their song at the sea, as a powerful man of war, acts in concert with the angels and the natural world to care as a mother would for the fragile infants placed under the apple trees. When the children grow up and are freed at last, they recognize the one who met their early needs as the divine, the divine author of their liberation. In the words of the Talmudic story, when the holy blessed one was revealed at the Red Sea, these children recognized him first. As it is stated, this is my God, whom I glorify. They recognized God because they had felt God's care during their infancy and could declare with authority, this is my God. I treasure this Midrash, this interpretive story, because it helps us to think about how relationships of care make God visible to us in the world. You are our representatives. It is your duty and your privilege to locate, recognize and glorify the most high in the faces of the Georgians that you serve. And so let us pray. May we recognize the light of the divine source in the varied countenances of our fellow human beings. May we dignify the otherness of others while cultivating a deep sense of connection through the humanity that we all share. Oh God of creation and of deliverance, grant peace, goodness and blessing, grace, loving kindness and compassion to us and all your people. Bless us with the light of your countenance. For by this light you have given us living teachings and love of kindness, righteousness, blessing, compassion, life and peace. May you see fit to bless us always in every hour with your peace. And to this we say Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. A great first this morning. A great first. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The doctor of the day is Dr. Sharad Gamande from Augusta University in Augusta, Georgia. Dr. Gamande is a world renowned gynecological oncologist. He's also a associate professor, associate of the Cancer Center Director for Clinical Research. Dr. Gamande has served in the Augusta area for over 16 years, especially dealing with trial health clinics as well as reaching out to all to make sure the research is done and is efficient. I think he may be in the gallery. If he is, would you please stand? Mr. Speaker, I don't see him. Maybe he's open to the Senate. But please go by and see Dr. Gamande down in the aid station. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Prince. I spoke with Dr. Gamande this morning. He's doing a wonderful job for us over at Augusta University, the Medical College of Georgia. We appreciate that. Work he's doing there and appreciate him being here today to be our doctor of the day in taking care of us. Representative Derek McCullum for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. You'll be joined by Representative Cebuis as well. Good morning. I come for you today. I've been working on a new program with the help of our great speaker. Georgia EM, Emergency Medical Services Association and great EMS. As you may or may not know, I'm a retired firefighter EMT. When you're part of an organization such as the fire service in the Marines, they become your family. As the speaker burns tells us, everyone here is family. Even though we may not always agree, we still care for each other. Now, everyone under the gold dome is considered my family now. Starting today, we'll start a new paramedic EMT program in conjunction with great EMS. The paramedics and EMT that we have here will be here from 7.30 to 5 in the morning. They'll be here longer if need be during session. These men and women are capable of immediate response with a total advanced life support. Stryker has donated a Lucas device which hopefully we never need it. We'll give CPR. They have all the first round cardiac meds. They have a cardiac monitor. Hopefully we never need it. But if we do, they'll be right here on site. They'll be covering the capital, CLOB and the other facilities around. I want to thank Georgia Emergency Medical Service Association, Grady, EMS, GBA for working with us to get this done. And of course, speaker burns, Chairman Hatchett, and Chairman Tillery in the Senate. As you all know, he lost some out that was close to him last year. Georgia Emergency Medical Service Association chair. One of the EMTs is up in the audience. If you give them a hand, this is what they're going to look like. So that's how they're going to be dressed. If you need help, obviously they'll have to be in contact with the State Patrol. And then also they'll be in direct contact with Grady. So if something happens, they'll be able to radio, Grady, guide them in, but they'll be here already providing service. So thank you, thank you, and I really appreciate this. It was a lot of work. And thanks again to the Speaker's Office. And this is going to be great for our family. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, River Zimperty. And Representative Sharper, we also thank you for your service to your community and this base. And thank you for being here. Look, y'all, y'all know as well as I do that certain times in our lives and certainly here, with everything goes on, we need a helping hand. To our medical professionals that come in and serve as doctor of the day and now with this great new service, I feel really good and very grateful and thankful for those who rush to our aid when we need them. So for these special people, we give them thanks. I hope none of us need these services, but when we do, they will be here for us. And this is a bipartisan effort. We're even working with the Senate and we'll even let them help the press corps when that needs. So we'll let them give service to all those who serve in this go-dum. Chair now recognizes Chairman Dickie for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'm going to have our retired county agents, chairman Jasper's going to here. And all of you got one of these cards on your desk, but all of you also have county agents in each and every one of your counties. And they are a great resource to all of us, whether you're farmers or homeowners or consumers. And I just want to say a shout out to our great corporate extension program that we have in our state. I think we maybe have some county agents in the gallery. If they are, I'd like to have them stand. But maybe they've been around the capital today in Laura Perry, Johnson, Extension Director. It does a great job with our county extension program throughout Georgia. So if you see them, they're a great resource to you for you and your constituents. And just find them for what they do. It's a great program. And thank you for your support in the budget for our extension and research and teaching programs at UDA. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great group you just recognized. Thank you. Chair now recognizes Chairman Collins for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I won't take it just a moment. I want to recognize a group of young men and women from my district. If the elementary school is here today with us at the state capital, young people, if you please rise, let us welcome you to the people's house. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, is there someone special to you in that group? Would you mind introducing? Well, I refer to as little bird, but Janey Joe Collins, my pride and joy is right up there. Welcome, Janey Joe. Representative Chocus, Chairman Chocus is recognized for a morning order. He will be joined by Representative Bentley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, good morning, everyone. It is indeed my pleasure and honor to recognize the AP government and student council from Sligh County High School. Y'all stand up. They are in the gallery. They are accompanied by Gabe Tyson, William Rooks, stand up. Let's applaud and welcome them to the people's house. I want to take this opportunity to brag a little bit about the Sligh County School System. There are 180 school systems in the state of Georgia public school systems. Sligh County is ranked number six. It is the only one in the top 10 that is not in the metro area. So y'all keep up the good work, young people. Thank you. It is great to have Sligh County here. That is awesome. Travel along ways. Thank you for being here at your capital. Thank you, Chair and Chocus. Chair now recognize Chairman Williams and Chairman Blackman for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Blackman and I would like to welcome to the people's house, the credit unions. They have been here yesterday and today. We would just like to welcome you to the people's house. Thank you for being here. Great group, Mr. Chairman. I saw them this morning. I have a great group here. We appreciate them being here as well. Chairman Hatchett, you have a morning order. I thought you were getting warmed up. Is that what you are going to do? Chair recognizes Chairman Hatchett for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for letting me make this semi-announcement during the morning order. Just to make sure you all know that you are tracking sheet at an HP-18. The bill that is FY-23 amended budget is on your desk and it was put there shortly after 10 o'clock or shortly after the rules chairman put it on the calendar. I will be around all day as are the subcommittee chair, chairman and chairwomen on the appropriations committee to answer questions. Also, the House budget and research office staff is around. They will be on the floor in the morning to answer any questions that you may have. I just want to make sure everybody knew that and look forward to seeing you tomorrow on Groundhog Day. I hope you don't bring a lot of water bottles, anything like the former chairman did and try to empty them all before you finish your presentation. We are going to take this time off your presentation for tomorrow. I just wanted to mention that. So you are on your schedule. A couple of recognitions members of some folks are here visiting with us today. Former members, we have former chairman Tom Taylor. Right off here, good to have you, chairman. And I'm sure he was here. Is Tom still here? Tom Bardot. He left. We had a former member from the great state of Chatham at that time. Representative chairman Tom Bardot was here with us earlier this afternoon. Good member. Good man. We also have a representative elect here with us. Representative Lick Chaz Cannon. Glad to have you one yesterday. Now we have your attention for sure now for a minute. We have a special invite resolution, a special resolution that we will have the clerk to read House resolution 44, Mr. Clerk. And then we'll invite Mr. Clerkfield to spend just for a second. I want to go ahead and make sure we get the right folks up here. We have chairman Knight, representative Nullowicz, Jones, Williamson and Prince. We'll join us along with our special guest, Mr. Clerk. House resolution 44, our representative Knight of the 134th and Nullowicz at the 42nd, Jones at the 47th, Williamson at the 112th and Prince at the 132nd. A resolution recognizing the 49th anniversary, the consulate general of Japan and Atlanta and for other purposes. Chairman Knight in your guest. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is indeed an honor today to recognize the 49th anniversary of the Japanese consulate general in Atlanta. I've had to privilege over the last couple of years of serving as the chair in the House. I want to make sure I think representative Nullowicz, who is the coach here also of the Georgia, Japan House Caucus. But it is so important. I can't tell you, not only for our country, the strong ally and relationship that we have with Japan, but also for Georgia. For 49 years, Japan has had a relationship with Georgia. Many of you have sister cities. As our reputation of the best place to do business, I can tell you that strong partnerships like those for our Japanese companies that come in here and our great partners in Georgia, many of you have these Japanese companies that are actually in your district and they employ our Georgia citizens. So I can't stress enough how proud and how honored I am to recognize the relationship and the partnership. And with that, I want to introduce the consulate general, Japan's consulate general, made Mata to say a few words. Thank you. Thank you very much, Speaker Burns. It is a great honor for me to have this privilege to speak into this House of Representatives today. First, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to Georgia, Japan, House Caucus, Coaches, Chairman David Knight and Representative Teddy Annouz, Annouz Beats, as well as co-sponsors, Speaker Proton, Young Jones, Representative Bruce Williamson, and Representative Brian Prince. Along with those who supported the sponsor, the resolution and all other members of the Georgia House of Representatives. Three months, three weeks ago, Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden reaffirmed at Washington DC that our cooperation today is unprecedented rooted in our shared vision of free and open in the Pacific and peaceful and prosperous world. guided by the shared vision of shared values, including the little of low. This relationship is also a strategic partnership that is critical in this rapid-changing world. And I'm glad to say that the relationship between Japan and Georgia is also unprecedented, with a long history of friendship. In 1935, President Biden's President Trump was a long history of friendship. In 1973, the state of Georgia established its trade office in Japan, and two Japanese prominent companies studied its operations in this pitch state. One year later, the government of Japan decided to establish the construction general of Japan here in Atlanta. Today, more than 600 Japanese affiliated offices and companies are active in this state and employ more than 40,000 Georgians. I'd like to express my sincere gratitude and thanks to the people of Georgia for their strong and continued support to their activities. But our relationship is not limited to these economic areas. Many Georgians are studying Japanese, and others have been involved in Japanese cultural activities. And Japan first, the largest Japanese festival in the South East, was held last September in person for the first time in three years, and attracted more than 18,000 people. I've directed a Japanese memorably event, which was also held last September. That is, the completion of the Peace Bell Tower at the Kata Center. Look at that screen. The Bell itself was originally molded for the temple in Hiroshima in 1820, but after the twist and turns, it was donated to President and Mrs. Carter in 1980s. The Bell itself had remained unhanged for decades at the Kata Center, but the combined effort of Japanese and Americans led to the construction of this Bell Tower in traditional Japanese style. I'm glad to say that now we can strike this historic Bell once again, and we can enjoy the solemn sound of it. This is the perfect example of the strong ties between Japan and Georgia. On our representatives, I'd like to reiterate that the relationship between Japan and Georgia is unprecedented, but I strongly believe that we still have a lot of rooms to explore more. So, as the Consulate General of Japan in Atlanta, I commit myself to continue working hard to descend, and I'm looking forward to working closely with you for the Mutually Prosperous Future. Thank you very much for your attention, your friendship, and hospitality. Thank you very much.

We're all trying to crown him. Mr. Council general, we're so very pleased that you were here with us today. Thank you for being with Georgia, the great partnership that this country, and especially Georgia, enjoys with your country, is something we continue to build on. And we appreciate your interest in being with us. We look forward to continuing this great partnership between two great countries and the brightest days are in front of us. And this house will continue to be a great partner working with you and Governor Kim to ensure that future remains bright. Thank you so much. Members, if you would like to have a photo with the Council general, they'll be in the south any room so you can join them there. Moving right along, we're moving to afternoon orders. Our first afternoon order is Representative David Simpson. Representative Simpson. Here he comes. Good afternoon. Good to see you today. You have the well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity. Good morning, colleagues, and good morning to everyone in this great chamber. I stand before you today as a representative from Dordy County, the city, the good life city, which people call all Benny, Georgia. All Benny, I rise on this first day of February, the first day of Black History Month, to tell you about one of the most influential people in the history of this great state. His name is Maynard Hobrub, Jackson, Jr. Maynard was born in 1938 in Dallas, Texas. And from that time, later on, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended David Howard High School. During that time, Maynard was an instrument of a great instrument as far as people are concerned because he was a kid that graduated from high school at the age of 14. He graduated from high school. I say that again at the age of 14. He graduated from a school that saw the likes of Eldren Bell, former police chief of the City of Atlanta, Walt Clyde Frazier, professional basketball player, Vernon Jordan, Herman Russell, and our own Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. While attending David Howard High School, Maynard Jackson became an outstanding student. And upon graduation, moved and went to Morehouse College, where he graduated Morehouse College at the age of 18. He went on to attend Boston University and then North Carolina Central University, the School of Law. In 1973, at the age of 35, Maynard Jackson became the first black mayor of the City of Atlanta, where he served three terms. During that time, Jackson's most notable accomplishment was this, improving the opportunities of African Americans in the business sector in the City of Atlanta. Especially in the expansion of the Hartzville Airport. The project that many people said, many critics said he couldn't do, but under his leadership, not only was the project completed, it was completed before time and it was completed under budget. Today, the busiest airport in the world bears his name, Hartzville Jackson International Airport. Mr. Jackson was a beloved son of this city. He was a beacon of hope, a lightning rod for change. My prayer is, through this great house, we can be the same. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Samson, I apologize. I was up here playing with some buttons. I didn't realize they all worked. Well, I'm learning. Recognized for an afternoon order, Kevin Parsons. Thank you, Speaker Burns. I was listening yesterday morning to the privilege of resolutions. And I heard a name on there that I recognized. Heard one honoring the life of the support Roberts. And I knew the support Roberts. I knew her between about 33 years ago and about 43 years ago. And probably on a different perspective than a lot of people. And I've got, I need to recognize, and maybe apologize, represent a viola Davis. She's the one I believe to put that resolution in. I didn't get a chance to actually look that up until this morning because of different things were happening. But Representative Davis, I think, put in the resolution honoring support his life. I knew his support during that time, many years ago, when we both served in the same military unit. I think I came to know her when she was a PSCE III. I was a Buck Sargent E5, I think it was, in a 335 signal brigade back in those days. And we designed circuits and helped other military organizations implement their signal requirements. She eventually got promoted up and she did too. Eventually, she became the first sergeant of the headquarters, headquarters of Platoon or unit, rather, in that unit. And head, first sergeant, headquarters, companies, excuse me. And she became my clerk and we worked together very closely for a number of years, including Operation Brightstar, which was one of the first big operations in the Middle East or what the military terms, Southwest Asia, over in Egypt back in 1987. I want to say 1987. We work with different countries, different services and working together and trying to make sure we had a plan for Southwest Asia. And that's what Southwest Asia, to the military, takes in a lot of what we call, what we normally call the Middle East. And we work together and I don't think that we ever talked about politics. We talked about music a lot. Talked about people in the unit, people in general, television shows, things like that. But she was a very hard worker and a good friend. And we both moved on. I eventually moved to another unit. I eventually got 20 years in. I moved on from that. Didn't see, didn't see Zipporra for a long, long time. And then I guess about, I would say, 12 years, maybe 10 years ago, something like that. Educators had something here at the Capitol and somebody called me out to the road south there. And I went out and there was Zipporra and she had been elected as a member of the Decap County Board of Education. So we had an ice of the conversation about how, you know, how it was that we'd work together and never talked about politics, never talked about running for office or anything like that. And there we were both, you know, both serving our community in some respect or another. She was a great lady. She was a very dedicated person. She was a warrior. I just was reading this morning. She actually passed away having driven to a facility for dialysis driven there. And I think she actually passed away in the parking lot trying to get in for that, for her dialysis, but that's how dedicated she was. So I just came up here. I felt, I felt calling to come up. She was my friend from a long time ago and just happened to hear her name in a privilege of resolution. And I know a lot of people here probably, especially from Decap County, New Zipporra, but I knew her as a friend. I knew her as somebody. We didn't talk politics together about. We just talked about those general things, but she did a tremendous amount of work for her community. I know she was involved in the NAACP and different things in her community, but a real warrior. So just came up here to honor the memory from my perspective. I was at poor Roberts from Decap County. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This goes to prove a small world in it. It's no doubt about that. And thank you for your remembrance of a, sounds like a wonderful lady and dear friend of yours. Chair now recognizes Chairman LeHood for an afternoon order. And the Lounds County delegation. Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker and good afternoon colleagues or late morning colleagues. The Lounds County delegation and I are up here to invite you to the Lounds County, about the Lounds County bird supper tonight at the Deep Boat at 5 o'clock. Our Williams knows how good it is. And so we'd love to see everyone be there to enjoy some delicious fried quail, all the fixings and some good old South Georgia hospitality. So see you there. Thank you. One of the best nights up here. No doubt about that. Thanks to Lounds County and welcomed all of y'all's folks. Chair now recognizes Representative Holly for an afternoon order. Representative Holly. It looks like he's got Representative Penny. Penny, with him. Great support there. Yes, sir. Thank you, Speaker Burns. And yes, I'm honored to be here with fellow Representative Esther Penny. Today we recognize the fourth annual Jewish Genetic Screening Awareness Week, originally proclaimed by our former Representative, my North Springs High School buddy, Mike Wilinski. This week serves to create an awareness around the importance and accessibility of comprehensive genetic screening and counseling, not only for those with Jewish background, but for anyone planning to have children or concerned about their own hereditary cancer risk. Knowing one's genetic risks can be a powerful tool in the prevention of genetic diseases and cancer. The ability to make proactive decisions to avoid passing on devastating genetic diseases to future children or to save one's own life is remarkable. Resources such as J-Screen are making testing more accessible, ensuring that no matter your race, your religion, or your background, that everyone has the information they need to take action to take control and to get screened. And so that's why we're here and we're very humbled to be involved in this honorable work to keep our local families and communities healthy. Thank you. Thank you, Representative. Chair now recognizes Representative Bird, Donna Hu and Horner for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Recently, I participated in a March for Life and a prayer was offered. It was not in the spirit of the March. We had no knowledge of the prayer. We do not condone the prayer. Prayer is for lifting up, never tearing down. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. We now have a special treat. Representative Beesmore will bring us an afternoon order along with the video. Is that correct? Representative Beesmore. Representative Beesmore. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I want to invite those that have been in the fight for human trafficking to come up and join me. Mr. Pro Tem. So good morning, colleagues. Some of you may remember that I have been working with the First Lady, Marty Camp, for about three years now on human trafficking. My district sits closest to the busiest airport in the world. And there's a recipe right there. So I joined forces with her and we came up with a PSA that's going to be played in the airport. And yesterday morning, if some of you missed me in the chambers, we were at the airport for the official unveiling. And so if we can play the video now, so you all can see it. Welcome to Harstville, Jackson Atlanta International Airport. No matter what brings you to our great city, you have an important part to play in keeping our youth safe. Human trafficking is a horrible crime involving the legal trade of people for exploitation or commercial gain. Traffickers use violence, threats, lies, or other forms of control to manipulate their victims and coerce them into acts against their will. Unfortunately, trafficking hides in plain sight, especially in places where people gather like airports. In Georgia, we are united in the fight to eradicate human trafficking. We've worked hard to create a safe haven for survivors and a hostile environment for buyers and traffickers. Stay local and federal agencies have made great strides in the fight. And you too can play a part in keeping our children and vulnerable adults safe. Please be on the lookout for suspicious activity and know that if you see something, it's okay to say something to authorities. Some of the tell-tale signs of human trafficking to watch for are poor physical health, lack of control, and more. Poor physical health can manifest the signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, or signs of physical abuse. Lack of control includes having few personal possessions, wearing the same clothes, regardless of circumstances, and not being allowed to speak for oneself. Other signs to watch for include avoiding eye contact and hesitating to talk to strangers and an inability to clarify where they are staying or tattoos branding them as a member of sex trafficking. It is up to us to combat these evils and keep our children and vulnerable adults safe. If you think you have witnessed a traffic situation, keep careful track of your observation to report. If the victim is in immediate danger, call 911. Otherwise you can call 1-866-E-N-D-H-T-G-A, where trained law enforcement agents and advocates and first responders are available 24-7. The number again is 1-866-363-4842. Together, by knowing the signs of trafficking and who to contact, we can help in trafficking in the peach state and beyond. I just want to invite each and every one of you to get in the fight. This is horrendous action against our children, young people, and some adults. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Virginia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Baysmore. We certainly saved the most informative information to last, and thank you for your work. We do appreciate that. That completes our afternoon orders. The clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Honoring the life and memory of Officer Scott Reiner.
