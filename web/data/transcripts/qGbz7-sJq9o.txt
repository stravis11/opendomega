TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good evening, I'm Sarah Callis with the Lawmakers Capitol Report.
In the House, members disagreed to Senate changes to House Bill 86.
The bill was written to increase pay for some judges, but a Senate amendment made yesterday
added significant pay increases for Governor Brian Kemp and other state leaders.
I think that is the discussion we as a body need to have at some point, but we shouldn't
have it as an amendment to a bill in the last two or three days of session.
The House also passed a bill increasing penalties for fentanyl trafficking and gave final approval
to protections for in vitro fertilization.
The Senate presented their version of the HB68, the fiscal year 2026 budget, stressing
that money is going to be tighter as COVID era federal funds sent to the state are disappearing.
The Senate's budget realigns some of the funding you may have seen in the House and it's
a recognition of what we're looking at at the national level. As you know, the federal
government is in a position now to realign its budget, get its fiscal house in order
for the first time in decades. We support that initiative, but it might mean some changes
on the state level. The state prison system had big increases to hire more correctional officers
for pay raises and to acquire new technology
to counter prison contraband.
In education, the Senate fully funded
private school vouchers at $140 million,
but cut 28 million from the house
planned to fund disadvantaged students.
The bill was passed 48 to seven
and now goes back to the house.
Monday marks the last week of the legislative session
under the Gold Dome.
For GPB News, I'm Sarah Callis at the State Capitol.
