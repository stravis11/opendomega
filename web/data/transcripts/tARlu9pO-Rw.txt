TRANSCRIPT
----------
The Senate's study committee on truck driver shortages. This is the meeting to adopt the
report. I'm going to ask this real quick briefly. The chairman of transportation and
filio open us up in a word of prayer. We'll go through quick review and I'm going to go
through the findings recommendations and we'll probably be out here pretty quick. So
Senator Dozo.
On this journey.
Father, thank you for today.
We thank you for taking the life today.
Thank you for the air in our lungs
and we're pretty good to use it well.
Just be polite and true to other people.
I think it's the opportunity to serve the state
and the people are pretty good to do so.
We're dignity and honor to name you, bro.
Thank you.
Just to give kind of quick background,
we've had this will be meeting number four.
Our first meeting was August 30th.
that grace some power in a higher from Georgia.
Meeting number two, September 19th at Coca-Cola
in Union City, Georgia.
Meeting number three was just a few weeks ago
here at the state capitol,
and then we have meeting number four today.
I wanna thank Senate Research
and everyone who has helped put this together,
including the senators and the committee,
Anna from my office.
I don't know that I wanna go through the entire report.
I know some of y'all probably have just gone through it
and seen it just now.
It's roughly 30 pages,
but it does capture in pretty good detail
every single presentation that was given.
And I know I have gotten recommendations
from I think almost everybody on the committee
and if there's something here that we need to amend,
adjust or want to do some word smithing,
we can do it as we kind of go through
the recommendations on page 27.
So as we begin, everybody cool with that?
Okay.
Senator Goodsch, you good?
You can hear us?
All right, I'm just gonna say whatever I say,
you're good.
So I'm just gonna go through the recommendations real quick
and then just stop me if you have questions
or if you think we need to adjust something.
Recommendation number one is repeal the direct action
statute.
Recommendation number two is recognize
identify opportunities to support veterans to obtain CDL licensing and workforce training
by eliminating fees, tuition or even opportunities for tax relief for veterans in the trucking
industry. Recommendation number three, better educate, sorry, better educate young people,
specifically those in the 19 to age 24 group about opportunities available for long-term quality
of life provided by careers in the trucking. Intrug driving a better educate students about scholarship
opportunities available to pursue CDL courses. The next recommendation is address difficult
application processes and insurance requirements required to enter the trucking industry.
I know there was a lot of discussion on how a lot of that is driven by the feds and I think
the constant hand downs from the feds of new rules and requirements that's hampering the industry.
And I think towards the end of this there's I think one recommendation that talks on
support from the congressional delegation and we may want to put something in here if the committee
would like. I think just kind of touching on put you know the state of Georgia pushing back on
on some of the unnecessary regs and rules
that are being placed on truck drivers unnecessarily.
Next recommendation, support the Department of Driver Services
and their efforts to increase efficiency,
efficiency in administering CDL tests.
C-measured increases in the use of third-party testers
for CDL road skills tests.
The next one is requests the Department of Driver Services
to annually conduct at least four CDL town hall meetings
seeking input on how to create more efficient licensing
within the trucking industry.
I know they did one robust one.
It sounded like in middle Georgia.
I think from a data perspective, public participation,
perspective and industry perspective,
these could be a little bit more diverse around the state
from region to region and also seek input
from stakeholders in Atlanta, Metro Atlanta,
but also more other parts of rural Georgia,
including Southeast Georgia where I know there's a lot of freight and product coming in through the port to other parts of the state, including I know many of our districts currently.
The next recommendation, let's see, assist the technical college institutions with creating more CDL training facilities, explaining driver ranges and testing sites seeking out partnerships with private employers to allow more access to trucks and invest in more faculty to increase.
and to address the increased student demand
that we're seeing, facilitate partnerships
between DDS, TCSG, and other vocational schools.
This should say public and private.
To offer more flexible third party examinations,
certification training,
allows CDL third party examiners
to be able to verify that an applicant's CDL permit
is valid.
investigate opportunities to create
due enrollment pathways that feed
into internships to allow,
let's see, that feeds into an internship
to allow younger students to obtain miles
to become an insurable driver.
I know this was something I think
Senator Islam you've talked about
and also Commissioner King has talked about.
Work with the Georgia Department of Transportation
to expand truck driving parking options
and limit unauthorized truck parking
and investigate how to explain it
and incentivize more private truck parking options.
I know the commissioner's office
and their presentation recognize
and I think we acknowledge that this is not something
I think the state can straight up just pay for and fund
and I think we have to work with the private sector
to address I think the challenges we're seeing
with the lack of availability in certain corridors.
For example, Interstate 75, 85, 20,
as it relates to truck parking along our corridors
and interstates.
Next bullet, kind of what I was referring to a little bit
earlier, it incurs a Georgia congressional delegation
to commission and fund study by the relevant federal agencies
to examine the ramifications of shifting
to an hourly wage system.
Next recommendation, appropriate more funding
for truck driver training programs and tuition assistance,
especially for students who are not coming out
high school. I like to come back and talk about that bullet in a minute. I don't remember
who submitted that or who submitted that one to get clarity on I think what exactly are
we trying to achieve there? Okay, we'll come back to that one. Appropriate more funding
to DDS to increase salaries for testers and examiners, which had helped their staffing
shortage and reduce wait times. I know the Commissioner of DDS talked about the workforce shortages and
retention of employees as it relates to licensing, especially in our industry, trucking industry.
And then the final one revives the Appleville code ordinances regarding warehouses and
facilities for truck drivers to include facilities for overnight stay on site as an economic
like development tool, and I know that recommendation came
from Senator Jones based on just the industry
that I know he sees in his Senate district.
First, are there questions, thoughts, things we should add,
modify, and then Senator Aiesel,
I'm gonna go back to that one,
if you could talk about that one below a little bit more.
We can start there, and then we can just go around the table.
We'll start with you.
Well, I'll speak to the appropriate more funding for driver turning programs and tuition assistance, especially for students, we're not coming not a high school.
The reason that I worded it like that is because the average student is much older and so they can't take advantage of the hook grants and so they need tuition assistance for these training programs to be able to complete them.
So, I thought that would be a good thing to talk about.
Okay, so this was because, okay, I got you know, I think that came out of
our meeting at Coca-Cola.
Okay.
Thank you.
Chairman.
Chairman Adam Attardi.
Yes, thank you.
Good.
Yes.
Thank you.
So, go back to the discussion on the truck parking in the G doc in
government, private versus public. I believe there's a there's a role for G dot to play in this.
I was last week I drove to Arkansas and back for the holidays. And when I got into Arkansas,
along interstate 40, I noticed truck parking
throughout the two three hundred mile corridor that I drove on interstate 40.
And I would say there were 10 or 12 different pull-offs where they created parking for
tractor and trailers for overnight parking. Now, they didn't have facilities, they didn't
have infrastructure set up that I could see for showers and so forth, but they had places
for truck drivers to get off of the interstate park overnight, get their required rest
in and then pull back out onto the interstate and it was not private property. It appeared
to be part of the interstate system.
So I'd like to have some language in the report
that encourages you to look at what other states have done
with public funding and not rely just on private funding.
I think the private funding creates some other challenges
with federal highway regulations.
So I do know Arkansas had a pretty impressive setup
the way they had their park and setup.
Okay, so let's word smith, that recommendation.
Let me read it again.
Work with GDOT to expand public trucking,
parking options and limit, unauthorized truck parking
and investigate how to expand or incentivize
more private truck parking options,
semi-colon, and then let's add, investigate,
future investments by GDOT into public parking options
or something to add to say.
Similar to other states already in progress.
I believe you'll find other states are already doing it as well, not just Arkansas, but Arkansas was very noticeable and they were being utilized heavily by the truckers.
Senator Senator does all has a thought to recommend that we change to read work with GDOT to expand public truck public truck parking options and comma modeling usage in other states, comma, and limit unauthorized truck parking.
Okay. Thank you for that.
I'll list like staying public from options.
Women on the rise.
Investigate how to expand and then investigate how other states are.
So that's.
Okay.
Good deal. All right. We got that captured.
What else thoughts?
I have a modification.
Okay, so I don't believe that repealing direct action will is going to have nothing to do with the truck driver shortage, but every other recommendation on here as a direct impact and getting more truck drivers license and mobilized except repealing DA.
So I just don't I just don't know how it would create more truck drivers and it's not causing our exacerbating truck driver shortage.
Yeah, I mean, I think that's we've we had that discussion. I think the Senate's had a discussion. I think
By repealing direct action the statute itself. I mean we get into I
Think the increased costs that we're seeing from frivolous lawsuits and things that have been happening in the trucking industry
So I think when it gets down to nuts and bolts of quality of life and what does that mean for?
Not just the drivers, but I think the companies and even some of the smaller companies that are zero to five that are
Mostly family owned, I think those lawsuits are having an impact in terms of what's going on with the workforce in the state. So I think that recommendation is germane.
Chairman, I agree and also you might want to mention that the cost of insurance has risen so rapidly over the past few years that it's creating a competitive issue with other states.
other truckers to where Georgia is at a competitive disadvantage.
Therefore, they can't offer their truck drivers as good a wage either.
Therefore, creating a hardship on being able to recruit drivers,
the cause of the cost of their insurance here in Georgia.
Right.
Yeah, I agree, Senator.
I mean, I think we heard that in testimony in Hyrum by the commissioner.
I know we've heard that from trucking companies like Siphon Logistics and
others. And I think we've also heard that from a couple of different even defense attorneys
in terms of the impact that they've seen it have on their clients here in Georgia and across
country. Absolutely. What other thoughts? Yes, ma'am.
All right. Back to that written decision about
events that were not coming out of high school,
make it a little more clear. Okay.
And we can do appropriate more funding for church or training programs,
especially for older student, older students who are not recent high school graduates.
Was that, um, I think what you're saying, like, we're just non-high school graduates and we're trying to catch you up to the center, but it's on.
Yes.
Yeah.
So it's just all ages.
You know, let me get older, older, older, so older.
Correct.
Okay, awesome.
Any other recommendations to add or discuss before we adopt?
Senator Dezle, any questions you good?
The only thing I found really compelling was the mention of,
I believe it was me in Mexico,
had an attentionary base six month.
CDL training program.
I don't know if they had 100.
If you want to express interest in it and I'm wondering if that's something that you want to add to this.
That we want to encourage our corrections to a pathway for CDL training.
Okay.
I don't really want to add this or I believe this is part of the report already so maybe sufficient.
We can add it as a recommendation.
Raymond, could you repeat that recommendation?
I'll miss his comment.
Yeah, we're, we're smithing it real quick
and then we'll read it back to you.
I was gonna ask him to share my thoughts.
Yeah, you're good.
So, at least one understate,
Mr. Lee, I'll say this,
so you can hear as well,
then my microphone is off.
They have a six month pathway,
a six month training program for inmates
who are good to be released soon.
And so I think that helps a lot of things,
helps the recidivism rate.
It also helps expand the labor pool for truck drivers.
So I think that having department corrections
look at an option for a training program
for incarcerated individuals,
he'll be released soon to help them fast track
their way to receiving a CDL when they are released
from jail, well from prison.
So we're going to get that in.
Thank you.
We encourage the Department of Corrections to explore.
Explore implementing a CDL training program for India.
Great.
Awesome.
Good recommendation.
Anything else, Senator Gooch?
Any other thoughts, comments as we close this out?
No, I think it's a pretty thorough list.
And it sounds like a good action plan.
If we could put some of that into motion this year,
it would be a big victory for the trucking industry, for sure.
I agree.
Senator Islam, anything else?
No, I think every recommendation is good,
except for the one I mentioned,
that. I don't think it's necessary.
Sorry, we're going to agree to disagree.
I appreciate that. And I do appreciate all the ones that you've
submitted. You've been highly helpful, thoughtful, and
engaged. You've been there, remaining. So I appreciate you.
All right, I guess with that, I will ask for a motion to adopt the Senate
study committee report on truck driver shortages by the Senate.
So moved of motion by Senator dozoz or a second
Center is on
Seconds all those in favor say aye
All those opposed
One day
Committee report is adopted
Thank you
I would like to also submit a good Senator Gooch.
No, I'm good. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Okay. Senator is on.
I was just going to say that I plan on submitting a minority report as well.
That's cool. Thank you. Thank you.
Meeting adjourned. Thank you.
