TRANSCRIPT
----------
good afternoon everyone good afternoon and thank you all so much for joining us
today we stand here united today and every day in our universal call to speak
out against injustices raining down on our neighbors in our state and
throughout the country as we gather here today I want to pause to thank all of
the advocates who have been doing the work of protecting and helping our immigrant and
refugee communities for years and years, not just this week, but for decades of work
that our advocates have provided to make sure that people who move to this great state
are able to have an opportunity for a great stable life.
I want to invite us before we begin with our speeches formally to take a moment of silence.
We will pause in silence to honor the lives of those who have been lost at the hands of
ICE.
We will pause in silence to honor those who are being detained and we will pause in silence
to honor the families and the loved ones who grieve their friends and families absence.
So please join me in a moment of silence.
I'm in. It's now my great privilege and honor to introduce to you, Georgia's first Muslim
lawmaker. Senator Shake Ramon is an incredible friend, has been a great ally and voice with
me and the work that I do and I'm honored to be able to stand by him and beside him
I see represents his community and so many others.
So with that, I turn it over to Senator Ramon.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Good afternoon.
Thank you to my fellow senators,
the Georgians standing behind us today
and to all of you for being here.
I'm a state Senator Sheikh Ramon
And it's my honor to represent part of Gunaat County,
one of the most diverse counties in Georgia
and home to a significant immigrant population.
As you may have guessed, I was not born in this country,
I still remember vividly when I first
migrated to the United States during the Iran-Hoster's
crisis in the 80s.
And we call, rag head, and to go back home.
But luckily for him, I'm still here
and be proud to be your state senator.
Yes.
Woo!
Woo!
To my fellow immigrants, I understand
while hostility and privileges against us still exist,
I want to offer you hope.
And after more than four decades in this country,
I have witnessed the progress we have made.
And I know that progress will continue,
as long as we continue to stand up for one another.
Over the last several months,
Donald Trump has unleashed fertile agents on families
and communities across our country.
His action have inflamed tensions,
repeated Americans against American and grossly overstepped his authority.
He has fertilized national guard members, pulling them away from their families and their
jobs to police other Americans without the state's permissions.
We have seen masked armed federal agents reap women out of their cars, throw them into
unmarked vehicles and wicks them away in broad daylight.
We have seen agents unloaded weapons at lawful protesters.
We have seen them beat, detain, deport, and even kill Americans.
And why?
Donald Trump claims he's simply enforcing immigration laws
and removing violent criminals.
But the reality on the ground tells a very different story.
Hardworking immigrants trying to build a life in this country
have been theorized at their jobs, their schools,
and their places of worship.
Americans and lawful parliament residents
have been caught in the crossfire simply
for believing that what they are witnessing is wrong.
And it is wrong.
Donald Trump has normalized the harassment of everyday people
and entire communities simply for being a little too brown
or for having a little different accent.
Today, Democrats are introducing legislation
to protect the rights of Georgian.
This legislation will prevent national guard units
from being deployed to Georgia
without the express permission of George's governor.
Prohibit, fertile immigration, enforcement,
without a warrant on his school grounds,
in places of worship and in hospitals,
what Donald Trump has done to American communities
over the last year is sickening.
No one should be subjected to the brazen, violent act
We have witnessed in recent months unleashing law enforcement officers and brave Americans service members like secret police is simply an un-American
with that. With that I want to thank my colleagues for standing united in defense of our immigrant
community is now my honor to introduce to our leader Jones I'm sorry I didn't see you
I'm sorry, I was looking for you.
Thank you, appreciate it, thank you very much.
Thank you, and good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Everyone's presence here today is what it looks like
when people come together to fight for democracy,
to fight for the ideals of this nation.
America has struggled modally to live up to its principles
and ideals, but over the last 50 plus years,
we have been pushing to achieve those ideals.
And although there have been roadblocks and sometimes speed bumps
on the way to progress, it always appeared
that the march to achieving the ideals of this country
would continue.
But what we are facing today is not a speed bump against progress.
What we are facing today is an attempt to put up a permanent wall
through progress.
It is an attempt to place a veil of tyranny upon all of us.
And to accomplish this, the Trump regime
has decided to use the brave women and women
of the guard, of the National Guard.
The guard is here to help.
The guard is always here when we have natural disasters
or global pandemics.
The guard is made up of selfish individuals
who have believed their families to do what, to help us.
But the current administration has decided
to call these brave men and women not for good,
but for political witch hunts.
We cannot allow what has occurred across the nation
to happen here.
Our guard deserves better.
Our communities deserve better.
That is why today we are filing,
as by a self-being the principal sponsor, SB390,
to prohibit the armed state forces
to come into Georgia without permission
of his elected leaders.
The guard should not be abused by a president
who wants tyranny and to snatch people off the streets.
and make no mistake, other states have also done this,
whether it was Kansas, South Carolina,
or even Washington State have enacted these particular laws.
We cannot continue to allow the President
to abuse the patriotism of our troops.
As this regime is sought to build a wall against progress,
the progress of achieving America's values in our deals,
we must build a wall against him.
And the legislation presented here today
is a step towards protecting all of Georgia citizens
and making sure that we continue to pursue
America's ideals and goals.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I am State Senator Nebula Parks.
Today I am introducing Senate Bill 391.
and I want to talk plainly about what this bill does
and why it matters to Georgia families.
This legislation sets a clear and reasonable standard.
Immigration enforcement should not occur
in certain sensitive places like our schools,
our hospitals, places of worship, libraries,
and family violence shelters,
without a judicial warrant.
It simply requires lawful process
in places where safety and stability matter most.
Our schools must be safe places for children, full stop.
Kids should be focused on learning, not fear.
And parents should not be able to drop
their children off at school knowing
it is a place of stability and not disruption.
And no one should get dragged out of their home
or workplace without a judicial warrant.
That's basic constitutional due process.
In Georgia, we believe in freedom,
and we believe government power should come with limits
in accountability.
But this is also about affordability.
When ICE rates destabilize whole communities,
people stop showing up at work.
Small businesses lose staff overnight.
Construction slows, healthcare and service industry
struggle to stay staffed.
That disruption ripples outward.
Insurance costs go up across the board.
Prices go up.
Housing becomes harder to build and harder to afford.
And once again, working families are left paying more.
If we're serious about lowering our premiums
and making Georgia more affordable,
we need stability, lawful process,
and a stable workforce, not chaos
that drives up costs for everyone.
Judicial warrants protect rights,
they protect our children,
and protect Georgia's economy, period.
Thank you.
Good afternoon. My name is Josh McLaren. I serve in the State Senate for North
Fulton County. I'm really grateful to the Minority Whip, Senator Kim Jackson for
her leadership on this issue and making sure that the State of Georgia knows
Democrats are standing up to this rogue administration. I want to thank the
community members who are here today. If you want to see real constraints on this
rogue administration and this out of control ice, give us a shout real quick. Last year
Trump passed a budget that put tens of billions of dollars into ice recruitment and detention
facility construction. As a side note, that's why 4 million people lose in their health
care, so we can pay for this dramatic expansion of ICE making it one of the biggest, if
that the biggest federal law enforcement agency with a budget bigger than the FBI, bigger
than the federal prison system. And they are rushing to deport as many people as possible,
so much so that they offer tens of thousands in signing bonuses to people who are unqualified,
trained, and in some cases probably couldn't get a job as a police officer, am I right?
So these people have become rogue agents and thugs, these ICE officials who think that
they can act with utter lawlessness and face no consequences.
We have seen ICE detain, arrest, U.S. citizens without charge.
We have seen ICE raid an apartment building in Chicago at night and zip tie children.
We have seen ICE physically assault people who are just protesting or lawfully observing
and we just saw in Minneapolis ICE murder Renee Good.
We've all seen the video.
Obviously, the officer did what he was not trained to do, which is step in front of the
car, escalate when there was no need to escalate to a woman who said, I'm not mad at you.
And then to killer and broad daylight and let her die.
So it's physical assault, it's false imprisonment, it's murder.
Y'all probably agree with me, those are violations of the United States Constitution.
And there's two things I want to do with the bill I'm introducing, that's SB397, which
creates a civil cause of action against federal officials who violate constitutional rights.
Now that's lawyer speak for accountability and deterrence.
And Isover reaches, they need to face real accountability in courts of law.
But accountability is not necessarily justice, because Renee Good will not get justice.
And there's no way to give her justice.
Real justice making sure this never happens in the first place.
So it may be no surprise to you that police officers, both local and state, A, have better
training, but B, they check themselves before they act because they know that if they
violate constitutional rights, they may face personal liability for their overreach.
ICE does not currently face that threat in Georgia, which means they know that if they act
unchecked, nothing will happen to them.
A personal lawsuit against ICE agents under Georgia law is essential to deterring ICE agents
from ever committing these crimes in the first place.
So I'm immensely proud to stand with my caucus, with the house representatives who are
here, thank you, in saying with one voice in Georgia, repeat after me, no ice, no ice,
no murders, no murders.
My name is Josh McLaren.
Thank you again.
I am so grateful to be able to stand here.
I am the state senator, Kim Jackson, representing the great people of DeCab County, hundreds
and hundreds of immigrants and refugees who have found their home in my backyard, our
backyards, friends and family, it's my great honor to stand and be a voice with them.
I'm here to introduce to you all my bill SB 389, the final in our package of fight back
on ice bills.
Let me tell you just a quick story because I'm a preacher.
Yesterday, an gentleman called me, he's an older man, he didn't tell me exactly how old
he was but his voice cracked just enough for me to know that he had some years under him.
He said, Senator, this is the first time I've ever called Congress.
We'll accept that.
Senator, it's the first time in my life that I've ever called Congress, but I'm calling
because it's scary out there.
I'm calling because it's bad.
I thought the things would be better for my grandchildren, but it is scary out there.
Senator, I'm calling because even with the clan, even though they were masked, at least
it was on their own dime.
There are men out there wearing masks
who are doing so on our dime.
Our tax dollars are paying for them to wear masks
and to go out into our communities,
snatch people away and take them to places
where we know not of.
Senator, I'm calling for the first time
because I'm scared.
I'm scared that this world will not be better
for my grandchildren than it was for me.
So friends, that's why we're here.
We are here to call for no more mask for ice.
It's time to unmask ice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've heard it from my colleagues already.
We have men who are unidentifiable.
Roaming our streets, snatching up people, and taking them,
and then they are able to commit crimes and hide
because we don't even know their identity.
So my bill will call for ICE agents to take off their mask,
to show their face.
We have men who show up in tactical equipment,
but nothing that identifies them as federal agents.
I don't know if they are a part of a vigilante group that's
just to deputize themselves to go and steal my friend,
or if they're an agent of ICE.
So my bill demands that they put on a badge
that they have something on them that tells us undeniably
that they are a federal agent.
My friends, it's time to unmask ice.
Yay!
Yay!
I am introducing this bill for my constituents,
for the brown and black folks who are now walking around
carrying papers to guarantee that then when they are stopped,
they can say that they are actually a citizen.
I am carrying this bill for my neighbors,
for my friends, for my constituents who are afraid
to leave their homes and have other people dropping
off their kids at school because they don't know
if they can get home.
I'm dropping this bill today for the congregation
and Tucker, where a man went to worship on a Sunday
like he had time and time again, only to have himself
called out of church and taken away
in front of his own children.
I'm dropping this bill today for all of the children
who now grieve because their parents
have either been deported or somewhere
in a detention center that they don't even know where it is
or they've simply disappeared because they're afraid
that the ice might find them.
Today we are calling for my ice to be unmasked
to end the terror, to end the fear.
I believe that we can create a state where every person who lives here can walk around
without fear of a vigilante telling them away without knowing who they are.
I believe that we can create a state where we can see our law enforcement officers like
we can today and know who they are and know whether or not we can trust them or find
them if something goes wrong.
So I am proud, my friends, to introduce SB 389,
a bill that calls on us to unmask ice,
and to make sure that they wear a badge
so that we know if they are who they say they are.
With that, my friends, thank you.
With that, my friends, I welcome questions from our press.
So the question is, some people have said that the mask are necessary because of doxing,
that it protects the agents.
Let me be clear, there are elected officials standing here today who have been doxed.
There are elected officials standing right here in front of you who have been swatted.
officials who know what it is to have people because they can see our face come after us and you know
what we've done about that? We've passed legislation to protect us. We've passed legislation to protect
all law enforcement agents from being docks. We've taken care of them, we have protected them,
and now we are asking for them to do the same and to protect our citizens by showing their face.
We've been here.
If our brothers in the gray hats can stand up and show their face, then soak in ice.
If we can stand out here as elected officials who introduce laws that ultimately end up
and some people are getting locked up and others getting free, then they can show their
face too.
We have already passed the legislation to protect them.
This is not necessary, it is cowardice.
It is cowardice, and it's time to unmask mice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are there other questions?
Sorry.
Jeff.
Mr. Liddell.
Well, the way the bill actually at work is it has to be with his permission.
So obviously, if it has permission, this bill here is actually more geared towards
towards actually bringing people within the state.
So you actually had a couple of states who had done it
both ways, whether bringing it out of state,
National Guard people, and then the state,
or actually preventing their governor
from sending people outside of the state,
unless they have his permission.
The key thing is always permission
of your elected official.
So the key thing, no matter which,
how you look at it is, the type of bill
that you're talking about is,
the president himself could not just send
National Guard troops without the permission of the governor.
In this particular situation,
if you had the permission of the governor,
it still would fit.
So we actually would hope, whether we're talking about
bringing in or actually going out, that the governor of
this state would say, you know what?
I'm not going to be part of this tyranny that's actually
taking place.
That is the key thing that you would hope, whether it's
bringing someone in or actually sitting in our guard
troops out.
I would not be part of the tyranny that's actually
being trying to be taken place by this administration.
What's the governor's name?
It's basically the governor would be the voice of that.
The governor would be the voice of that, correct?
Unfortunately, the question is, is this complaint about all law enforcement or just federal
immigration enforcement?
We are keeping our focus squarely on federal immigration enforcement.
We're grateful for the law enforcement in Georgia
that abides by much higher standards of conduct
than ICE has proved itself to be.
And let's be clear about why this is happening.
The Trump administration has adopted this
Silicon Valley move fast and break things mentality.
And the way that they fund at ICE,
the way they've built up the organization,
is not deliberate, it is not in any,
with any compassion towards the citizenry
or professional standards of conduct.
And so I think culture creates these outcomes.
When you see that ICE is not being held accountable
from the top levels of government,
they're trying to build it up to basically be
this brute force that terrorizes citizens.
You know, we say a lot around here,
that's the point.
This is not just an accident,
this is the design of this administration's policy
on immigration is to terrorize communities.
I'm trying to get that.
Woo!
Woo!
And I would also second that,
but also go a little bit further,
also go, the focus, of course, is on ice,
But at the same time, the larger focus really is about
actually keeping our rights within the nation.
That's the larger focus.
The larger focus is actually allowing this president
to use armed forces to allow this president
to use the weight of the federal government
to actually repress citizens of this country.
That is really the larger focus.
The direct focus, of course, is on ICE,
is on federal law enforcement,
as Assemblyman Lorna stated.
But our larger focus is the fact that we are actually
facing a true crisis as far as freedom
of is concern in this nation.
Can you let us understand how you envision
these bills path to the governor's desk?
I can't imagine you're expecting
what a little combined.
Yeah, the question is, what is the path
to the governor's desk for this slate of bills?
To be clear, on its surface, in terms of policy,
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
should agree with us.
It's good policy for us to say that you can't bring
bring in a national guard without the governor's sign off.
In fact, they have a Republican governor.
They ought to trust him.
It's good policy.
It's good policy to say that for our public safety,
you should unmask ice.
It's good policy to say that certain places
are protected, that sanctuaries exist,
that places where children are being dropped in
all should be protected.
That's good policy.
The problem is the path to the governor's desk
is not about policy, it's about politics.
And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
are beholden to a man in the White House
who does not care about good policy
and does not care about people.
So we understand that the road to the governor's desk
is quite limited, that path is narrow.
But we also stand here in hope that common sense
and good policy might persuade a few of our colleagues
on the other side of the aisle to stand up
and to resist and to be a part of good policy making
on behalf of the good people of Georgia.
With that, friends, I thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
