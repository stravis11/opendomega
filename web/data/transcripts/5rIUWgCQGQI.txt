I pledge allegiance to the flag, to the United States of America, and to the Republic of Wichita's chairman, one nation under God, and indivisible, the liberty of justice all, and the Georgia flag. I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag, and the current world of Wichita's statement, to the Muslim justice Congress, and to the state. Good morning, colleagues. I am excited to present to some, and introduce to others, the Reverend Dr. Anton Elwood, who's a senior pastor at St. Philip's AME Church. Now, St. Philip's isn't just an ordinary church. It is the largest in the sixth district, which includes the entire state of Georgia. To my right over here, I have some very distinguished members of the church as well. Sam Tillman, my good friend, and my chief of staff, and certainly represented Billy Mitchell, who serves on the advisory board, and what we were called a Deacon's capacity over at St. Philip's AME Church. Dr. Elwood was appointed to end as a senior pastor at St. Philip's AME Church in Atlanta in June of 2023. Dr. Elwood has shown his focus, dedication, and inspired leadership both spiritually and professionally. And under his leadership, St. Philip's has his experience, exponential growth, as well as his power for preaching. Significantly, this New Orleans Louisiana native, sorry to put that in, Pastor, just had to say that, is prepared for each platform and audience. Dr. Elwood was a graduate of United Theological Seminary, and they know how you're an adoptive ministry degree, and a graduate of ITC International, the Domination of Theological Seminary, right here in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Masters of Divinity, Psychology, Religion, Pastor, Karen, and Councilman, and a graduate of Bethune, Kutman College, Daytona Beach, Florida, with the Bachelor's of Philosophy and Religion. Dr. Elwood was most recently, he served as the pastor of New Mount Zion, AME Church in Tallahassee, Florida, where his tenure there lasted well over 15 years. His keynote credits include, and they are significant, by the way, and please allow me just a list of few of them, which would include the Job Corps Youth Empowerment Series in Atlanta, Georgia, Theragood, Marshall, Scholarship, Fund, Leadership Summit, and Manhattan, New York, Florida AMM University Commencement Speaker in Tallahassee, Development Research School, Back-A-Lart Speaker in Tallahassee, Florida juvenile transition center, and Board and Beach Florida. You can see Dr. Elwood has been a very, very busy pastor. Dr. Elwood is married to this lovely wife. She won a Alicia Elwood. They are the proud parents of a daughter, Kaylen Elise, and a son, Anton G. Elwood II. I am excited to invite Pastor Elwood to come and share word with us this morning. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Jones, and Mr. President, and certainly to each of you, I want to suggest that every life is valuable, not for what we do, but for who we are. The world is filled with lines of demarcation, the myriad of opinions, affiliations, philosophies, theologies, ideologies, and the major debate that exists between iPhone and Android seemed to keep us with adversarial energy. This energy is unfortunately the energy that should be replaced with allied energy. The divisive energy in most rooms in the year of 2025 is palpable. My Christian faith teaches that love should be the order of the day every day. And that's tough, sometimes that seems unreachable at times. It is even what I call tough Christianity. It is much easier to walk in our division to espouse as much hate as possible, and to live in the siloed reality that causes us to be less hopeful concerning a united future. It is my hope that we can find the cords that unite us instead of the strings that divide us. It is my hope that it will not take tragedy for us to inch toward the places where we find value in every human life. May the beat of every human heart be the soundtrack that undergirds the richness that is found in the day and in the turning of another season. Shall we pray God, we honor you, we thank you. We glorify you for another day's journey. We pray God that there will always be value in every human life. May we serve this present age. May we serve humanity. May we always look to you, our creator, and our sustainer. Leading God us every day of our lives, our thoughts, our mind, our deliberation, and give us the wisdom that is necessary to lead with precision. Because of my Christian faith, I seal this prayer in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We have a very special guest today. If I get everybody's attention real quick, I have a very special guest from Athens, Georgia. He is serving as our doctor of the day. But I'm going to introduce the senator from the 46 to introduce our doctor of the day, which wants to give us a little update on the project that the senator and I have been working on. That worked on last year for his facility. And he's going to give us a progress report of all our hard work that we did last year in the Senate, and with the help of the senators from the 46, making it happen. Senator? Thank you, Mr. President. It's my pleasure to date introduce Dr. Cody Gunn as our doctor of the day. Cody and I have been personal friends for decades, really, in Athens. And he has taken a big interest in the political process. Cody has been a general surgeon since 1988, and he developed a specialty in breast cancer and breast diseases. Ultimately, he ran the program from its inception at Athens Regional, the breast cancer program from 2002 up until 2022, when he left to go to UC BC. And that's the University Cancer and Blood Center, which is the leading oncology center in Northeast Georgia. He is particularly grateful for our work on the CON reform last year, and I'm going to let him speak to that and let you know sometimes the real effects that we have on people's lives with the bills that we pass here. But he's a fantastic doctor. He has a following as revered as the breast cancer expert in Northeast Georgia. Everybody, men and women love him because he gives such empathetic care, and it's so good at what he does. And so it's my pleasure to welcome to you as our doctor of the day today, Dr. Cody Gunn. Good morning. It is my very special honor to be able to speak to you this morning. I've come up here several times since Senator Caldsworth's been in office, maybe three or four times, and just spent the day with him like an adult field trip and set up in the upstairs and just watched the proceedings. It's just been in all of how you all work together. We're all in the state. So grateful to what you do, and you give up three months away from family, your regular job coming here and work together. I thought football was the ultimate team sport, but I think maybe this might be the ultimate team sport. Last year, particularly in Athens, we worked with the cancer group there. We had a pet scanner, a pet scanner, a scan the entire body with a special material that shows cancer cells that other images do not pick up. We had one pet scanner in Athens at the hospital, and that supplied basically all of Northeast Georgia, and the wait time to have a pet scan was about four to five weeks. So you can imagine having a diagnosis of cancer, and you can't start your treatment until you have a pet scan, and we can tell there's nothing else going on in someplace else, or we do identify something else that needs to be addressed. So you basically wait a month to get the scan because we only had one scanner. We were trying to get it for several years. The CON was blocking that to some degree. And so last year, thanks to you all in your work, that was pushed through. And we now have a pet scanner at the premier oncology group in Northeast Georgia. We didn't have one, and we couldn't get one. And now the wait is more at like five days. So I told Senator Caldery last year, it's hard to imagine everything that you do is so important, but this literally saves people's lives to get them into treatment a month sooner. So I cannot tell you how much I appreciate all your work. This is just one thing that you all might know about. I'm sure there are many, many more things, more bills that go through that affect people's lives, but this saved lives. So thank you very much for everything you do. We're very, very grateful. I appreciate being here. Thank you.

you Are there any unanimous concerns? All right, we're going to, before we start points of personal privilege, we're going get nominated for technically ten needs for about 15 minutes. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you are now open for points of personal privilege. Stand from the 15th, would you like to do a point of personal privilege? I heard Senator from 28th, you've only one signed up for a point of personal privilege. So just let me know when you're ready, when you folks are ready. You've only one signed up for it. I can't believe we got a room full of politicians, the light wants to talk. We got open mic hour right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Why my honor is, come on down. Let me introduce you to the Global Sister Speed Network, who are in the gallery stand, and give them a warm welcome. Thank you. They seek to foster and empower a global circle of women and girls to live abundantly in their authenticity, as well as find success through business and community endeavours. Mrs. Sabrina, right there. Thank you for being here. You have a long list of credentials, and I'm so honored to know you and honor to know that you would come today. Thank you all, ladies. They gave me a couple of minutes, but I will come see you in room what? How come down and see you as soon as I vote today? Thank you very much for being here. I bless you all. Do I have my share of it? Today is Morris Brown College Day. Thank you. I stand to recognize my alma mater, Morris Brown College. Yes, I was there. I'm a bubbling brown shoe. 18 years after the president Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, the ministers of the African Methodist Episcopal Church of the State of Georgia created Mars Brown College. After fully realizing the necessity of an institution for the preparation of young men and women for every department of Christian work, as well as an industrial training school for both genders, Mars Brown College of the AME Church was granted a charter from the State of Georgia in May 1885. Become in the first institution in the state solely under African American patronage. The school first opened its doors in October 1885 with Mrs. Mary McCree. The first institution in the state solely under African American patronage was put more than 130 years. Mars Brown College has received and nurtured students around the world. This institution's deep seated commitment to the profound purpose diligence of effort, heartwork, perseverance, and belief and trust in God provides access to opportunities for educational development in a nurturing environment. I'm proud to have been an alum of graduate, where our president is here, president of our college. Is he downstairs? Dr. Kevin James. We had a resolution passed about a week ago. It's our 397 honoring Dr. James and Mars Brown College. Also, our woman of the year and our number one of Mars Brown alum for this year is none other than the sheriff of the camp county. She is a very talented and talented sheriff. I had said earlier, I was a bubbling brown sugar with you, but the bubbling brown sugar you still are. Thank you for all that you do for our state. I see how the camp people are coming down now. I know they can stand around you. Our Dr. James is also here. Dr. Kevin James. I was so honored to serve. Hey, man. I was so honored to serve on the board of directors when we were working to get the accreditation back from Mars Brown, but you got here and you got it for us. Thank you. Let's give them another hand. I already mentioned that we passed legislation SR 397 Dr. Kevin James for you. Also, for our woman of the year, I'll share for the camp county melody medics. We have SR 395 that's already passed as well. I'm also representative of the Alumni Association and our constant companion, Mrs. Walleen Smith. Yeah. She retired from the GBI everybody, so y'all better act right. I know Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs at Mars Brown, Dr. Tonya Sherry Randolph, Vice President of enrollment and Student Affairs, Dr. James Elf Allen, and enrollment senior specialist Shy Juan B. Randolph. I really have, he's actually an intern here in the capital this year, but I want to see Dr. Faroqi and I sit down there because he was my professor. Stand up, Dr. Faroqi up there. His son is a City Council person for Atlanta. Dr. Faroqi, I owe you everything. I'm not only my professor and you start being my counselor. And so you've helped so many people over the years. Thank you very much. And one last thing, stand up again, Mars Brown College, and let us give you a warm Senate welcome. Stand up, Faroqi. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you. Well, Senator, it looks like you woke up all these politicians in here because now all of a sudden we got, well, it's like we got somebody, I want to make sure they recognize somebody today. Senator from the 38th. Good morning, colleagues. I rise today to recognize that it is Georgia's single parents day here at the Capitol. This day is meant to recognize the valuable contributions of our single parents from all across Georgia here under the Go Dome. Our single parents devote a measurable time, energy, and care to raise their children, ensuring they grow into responsible, productive, and successful adults. It is hard to raise kids as a single parent in today's society. I had some experience with that so I had no all too well, very familiar. So I think it is fitting and proper to honor the outstanding accomplishments of these remarkable individuals for their exemplary contributions and unwavering dedication to raise in the next generation of Georgians. Representative Skolfield over in the House has recognized this amazing group that is here with former representative Stovall. But we have also some single parents here in the gallery that are being recognized and are getting awards today. So I will ask you please join me in recognizing all the single parents if you can stand up and know they're back there. There you go. All right, thank you all so much for being here and all you do. All right, and with that Mr. President, I yield the well. Thank you. We're going to have a sit in front of the seven. I rise. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to talk about tort reform, Senate Bill 68. When a parent drops their child off at daycare, they should feel secure knowing their little one is safe. Not just in the moment, but in the justice system if something goes wrong. When a daughter trusts a nursing home to care for her aging mother, she shouldn't have to wonder if the law will protect her if...

harm comes. And when a survivor of assault seeks justice, they should not find the courthouse doors locked because politicians decided the rights of corporations mattered more than the rights of people. But that's exactly what Senate Bill 68 does. Port reform is not a solution. It is a shield for the powerful and the expense of the vulnerable. We've seen this experiment play out in other states. And the results are as clear as they are devastating. Florida passed a version of this and now families are fighting uphill battles to hold bad actors accountable while they see their insurance rates skyrocket. We are watching the damage unfold in real time. Yet some in this chamber want to bring that disaster here. They'll tell you this is about fixing the insurance industry. That it's about fairness. But let's be clear. This bill doesn't fix anything. It doesn't lower premiums. It doesn't make businesses more responsible. And what it does is to make the harder for Georgians to seek justice when they need it most. And here's what's really backwards guys. We're being told to pass torreform to lower insurance rates while the insurance industry continues to operate without oversight or accountability. Now after pushing this bill forward, the House is creating a study committee to investigate whether the insurance industry is actually keeping its promises. The fact that such a committee is even necessary should tell you everything you need to know about how flawed this bill is. We're being asked to gut legal protections for Georgia families first and ask questions later. That's not policy making. It's policy making on behalf of insurers. If we're serious about fairness which is start by getting answers not by handing out favors. And if you think this concern is partisan you guys, think again. Donald Trump blasted Florida's approach calling it and I quote the worst insurance scam in the entire country. He said raw to Sanctus is delivering the biggest insurance company bail out to globalist insurance companies in history while homeowners get pennies on the dollar. So if you're pushing this bill because you think it's pro consumer or pro fairness, take a closer look. When Trump and I agree on something that should give you pause. Imagine your child is haunted daycare and you find out later that the company running it cuts corners. Ignored safety measures and put profit over protection. Under this bill your ability to hold them accountable would be drastically limited. Imagine your mother is neglected in a nursing home or your loved one is assaulted by employee at their workplace. This bill makes it harder to fight back. There's no mystery here. We know what will happen because it happened elsewhere and it's happening right now all over the country and yet we're being asked to ignore all that evidence to roll the dice with safety and security of Georgia families. I refuse. I refuse to stand by what corporations and insurance companies get yet another gift at the expense of the most vulnerable among us. I refuse to look at parents in the eye and tell them that their child suffering is just a cost of doing business. So today I ask my colleagues are you willing to tell those parents that their children's safety is worth less than an insurance company's bottom line? Are you willing to tell it's survivor that the system values profits over their pain and if you're not then vote against this bill vote for Georgia families and vote for justice because if we pass this and we see the same devastation that's happening in Florida there will be no pretending that we didn't know exactly what we were doing and there will be no excuse. I yield a well. I'm going to have to say thank you. Thank you. Good morning Mr. President. Thank you Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. We got a special opportunity this morning. I want to speak to someone who's a dear friend of mine and a dear friend of so many of us in this chamber and pay extra special tribute to an extraordinary leader, a steadfast advocate for our nation's defense and our dear friend the late Senator Sheila McNeil. Sheila's unwavering dedication to the United States to the United States Navy and the Naval submarine base at Kings Bay of which she lived close by and was so deeply cared for and deeply loved was more than just service in Senator McNeil's eyes. It really was a lifelong mission even before she came to this chamber. Her tireless effort left an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of working alongside of her and her legacy quite frankly continues to inspire so many of us. To honor her remarkable contributions our office has established a nonprofit organization in her name, a leading testament to her passion for her service and commitment to the next generation of naval leaders. Each year the organization will proudly sponsor a deserving candidate to the United States Naval Academy, ensuring that Sheila's spirit of leadership, patriotism and dedication will live on and on. We are especially honored today for us to have a friendly smiling face. It is so familiar to us. Sheila's daughter Leslie is with us and Leslie want to make sure you know that your mother's legacy will live on with all of us and we are very grateful to have you here this morning. For those of you that wish to support this cause and I hope that so many of us will, donations can be made to the Sheila McNeil Legacy Scholarship Fund. You can drop those checks off at my office or I've got an address that I can give you as well. So let us not only remember Sheila's legacy in words but also honor it through action. By investing in the future of young men and women who will one day serve and protect our nation just as she so dearly cherished and as she so passionately championed. You'll see additional information on your desk about that and so with that let's just give Leslie a nice warm Senate welcome for being with us this morning. Leslie we love and miss your mom just as we know you do but her spirit is still with us and we appreciate you being with us. Mr. President I yield the will. Thank you Senator. Senator from third. Thank you. Thank you Mr. President. Colleagues if you will indulge me for a second let me tell you the story. The first church that I remember attending I was probably four years old but it was the Norwich Street Baptist Church in Brunswick, Georgia. A beautiful old red brick building still there today but I attended with my mom and dad my sister my two brothers the Hodges family sat on the same pew every Sunday and on the next pew there was a family named Mobley. The Mobley family sat on the next pew over from the Hodges family. There was I remember Mr. and Mrs. Mobley they had an older daughter or a daughter named Sheila and Sheila had I think three brothers. Sheila was nine or ten years older than me so we didn't really get to know each other but she had a brother my age brother named Ricky. Ricky and I went 12 years of school together and we became very very good friends. So one of the stories here is that in that little red brick church in Brunswick, Georgia on the south end of town those pews held two people who would sit in this chamber. Two people Sheila, Mobley, McNeil and me but that's not the story that's not the real story. Let me tell you the real story. The real story is that it was easier for me to get here than it was for Sheila. When Sheila was growing up in the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s and beyond it was hard very hard for a female to attain station and responsibility in society and particularly in business. You might not realize that as much today and you don't realize it because it's easier today and it's easier for females today because of Sheila and people like Sheila. For that we all owe her a debt of gratitude. Now those of you who serve with Sheila know what I mean when I speak of Sheila's force of nature and her sense of purpose, Sheila dedicated her life to her family, to her community of Brunswick and Kings Bay and to the Navy. I don't need to list all of her accomplishments. You know those and I will remind you that she was the first and only woman to ever run the Navy League. She was a president, a national president of the Navy League. So this scholarship, the scholarship fund is a fitting tribute to Sheila's life for it. So I'm proud to participate and I hope you will too. And let me also mention the work in its way through the Senate right now, is Senate Resolution 439. And what that will do will be to rename a stretch of Osborne Road in Camden County, Georgia which will include the new Camden County Sub-Base Museum which Sheila dedicated her life to, to Kings Bay and to the Navy and to that sub-base. So, lastly, let me reiterate that I loved your mother, I loved Sheila. I was honored to follow her. I told you before that I had really big little shoes to fill and I'm trying to do that. So I hope that you'll participate and thank you for indulging me. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator. Well fitting for a good, good lady. We really, we are enjoying serving with Senator Neil. She was a fine, fine lady and appreciate everything she did, appreciate that too, Senator. We're going to have Senator from the 54. Thank you, Mr. President. Friends, I just wanted to come to the well because we got some special guests up in the gallery with us today and I just, my years of working with kids and youth always know it's just the innate hearts of people who just have the desire to really go out of their way, to be compassionate, to be caring, to be a surrogate mother or a surrogate father to our kids that are in need in our communities. And today we have North Georgia Boys and Girls Club folks with us today. If you all please stand up and let us recognize you. And as we just, these are the folks that literally make a difference in lives of kids every day. They are literally the most compassionate people you've been most selfless people you'll ever find in your communities. If you do not know the folks that your boys and girls club, get out and meet them because they literally do God's work each and every day. Thank you and I will yield the Web, Mr. President. Does any other Senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege? All right, you have before you a consent calendar or privilege or resolutions. Does any Senator wish remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair here's none and the resolution on the consent calendar is our doctor. Are there any motions that withdraw and commit? Yes, sir. You have before you a consent calendar of local bills. The sex here. Are there any objections? Mr. President, no objections. I'm in file. All right. Is there objection to agree, agree, so the report of the committee on state and local governmental operations, which is in favor of the pass of the bill on the local consent calendar? Chair here's none and the board of the committee has agreed to. Questions on the pass of the bill and local consent calendar, all those in favor of vote. Yeah, all opposed. Nays, Secretary of the Law and the Machine. All opposed. All the pass of the bill, the a's are 53 and the a's are zero. This bill on having on the local consent calendar, see the rex sync my constitutional majority. I can't talk today. Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Senator from the 39 36, I mean conversation we have got me all nervous right here from earlier. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent that the following bills be engrossed. House bill 266 and House bill 426. Secretary, read the captions. Lieutenant title 15, the district of Georgia, annotated. Way to the magistrate court. So it's a bribe for nonpartisan election to magistrate. To amend chapter 2, title 1 and 1 of those to GA, way to elections and prime raise generally. So it's to revise provisions related to nonpartisan elections of judges of the public court and magistrates who are related matters, bribe for effective date, a contingent effective date, an automatic repeal of to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Is there objection? Senator would you like to speak to it? Senator from 26, you have your light on. You want to speak to it? It's part of me, Dr. Enquire. Station Quirin. Mr. President, do we have a fiscal note on 266 as to what it might cost us? Yes, the offer the bill does have a fiscal note on. And we, you have been asking that question. We're going to have Senator from the 27th, what purpose do you rise? Part of the entry in Quirin. I'm just saying to Quirin. Mr. President, this is not true that Senate bill, sorry, House bill 266 has been completely reconstructed to be the exact language of Senate bill 31 as it passed the Senate. And then I have a fiscal note here for Senate bill 31 if any member wants to see it. Senator Knows of what he speaks, and I'm sure all that will be hashed out in debate. All right, we do have objection to the motion to engross all those in favor of the majority leaders. Motion to engross will vote, yay, I'll oppose the name Secretary-General on the machine. The vote goes to the A's are 32, the Udnaes are 22, and the motion has prevailed. On to the rules calendar. Secretary-Hauspiel 58. House Bill 58 by Representative Richardson, the 125th and others, bill 20 in town, Knight to Man, chapter 1, to title 6 of the official go to Georgia and take will to general provisions relative to aviation. So I've authorized the adoption of local ordinances, resolutions, regulations, and policies that are stricter flight of unmanned aircraft systems of our mass public gatherings, required for definitions, required for later matters, for being able to look in laws and further purposes. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Transportation recommends that this bill do pass or so up with minutes in our goals, I'll chair men. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Transportation offers the following substitute to House Bill 58, built to mean Title IX to Man, chapter 1, to title 6 of the OCGA, way to general provisions relative to aviation. So I've submitted certain actions by operators of unmanned aircraft systems, for our panel to each ride for the percolability, to ride for definitions, ride for later matters, ride for an effective date, to be able to look in laws and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. I recognize Senator from the 6. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate everyone's attention. Some important legislation here, that's why all the cameras are here. So I appreciate you indulging with me. There's this bill as a response to a glaring concern regarding operation of unmanned aircraft, also known as drones, flying over certain gatherings of people like sporting events. And under the current law, our law enforcement generally lack a clear path to taking steps to intervene if drones are being flown in these situations. So just a quick me to the bill, lines 13 through 16, it defines a ticketed entertainment event. Lines 38 through 39 says that these drones cannot fly within 400 feet of the event. And lines 44 through 51 lays out some exceptions. Those exceptions are people that have gotten consent from the owners of the property. And those who are operating under FAA authorization and within FAA regulation also has exemptions for employees of the event and then should be utility contractor needed for official business. That all yield for questions. Sure. You do have one question, Senator. Senator from the 33rd, would you like to ask question? Thank you, Mr. President. We'll send it to you. I will yield from a good friend from Mayrata. Are you referred to as Maverick because of this bill? No, sir Maverick flew as a heat-flue manned aircraft. This is for unmanned aircraft. But great question. You have no more questions. Thank you. Urge your favorable consideration for HB 58. Yield the well. Does any other Senator, would you speak for against the measure? Chair here is on. Is there objections to previous questions being ordered? Chair here is none of the previous questions is ordered. Question is on the adoption of the committee. Substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee? Substitute. Here you none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agrees to report a committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The board of committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of vote, yay. All opposed, nay. Secretary, a lot of machine. The bill is on. The pass of the bill, the a's are 53 and a's are two. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. It is therefore passed by substitute. Senator. What's wrong with your neighbors back there, man? Secretary, a House bill, 159. House, 129. Representative Crow, the 118th and others. Bill is being titled to amend chapter 26, title 50. The official go to Georgia and it will be to Georgia housing and finance authority. So it's increased the outstanding bond limit to write it for later matters. If they give dates or bill looking laws and further purposes, Mr. President, the same committee on economic development and tourism recommends that this bill do pass for the submitted center, each to chairman. That can be the order, Mr. President. Senator, the pro team. Thank you, Mr. President. Move that we excuse the senator from from the 8th for business inside the capital. The objection is sent from the 8th is excused. We're going to send it from the 49th who also has the former senator from the 49th here today. So we sure are glad to have the current and past senators from the good hall county today. Thank you, Mr. President. The former senator came down today with the young man, celebrate and world down syndrome day. He's out in the hallway, supporting the cowboy hat, if y'all see him walking around out there. The only thing that I would see different from what chairman said previously on the previous bill, I do believe the cameras are here for HB 159. And I appreciate you guys being here today. Colleagues, we know that home ownership is the American dream, but something that we don't realize a lot of times as Georgia has the lowest home ownership rate in the southeastern United States. The Georgia Dream program is a tool that we use to help people move toward that goal of home ownership. This program is funded through mortgage review bonds issued by the Georgia Housing Finance Authority, and then they're bought by private investors. That current limit for those bonds is $3 billion. And what this bill does, it moves that limit up to $6 billion. Currently, we're at $1.8 billion without standing on those outstanding bonds. And that's set to, we're set to reach that $3 billion threshold by March of next year. So what we're doing is simply asking to move that up to $6 billion and give these folks some room to make loans for homeowners in the state of Georgia. With that, Mr. President, I yield well. Thank you, Mr. President. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. Previous question is ordered. Is there objection to reading to the Board of Committee, which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none. The Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. Questions on the past of the bill? All those in favor vote? Yay. All opposed. Now you say, Chair, and a lot of the machine.

you LastMaster座 29 and the NAZR 6. This bill has received the rest. The Constitution majority is therefore passed. 6-A-Ree House bill 266. House bill 266 by representative Sains, the 180th and others, Bill Smith, me and town of NACHA men, article two, chapter seven, title 40, and the official code of Georgia Anatilla to the Invisition Rate Competition Exemptions and Credits for State Income Tax. So as to exempt from State Income Tax, income receivage is personal compensation for full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. It's provided for later matters for our effective date and applicability to repeal and conflicting laws and further purposes. Mr. President, this thank you very much. I'm finance recommends that this bill do pass by substitute or submit to the Senate on a host out there, chairman. Mr. President, this thank you very much. And finance offers the following substitute to House bill 266. Bill's being titled NACHA men, chapter seven and title 48. I was the official code of Georgia Anatilla to Income Tax, it's a special exam from taxation. All income received is retirement benefits, drive from service and the armed forces of the United States and for other purposes. Mr. President, I complete the order. Bring it out, Senator, from 27. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, colleagues. We have perfected House Bill 266. And the way that we perfected House Bill 266 is we made it Senate Bill 31. This is word for word Senate Bill 31 as it passed this chamber, 53 to one. And it's not often that we get to do things here that I think so fundamentally changed the lives of a very, very important group people who have served this country. I want to show you this map. And you can see Georgia on this map is the only dark colored state in the southeast. It's only one of 11 dark colored states in the entire country. And the darker blue color here references states that currently tax military retirement income. So what we will do today is we will take Georgia, hopefully from a darker blue color on this map to a lighter blue color on this map. And we will, for the 95,000 retired military veterans in Georgia, we will give them a tax cut. I hope what this bill also does is turns on an electro magnet for veterans to choose Georgia as a place to retire. Because as we know, they are some of the best citizens and they may now be choosing other states due to the fact that we have this income tax, even though it's a graduated income tax on them. So colleagues, I thank you for your previous vote on this. This bill has bipartisan support. I would like to thank Lieutenant Governor and his office for supporting me in this issue, working on this issue, working this through the process as well. Because it's something that has been very important to him as well. With that Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions or I'm happy to yield the will. Gregor, how's the Senate from 31st? Well, Senator Yule. I will. Is it not true that this bill is upgraded since it came over? It's upgraded. And Chairman, if I would take the liberty, you have been especially supportive of this bill. And I believe you have said that you believe this is, if not the best bill of the session is certainly as one of them. I appreciate your help on that. I agree. And I thank you for your leadership on behalf of all our veterans in Georgia to get this done and look forward to seeing Green on the board in a second. Thank you, Chairman. Senator from the 26th, you have a question. You just won't come up to them. Okay. You have no more questions, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. I think you'll be able to do the well. We're going to have Senator from 26th. Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, Senator, I hate to oppose my warm, closer and trusted friend. But this bill is going to cost us $40 million a year. It's $40 million that you will not be able to touch appropriate. In the past, I've gone along with, but what's happening in Washington, DC and the things that are being cut. My personal opinion is that we're going to have to pick up some of that cost and not be able to get those $30. So I just wanted to just make that note in the cost was $40 million a year. Thank you. A year of the way. You're going to have Senator from 36th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, you. Yes. Thank you for your comments from the well on HB 266. And recognizing there are other authorities in the building, but I want to ask you, should this bill have a fiscal note? They have one. I just saw it. You saw it, but it's not in our book, is it? Yeah, the gentleman has a fiscal note. And that's the reason I say it's going to cost $40 million. So if you got prejudices, if that's $40 million, you're not going to be able to touch because of this bill. It's dealing with veterans, people who have given their lives and put their lives on the line for this country. I understand that. And not for the veterans. I never said it. But with everything going on in Washington, the dismount of the Department of Education, Social Security Office is closing in Georgia. How you close the Social Security Office in Columbus, Georgia, with all those folks around there? These are the kind of things that we're going to have to look at because when they do that, then we, as a state, have the obligation to try to take care of our folks in this state. And I just want to make that note. I'm not against the veterans. I think they've done a marvelous job and have gone and served us well. But it's for the million dollars that you won't see. And you won't appropriate under this bill. And further true, with the bill that passed yesterday, HB111, that blows a reduces state revenues by 800 and some million dollars. And you add this money that you're talking about. Another, do you say it's 30 million or 40 million? Add that to it. And we're building up a, we're pulling a lot of money out of our state revenue stream. Isn't that true? That is very true. But again, I say, we all have different opinions of how we do things and the people we serve. And again, I say that the military, many women who are taking over to serve this country and give them out. But again, I just want to tell you, it's 40 million dollars. So if you got a project in your hometown and you're trying to get money out of the appropriation process, it's going to be 40 million dollars. And so I just want you to know, when you do these things, they have consequences. They have real consequences. You know, I'm poor boy. I dollar me something to me. But when you start talking about 40 million, I can't count it. I can't count. 40 million dollars. In my account, no else. And I just want you to know that when you do it, it does have consequences because when you look at the overall budget, and we don't know what else is coming down the pipe in Washington. It means that when we lose that money there, we got to make up the difference. The animal courts. Mr. President, I yield the will. Would any other Senator, which speaks for against Bill? Hearing none, Senator from 27th, you'd like close the debate? Thank you, Mr. President. My friend from the 26th has been consistent on this, and so I do appreciate that. He was the one Senator who voted against this the last time before the chamber. I would offer the fiscal note to anyone who would like to see it. As all fiscal notes do, it has a high end and a low end range. And that range for next fiscal year, the full fiscal year, this would be affected. In fact, it's from 23 to 58 million, so his number of 40 million is correct. I would only point out to you that we collect about 16 billion dollars in the income tax. And so we are giving a one quarter of 1% cut to only income tax revenue, which is less than half of the revenue that we appropriate in the budget. So this is about 1 1 1% of the funding that we appropriate. And we have actually been in the budgeting process in Green Door and the last day or so. And we can find $40 million for these veterans. And I am thankful this has been a bipartisan issue so far. I've been thankful this has been a Senate issue so far. And that the Senate has led and taken a stand and said that we passed this bill very early in the session. One of the very first things that we wanted to do was to prioritize this small tax cut for our veterans. And with that, Mr. President, I ask for your favorable consideration members of this chamber. And I yield the well. Senator Hezilden. Senator from 36. Parliamentary inquiry. Statue of Parliament. My question is, are fiscal notes supposed to appear in with the bill when it's being considered on the floor? Senator, that's going to be a question for the author of the bill. We don't have them up here at the Rossum. So the rules require a fiscal note to be attached to a bill if there is said fiscal note. I don't believe the rules require to have them on the floor, Senator. But I assume during the process and the committee and everything that those questions were asked and they were answered. I saw it and saw it can help you with here. Is our secretary of state instructed to provide the fiscal note if one exists with the bill when it's on the floor? We don't have one for this LC. I'm sorry. We don't have one for this LC. This is House Bill. I understand. I have no idea what Secretary of State does on that one. Thank you. We've been sector of the Senate. Correct. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Senator from the 36 that your point was noted, Senator, and we'll get it provided to you. The question is on the adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the report of the committee which is favourable to the past to the bill? Is there objection to the main question being ordered? There are questions on the past to the bill by substitute. All those in favourable? Yes, all opposed. Secretary, I'm not in the machine. All the passed on the bill, the A's, are 53, the A's, are 2. This bill has received the requisite constitution majority. Therefore, passed my substitute. Secretary, House Bill 331. House Bill 331. My represent of camp, the 135th, and others, bill 292, and Article 11, Title 4. The official good of George annotated will teach general provisions regarding animal protections to prohibit the transfer of certain domestic animals, certain locations, to bribe for exceptions, to bribe for enforcements, to bribe for penalties, to bribe for definitions, to bribe for related matters, to appeal conflicting laws, and further purposes. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, I say I say, I bring you House Bill 331, a very important bill, a very simple bill. This is a bill to be able to protect some very special animals. In our homes, we are our children, and we love them the most. But then we have our dogs and our cats and our rabbits. This is a bill to where all animals will be protected, and being taken care of the right way. This gets rid of all the bad actors. There's a, has had too many animals took them in. They have not been able to maintain them, take care of them, and then they're trying to sell them as an un-falks consent. Ladies and gentlemen, we need this bill so we can make sure all our pets are taken care of. And also, it protects the companies that already do it the right way. Also, I would like and encourage, if you want, to vote green so that our President, our First Lady and the Senate, will be very proud of us. And that way, our President and many of us here will not be in the doghouse tonight. Thank you. I ask you to vote green. Sanders yielded. Sanders yielded. Tell you what, it's important. It's important for me getting home tonight. I can tell you that right now. Does any of the Surgeon, which speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there a Jackson to agree to the Board of Committee, which is favourable to the passes of the bill? Chair, here's none. The Board of Committee is agreed to. Is there a Jackson to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The main question is ordered. Which is on the passes of the bill. All those in favour of the bill vote. Yeah, you pose, nay. Sex, tear, and lock the machine. All on the pass of the bill. The A's are 53. The A's are 1. This bill, him, received. The Constitution of Majority is 0.4 pass. All right. I appreciate that, Senator. Appreciate that very much. Appreciate it. And Senator from the 53rd. Point of order, Mr. President. Station fire. Hidden it true that the best coon I ever bought was in a McDonald's parking lot. You know, Senator, I was just sitting here thinking when you all ran in the doghouse, I don't know where else to put one dog, you know. But I'm sure that couldn't dog you have was a good dog, sir. All right. Moving on, House bill 426. Secretary Reed captioned. House bill 426, where I represent him new, the 40th, and others the bill between 10 and 9 to amend chapter 10, title 15 of the A.V. Georgia Annotated, will it do magistrate court, says to provide for nonpartisan election, it imagestrates to amend chapter 2, title 21 of the A.V. Georgia Annotated, will it do election some primary general, says to revise provisions related to nonpartisan elections of judges of the probate court imaginations, five related matters, five for the effective date, a contingent, effective date, an automatic repeal. So, the people looking for laws and further purposes. Mr. President, this is the line committee on ethics recommends this bill to pass. So, it's like this minutes and a William's vice chairman that can be steward or Mr. President. Senator Freundin. Senator Freundin. Senator Freundin. Thank you, Mr. President. After all that time on dogs and cats and rabbits, I won't take much of your time. This is a little simple bill that just changed the magistrates and enjoyed you to 9th Partisan. So Friday afternoon, I don't want to stand in the way of everybody getting home. I ask for your favorable consideration. I'll yield the well. Does any of the Senate which speak for against measure? Chair here is 9th. Is there objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is 9th and the previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agree to the 40 committee which is favour to the past of the bill? Chair here is 9th and the 40 committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is done. The main question is ordered. Questions on the past of the bill. All those are favourable. Yeah, all opposed today. Secretary, a lot of machine. All in the past of the bill, the A's are 43 and the A's are 11. And this bill has received registered constitutional majority. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute to SB 68. Secretary, read the caption. Senate bill 68 by Senate Kennedy. The 18th and others. Bill Tmeintown and act to amend titles 9th, 13th, 14th, 51th, the Fisher go to Georgia and it's a two civil practice contract. The motor vehicles and torches respectively. So that's the right for sub-nensive and comprehensive revision of provisions. Regarding civil practice, evidentiary matters, damages and liability and toward actions. Right for limitations relative to paying and suffering testimony. Right for timing, evansors and discovery. Right for dismissals of civil actions. Right for definitions. Right for related matters. Right for effective date and applicability to repeal the laws and further purposes. That can be seen on Mr. President. Senator from 44. Parliamentary, I rise to make a motion. State should inquire. I move that the Senate agree to the House substitute to SB 68 as amended by amendment 1. Secretary, read amendment number 1. Mr. President, Senator Pairn of the 44th and others are for the following amendment number 1 to amend the House substitute to Senate bill 68 by replacing substantially similar wrongful conduct with similar. Wrongful conduct online is 199-229-231-234 and 238 by deleting physical online is 206-242-247-261-266 by deleting substantially online is 207-244-263 by inserting after line 281 the following. Senator, we would like to speak to you motion to your motion. Senator, would you like to speak to your motion to your motion. Senator, would you like to speak to your motion to your motion. Senator, would you like to speak to your motion to your motion. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I am opposed to SB 68. Certainly in its current form, but I rise to posit to this body that we could procedurally agree is amended, which would allow us to consider or allow amendment 1 to go forward and then would give the House of Representatives to be the same. We would like to give you some justice for some victims that right now are having the courthouse store closed in their faces and they have been down here every day with their horrible stories of abuse. And I think that this body should listen to those stories of abuse. And imagine the horror of learning that a child you love has suffered unimaginable abuse. Abuse that will at a minimum shape and may even destroy the rest of that child's life. Now imagine being told that you don't have the right to seek justice, not because the case isn't valid, but because lawmakers have decided that protecting corporations and insurance companies is more important than protecting victims. And that's exactly what will happen if these so-called lawsuit reforms pass. These so-called reforms are not about stopping frivolous lawsuits. They are about and they will shield negligent institutions from accountability at the expense of children and victims of violent crime. All the cases I'm about to reference are cases from right here in Georgia.

Consider the case of a seven-year-old boy, repeatedly molested at summer camp because the staff ignored their own safety rules. Too much trouble to enforce. He now suffers from PTSD and has suicidal thoughts. Or a five-year-old girl who was raped with a pencil at camp because the staff failed to supervise the children in their care as put out by the camp's own policies. She now lives with nightmares and deep emotional scars. And then there is the horrifying case of an extended stay hotel that allowed a nightmare to unfold inside its walls. A man held his children and a vulnerable teenage girl captive for years. Three of the children were conceived and born inside of this single hotel room without any medical care. For 15 months, a year and three months, these children and the young woman were starved and tortured. A 15-month-old baby weighing only seven and a half pounds, the size of a small newborn, died of starvation. And at that point, authorities were called. The baby was dead. Her tiny body bore the signs of prolonged abuse, a broken arm and 42 fractured ribs. The other children were critically malnourished. The woman, the mother, the captive mother weighed only 59 pounds and was in a catatonic state for months. And all of this happened because the hotel failed to follow its own very basic policies. Under their policies, they were supposed to check on guests weekly, make sure that each room was entered on a weekly basis. And they didn't. They didn't do it for 15 months. And there were people imprisoned inside the hotel room for 15 months, a baby weighing a 15-month-old baby weighing seven pounds with 42 fractured ribs, an enslaved woman, 59 pounds, who had given birth in this hotel room. I would suggest to you colleagues that the reason the policy exists for the extended stay hotel is to make sure things like that are not happening. But they were. And this hotel did not follow its own policies, which led to the starvation and malnourishment of three kids, the death of another, and the enslavement and malnourishment of a young woman. Even after the police came looking for one of the abusers of this family, they allowed the abuser to switch rooms and re-register under a fake name, enabling the abuse to continue after the police had shown up. After the police had shown up, if these lawsuit reforms pass, the victims in these cases may never get their day in court. And it's worse than that for our society. It's not just about the victims of these horrific crimes. It's actually about our whole society and what safety measures we should be able to expect out of businesses that invite the public onto their property. If these organizations can fail the public in this way, whether it's a summer camp or a hotel and face no consequences, that means no justice for these victims, no accountability for those who allowed their suffering and worst of all, no change to prevent future tragedies. Who benefits, I ask, who benefits from these reforms? Not the children who have been raped and abused, not the families who are mourning their loved ones. The only winners are insurance companies and other corporations that are more concerned about their bottom line than making sure that their policies protect human lives. Because you see lawsuits are not just about compensation. They're about exposing negligence, forcing institutions to change and preventing more victims. Everyone in this room should know that the way the American judicial system has grown up since the founding of this country has had lawsuits pay, play a critical role in providing safety, basic safety tenants to every person in the United States of America. They basically play a regulatory role. And if you get rid of them, then that will mean that businesses aren't incentivized to spend that money. I'm not trying to say businesses are evil, they're not. But it's about showing through a lawsuit the harms that are caused if you say, you know what, we're not going to follow that policy. We're not going to have that security guard. We're not going to install that lighting. We're not going to have that fence fixed or delaying on all of it. Do you think code enforcement is going to be able to come around? Check all the lights? No. And we've never expected them to. And therein lies the problem with changing premises liability. You may want to call it negligent security in this wide open way without grappling with the fact that these lawsuits have made every single one of us and all of our families more safe or maybe even having a basic safety, basic safety. The number of lawyers on in favor of this bill that have said how poorly written, vague and overly broad, the section of the bill about premises liability is shocking. But what's more shocking is that there were no changes made to that section. Other changes were made that kind of affect lawyer compensation, how expensive is it to bring a case? This piece that impacts every single person on the shores of the United States of America, whether they're a citizen or a visitor, and every single business did not get the scrutiny it deserved. But you know what? Everyone who's been filling this capital, this is the part they're here on. They're not here to talk about fountains damages. They're here to talk about the crime they suffered, being kidnapped, raped, the child's sexual abuse. That's what they've been talking about for weeks. And the only change was to carve out sex trafficking, victims. Well good, good. Glad that happened. But it also puts the lie to the entire rest of the section because it also says, all right, if you were sex trafficked, you can have your day in court. But if you were kidnapped and raped and held for 15 months, then no luck for you. So let that sink in. Being stabbed, no big deal. Raped, totally fine. Murdered? That's a shame. You've got to face all these additional barriers. Sex trafficked? All right. All right. You, we want to take care of. Can you imagine how crazy that sounds? When we take away the right to sue, we're not protecting our communities. We are enabling abuse and bad actors who would rather pad profits than protect people. And like I said, they may not even do it intentionally. It may seem like a wise business decision until it's too late. And you've got an enslaved family and a dead baby. We have to ask ourselves, who do we? The people's representatives stand with. The insurance companies that even as I speak are being investigated in Florida for crying poor to get tort reform passed while hiding as alleged billions of dollars in profits. Or the children and families who have suffered unimaginable horrors. The answer should be clear. We're here on behalf of the people. We need balance. I'm not against lawsuit reform. But the failure to grapple with the changes that are allowed in this bill, shutting out all victims of crime, no matter how heinous, unless it's sex trafficking. Even while an insurance scandal is unfolding in Florida, where it appears the entire system was aimed to bamboozle legislators to fool them into voting for tort reform, we're still voting yes. People are still out there voting yes. I urge you to stand against this injustice. And if you won't do that, then it may get a little worried that they're busy investigating, launching an investigation in our state immediately to the South. That should make you worried. We've gone through this whole process about how insurance premiums are too high. And we have not asked one hard question of insurance companies. It's like we want to pretend they don't exist. There are lawsuits. And Ergo rates are high for businesses. That's just forcical. And as farcical, if you're going to say we aren't even going to ask any questions of the freaking people setting the rates. What a joke. What a stop to insurance companies. That is ridiculous. And the people know it, by the way. They know it. And I would tell you colleagues that the shape this bill is in, it's real dangerous to be voting for this bill given the scandal in Florida and what it does on premises liability. So I'm offering amendment one, which will allow other victims, children and the elderly to have the same rights that right now Senate bill 68 gives only to people who have been sex trafficked. So let's stand with kids. Let's stand with the elderly. Why should they not have the same rights? If they're abused, if they're raped, then people who have been sex trafficked. Why should they not have the same rights? Why is it not a big deal if someone got raped? If someone can answer me that question, maybe I'll understand. But I would tell you that it makes no sense. And it's just about limiting liability as much as possible. And having been forced, I guess, by all the talking we've done about sex trafficking for the last at least ten years that I've been here, all the talk about sex trafficking clearly would have been shown to be just that talk, I guess, if we passed the bill that didn't allow them to sue. So okay, fine, fine, we'll just carve them out. People who have been raped, abused, murdered, we still will say absolutely not to them. So I think real hard about what you're doing. It's embarrassing to do a handout to insurance companies without asking them one darn question. That's just embarrassing. For anyone who has been yes. And what I would suggest to you is that you vote yes on my motion to agree is amended. And that will allow the kids, children, an action that injures a person who at the time of the injury was less than 18 years old or was 65 years old and older. Kids will allow children and the elderly to have those same rights. And then at least we will have helped some other categories of victims that deserve our consideration. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the vote. Sen. New Zealand, Secretary Reed, the substitution that you missed in the first reading. Mr. President, the House Office following substitute to Senate Bill 68, Bill Tween, Title and Act to amend, Title 9, 1451, and the official could have George annotated away to civil practice, motor vehicles, and torches, respectfully. So I strive for a substantive and comprehensive revision of the provisions regarding civil practice and further purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Senator from the 53rd, are you willing to speak to the amended? No, Mr. President. I want to speak to the main question. All right, so we're going to take up amendment one before we get to the main question. All right, so the posture right now is centered from 7th, what purpose do you rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Mr. President, isn't it true that we should table Senate Bill 68 until the completion? Look at me, Senator, I can't. Look at me, Senator. I said Mr. President, isn't it? Mr. President, isn't it true that we should table Senate Bill 68 until the completion of the entrance rate investigation committee recently created by the speaker? The duly noted there, Senator, but we're going to move forward with voting on the center from the 40th floor. So we're in the posture right now in voting. The Senator motion back there is in order and so the motion is 68 as amended. We're going to vote on her amendment right here. Those in favor her amendment will vote yay. Those opposed nay. Secretary-of-Latmachin. On the motion from the center from the 44th, the a's are 22 and the a's are 32 and this motion has failed. Now, now we move to Senator from the 18th, has moved the Senate degree to the House substitute to Senate Bill 68. Is there objection? I'm sorry, you speak to your motion, but I first, Senator, I recognize the center from the 18th, first, speak to the motion. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, colleagues. I appreciate your patience and I know this is a bill that has received a lot of vetting, a lot of consideration. A lot of time has gone into the issues that we are talking about here today and I want to begin by thanking Governor Kim for leading on this issue and his work on something that is a incredibly important measure for our state. I want to thank our president, our lieutenant governor Jones, who has done a great job in being supportive of this measure all along the way and also want to thank Speaker Burns, who came out early on and said he recognized the necessity that we get something done in Georgia to help hardworking Georgians to help us simply rebalance our civil justice system. I'm going to try to be brief, but I do want to go over and tell you about the substitute language that's before you today, which is very largely similar to the bill that passed out of this body just a few weeks ago with bipartisan support. I want to highlight the efforts of both the House and the Senate committees, the business community and those that came and shared their testimony with the committees both on the Senate and the House side. The governor, Commissioner John King and legislative leaders, many of whom are in this chamber today, have spent the past two years collecting data and participating in roundtable discussions with businesses, health care systems, and everyday Georgians to talk about what the problem was. You know, many of us had hoped that we might be working on some legislation, specific legislation in 2024 last year, but our governor is a very, very thoughtful governor. And you will remember that we passed HB 1114, which was the tort data collection bill so that we could find out more information that was not readily available from insurance companies that would inform the, what would ultimately go into the bill that you have before you. Through that entire process, along with the roundtable discussions with people around the state that the governor held, we learned a lot about what needs to be changed and what needs to be done. Not only that, but even after the Senate Bill 68 and Senate Bill 69 were filed, as the governor said in his state of the state address, he said that we were going to continue to have meaningful discussions. And we did. And you'll remember that after that initial filing of Senate Bill 68, there was a substantial revisions after working with various stakeholders, primarily the plaintiffs far on the GTLA that produced the substitute that was presented to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee. And then that was even further modified by what you voted on when Senate Bill left here from the Senate floor with regard to an amendment that substantially revised one of the portions involving phantom damages. After the bill passed out, as I've alluded to, all folks involved with this process, with the governor's office leading on this, have continued to meet and listen to the concerns. And then when it moved on to the House, it was exposed to over 15 hours of testimony and feedback from the public, committee members, and a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Yesterday, Senate Bill 68 passed the House as amended with bipartisan support. And I'm grateful to those leaders in the House that presented the bill, carried the bill, and also worked on their specially formed subcommittee from the rules committee to hear this measure. The substitute before you today incorporates input from the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, victims advocates and various plaintiffs lawyers around the state. The substitute is a result of dozens and dozens and dozens of hours spent diligently working with the House and the Senate and the governor's office and stakeholders from all sides. As I said, Governor Kemp said in his state of the state that there would be room for the legislative process to play out, and that is exactly what has happened with input from all sides. But the governor also made it clear in the legislation that it should not and will not be a half measure. I believe friends at this substitute in front of you today strikes that needed balance. The House added clarifying language to guard against any misapplication of the bill's provisions to protect both parties while ensuring open and fair access to the civil justice system. Let me walk you through those changes and briefly tell you what they are. You'll find in section one of the bill which was the provision dealing with anchoring. And it clarifies that the requirement to argue the monetary value of non-economic damages at the first opportunity for the closing argument means the first closing of the issue of damages, not the first at any point of the trial, but the first on damages. So what does this do? Well, it makes the interaction and interpretation of this section with section eight, dealing with bifurcation clear that it prevents any misapplication. It also clarifies that the second closing argument that counsel can argue the monetary value of non-economic damages again as long as the argument was made during the first closing. This prevents either party from sandbagging the other by delaying and not talking about what the anticipated damages are or what's going to be requested. And finally, it clarifies that the advocates can still ask questions in boardier about jurors' willingness to simply award damages. Section two involves motion to dismiss. And I know this stuff is thick, lawy early bill stuff, but for those of you that, and I know many of you educated yourselves on the details of this. And I wanted you to understand the changes that the House made and quite frankly, not only why I support them, but why they made the bill better. Section two highlights that if a court fails to rule on motions in a timely manner, then a writ of mandamus may issue and be used to keep the courts accountable. This is important because it puts accountability where it should be, and that's on the court, to keep the case moving forward. There's only three more sections. The third is section three involving voluntary dismissal, and it makes the clock for the voluntary dismissal start upon the filing of the answer regardless of whether a motion for summary judgment is filed. Well, why is that important? The catch, if you will, that was made by the House and looking at the language was good because it closed a potential loophole that defendants might take advantage of that would unduly and could have been used to gain the system to prevent the plaintiffs in having that portion of discovery period that we agreed ought to be a part of that. Section five dealing with seatbelt evidence. This preserves the trial courts inherent discretion to determine whether and for what purpose evidence of seatbelt use should be admitted. Seekbelt use still must be relevant and non-preditial. Two basic standards for any evidence, and of course we know the judge is the gatekeeper, the referee, if you will, of what goes to the jury, and he or she is a judge, still operate and do that function. Lastly, section six involving premises. It increases the carve out for sex trafficking victims, and it excludes any claim relating to a violation of 16, 5, 46, which is the criminal provision dealing with sex trafficking. So what does this mean? It means that section six provides valuable protection not only for businesses trying to do the right thing and needing to know and understand what that means, but also no protection, no protection for businesses who fail to act against human trafficking that occurs on their watch. It also places a clear limit on the application of section six so that the other claims, such as those based on the failure to supervise employees and negligent hiring, which was really most of what we heard the senator from the 44th just complained about with her amendment, that somehow this bill as written was going to deny those claims. I would encourage you to do one thing. Read the bill. What she represented to you is not in this bill, not in word, not in ink. Not in intent and not in a desired policy. It ensures that section six, as interpreted, is intended to prevent businesses from liability, to protect businesses from liability due to factors outside of their control, while ensuring that businesses still face liability and face fault and face responsibility for what is under their control. The last section deals with bifurcation. You'll remember we talked about that. That's where the parties can elect to have the trial split in the simple two phases, same trial, same judge, same parties, same courthouse, just two phases for efficiency purposes. The changes that the house made allows the court to reject a demand for bifurcation in two types of cases. One small case is in under $150,000. The court can say, no, this is too small of a case. We're going to not allow bifurcation. Second, and by the way, that's not some crazy thought because the same threshold is what North Carolina uses for their bifurcation statute. Second, where the plaintiff is a victim of sex offenses, and the potential additional testimony would cause additional emotional trauma for that witness in testifying about such horrific acts that they have endured. Regardless of what's at stake, the courts have the discretion to prioritize the emotional well-being of the victims of these horrific offenses so that they will not have to testify twice if the court so finds. These changes preserved bifurcation as a tool for both parties to ask for and use to give us those efficiencies while ensuring that the procedure does not clog up the court system or stop a victim of a sex crime from seeking justice through the civil justice system. You know, Georgia is from all across the state of come to us asking for a more fair and balanced civil justice system. Through this process, we have all heard so many, we've heard from hospitals, we've heard from the medical pair, the communities that take care of us when we're sick, we've heard from the business owners that give our family's jobs. We've heard from everyday Georgians who are struggling to make ends meet because of the litigation taxes on our families now, and those that are scared when they pick up the letter opener when they get their next notice from the insurance company of where the premiums have skyrocketed to. We need to do something about this. Senate Bill 68 proposes and does just that.

I know we've voted down the amendment that was offered by the Center from the 44th. And I'm not going to take your time with the hour of the day to refute all that was said. But I will tell you that in my 11 years of being a legislator under this gold dome, this may be the most misrepresented piece of legislation that I've ever seen. You'll know what was not told to you during the presentation of the amendment was any specific reference to a provision of the bill that did what she said she feared would happen. And the reason is the bill doesn't do what was represented to you. And the reason that the language protecting victims of sex crimes was added was raised only as a question on the Senate side of, could it possibly impair the bills that we passed two years ago to specifically give rights to those that have been sex traffic and human traffic. And so the languages added to make absolutely certain that those revisions of 51 156 were in no way impinged by this bill. But I'll give you one other thing to think about. You just heard the description of what this bill supposedly does. Does anybody in this chamber or anybody within the sound of my voice think that Governor Brian Kemp would propose a bill or a piece of legislation that would in any way decrease what the victims of sex trafficking and human trafficking in this state had available to them? If you have any thought like that, let me remind you of who he's married to. Our wonderful First Lady, Marty Kemp, who has for her entire tenure as our First Lady championed and done all she could for the victims of human trafficking and sex victims. In case you're wondering, how about Senate Bill 158 in 2019, the Anti-Human Trafficking Protection Response Act? How about Senate Bill 435 in 2020, the Survivors First Act? These are the things that Marty Kemp and Brian Kemp have championed for the women of this state. House Bill 28823 in 2020, House Bill 911 in 2020, Senate Bill 33 that so many of us were proud to vote for in 2021, Senate Bill 34 in 2021, Senate Bill 461 in 22, Senate Bill 42 in 23, Senate Bill 370 in 24. And our First Lady continues to work for the victims of sex trafficking this year with Senate Bill 42, which is pending in our legislature for approval. So yeah, I do bristle a little bit. It's a bit offensive to characterize a piece of legislation like this and the way that this has been knowing that this is Governor Kemp's priority for his legislative session this year. I'll leave you with one other comment. We had folks come and testify on the House side and on the Senate side. And it was done so in a way as if to suggest that if this bill passes, they'll have no causes of action to sue anybody for what they've endured. And that's not true. I won't take your time with it, but on the House side, we went and found the complaint of someone who came and unfortunately had been misled, severely misled into believing that this bill would have restricted the kind of compensation she already got. And we went and demonstrated that because all of the other causes of actions in Georgia law are remain untouched that folks have available to them. But I thought what was maybe somewhat rather telling is one of the members of the House special committee, a lawyer, who would have had us believe with the nature of her questions and her vote yesterday that this bill was just going to strip all the rights of Georgia for the victims of sex trafficking. But let me read to you from a complaint that was filed in the United States federal court for the Southern District of Georgia. Here's a copy of it. Teachers have to sign pleading with a requirement of candor to the court. Fortunately, Georgia has followed the federal government's lead in recognizing that actors other than actual traffickers and Johns were participating in promoting, facilitating and benefiting from the selling of sex and sex trafficking through the passage of SB-33. Because the passing of SB-33 now codified as OCA-51-156, Georgia now joins those states in providing trafficking victims the option to pursue civil suits. That's what's in the pleading. That's not the narrative that you're hearing because that's not what they want because they want this measure to not pass. I've been humbled by the outpouring of support simply for a balanced civil justice system. As the bill sponsors, I've had the distinct privilege to meet so many Georgians across the state who are begging for relief. And through a process, I feel hopeful that something in canon will be done today. All those folks came to see us whether it was the day that we dropped the bill or came across from across the state to the various times that the governor held the roundtable discussions because they were asking you for a vital and urgent support that they sent us into this building to provide and it's a way that we can give it to them by acting today. Things I ask your favourable consideration of this very thoughtful approach to simply balancing our civil justice system and I appreciate your patience. I appreciate all the work that's gone into this from so many people around the state and certainly the legislators that have given this consideration. Mr. President, I'm happy to answer any questions or I'll yield a bill. You have one question, Senator. Senator from 26. Thank you, Mr. President. What's the other you? Yes, sir. Senator, you talked about sex trafficking but it's more in that bill than just sex trafficking. Am I right? Yes, sir. There are eight sections. One deals with premises liability but only negligent security. So not all things dealing with premises liability and then there are the other seven that deal with the rules of the road if you will on how wheel lawyers and judges manage trials and yes, sir. So I'm not alone. The only thing I can do is try to read and make the best of it. But in your statement you said, but you said, yeah, I met with the Georgia trial lawyers association. What suggestions were made to you all in the discussion of this bill that you all accepted from the Georgia trial lawyers association? Senator, numerous suggestions that came. For example, the initial bill that was filed, that was initially filed. There was an objection to one of the sections that was completely removed. The issue on the motion to dismiss timing which the initial proposal followed and mirrored the federal rules of civil procedure which meant that the plaintiff had up until the time the defendant files an answer to dismiss their action. They asked for some time to do some limited discovery on to make sure that the jurisdictional and venue and proper party issues were properly addressed and asked for time. So the time date was moved back from the timing of the answer to the 60-day period that was suggested. The trial lawyers also did not like the initial approach to phantom damages which is truth in medical billing. And what we see in this proposal that came out of the Senate and was left unchanged by the House because it's a very good compromise is not only does the jury see the rack rate which was being the policy behind the initial Senate bill was that they would only see the actual amount needed for reimbursement. But we wound up with a landing spot where both numbers go to the jury. That was at the specific request of the trial lawyers and those that engage mostly in plaintiffs work. I can go on and on Senator. There are a lot of changes and as I said in my earlier comments every step along the way from the initial bill that was changed to the sub that was then changed by the amendment in this body that was then sent to the House that was modified by the eight, I think it was seven or eight different sections that they changed would be fairly characterized as all those changes were moving in the direction as requested by the plaintiffs bar. Senator E. Affair. Yes, sir. Senator, we, I don't know what you saw it, we had a copy of that, the speaker of the House in Florida talking about insurance companies and that the main one says they lost this but the subsidiaries made billions of dollars. So where are we when it comes to insurance companies? Most of the litigation is dealing with insurance companies and what they pay out. Now in the true, if you have a claim or you call it into the insurance company, that's what they call in our office memo and they decide what they're going to pay on that particular claim whether it's high or low but they're not going but so much when they do that and say they said the side I hundred thousand dollars and they only pay out fifty. Do they in turn tell the insurance department on their claim sheet where we pay it out fifty thousand but they had a hundred thousand set aside so the other fifty thousand went back to the insurance company or do they report to the insurance company that was a hundred thousand miles claim. Senator, if I understand your question you're asking about the retention policies and how that data is communicated to the Office of Insurance Commissioner, I really don't know the answer to your question. I would tell you I doubt that insurance companies but I don't know this report what their retention levels are on a claim by claim basis. I do know and understand that the Office of Insurance Commissioner does evaluate their overall retention policies because they want to make our insurance commissioners, I'm sure other insurance commissioners do as well, they want to make sure that the retention amounts that the carriers have are capable of sustaining the payment that may ultimately be made be required. Thank you Mr. President and I appreciate everybody's time. Urge your support for this bill and thank you for your patience. I'm going to send it from fifty third. I think Mr. President, for our today an opposition of Senate Bill 68 but my Democratic colleagues pointed to premises liability, that's what I think is the only good part of Senate Bill 68. You see our Georgia Constitution says we have rights to life, liberty and property. Didn't say life, liberty and happiness, it says life, liberty and property. Premises liability, that's the good part of the bill because it's protecting that property. But I come here today to give the other Republican side against my former caucus members because everything else in this piece of legislation is nothing more than an insurance company bailout. There's no guarantees whatsoever that insurance companies are going to lower their rates. I think any good business man in the insurance company, now that they've got this bailout, what are they going to do? Get that money, not return it back to their customers. As Donald Trump's floor leader, I'd like to read to you a truth from President Donald Trump. Now this is related to Florida but you can just take, when I say Florida, just replace that with Georgia and when I say Ron, you can replace that with Governor Kim. I don't read the whole thing but it says, Rhino, Ron de Sanctimonious is delivering the biggest insurance company bailout to globalist insurance companies in history. He also crushed Florida homeowners as their houses were destroyed in the hurricane. They're getting pennies on the dollar. His insurance commissioner does nothing while Floridians lives are ruined. This is the worst insurance scam in the entire country. So in my opinion, Senate Bill 68 is the second worst. Why is it the second worst? Because we've got the premises liability part in there. You see, we've got these ten amendments in our Constitution that protect us from the government. The Bill 68 infringes upon the seventh amendment the right to go seek justice. This is quintessential astroturf movement, not a grassroots movement as it's been portrayed. When it passed over in the house, the gallery was full of lobbyists. Those lobbyists didn't walk up that mezzanine and go up there if they weren't getting paid to be there. It wasn't full of regular everyday Georgians. When I talk to the people in the northwest, they're worried about the carpet mills. They're worried about the water that's ending up in the streams. And they want to make sure they've got a good way to go sue and bring justice to them and their families. Mr. President, I'm going to oppose Senate Bill 68 today and I thank you for the time at the well. Thank you, Senator. Okay. The proteam has moved that the Senate agreed to the House's substitute on SB 68. All those in favor of his emotional vote, yay? All those opposed, nay? All the motion to agree the a's are 34 and the a's are 21 and this motion has a prevail. We're going to sit in front of the 50 second. Thank you, Mr. President. I would move that the Senate agreed to the House substitute to Senate Bill 77 as amended by amendment number two. Secretary Reed, the caption. Senate Bill 77, Mr. Hustler, the 52nd. Mr. President, Mr. Hustler, the 52nd. Following amendment number two to amend Senate Bill 77 by replacing Bartow County Tax Commissioner with governing authority, the City of Cardisville, on line 3889, 92 and 97 by replacing tax commissioner Bartow County with governing authority of the City of Cardisville on line 62 to 63 and 77 and for other purposes. Mr. President, that completes the order. Senator, light speech to you Bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I apologize for a local bill taking up time and has nothing to do with Moe Berry. But we had a House substitute which we were going to agree to but then they had some errors in it where they had put Bartow County in there and the City of Cardisville like it should have been. So we originally had an amendment but then I realized that wasn't complete enough so I was withdrawing amendment number one and was replacing it with amendment number two. And if there are no questions I would urge your favorable consideration of agreeing to the House substitute as amended by my amendment number two. Senator from the 41st. What part of the city, guys? Senator, do you yield? I yield. So we understand what's happening. Is amendment two your amendment or is that the House's amendment? That's my amendment to what they had done because they had some errors in there that it should have said the City of Cardisville and it was saying Bartow County so we corrected that in numerous places. Senator, do you further yield? I yield. Is that amendment in our notebook or is it coming out on gas? Is in the back of your book there correct? All right. Thank you, Senator. We appreciate it. Thank you. You have no further questions, Senator. All right. Thank you, I urge your favorable consideration. Do you have any other Senator which speak for against the measure? Hearing none. So the posture win is on Senate Bill 77. Senator has made the motion that we agree to the substitute as amended amendment number two. All those who agree with the author's motion we vote yay. I'll oppose nay, secretary and law and machine. All motion to agree that the yays are 55 and the days are zero and this amendment has prevailed. Are you going to have a senator from the 52nd? Thank you, Mr. President. One more, I move that the Senate agree to the House to the Senate Bill 83. Read the caption. Senate Bill 83 by Senator Hustler of 52nd and others, bill is being done and act divided of homestead exemption from Bartol County School District. I have a warm taxes for educational purposes and amount equal to the amount by which the current year assesses of all year but homestead exceeds the adjusted base year assesses of all year such homestead and for other purposes. Mr. President, the House offers the long substitute to Senate Bill 83, bill is being done and act divided of homestead exemption from Bartol County School District. I have a warm taxes for educational purposes and amount equal to the amount by which the current year assesses of all year homestead and for other purposes. Mr. President, the complete seawater. Senator from the 52nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I should have missed you down the last as well as this one that the Senator from the 37th is also part of Bartol County and has been part of this process as well. The House of the Amendment and local bill, we agreed to the amendment and so it comes off the consent calendar and I just agree to that. It is in the back of the book. It's a homestead exemption for Bartol County. No questions? I yield to well. All those in favor of the motion to agree on Senate Bill 83 with vote yes, I'll oppose it. All the motion to agree the A's are feet forward and the A's are zero and this motion has prevailed. We're going to have a majority later. Mr. President, I move that the Senate's standard adjourned pursuant to SR6 until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, March 25th. Secretary, read the announcement. Mr. President, the Science and Technology Committee will meet upon adjournment room 310 and the CLOB and the rules committee will meet upon adjournment at 415th the Capitol. That can be seen on our Mr. President. Any other announcements? Senator, the majority of the leader has moved that the Senate's standard adjourned until 10 a.m. Monday. All those in favor of signify by saying aye. All those opposed? No. Aye. It's clear to have it. We're adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
