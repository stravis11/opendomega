title 19 the FIS Cod of Georgia anit
relating to protective order registry so

bill having F committee on Judiciary

recognized to present the Bill thank you
Mr Speaker I Rise here today to present
House Bill
325 um military protective Board of
registry first of all Mr Speaker I want
to thank a couple of of U uh folks that
helped me with this bill and there
they're on my right uh and Deputy adant
General Joe Ferrero and Georgia National
Guard State judge Colonel Brian Bishoff
who drafted the Bill thank you so much
for your service sir thank you also with
the uh chief of military Justice
Lieutenant Colonel Edward pesta uh Mr
Speaker and colleagues this uh hp25
provides the National Guard and its
military judge a mechanism to issue
military protective orders to prevent
deter and punish service member on
service member stalking and protect the
good order and discipline with within
the organization military protective
orders issued by commanders in the
Georgia National Guard do not
sufficiently protect service members
victimized by stalking because Georgia
law does not provide adequate mechanisms
to enforce npos while any commander May
issue npos to a subordinate npos have
significant limitations under their
existing Authority the currently npos
only apply when National Guard Personnel
are military status leaving gaps when
Personnel are not in military
status approximately 85% of our service
members serve in traditional status that
leads 28 days each month where npos are
unforce for most service members at
additionally npos are typically only
enforced on military installations yet
most National Guard Personnel reside off
installations because the limited en
forceably of npos increased risk of
victims so HB 325 seeks to improve
enforcement mechanisms to mitigate the
risk the purpose of HB 325 IS to include
a mechanism under Georgia Code of
military Justice for our state
military's judge to consider verified
petitions for protective orders and
issue enforcable protective orders to
protect stalking victims 24 hours a day
7 days a week the bill extends authority
to the National Guard and our state's
military judge to prevent deter and
punish stalking with similar mechanisms
available in our Superior Courts the
proposed statute only applies to service
member on service member allegations
this bill does not apply to civilian on
service members or service members on
civilian allegations the proposed
legislation addresses service member on
service member stalking to protect a
good order discipline and morale with
the Georgia National
Guard npos will be enforceable through
our military judge and our courts
Marshal this bill gives the military
judge content powers to compel obedience
to npos in the same manner and subject
to the same Li to the same limitations
as authorized in Georgia civilian courts
Provisions include up to 30 days in
confinement and a f of 1,000 under HB
325 npos will be lawful military orders
also subjecting VI uh also subjecting
violators to change and punishments
under the Georgia Code of military
Justice for failing to obey no also the

which mod modernizes captive insurance
regulations captive insurance companies
are bus or are insurance companies that
business is uh start to self-insure
their own business risks there's no
outward facing coverages offered to the
general public at all um it basically
allows businesses are sufficiently C
capitalized to self-insure uh risk with
essentially a very high deductible the
bill permits business owned captives to
accept investor funds which help them
booler reserves aligning with common
reinsurer practices they do not sell
insurance to the public but cover only
the parent company's risk for example if
ABC retailer ABC
manufacturer establishes captive
insurance company they can only Ure
their own risks uh not external entities
also the bill authorizes the
commissioner to approved captiv for
other insurance lines enabling
businesses to partially self-insure
risks ranging from traditional lines

this Bill had reive received the

therefore passed Mr clerk would you read
the caption to House Bill
123 123 house 123 by representative work
high of the 157th and others being
titled act to amend title 17 in the
fishal go to Georgia annotated relating
to criminal procedure s to provide for
pre-trial proceedings in capital offense
cases where the death penalty is sought
this bill have referred to the committee
on Judiciary non- civil that committee
recommends this bill do
pass representative workizer is
recognized to present his
Bill thank you Mr Speaker House Bill
123 there's 40 there's 27 states that
have capital
punishment Georgia is an outlier and
that is the only one that allows those
with intellectual disabilities to be
executed for two reasons and this bill
fixes both of those number one is the
standard of changing it from Beyond A
Reasonable Doubt to a
preponderance of evidence this is what
the other 26 states
do also the only uh thing that Georgia
does is they decide on intellectual
disabilities and at the end of the trial
so think about this after you've heard
two weeks of gruesome details and seeing
things you wish you could
unsee then you're asked to decide on the
in on the intellectual dis disability of
an
individual when in
reality this is not like an insanity or
any other plea this is intellectual
disability is something you're born with
and so you either have ID or you don't
and so this would move to a pre-trial
motion by the
defense and the defense in the state
would get to here go before a decider of
fact which would be the court and they
would decide if the person has an
intellectual
disability and then they would have the
trial portion of the case that is the
two things that the bill does and Mr
Speaker with that I'll yield the well if
there's no questions has a couple of
questions representing silox straight up
the aisle on the right is recognized for
a question thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield absolutely Mr chairman
there was testimony committee that the
state does not seek the death penalty
for individuals with intellectual
disabilities do you believe that to be
true absolutely do not and I kind of
cringe when I heard that and I'm going
to give you one example there's several
in
2015 the state had heard testimony about
Warren
Hill and it was very evident that the
defense had said that he was severely
mentally
and thanks to Scott Hilton his
first freshman bill that that phrase has
been strucken stricken from Georgia Code
throughout the argument was not whether
he had idea or not but whether we should
execute him and the interesting thing is
the seven judges this is about as split
as you could get the Georgia Supreme
Court was split four to3 to execute
Warren
Hill and the interesting thing is three
of the judges pointed
to the 2002 Atkins versus
Virginia when our US Supreme Court
said it violates the eth amendment of
cruel and unusual punishment to execute
somebody with intellectual
disability so those three judges pointed
to that ruling the interesting thing is
the other four judges pointed to that
exact same ruling because also in that
Supreme Court Atkins versus Virginia
they said it violated the eth amendment
but it was up to the states to decide
how to fix it so Virginia Florida Texas
fixed their laws Georgia did
not this will be that fix and I could
point you to other cases of that one as
late as March 30th of last year
but so no I do not believe that thank
you so much for bringing the
bill and gentlemen further yield I'll
take one more representative Reeves to
your right is recognized to speak to the
thank you speak question with the
chairman you for a question absolutely
is it not true that the Catholic
Archbishop from Atlanta came here to the
capitl and as well as many other Faith
leaders to earnestly request this bill
and this bill leaves the death penalty
intact for C blooded Killers who were
not intellectually disabled that is
absolutely true and I've got a letter
from over a hundred religious
organizations who have supported this
bill the Georgia Council on disabilities
and many other
organizations um it does leave for those
who believe in capital punishment it
leaves it intact but not for those who
are intellectually disabled Mr Speaker
I'm going yield to well but I want to as
you and I have a very close friend uh in
Jack Hill who whose favorite saying was
that Turtle did not get on that fence
post by itself and so want to thank a
couple of people who's gone before me
this issue has been fought over for
years Scott Hilton Beth Moore who our
former state representative Brett
Harrell uh Kathy Harmon Christian who
got your attention and sent I guess you
sent her to me um and many other
organizations who have fought to get
this bill passed so I hope we can get it
over to the Senate and get it done thank
you and I ask for your favorable
consideration gentlemen J and well thank
you for your work Mr chairman we have a
couple of
speakers they'll have up to 10 minutes
for your presentations chairman Tyler
Paul Smith has recognized to speak to
the bill House Bill
123 thank you Mr Speaker especially for
the 10 minutes was as slow as I talk
sometimes
uh Mr Speaker members of this August
body I know we're in Rapid Fire but I
would ask that you pay attention to this
bill stand before you today to implore
your support for this great piece of
legislation I want to thank chairman
worker and those that have worked on
this issue for
decades this is not getting rid of the
death penalty for those who do not
suffer from intellectual disabilities
this
legislation not just a procedural
Amendment it's a necessary reform to
uphold the rights of individuals with
intellectual disabilities and ensure
that our Criminal Justice System
operates with both integrity and
compassion we're going to go into the
weeds a little bit here with me but bear
with me on it this legislation
establishes a clear fair and structured
process that allows a defendant to
present evidence of intellectual
disability before trial it ensures that
no individual who qualifies as
intellectually disabled will face the
death penalty preventing the risk of
wrongful
execution furthermore it respects the
role of the Judiciary by granting judges
the authority to make pre-trial
determinations reducing unnecessary
delays and ensuring efficiency in our
Capital
cases beyond the legal
principles legal leads of this this bill
reflects our state's shared
values and our belief in our statement
of wisdom Justice and
moderation we must recognize that
intellectual disability affects an
individual's ability to understand those
complex legal proceedings not to
mention their actions and the results
thereof but to also participate
meaningfully in their defense
House Bill 123 ensures that we do not
punish
individuals who lack the requisite
culpability or for those of you who
study Latin the men's Rea to Warrant the
harshest penalty available under law
that being
death this bill does not eliminate
accountability it actually refines our
justice system to ensure that punishment
is proportional and
appropriate for instance a defendant
found to have an in intellectual
disability will still be subject to life
imprisonment therefore not absolving
them of the responsibility of their
action however this legislation
guarantees that Justice is administered
in a manner consistent with our
constitutional obligations and moral
responsibilities I hope as you join me
in passing this great piece of
legislation that we take this necessary
step towards strengthening the Integrity
of our legal system ensuring due process
preventing the reversible miscarriages
of justice and I appreciate y'all's time
and consideration here today with that
Mr Speaker I'll yield the
will thank you sir gentleman yielded the
well represent Panic recognize speak to
the bill up to 10 minutes I'll take
three
colleagues executing an intellectually
disabled person is not an act of justice
but a moral fail
failure these individuals by definition
are less culpable they cannot fully
grasp the depth of their actions nor can
they navigate the intricate legal system
designed to protect our rights to put to
put them to death is to punish them for
a cognitive limitation that they did not
choose a limitation in in essence a part
of their fundamental human identity
we are not defined by how we treat the
the strongest among us but how we
protect the most vulnerable an
intellectually disabled individual
facing the death penalty is the ultimate
test of our Collective moral character
and I submit that we must choose
compassion over retribution and
understanding over
punishment we have the death penalty in
the state I'm not here to debate it but
if we're going to meet out the ultimate
punishment it should only be for the
worst of the worst and for those we have
spent the time to make
sure understand their
culpability I urge you to vote Yes on
this great
bill I yelled The
Well the lady has yielded the well
that concludes all of our presentations
on House Bill 123 is there any objection

Clerk's Council you may remember this
bill from last year we passed it almost
unanimously and didn't make it to the
Finish Line last year so I brought it
back uh there're 389 municipal courts in
Georgia they're the largest class of
courts in Georgia and they' range from
Atlanta who holds courts multiple times
a day to very small cities that have
courts just once every other month
despite the diversity of these uh
municipalities every Municipal Court
must follow the same rules rules the
same laws and make sure the court has
run properly and respects all the
constitutional rights of its citizens to
assist in standardizing the operation of
municipal courts and further bring
professionalism to the administration of
the courts is very important this bill
brings that confidence and skill to the
profession of Municipal Court clerks to
assist in their best practices they even
plan to create a municipal court clerk
certification uh this is an entity that
will represent the needs of the
municipal courts across the state
develop mentorship programs and training
programs more training allows the
municipal courts to better serve the
public and that's what this bill is all

lever to the 123rd to be entitled an act
to amend subp part two part six of
article 6 of chapter 2 entitled 20 for
the official Cote of George annotator
relating to conditions of employment in
elementary and secondary education so as
to require local school syst to provide
notice to employees regarding Social
Security withholdings this bill referred
to the committee on education that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass representative Leverett is
recognized to present the
Bill thank you m speaker good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen of the house house
bill 37 is like most of my legisl this
year another shot at trying to get
something through the Senate so this was
a bill we passed yesterday off the floor
that requires school districts to give
notice to their employees of of whether
or not they are going to withhold Social
Security if they don't other plans that
might be comparable that they would be
eligible for and then periodically renew
that notice every 5 years and then upon
separation tell them if they have
withheld any social getting a little bit
of a ring here Social Security the
reason for this is school districts do
not have to withhold they do not have to
participate in Social Security they can
opt out and a number of them have so
this is to try to just make sure
employees know the origin of this was
that a retired Educators meeting in my
district one of the members apparently
did not realize the school district she
worked for did not withhold and had a
very unpleasant surprise at retirement
so we're just trying to make sure those
surprises are kept to a minimum and
that's the bill I would greatly
appreciate your support we'll stand for
any
questions gentleman y you have a
question to your left representative
rice yes sir way to your left as
recognized for a question ladies
recognized thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield yes ma'am is it not true
that requiring local school systems to
notify employees about their social
security withholdings and benefit
eligibility promotes transparency and
Trust within our educational
institutions that is certainly my belief
yes ma'am thank you thank you for the
question gentleman has another question
for your you representing Bernal to your
left out front as recognized for our
question yes thank you Mr Speaker those
gentleman yield yes ma'am what would be
an example of the other retirement
benefits that they could get well one
would be teacher retirement for which
many teachers would qualify and there
are other other kinds of plans that some
systems offer or that are available
commercially um so that's that's kind of
what we're just trying to let them make
make them start thinking about
retirement planning if they aren't going
to have social security okay thank you
thank you for the question gentleman has
no further questions thank you ladies
and gentlemen I greatly appreciate your
support for House Bill 37 thank you and

loophole that currently exists in our
code concerning our article 6 probate
Court judges to make sure that the
affidavit they file when qualifying for
the to run for the office that that
matches up with the qualifications
within the statute and so Mr Speaker

amend chapter 23 of title 47 the

as house or again now as another bill
this is House Bill 406 and the clerk uh
really summarized it in reading the
caption although it was initially
assigned to Judy it was later
transferred to retirement this bill
would change the retirement age for
Superior Court judges that are appointed
or elected after July 1 of this year
currently their retirement age like
everybody in I believe they're in Jrs is
60 this would increase it to 65 uh this
is I suppose you would say it's somewhat
of a companion piece of legislation to
the restructuring of the judicial pay
that you passed off the floor earlier
this year this is something the judges
have agreed to uh sort of as a to to
travel with that uh if you will they're
they're asking us to make a greater
State commitment to relieve the locals
of some of the burden of the and this is
a way for them to slightly amarate the
state's uh commitment with respect to
the retirement so it would not apply to
any existing super court judge but would
just apply to Future Super Court judges
it is a non-fiscal retirement bill
because it's going to actually save the
state money so that is basically the um
the bill and it is agreed to by the Su
Court judges Council so I would greatly
appreciate your support and we'll be
glad to answer any questions and
gentleman has no questions thank you
very much ladies and gentlemen as um I
appreciate your support as the former

caption to House Bill
7979 House Bill 79 by representative
Newton of the 127th being titled act to
amend chapter 7 of title 480 the
official Cod of Georgia annotated
relating to income taxes as to provide a
tax credit for certain eligible expenses
incurred for firearm Safe Handling
instructional courses and Firearm secure
storage devices this bill ader the
committee on ways and means that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee
[Music]
substitute chairman Newton is recognized
to present the bill chairman
Newton thank you Mr Speaker it's good to
be back um the house has been engaged
really in a multi-prong effort for a
long time caring for our youth and our
children uh we want to educate them we
want to strengthen families we've worked
hard on foster care and U adoption bills
and I think a little later we're going
to uh work on some bills to try to keep
children safe in an often dangerous
World House Bill 79 is an additional
step in that effort it provides an
option for a tax credit to do two things
to obtain a firearm Safe Handling
instruction course or to obtain a
firearm secure storage
device so House Bill 79 recognizes a few
different things um the firearm deaths
are actually the leading cause CA of
death of Youth and children under
19 even exceeding motor vehicle
accidents it's very important to clarify
that though because over 60% of these
are homicides those are uh felony
criminal actions uh that are already
against the law and that they're
obviously a a major source of of loss of
life very often Gang Related I am proud
of a lot of the work this house has done
to uh to do the Attorney General's tax
uh I'm sorry task force on a gang
activity uh we've done some work to try
to decrease the recruitment of of gang
members and miners we've done working on
that along the way so along with that
increased crime though we've had a lot
of law enforcement challenges later uh
most recently so that's part of the
reason behind the uh safe instructional
uh handling course an instructional
course on Safe Handling of firearms we
want to make sure like many people
didn't grow up hunting or grow up with
Firearms um but they may recognize that
they live in a dangerous area a
dangerous situation and they want to
have the ability to protect themselves
their children and their families so
that's important so this bill allows you
to use part of your $300 tax credit if
you want to to get a a safe handling
instructional course um we want them to
be able to protect their families and
their children these are typically about
$1
$150 uh their in-person courses uh the
second option on this bill which you can
do both is is to obtain a a firearm
secure storage device now remember 60%
over 60% are homicides many of those are
stolen as I mentioned tragically another
30% are suicides and about 10% are
accidental and these are these are in
youth 19 and under um this bill offers
choices to families parents firearm
owners you can get a bedside gun safe
with biometric digital access for about
$100 or you can get Trigger or cable
locks this is an example of a little
quick combination lock that can disable
most any handgun and almost all long
guns as far shotguns rifles as well um
so this bill offers uh choices ways to
secure your Firearms especially when you
have children or maybe neighborhood
children come to visit that weren't
trained like maybe you train your own
children um Grand grandparents that may
not think about this and then of course
we got troubled teens that's almost a
redundant to say that because all of us
were somewhat troubled when we were
teenagers but but it's a challenge and
it is and occasionally gets to the level
of a tragedy securely storing your
Firearms is certainly a responsible
action um
it can be something that can uh
avoid tragedy importantly in this bill
we did put some guardrails around this
we want to make sure that I mean the
Bill of Rights is important to all of us
and the second one of those Bill of
Rights is the Second Amendment the right
to protect yourself and your family so
we want to make sure by making this bill
is voluntary it has no threats of
criminal action or whatever it has a
Prohibition specific prohibition for any
list that's not needed just to
administer the program
uh and so we have put some guardrails
around it that I think are respectful of
your Bill of Rights your second
amendment rights but also allows
responsible gun owners the option that
they need the choices that they need I
think House Bill 79 can both inform the
public and encourage them to utilize
both Safe Handling and safe storage of
firearms and I hope I can get your
support uh as we try to move forward
with this bill Mr Speaker I'm glad to
answer any questions gentleman's going
to answer some question question we have
um five folks who want to uh speak in
favor of the bill and we do have a
couple of questions I'm going to
recognize representative
hering to your left for question
representative thank you Mr Speaker does
the gentleman yield
certainly is it not true that promoting
secure firearm storage through tax
incentives will help prevent accidental
shootings especially among children and
teenagers in Georgia absolutely the lady
knows of what she speak it is it is true
accidental they about 10% and the others
are suicide 30% and 60 over 60%
homicides but thank you so much thank
you for your support representative
Kelly to your left has recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker with the
gentleman yel sure chairman Newton uh
just to clear a few things up isn't it
true that there's nothing mandatory in
this legislation that would require
anyone to do this no it's Absolut
absolutely true this is number one it's
a number completely voluntary program
there are prohibitions on a registry or
list in the bill but once again it's
it's an optional program it may not be
right for everyone but we want to both
educate and inform and encourage the use
of a
responsible Secure Storage and isn't it
further true that I love guns so much
that I'm going to use this tax credit to
buy uh lock box for my Tahoe so that
when my car gets broken to broken into
in Atlanta no one will take my guns out
of it that's a that's I'm excited to see
that there are beginning to be a lot of
U vehicle safes that are biometric for
the people who are driving an area where
they feel they need protection but at
the same time um stolen guns out of
vehicles is probably the leading weapon
used in Gang Related violence and those
60% over 60% of homicides that I
mentioned and so that's going to be a
great choice if you make
it representive for Ana Jones to your
left has recognized for a
question thank you speaker does the Gent
yeld yes ma'am as a gun license holder
and a responsible gun owner I would like
to express my gratitude for this bill
for I lost a cousin because a firearm
was not safely secured is it not true
that house bill 79 does not impose any
restrictions on gun ownership but
instead promotes responsible firearm
storage and handling which benefits all
Georgians I thank the lady thank you
very much for the question she's
absolutely right I look forward to to
moving forward on this gentleman has no
further questions well thank you Mr
Speaker I hope that we can uh we can
take a step forward and and continue to
do things to protect and strengthen our
children and families I appreciate your
support on the bill gentleman yield of
the
well we have five speakers in favor I'm
going to give y'all up to individually s
minutes if you don't need it don't take
it but up to seven minutes I'm going to
start with representative Al Dr Al
you're recognized to speak to the bill
give the lady your attention
please thank you Mr
Speaker today I Rise Again to speak in
support of a bill that incentivizes
responsible firearm ownership and the
Secure Storage of guns I was pleased to
co-sponsor this bill last year when it
passed near unanimously out of the house
and I hope in a few minutes we'll have a
chance to pass it again with just as
much
support I appreciate the good doctor
from Augusta for again sponsoring this
bill and I appreciate the support that
Republican leadership has put behind it
indicating that not only does Secure
Storage work to keep our families safer
safe storage is a gun safety measure
we're willing to put some muscle
behind when we pass this bill today we
can all go home knowing that we did
something good but since I might not get
another chance to do
this I'm going to walk you through some
hypotheticals so what if we passed a
bill offering families vouchers for
buying car seats but we did not also
have a law requiring car seat use for
babies and
children what if we passed the bill
instructing car insurance companies to
offer lower premiums for drivers with
clean records but we didn't also have
speed limits or DUI
laws what if we passed the bill offering
tax credits for swimming lessons and
water safety courses but did not also
require safety fences around public and
private swimming pools in those cases I
think we can recognize how despite all
the good intentions incentives alone do
not work nearly as well as incentives
coupled with
regulation so I want to be clear here
the current bill we are debating HB 79
includes no such requirements Okay this
may in fact be the key selling point for
many so I really want to underline this
point to ensure this bill's passage hb7
does not require any gun owner to do
anything this Omission in my opinion
also highlights the opportunity that
this body has missed year after year
after year and I want to urge us to not
miss this opportunity again gun violence
as Dr Newton noted is the number one
cause of death of kids and teenagers in
this country and there's really no way
around this next thing I'm going to say
which is that a safe storage law is the
most effective way to keep guns out of
the hands of unsupervised minors this
may be An Inconvenient Truth uh but
among friends like ourselves we need to
be honest right we've had a chance to do
better and we have chosen to not do
so yet a few important things that I
want to point out right now many other
similar proun States like Florida like
Texas have stronger safe storage
requirements than Georgia
does yes I said Florida and Texas have
stronger safe storage laws than we do if
they can do it so can we we can respect
and embrace the Second Amendment even
with
regulation in 2020 the American Bar
Association noted and I quote from their
paper safe storage laws are a
constitutional means to protect the
public from preventable SU hides tragic
accidents and crime while respecting
American second amendment
rights and in 2024 just last year our
current conservative Supreme Court also
ruled 8:1 in favor of a bill limiting
certain people's access to guns
indicating that the Second Amendment
rights can exist with limits Chief
Justice John Roberts wrote quote since
the founding our nation's firearm laws
have included Provisions preventing
individuals who threaten physical harm
to others from misusing
Firearms so we we can pass a safe
storage law if we choose to and I know
behind Clos doors because I've had this
conversation for many many years many of
you understand that we should pass a law
like
this so this past September appalachi
high
school was the site of the deadliest
school shooting in Georgia's history the
shooter in that case was only 14 years
old this of course was shocking but what
shocked me more was that hearing that
just a year prior to that Massacre he
and his father had been questioned by
local police on suspicion that he might
do something exactly like this so as
part of this questioning police asked
the father about the then 13-year-olds
access to Firearms right police were
told that yes there were in fact guns in
the home that they used for hunting but
that ammunition was out of the boy's
Reach This encounter took place in
2023 now imagine imagine had we passed a
safe storage requirement earlier that
same year and we did have a chance to do
so ask me how I
know how might that have changed things
well so the police questioning the
father could have said then did you know
that Georgia just passed a law requiring
that guns be accessed guns that can be
accessed by miners be locked up
securely are the guns in your home
stored securely so that your son can't
access them without
supervision can you show
us nothing should haunt us more in this
chamber than a missed
opportunity and nothing should shame us
more than failing to learn from our
mistakes we don't have to miss this
opportunity again we have a chance to do
this now this year and to do the right
thing
so should we pass this bill
h79 absolutely 100% I will be voting yes
and I urge everyone in this chamber to
vote Yes
too I also urge you to push yourselves a
little bit more even though it's hard
you know we often commend the staff and
the students and the families and the
teachers after school shooting for being
brave right and they
are but we can be brave
too right so as we pass HP 79 let's
commit to close that Loop incentivize
responsible behavior while creating a
cult
and an expectation of exactly what that
responsible behavior should look
like here and vote on
hb1 the Pediatric Health safe storage
act you've had a lot of time it's the
first bill that was dropped this session
we still have a little bit of time to do
it you may disagree with hb1 right you
may ultimately vote no on it and that's
that's okay right that's how the
Democratic process works but at least
give the issue issue the respect it
deserves and don't go home today after
passing this current bill HB 79 patting
yourselves on the back and thinking that
we've done enough we have not done
enough so don't walk away from that
responsibility because that is why we
are here thank you Mr Speaker I yield
The
Well the lady has yielded the well
representative Oliver recognize speak to
the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'm grateful for
this opportunity today one of the
benefits of a long political career is
that you have an opportunity to learn
things over time to look at Trends to
look at changes in the law how they came
quickly or not so quickly you have the
opportunity to experience as I have
serving both in the majority party with
leadership roles and in the minority
party without leadership
roles I want to make an argument to you
briefly today certainly less than seven
minutes that the gun safety legislation
in my long political career has been the
most partisan the most
intransient and with devastating
results I have followed these issues
very closely I have been involved in
many different uh efforts to make gun
safety legislation more meaningful and I
want to give you some examples of this
history and some examples what's
meaningful to me of what true
bipartisanship is I have benefited from
bip bipartisan efforts very much I have
appreciated the opportunity to serve
primarily um in the Judiciary Committee
where there is an opportunity for shared
views real bipartisanship is based on an
open mind an intellectual honesty and
mutual respect I learned those skills
had to learn those skills as a young
lawyer in rural Georgia in many
different court systems the judge was
always in charge of my opposing
council's Behavior not me it didn't
matter where my opposing Council was
really bad showed up drunk slept during
the trial and knew less about the law
and my hound dog Henry he is somebody I
was required to respect because only the
judge was in charge of my opponent's
Behavior not myself that gave me some
reasons to believe coming down here that
intellectual
honesty open mind and mutual respect
would be opportunities I could enjoy and
I have enjoyed many of those David
Roston and I came to the Senate on the
same day he he was on a committee I
chaired he came to the committee every
day and for six years we worked together
we both ran for a Statewide office we
both lost we both went home to our law
offices and then we came back I've had a
house in his district for 25 years and I
really missed him this week because I
wanted to tell him that we have a bald
eagle on fighting Town Creek and I
enjoyed sharing that with representative
Chastain here are the bills that we have
not enjoyed a bipartisan positive
opportunity about that we should pass in
the issue of gun
safety red flag laws would prevent
deaths waiting periods would prevent
deaths not abolishing mental health
records after 5 years as we do in
Georgia uniquely would prevent death
background checks would prevent
deaths I served as a magistrate court
judge for several years I was at the
jail on Friday night regularly I saw the
significant impact of gun violence we
live in a gun violence society and
ladies and gentlemen it's gotten
worse I will vote
4.79 the tax credit benefit if I were to
buy was what is uh Amazon's most uh
favored gun safety would save me about
$15 I think but I'm going to vote for it
because it
represents a little bit of change but
I'm going to urge you in an effort to
promote uh intellectual honesty and open
mindness to let's follow the advice of
people like Warren Buffett and many
others that say we can educate ourselves
no matter how old we are we need to
concentrate every week five hours of
reading or a book every week I want to
recommend to you this is a little bit
more gratuitous advice that you read the
American Gun the true story of the
AR-15 written by a Wall Street Journal
reporter on the history of the
AR-15 came out of the World War II
efforts to improve guns to make safety a
higher priority for our
soldiers we need to understand more that
we have failed in the area of gun safety
we need to be more
open-minded and we need to pay attention
please pay attention to the reality that
the number one cause of death today for
children is gun violence thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well
thank you the ladies are yielded the
well representative Roberts has
recognized speak to the bill up to 7
minutes thank you Mr
Speaker today I rise in support of h79
because I think we all can agree putting
a few tax dollars back in georg's
pockets for doing the right thing is
always a good thing and encouraging
investment in safe storage is a step in
the right
direction that said I do hope it's not
the only step this body takes this
session and in the future because
Georgia is now fourth in the country for
weakest gun laws and
correspondingly has the fourth highest
number of gun deaths per year we should
all want to improve those
numbers especially when we recently
experienced what might have been a
ventable school shooting very close to
home right up the road in Winder Georgia
two teachers and two students gunned
down by a
14-year-old who was on law enforcement's
radar known by his family to be a risk
and had access to
Firearms family members of the victims
and survivors from from the appalache
high school shooting have been at the
capital this
session I hope you all took time to
listen to their stories since you're not
listening to
me one high school student School senior
shared her story while she was
here she said and I quote the shooting
started the minutes that followed would
feel like a
eternity in that moment I felt
responsible I still do many of us do I
sat there Frozen terrified unable to
move unable to help if I had moved had
tried I might have been
next let that settle for a minute a math
teacher who was in the classroom next
door to where the shooter killed the
victims recently shared with our caucus
that she is now suffering from PTSD and
two days ago I know y'all are football
fans Mike Hancock resigned as football
coach at appalache citing PTSD anxiety
grief and depression because one of
those killed was Richard aspenwall his
defensive
coordinator this session I have watched
many of you come to this
well pleading passionately and tearfully
and I've cried from my chair with you
some of you have said you need us to
vote Yes even though we can't understand
because we haven't lived what you've
lived through you're right I have not
lived through a hurricane but I voted
with you I have not watched my child
suffer from a rare disease and I hope
none of us do but I voted with you
every year we have citizens from All
Over Georgia come down to this capital
and tearfully plead with you to pass
Common Sense gun safety legislation
parents whose children died accidentally
or committed suicide with a gun that was
not properly stored a
Survivor who has been in this capital in
her wheelchair because her abusive
spouse came after her and shot her
multiple times and families of victims
who lost L loved ones at the hand of
School shooters who projected their
intentions to others in advance of the
tragedy instead of passing policies that
might prevent these tragic deaths some
of you avoid the Rope line when the red
shirts are in the capital and you won't
even grant us a Comm Committee hearing
with a vote on the bills we file for
these grieving and scared
Georgians we know that none of these
bills by themselves will prevent every G
gun death but our constituents deserve
for us to try some of these policies we
know are working in other
states after the tragic Parkland
shooting Florida Citizens pleaded with
the state legislature to pass Common
Sense gun safety bills and they did they
passed a red flag bill they raised the
age of who can own a gun and they
required a mandatory waiting period a
few a few years later in response to an
attempt to repeal that red flag law a
Broward County Sheriff who was a self-
proclaimed Law and Order
conservative I remember the first time I
shadowed somebody before I decided to
run for office and I have done politics
in county and cities as a zoning
attorney I was shocked at how rude this
chamber is to talk when somebody's in
this
well I haven't talked when you been
crying from up here about your
constituents who are hurting and I would
appreciate the same
respect that sheriff shared in an
article that he believed the red law
flag laws were working he said he was
able to stop tragedies before they
happened rather than just respond
afterwards we've now had a tragic school
shooting right here at home Georgians
are suffering and pleading for us to do
something HB 79 is a start but what's it
going to take before this body will
answer the call of 80% of Georgians who
support more impactful common sense
Solutions respectfully a school safety
bill that doesn't require safe storage
is
incomplete this issue should not be
partisan bullets don't pick Democrats
and Republicans the bills my colleagues
and I file to try and address gun
violence are as important to us as yours
providing Hurricane Relief rather than
reciprocate the empathy we show you you
ignore us year after year and then you
claim this issue this more innocuous
bill as your own to claim credit for one
of the first gun safety bills in more
than a
decade step too far many of you often
say to us in the minority party how
happy you are that we can disagree and
still be respectful of each other let me
be clear we respect this chamber and the
honor of this office we all hold but it
hurts us deeply when you disregard our
passionate pleas I will continue to vote
on your legislation with empathy and I
will vote Yes on this bill but we as
members of this house deserve better and
Georgia families deserve
more memb yielded the will
representative Carter is recognized to
present the bill I get to present a bill
yeah I guess you could speak to the
bill you know what I
meant lady will speak to the bill good
afternoon everyone I first want to let
you know that I have come in support of
h79 I love the fact that we have a piece
of legislation that is promoting uh not
only safety but
training if if you're going to own a gun
if you're going to own a firearm you
need to be trained a lot of us did not
grow up with guns but they've become
popular the children want them the
adults want them everybody wants them so
this piece of legislation will also
provide a tax credit for
training we've talked a lot about the
shooting but here's another reason why
it's important that the training is
included can you
imagine
moms having your firearm in your
purse you leave your purse in the car
you run in the store and come back and
your child has shot themselves because
they were rumbling in your
purse well you know what if that Mom or
that cousin or that father or whoever
did that had firearm training maybe that
child would have lived so I hope when we
pass this piece of legislation that we
will will promote it we'll go out and
encourage our is constituents to ensure
that they not only safe uh safely store
their guns but get training because
here's the thing training ensures that
gun owners are educated on responsible
practices for handling and using
Firearms storing them securely in your
home in your vehicle and I'm going to
say ladies in your purse
is critical it's common sense and before
using a gun you should receive
training gun owners can make their homes
and communities safer by storing their
guns securely this means storing them
unloaded locked and separate from
ammunition research shows Secure Storage
practice practices play a vital role in
reducing risk of gun violence storing
firearms securely protects children and
adults and prevented and prevented
unintentional
shootings you may not know this or you
may know this an estimate 54% of gun
owners do not lock their guns
securely
54% every year nearly 360 children under
the age of 18 unintentionally shoot
themselves are someone
else 4.6 million children in the US live
in a home with at least one unlocked and
loaded
firearm guys if we don't do anything
else with gun safety this
session passing this piece of
legislation and offering a credit is a
good step because if we can get people
to be trained to use their firearms and
store them safely I believe that we will
see a reducing crime so I want to say
join me in supporting
hb7 are y The

bill on our supplemental calendar we
have a a couple bills to hear this
afternoon so hope you'll give the folks
in the in the well your attention
as we move forward through the afternoon
so we'll begin with House Bill 268
representative Hol peringer is
recognized to present the bill
representative
Pinger thank you Mr Speaker good
afternoon colleagues I rise today to
present for your favorable consideration
House Bill
268 but before I cover the contents of
this legislation I want to present each
of you with the opportunity this bill
represents
this legislation represents an
opportunity to pass measures today that
will save lives and protect our students
teachers and schools in every corner of
this
state this bill will put in place
proactive early intervention measures
that support the mental health and
well-being of our children and provide
resources for students in crisis
ensuring that we can intervene to make a
meaningful impact on an individual
before A Mental Health crisis escalates
to self harm or the harm of other
students I urge you to keep that in mind
as you consider this
measure last September the bar County
community in our en entire State
witnessed an unimaginable tragedy when
four GE Georgians were taken from us
during a Despicable and senseless act of
violence those Four Georgians were
14-year-old students Mason skir Horn
Christian
Angulo beloved math and dance teacher
Christina iry and Coach Richard
aspenwall
after this tragedy speaker Burns along
with the members of this house committed
the championing of legislation that
bolster school security mandate stronger
communication between our schools state
agencies and law enforcement and
provides critical Mental Health
Resources to our students that's exactly
what HB 268 will
accomplish first HB 268 creates
increased Mental Health Resources for
students in every Public School District
across the
state these resources include new
positions Behavioral Health coordinators
in our systems as well as grants to fund
these
positions secondly this legislation
addresses several critical needs to
strengthen school security and filling
gaps and communication that were
revealed following the events at
appalache high
school HB 268 requires relevant student
records including academic and
disciplinary records to be shared
quickly and efficiently when a student
transfers between school districts we
know that a lack of information sharing
occurred with the accused shooter at
appalache and this measure measure
directly addresses that breakdown in
communication third HB 268 will require
a structured multi-disciplinary process
to identify assess and mitigate
potential threats while supporting the
safety and well-being of students and
staff this includes requiring schools to
adopt behavioral threat assessment
management teams also called bams to
identify and manage potential threats at
the school
level gima will also expand their
Statewide behavioral threat management
operational process to provide technical
assistance and training to local school
systems helping them develop and
Implement effective threat management
teams and
policies this will help ensure that
students who may be facing a mental
health crisis receive the resources and
support they need when they need it
most next to continue fostering inter
agency communication and communication
between school districts HB 268 creates
a Statewide information sharing system
that is used to collect integrate and
analyze data related to threats against
school safety the school and student
safety database are
S3 this includes the incident records of
students who have made a threat or engag
in other threatening or criminal
behavior that members of a school's bam
team
deems Rises to a standard that would
initiate entrance into the S3
database I want to be very clear not
every student in our state will have an
S3 data record in fact the vast majority
of students will never have a record in
the S3 database
Bas S3 would also meet the highest
security standards and only individuals
on local bam teams and designated school
and GMA Personnel would have access to
the S3 student record parents can also
request to review this data at any
time next we know that students feel
comfortable in safe sharing information
and voicing concerns on their devices
that's why HP 268 requires schools to
adopt the use of an anonymous reporting
app that meets certain standards
finally this bill increases the penalty
for terric threats and requires the
immediate removal and placement in
online learning of a student who makes a
terroristic threat until law enforcement
and the BAM team deem it safe for that
individual to return to
school this approach balances the
immediate need to secure the safety of
other students while providing an
opportunity for the student who made the
threat to be assessed and received the
resources they may
need colleagues HB 268 is a result of
months of collaboration between me of
this house state agencies Law
Enforcement Officers Educators School
administrators and parents whose number
one concern is the safety of our
students I will once again reiterate
this bill and the resources it creates
will save lives we have an opportunity
today to change the narrative
surrounding mental health put in place
measures that will have positive
lifelong impact on Georgia's children
and take proactive steps to ensure a
tragedy like what happened at appalachi
high school never happens again in our
state
I'm honored to stand before you today
and ask for your favorable consideration
of House Bill
268 Mr Speaker I'll yield the well if
there are no questions there is a
question uh chair recognizes
representative Clark for a
question to your
left thank you madam speaker does a
gentleman yield I do so I received a lot
a lot of emails about this bill and one
of the concerns that I received from a
lot of parents was about the privacy of
the information that is being shared um
you know across these schools um I
didn't hear you really speak on the
Privacy part could you expound on how
we're making sure that this data is not
going to get into the hands of people
who necessarily shouldn't see this data
sure so all all the data records are um
under Hippa and furpa compliance and not
every person in a school system is going
to have access to all the records it's
on a need to know so you're only going
to have access to a student's records if
you're their classroom teacher or an
administrator somebody directly involved
in the education of that child and does
the gentleman further you I do um what
about um students that have like a 504
plan or an IEP um for um disciplinary or
mental health um issues um how are we
making sure that um they are I guess not
necessarily being labeled as the quote
bad kid corre because of something that
might actually be diagnosed so thanks to
representative glaze we've had we mitted
the billing committee to directly
address that so similar to if they have
a behavioral issue now they have a man
manifestation meeting so in the ban
meeting if a child with a 504 or an IEP
were to be referred to the B Tam team
someone um intimately involved in in
creating their 504 or IEP will be um a
member of that Team all right thank you
very much thank you the chair recognizes
the majority leader of stration for a
question thank you madam speaker the
gentleman yiel I do sir is it not true
that this legislation will provide local
school systems with the necessary
resources and guidance to effectively
manage and mitigate potential threats
that's absolutely correct thank you for
bringing the bill sir thank you there
are no more
questions I yield the well gentleman has
yielded the well the chair
recognizes representative
McQueen uh to speak to the
bill okay at the speaker's discretion
the opposition will have 15 minutes
total as will uh those speaking in favor
of the bill
thank you madam speaker colleagues I
rise today to confess that I have read
this bill more than I've read any bill
this session I approach reading bills
the same way I teach my students to
approach a complex test or assessment I
read every bill at least three times
each with a different purpose round one
is for feelings with some of the
legislation we've seen this year that's
a necessary step for me I read the words
I feel what I feel and I move on round
two is for facts what is actually here
what is this bill saying and just as
important what is it not saying and
finally round three is for questions
where are the gaps what doesn't add up
now usually that third reading wraps
things up maybe a fourth pass at most
but with House Bill 268 I lost count
because the more I read the more
questions I had and the first question
was simple what what exactly are we
doing here we are being asked to create
a statun student surveillance database a
watch list for children readily
available for law enforcement access the
talking points meant to be reassuring
are this isn't a watch list it's just a
safety tool we track attendance we track
grades why not this because this is
different this isn't neutral
data this is subjective labeling
deciding which children are considered a
threat Based On A Feeling a perception a
judgment so then I wonder well who makes
that call and once a child is flagged
how long does that label follow them
does a 10-year-old who gets written up
for acting out at fifth grade recess
stay in this system until they're 18
applying for college when they apply for
a job I went back to the bill looking
for guard rails looking for limits
looking for Clear criteria to answer
those basic questions and while the
supplement to this bill now includes an
appeal process a path for parents to
challenge a recommendation to the school
level behavioral threat assessment
management team
bam what happens to the students who
don't have someone to make that appeal
what about students in foster care the
students whose Guardians are absent or
unavailable the students navigating the
system alone because an appeal process
on paper means nothing if there's no one
to file it and I looked for language
that accounted for them protections for
students without Advocates alternative
safeguards to make sure no child slips
through the cracks and unfortunately I
found nothing and so then I thought well
surely there must be strict controls on
who can see this information because if
we're creating a list like this the
first concern has to be privacy so I
went to the bill looking for answers
looking for Clear en forcable limits on
who can access this database on how the
information is shared and on how long a
student's name can stay in the system
and and I found in lines 136 through 138
of the original that quote any sharing
of Student Records shall comply with the
federal family education rights and
Privacy Act furpa and it's implementing
regulations in quote and that's it and
the concern here is that furpa has broad
exceptions especially when safety is
invoked under furpa if a school official
believes there's a threat they can share
they can share personally identifiable
information from Student Records without
parental consent and with nearly any
outside party they claim has a
legitimate educational interest so under
this bill once a child is flagged what's
stopping that information from
circulating between schools law
enforcement state agencies and Beyond so
I kept looking I searched for any extra
guard rails this bill might put in place
limits Beyond furpa clear restrictions
to prevent overreach or use I looked for
language that says who exactly can see
this information I looked for language
that says how long this data stays on
file and again I found nothing so now
I'm wondering why do we even need this
because here's the thing we already have
information sharing tools between
schools and law enforcement right now
under existing Georgia law if there's a
credible threat schools are fully
empowered to notify authorities
coordinate responses and share necessary
records to Pro to protect students and
staff and even when considering that in
many rural areas information sharing
might not be happening as smoothly as it
should that some districts May lack the
Personnel technology or relationships to
coordinate effectively the question
becomes whether this bill fixes these
issues does this bill fund training to
strengthen Partnerships between school
and law enforcement does it provide
resources for Rural districts to develop
communication plans does it offer grants
to improve existing systems rather than
forcing every District into a one- siiz
fits-all state database I went looking
for those answers in the bill and once
again I found nothing no new protections
no new powers no new resources just
another layer another government system
another database to maintain with all
the risk that comes with collecting
sensitive data on children and none of
the benefit so even if we accept the
premise that some districts need help
coordinating School safety responses
this bill does not address that problem
it does not provide a solution it just
builds a new system on top of the gaps
that already exist without actually
closing them so if the information is
already flowing where it needs to in
most areas and if this bill does nothing
to improve coordination where it isn't
then why are we building this machine
and who's paying for all of this because
we know this isn't free the technology
the training the maintenance the
security and yes school safety is worth
the cost we could find the money later
and schools could just get started now
but we've heard that promise before and
it's always the schools with the fewest
resources who are asked to stretch the
furthest so I looked in the bill for
funding streams for grants for
Appropriations for anything that
acknowledges the cost we're dumping on
these districts and again nothing so
when I went looking in the bill for the
oversight where is the back stop to
ensure this system isn't misused there
are references to the Chief privacy
officer in lines 126 through 130 of the
original but does the CPO have
independent Authority can they stop
misuse remove false entries protect
students in real time yet again nothing
to be found the Chief privacy officer
advises they consult but they do not
control this system they do not have the
power to intervene when a student is
wrongfully flagged they do not protect
these children from the consequences of
a label that may follow them
indefinitely and all of this brought me
to my one last question what happened to
local control we hear about it
constantly in this chamber the wisdom of
letting parents and local Educators make
the decisions closest to their students
and yet here we are voting on a bill
that creates a one-size fits all
Statewide mandate that forces every
District into the same system whether it
works for their students or not school
safety requires consistency but safety
does not mean sacrificing local wisdom
it does not mean stacking one system on
top of another and pretending that's
progress so colleagues I ask you this if
this bill does not protect privacy if it
does not provide funding if it does not
respect local control and if it
duplicates work that schools and law
enforcement are already doing then what
are we doing if the goal is real safety
let's fund the people who do the real
work let's hire more counselors more
social workers let's invest in mental
health care and conflict resolution but
if the goal is simply to say we did
something regardless of whether it truly
works then let's at least be honest
about that and to be clear I want to
recognize the work of the sponsor and
the committee I see the efforts to
respond to concerns raised about the
original bill I see the Amendments I see
the attempt to build in some guard rails
and I appreciate those steps but
colleagues there is so much more work to
do so I strongly urge you to consider
everything I've laid out here as you
make your vote thank you speaker I a
yield the well ladies yielded the will
representative Sanchez is recognized to
speak to the bill represent
Sanchez thank you Mr
Speaker I stand here today to oppose
House Bill 268 not because I don't
support the intent of helping our
students in keeping them safe it's
because I want to keep our kids safe
that I am opposing this
bill as of one only two genz legislators
here and as someone who was in high
school in the last decade I have
experience what it's like to go to
school in the modern environment of mass
shootings and the fears and anxieties
that that comes
with there are many things to speak up
on this bill including some things that
in isolation I would
support but of the over 60 Pages there
isn't nearly enough on mental health and
there's too much on surveillance
overcriminalization and the invasion of
privacy of our students and their
families testimony was heard in
committee from multiple parents who are
afraid of what this bill could do to
their children parents whose children
have already had to face racial
discrimination in our schools some
students have been labeled terrorists
and bared for participating in student
elections simply because a principal did
not understand a movie reference another
student was simply discussing guns and
had to be suspended for 3 Days to
appease racial animosity from other
parents this bill will exacerbate cases
like this where ignorance man
misunderstandings and straight up
Prejudice cause students to be punished
for doing nothing wrong this bill
requires records of disciplinary actions
to follow students wherever they go even
if they're not criminal actions it is
also makes it much easier for law
enforcement in the government to have
access to these records and undermine
parents rights to deny such requests
even despite some of the Amendments
made as the Intercultural development
research Association has noted
discipline is very often conflated with
security the records being referenced in
this bill are discipline records not
security risk
records and they are using these
discipline records to label children as
threats we're talking about children as
threats idra states that the existing
disparities in school discipline
processes and systems across the state
mean that right now black children are
three times more likely than their white
peers to be disciplined in Georgia
Public Schools even though black
students are not more likely to
misbehave additionally students with
disabilities are one and a half times
more likely to be punished we cannot
allow these unjust disparities to turn
into a permanent setback for students
through the system this bill is trying
to create and if I may I'd like to share
a personal story about my time in school
in 2008 the recession made my family
lose everything and we had to move to a
completely different community and shove
ourselves into a small
apartment with a family of five it was a
hard year for us and for me and in that
year I got into three fights at the new
school that I was in and I got written
up for them mind you I was a straight A
student and a year later I was in
student
government but what would have happened
if this bill was enacted
then what would have how would that have
impacted how my teachers viewed me or
the opportunities that I would have
received
between fourth and 10th grade I went to
six different
schools and if this bill was enacted
then that record would have followed me
through those
schools why are we essentially creating
a criminal record for
students you know what that would do to
students who are struggling to better
themselves a study demonstrated multiple
Studies have demonstrated the bias that
happens from Educators and they showed
that Educators that perceive students as
lower performing treat those students
differently than they do who students
who they perceive to be higher
performing to the detriment of those
lower performing
students so what do you think this bill
will do if you see a student who has a
essentially criminal record attached to
them through this S3
database what do you think will happen
to students who have one bad day follow
them for the rest of their educational
life we should not punish children who
haven't even committed a
crime this will disproportionately
impact students from working families
who are struggling to get by single
parents who have to work and can't be as
involved in their children's education
or both parents who work to make ends
meet and as referenced earlier black and
brown students are traditionally overp
policed and marginalized and will
disproportionately be impacted by this
legislation this bill unnecessarily
punishes students who are just trying to
do better and makes it even harder for
those who are behind to get
ahead and it also does not do nearly
enough to stop school
shootings I would speak in support of
this bill if it significantly expanded
access to mental health Cal
Professionals in our schools if it
looked as students as human beings that
they are instead of trying to
criminalize them for things they might
or might not do in the
future I would support this bill if it
gave parents the ability and the tools
to be more involved in their children's
lives if teachers were given more
resources in tackling the Mental Health
crisis if they were paid more for that
work if this bill was investing in
programs to help kids to help parents to
help schools to help our
communities I would fully support this
legislation but this bill does not do
nearly enough of this instead of helping
our students it hurts them it
criminalizes them it polies them it
curtails their civil rights their rights
to a safe School environment and their
rights to
privacy it also certainly ignores a
issue behind the Appalachia school
shooting which is guns I was 2 years old
when the mass shooting a m High School
happened I was also two years old when a
month later the Georgia the Heritage
High School shooting happened in
Georgia and now nearly 26 years later
hardly anything has been done around
this issue now I know we just passed the
legislation earlier and I am glad that
we passed House Bill 79 but we need so
much more to ensure the safety of our
students and of our
communities our students are less safe
now guns have become the number one
cause of death for our children and we
have all we've been doing is offering
thoughts and prayers and bills that
criminalize black and brown children
children like me when I was in
school so I please urge you to vote no
on this
legislation I am a example of someone
who would have been considered gentlem
we'll wrap up we have another speaker if
you don't mind thank you thank you Mr
Speaker I yield the well thank you sir I
appreciate your
accommodating represent representative
Roman is recognized to speak to up four
minutes the L's
recognized thank you Mr Speaker
colleagues today I rise in opposition to
this bill and I take no pleasure in
doing
so when I was in high school
specifically when I was in driver ed I
got pulled out of class by my teacher
who proceeded to interrog me to make
sure that I and my family was not part
of any terrorist
organizations and I kind of laughed it
off because I didn't know what else to
do because you know when you're a kid
you don't know your civil rights
nobody's given you a know your rights
you know seminar nobody's taught you the
law nobody's told you how to talk back
to your teacher that way which I never
had problems with it's just in that
situation I don't know what to do and I
kind of laughed at off but I found out
it was because he'd overheard about
where my family and I come from that was
it all it took took was for him to
overhear a conversation by another set
of students for him to think that I was
a danger to my
classmates I didn't have a record I
didn't have any trouble in school in
fact I was one of those students that
was so obsessed with getting straight
AIDS I stayed up all night studying I
was in the IB program I graduated I went
to college and somehow I ended up
here and so when we talk about bills
like this and you've heard from my other
colleagues as well about how we continue
to think that by further criminalizing
students and further surveilling them
and and further doing all these things
that will somehow fix the problems of
Our
Generations I don't think we will in
fact I think the more we Harden our
schools the more we Harden our hearts
the more that we continue to perpetuate
this lack of trust this lack of care the
more that we are unable to address the
most fundamental reasons behind child
neglect the more we are going to see
these issues so I don't want to belver
the point I just wanted to make sure
that you all understood why some of us
are going to be opposing this piece of
legislation it's not because we don't
care it's not because we don't want to
prevent any further tragedies it's not
even because we don't think that there
aren't any good policies in this bill
it's just because I know that sometimes
we want to rush and make sure we get
something done anything done that we
inadvertently hurt the most vulnerable
among us so I hope you will reconsider
and if not thank you for listening thank
you Mr Speaker I yield The Well the lady
has yielded the well the chair
recognizes speaker Burns to speak to the
Belt thank you madam
speaker members I come before you
today to speak to one of the most
important bills we will consider I
believe the most important bill that we
will consider this
session the safety of our children
our school children an obligation that I
know each and every one of you in this
room takes very very
seriously first I want to thank the two
gentlemen and all of you who have worked
on this
bill representative PR singer I know
this is personal to
you chairman Irwin thank you for your
time your efforts to hear from
everyone in this community involved in
this tra in this
conversation 65
pages of careful
thought put together a plan that I
believe addresses the
issues that have been spoken to by my
colleagues here and I and I very much
respect their thoughts
addresses the issues that I've heard
from a lot of different
sources I believe this bill brings
common sense to school
safety the security of our children
we're having a great conversation about
literacy you can't
learn if you're not in a safe and secure
environment that's what we're about
today that's what this effort is about
you will be in a few
moments given the opportunity to cast
your vote again on one of the most
impactful piece of legislation that we
begin the journey on begin the journey
on and that's on school
safety it's not the last time we will
work on this
issue our
children
demand that we address this issue
thanks to this
body thanks to the governor thanks to
the
Senate the general assembly has invested
over aund will invest $150
million into local control for school
safety that's a strong commitment
thank you to the members of this body
for standing strong your
commitment putting your dollars where
your words are ensuring that we uh we
reach
out to all of the components of this
problem law
enforcement parents and we've done that
we talked to parents from all over this
country that have been been impacted by
the tragedies of school
shootings we visited with the
parents and law
enforcement from appalache in Bara
County so we could understand exactly
how we should address the
issue we visited with school
boards
superintendents administrators from
every
level all of them committed to school
safety today we have an opportunity to
be committed to school
safety our children demand no less our
future demands no less
Communications sure Communications are
important they're very important when
the student transfers into a new
school and the receiving school does not
have the information on that student not
an invasion of privacy
but just information on how you deal
with the all the issues that young
people can face today that all people
can face there should be no Stigma when
it comes to mental health issues this
house has been committed and will
continue to be committed to deal with
mental health issues not only in schools
but in our society I'm proud of that and
I bet y'all are too that effort will be
no less in our school
systems as we allow systems to
communicate again just good old common
sense to know what issue what the issues
are and what steps need to be
taken I do
believe I do
believe that
Georgia and
Georgians have a bright future when it
comes to
education I know that to be the case
that
future our
future your children your grandchildren
my grandchildren again deserve no less
to to be able to drop be able to be
dropped off at school by their parents
by their
grandparents with
theity that they will have a safe
environment to learn during the
day and then to be picked up in be
picked up when school ends and after
afternoon this legislation will
strengthen our Mental Health Resources
and our school systems allowing our
schools to work together provide every
student provide every student and what
to help meet their needs when it comes
to issues that may be impacting them at
home and in
school I
believe this
legislation will usher in a new culture
in our school systems
where where we run
towards run towards our children facing
struggles whether it be mental health
because we've done that we try to do
that but many times we've also run away
from those issues it's time we turn that
around we provide the resources we're
doing that we will do that in our
budgetary items would strengthen those
School resources I see friends from all
over the state that in different levels
of of school administration
that understand these issues they've
supported what these gentlemen have put
together what the committee has put
together but we've work so hard
on I believe again it will provide this
legislation Pro provide every child in
this state with a safe and secure method
to secure their concerns I truly believe
that's the
case in addition it will keep Georgia
students safe
and as members of this
body I don't believe we have any higher
obligation if you will no high no higher
calling than to do just that Madam
speaker I yield the well the gentleman
has yielded the well is any objection to
the previous question being ordered the
chair here's none the previous question
is ordered the chair recognizes chairman
Irwin for the Chairman's
time thank you madam chair let me first
begin today by telling you rarely in
this chamber do we get the opportunity
to save lives this bill gives you the
opportunity to save lives and we need to
do that in today's environment let me
tell you in my whole career in education
I've witnessed it not only as a student
but as an educator
how difficult it is to
learn and how much more difficult it is
to learn if it's not a secure
environment we must secure the
environment of all of our
schools we must have plans we must be
prepared then we must move on to
educating the children to the level that
we expect every single day for our
teachers to
work I'm going to ask you to vote Yes on
this
bill to save lives and those lives after
you vote on this bill you won't even
know you saved it because the team
stepped
up and were proactive with the
situation and they were able to either
prevent it or catch it before it got in
the door and created the violence
that are so often seen within our
schools
today I'm GNA say it again our students
deserve a safe and secure
environment what this bill does because
I've heard quite a bit about what it
doesn't do and who it doesn't look at
and who maybe they thought it looked at
but it assists students with the mental
health and the behavioral health that
they need we're putting coordinators in
there for the first time in school and
they're going to connect kids to
services that they need when they're in
crisis school systems have been asking
for this and they've been paying for it
for themselves for years and bringing in
groups and bringing in the
expertise we're putting together the
agencies that have the expertise in this
state
to come coordinate with teams work with
teams to secure that
environment that could be GMA that could
be the sheriffs that could be gbi all
these groups are not only communicating
for the first time together as a team
but they're coming in to secure that
environment one most important thing I
think this bill
does it provides for the transfer of
student data between schools at a very
accurate good measure by which we know
those students that are moving between
schools how we can help them immediately
when they come in the door not two or
three weeks later when part of the
records come
in but immediately when they come in the
door
it develops that team I talked about
which is a behavioral threat assessment
management team at each individual
school that can set a threat
level and decide is that a credible
threat or is that just to sit down with
that student and have a conversation
threat that is preventative folks just
like the mental health is preventable
and we can deal with it when it comes in
and then we can assist those children
through it well before they get their
hand on any violence inside their
mind colleagues I can tell you I I
absolute hated to have to travel around
this state today talking about this
topic and it was because of what I had
seen that occurred not
only in bar County in that school system
but what I had seen some in my
career but I will tell you the Educators
all the agencies that we dealt with that
we called in Behavioral
Health um
gima Everybody sat down and developed a
plan that will
work we didn't leave anybody out
we asked everybody to get
together and I could see it in the
hearts of the people in the room that
are parents that are
grandparents hey it's all about
protecting our
kids and we need to do what it takes
today to support that team to protect
our kids in the future and save lives
that you don't even know you've saved so
colleagues I can't get more clear than
this Save a Life
Today Vote for This Bill thank you Mr
Speaker the gentleman has yielded the
well is there any objection to the
previous question being

all those opposed will vote no and Mr
clerk will you unlock the machine
so I'm doing who's
first have all members
voted for what purposes representative
Campbell
rise Mr Speaker
parliamentary inquiry state
inquir is it not true while I support
this sincere and solid first step in
protecting our
students um but as respectfully the
speaker pointed out out of 65 Pages
20,240 words on
2,377 lines the number of times a gun or
for guns is mentioned is zero the number
of times a firearm or Firearms mentioned
is zero and the number of times the
shooting mentioned is
zero the number of times gun safety
training is mentioned is
zero and is it not true that we still
have an enormous opportunity ahead of us
to make this bill exponentially stronger
with additional work and hearings in
this session
to implement gun safety
storage I'm sure the lady believes very
strongly in what she just stated and
this is as I said this is a step in the
right direction and we are hopefully
these members of this body will be
committed to school safety in this bill
House Bill 268 and we'll give you a
chance to show that support in just a
moment for what purposes representative

House Bill 551 by representative Ridley
of the 6 to be entitled an act to amend
title 40 the fish go to George annotator
relating to motor vehicles and traffic
so as to provide for conditions
procedures and limitations for issuance
of temporary operating permits for Motor
Vehicles this bill that referred to the
committee on motor vehicles that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee
substitute representative Jason Ridley
is recognized to present house bill 51
thank you Mr Speaker this bill is out to
fix a problem that we've been working on
for four or five years now and it's got
to do with a temporary operating permits
the little stickers that whenever you
see new cars and also the misuse and
illegal handling of dealer tags I know
y'all have all seen it around people
driving around in Ferraris and
everything else with a dealer tag on
them and what this build right here
seeks to do is stop that we've had um
number of occasions where people come to
Georgia they get a dealer license they
go back to New York New Jersey that's
kind of the kind of the Hub where this
is happened they'll print out the dealer
tags the little stickers like you bought
a new car and they're using those to get
around and use in crimes and stuff and
they're selling those for $150 or $250 a
piece to a criminal organization so what
this does is this is going to basically
move some of the parts of it under the
Department of Revenue uh the Ed carard
dealer board uh where they'll have
access to VIN numbers to be able to
track these it also prevents Brokers uh
if you're a true broker meeing that you
don't actually hold a title to the car
you're just use you're just the in
between person between a buyer and a
seller you won't be able to get a used
car tag um and that kind of is what the

14 entitle 40 the fish cod of Georg an
relating the speed detection devices so
as to repeal all laws relative to
enforcement of speeding violations in
school zones through the use of
automated traffic enforcement safety
devices this bill I referred to the
committee on motor vehicles that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass representative Washman is
recognized to present the bill give the
gentleman your attention
please well thank you Mr
Speaker and Mr Speaker let me say I
appreciate very
much if you give the gentleman your
attention there a lot of communication
notot of
discussion proceed now didn't thank you
Mr Speaker and Mr Speaker I want to
express my appreciation to you for
letting me bring uh this bill and
present it to the
house house bill 225 ceased to
repeal the use of automated School
cameras and school zones in
Georgia this bill seeks to reverse the
bill that was passed in
2018 which was well-intentioned but the
evidence clearly shows now that this
bill or this these operation of these
cameras has not improved Public Safety
but have instead become a highly
profitable Revenue stream for private
corporations and local
governments the evidence is they do not
improve safety that corporations take a
massive cut of the revenue and that it
is often seen as very unfair
ticketing that praise don't sometimes on
the least uh able in our society to pay
these fines the other issue is as a lack
of due process there's some
constitutional concerns that have been
expressed repeatedly and the truth is
our people when they're ticketed have uh
no they have no way to contest uh the
tickets we believe there are better
Alternatives uh for Public Safety let me
just tell you I want to go off on my
written comments for a minute and just
tell you my history with this and why
I've become so passionate about it
before I tell you that chairman Allen P
will be presenting a bill in a few
minutes that is more of a a fix it Bill
to add guard rails to try to correct
some of the problems that exist I will
be voting yes on chairman Powell's bill
I believe that my bill is a good
proposal to ban these School cameras and
I'm going to plead my case with you for
that but I will be voting voting yes on
chairman Powell's bill because I want us
to send two bills to the Senate and hope
that we can get something done to
address this problem let me give you the
history a couple of years ago or about
over a year ago I began to get
complaints from constituents about these
schools on cameras and ticketing they
were receiving at first I thought they
were just folks that were mad because
they got a ticket and then a weekly
newspaper in our area the Monroe County
making reporter began to do some
investigative work and I discovered that
in bib County that they had issued uh
fines or had collected fines of $6.5
million and I began to hear more and
more complaints from my constituents
about it so as I began to investigate
that I decided I want to introduce the
bill to call for the ban of these
cameras when I did that I then
discovered that it was not just a making
issue it was a Statewide issue and the
evidence is overwhelming by the work of
two television stations in Atlanta done
a lot of Investigation
work um ANF I believe it is and Fox 5
have done a lot of investigative work
last year one of those stations did some
work that showed and they documented
that $12 million had been collected
across Georgia $112
million over a year ago so today we
think I believe that we can safely say
that fines have been have been issued
uh at a level of in excess of $200
million the schools on cameras are
taking a percentage of that using a
conservative estimate they've probably
taken $50 million out of Georgia and put
it into their
pockets ladies and gentlemen these these
uh the stories abound about the
unfairness of the ticketing and how it
operates and hide
works it is unfair and when someone has
a unpaid ticket they won't be able to
renew their
tag after I made the announcement that I
was going to drop a bill to ban these
cameras I had an email from a lady in
Mon and she said thank you so much for
doing this I worked with a lot of low
income people I have had to help four
ladies recently pay Their fines one of
them could not get their tag renewed
because of an unpaid
fine ladies and gentlemen I told the
majority leader in the Sation one day
about I said Mr leader I've had one of
these
tickets I said but I can afford to pay
the
$100 but ladies and gentlemen I'm going
to ask you to look up here for a
minute this is what I used to do when I
T real estate when something's important
I'd say please look up here for a
minute I can afford to pay the
$100 but there's a lot of little Waffle
House waitresses and cleaning ladies and
construction workers and even some
school teachers who have a hard time
paying that $100 fine and for them
that's $100 that might be needed to feed
their
children ladies and gentlemen it is
wrong to allow these camera companies to
take the kind of money they're taken out
of
Georgia it is wrong for them to be
taking the money out of the pockets of
Georgians who are often entrapped with
these schools on
cameras it is also wrong that they're
taking the kind of money they're taking
out to put into their corporate
Pockets I urge you to vote with me or to
vote for this bill to ban the schools on
cameras in
Georgia I ask for your favorable
consideration Mr Speaker I will yield
for any questions the gentleman has a
couple of questions representative
Griffin to your right is recognized for
a question represent Griffin with a
gentleman y I will isn't it true that
you and I represent two of the the
counties in uh legislative district yes
we do and isn't it true that I support
you on this bill for a number of reasons
and one of those reasons is that we
don't know where the money is going
to and that there are a number of things
that should be done and put in place to
to make
this uh from the standpoint of the the
the lights and the speed zones and Etc
if they if we want to make that
something that should be in the school
zones then it should be better than what
we have seen at least in our
area that is a good assessment uh
Senator I appreciate your comments
chairman Powell's bill will be coming in
a minute does seek to reign in some of
the problems and as I said earlier I
will vote Yes on his bill but I I do
believe that the best course of action
is to ban these cameras in
Georgia another question Mr Speaker yes
sir the gentleman you represent Al
Williams to your left right up front is
recognized for a question thank you Mr
Speaker will the gentleman yield
absolutely for my friend is it not not
true that had it not been for your
effort and your
tenacity that this discussion would not
be going
on well you're kind to observe that I I
won't take all the credit I appreciate
the speaker letting me bring the bill
and others who have spoken for that is
it with the gentleman you absolutely is
it not further
true that I don't know what's going to
happen but something is going to happen
far too too many Georgians have spent
money when there was no problem during
2:00 in the day of our children being on
the streets so no matter what happens
here thank you for your effort and
making this a major conversation thank
you thank you sir and thank you for
mentioning that I did not spend much
time on the abuses but there are many
abuses and they reported often thank you
for that comment will park is recognized
for our question thank you Mr Speaker
does the gentleman yield I do for the
whip um representative is it not true
that while I appreciate your passion as
I've uh shared with you earlier you know
I think this bill goes too far and
repealing all school's own cameras and
is it not further true that I think
there may be a rule substitute on our
desk that may be something that provides
appropriate safeguards to again ensure
that our schools um and our school zones
and the children in them are protected
is that not true it is true that I
believe it is best to ban them it is
also true there's another bill coming
that seeks to rain them in and I should
say also I am never suggesting that
every community that is using these
cameras is abusing them the way some are
but I do believe that at taking $200
million uh what the estimate is and it's
a good estimate I think we cannot allow
them to be used in some communities
where they are not being abused and the
rest of Georgia be penalized at the rate
they're being penalized for
that gentlemen you go for another
question or yes sir I will
representative SS is recognized for a
question to your left there
representative Washton does the
gentleman yield I do is it not true that
I appreciate that the reason for the
gentleman to bring this up is because of
its misuse but that these public safety
tools do have the potential to ensure
that officers aren't on the street Ure
a uh traffic laws are followed and
instead in the school system ensuring
that our targets are hardening and out
in in the service in our community
responding to
calls I believe I understand the
question and that is that these cameras
can be used effectively to to uh prevent
the need for police officers there I
will say that the evidence is clear
there are ways to control speed in in
school zones and often the case of
flashing lights warning lights the
trouble is often tickets are being
written when the lights are not flashing
and so there are abuses there in place
but thank you for the
question representative Dawson is
recognized for question to your left
representative Washman thank you yes uh
does the gentleman yield I do is it uh
not true that I shared with you in my
city the city of South Fon which
actually raises the most funds of any
municipality using these cameras is it
not true that I shared with you that I
was on the scene the day that a young U
Middle School student was killed by a
speeding driver and that we have since
um initiated cameras that prevent these
type of
accidents I don't recall that you shared
that with me but certainly it is is a
terrible tragedy whenever a child is
killed but I will I must say that there
are there is little evidence that the
cameras would have prevented that
tragedy thank
you gentleman has a couple more
questions yield is he I'll be glad to
take them Mr Speaker representative
Hefner right up that to your left in the
back is recogniz Speaker this the
gentleman y yes ma'am is it not true
that I support this bill because as the
motor vehicle registration director in
Richmond County you and I had
conversations about how much time and
how much money was allocated for me to
hire outside attorneys to un mangle
these situations when those cameras
issue tickets in error to Residents in
my County sir yes ma'am that is true
thank you for your support yes sir
gentleman has one more question
representative Scott to your right is
recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker that's the
gentleman Yi yes ma'am I do I would like
to thank you for bringing this bill and
I have one question Mrs speaker it is to
you um representative edner Jackson and
I would like to vote twice on this bill
because we have had two
tickets
$100 I think the lady need to slow down
is what I'm thinking no Mr Speaker one
before school started and one after
school ended but uh but we would just
like to vote twice on these bills and we
will feel some type of satisfaction
thank you for bringing this Bill thank
you gentleman has I she'll have to vote
her conscience that's all I can tell
her gentleman has no further questions
well thank you Mr Speaker for your
patience in allowing so many questions
and ladies and gentlemen of the house
thank you for listening to me on this
bill and I would ask for your favorable
consideration thank you very much I
yield the well gentleman has yielded the
well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered hearing
none the previous question is ordered is
any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill hearing none the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now passed all in favor
of the passage of the bill we'll vote
Yes all those opposed we'll vote no and
Mr clerk will you unlock the
machine have all members
voted for what purpose is representative
Parish
rise per
Paris I she waves for what purposes
representative Dicky rise parliamentary
inquir State your inquir Mr chairman
isn't it true Mr Speaker that one time
this state had a city called Ludy whsy
that had a terrible uh reputation and
brought uh a speed trap in this state
and this body had to take measures to uh
reduce it and stop it is that not true
why are you looking at Trooper Hitchens
on that deal I think he's in that
picture down there and I'm sure the
gentleman knows of what he speaks for
what purposes representative Evans rise
thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry St your inquir Mr Speaker isn't
it true that school cameras have been
responsible for a 92% decrease in
speeding around schools and that I don't
understand a body that is so dedicated
to school
safety passing this legislation
especially when we know that there's a
piece of legislation that we're going to
also get to vote on that doesn't throw
the baby out with the bath water and
just puts reasonable parameters around
what is a very good idea to protect our
kids and if people are mad that they're
getting tickets maybe they shouldn't
speed in front of our
babies I'm sure the lady knows and
believes in what she speaks for what
purposes represented chairman de
rise inquiry Mr Speaker State inquir Sir
Mr Speaker isn't it true that what
representative chairman dick you
referred to is absolutely ancient
history and the absolute finest people
in the state of Georgia live in Luda
whsy
Georgia I can't argue with that since
you represent them we want you to come
back for what purpose does chair lady
Cooper
rise parliamentary inquiry
M isn't it true that sometimes when we
consider bills that are and when we're
had to solve a problem that we're having
across our state that sometimes we go
too far from one side to the other
instead of solving the problem and
finding a compromise we just throw the
problem out and I am thankful that we
have another bill coming forth It's on
our desk that has a more reasonable
approach to try to really solve the
problem and still take care of the
safety Factor thank you Mr Speaker
sure the lady knows what she speaks of
now all members voted all members voted
if so Mr clerk will you lock the machine
on the passage of House Bill 225 the Y
are 129 the Nays are 37 this bill has
received a reest constitutional majority
is therefore
passed Mr clerk will you read a caption
to House Bill 651
651 House Bill 651 by re repr paollo the
33rd and others to be entitled act to
amend Article 2 chapter 14 en title 40
of the official code of George annotator
relating speed detection devices so to
Revis Provisions relative to the use of
automated traffic enforcement safety
devices in school zones this bill and
referred the committee on motor vehicles
that committee recommends that this bill
do pass by rules committee substitute
thank you members chairman Powell is
recognized to present House Bill 651
chairman
Powell thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house you know that's
going to be a hard act to
follow but I would certainly like to
preface my comments before I go into the
bill on this you know
I appreciate uh my colleague
representative Washman and I told people
when a lot of folks were asking me why
he was going to the extreme of banning
these machines or these this process
with the cameras and I told him that I
said if I lived in his district where
they had plucked $65 million dollar out
of the economy I'd probably be doing the
same thing I probably wouldn't be near
as patient as he's been
but I will tell you and you a lot of
y'all have been here a while have heard
me say this but we come in we meet on
the second Monday of every January to
fix
bills that don't work that's gone a
right and uh what he I have to take his
word for it but uh in 2018 we passed
this bill as a matter of school safety
to give local law enforcement a tool
that they could use with these cameras
as a civil
citation granted was a lot of things
over the years has changed that made
this even worse and not acceptable to
the
public now before I go any further I
want to thank the folks in my district
because ain't a damn place got a red
light cam school zone camera in the
Three Counties that I represent but we
have one that's just outside the
district and I know from where he speaks
about the unfairness of this the
original Bill had a lot of parameters on
it that got uh taken away over the years
through different forms so then what
we've got to here with 651 is a second
choice representative Washburn has got
one to ban and this is one that's got a
lot of strict parameters it puts these
back under into play as a tool for law
enforcement and I'm going to go over
this bill carefully but before I do it I
want to tell you why we're doing two
bills and why the leadership has ushered
two bills
out I worked with uh the former chairman
of Public Safety over the last couple of
years uh representative
Collins and out of Public Safety we
tried to fix this bill we tried to fix
this process and we sent a couple of
bills over to the Senate and they didn't
do
anything they did nothing they were
basically tossed in the trash and
nothing was done he didn't run for
reelection and somehow I got drafted
into bringing this bill up
when I say draft it almost feel like I
needed one of them gun safs to hide the
gun from me to shoot keep from shooting
myself but I want to go over this bill
with and I want y'all to pay attention
because I'm going to try go through
Section section and Line to Line on this
bill so yall will understand the
parameters that we put in and between
the two bills if this bill is fortunate
enough to pass along with the
representative washburns that we'll send
two bills over to the state senate cuz
we've heard the rep we've heard the uh
the words that come out of the Senate
that they've got no appetite for Banning
anything so we want to give them a
second choice and that's what 651 is all
about ladies and gentlemen of the
bill school zone safety
cameras section one defines the school
zones between the state Master order in
local school systems and this would
depend according to council what whether
it's on State Highway or not section
two 500 ft you put a sign they'll have
to put a sign 500 ft prior to the
warnings and these signs will include
not just that 4x3 sign post but it's got
to have flashing yellow lights and in
this they'll have to have one of these
uh camera or one of these radar speed
detectors to warn the people when
they're coming into speed zone how fast
they're running
that should be a help
hopefully uh the signs are very
straightforward with the flashing uh
with flashing lights
and and these signs have to be on
clearly on before citation can be
issued section four 35% rule you know I
don't want to get into talking about
Ludi but in earlier life uh we had a
governor who put up signs down in Ludi
declaring a speed
trap and over the period of years this
legislature over the years put in what
was called a 35% Rule and the 35% rule
basically says that if a local
jurisdiction raises more than 35% of
their
revenue yeah if it if they raise more
than 35% of their revenue
then they are subject to lose their
ability by Public Safety taking a good
look at what they're doing so the 35%
rule has put into effect into this bill
which a lot of people had asked about
doing section five does something that
uh I don't know why it was never done to
start with but in this
state on radar the only people who can
tag you with a ticket for the exact
speed on radar is a Georgia State Patrol
we have What's called the 10% rule
always have it had it in Georgia and
that's that if you running whatever that
speed limit is you've got extra 10 mil
an hour
variance and that's what we put into
this so if a speed zone is 15 it's the
you would go 25 if it's 25 it'd be a 35
mph before you're cited in this so we
put that in the same uh the same system
that we do the radar with the 10 mph
variance probably one of the most
important parts of this since uh we know
that all the complaints have come of be
people have gotten these
citations uh in the middle of the day in
the middle of the night different times
other than what's supposed to be but
we're clearly saying again when these
cameras are eligible to be run one hour
before school 1 hour after it convenes
and in the afternoon the same so we have
a 4H hour gap two in the morning and two
in the afternoon and that's pretty
clearly spelled out in this
bill on line
101 this deals with four lanes a lot of
people that ask questions about the
forlane highways this gives the
Department of Public Safety and and do
the right to take a look at these four
lane highways if it's on the state
highway next we get on down into online
10 one excuse me
111 the monetary fine first offense is
$75 second offense is 125 and we have
stricken that $25 admin fee that we
never could figure out what that went to
except just to raise more
money
so your fines are clearly spelled out no
add owns no admin fees or anything else
if you'll look on the
money well let's go on to the next line
on one on Line 120 this
defines this
defines what agency is sending you out
of citation and remember these are civil
citations not traffic citations but on
that they have to clearly spell on the
envelope it's got to be displayed on the
envelope which city county including any
seal that they may have so that there's
no mistake whenever you would get that
notice in the mail
on
144 through
146 your rights is clearly spelled out
and if you'll see on that line that you
have a right to contest the liability by
Contracting your local Court very
clearly spelled out due process was
always involved in this process but I
think that it was a convenience matter
to a lot of people that they didn't want
to take it to court if they got a
citation because most people probably
realize in a lot of cases they might
have been
speeding but in this it clearly spells
out take it to your
court if you go to line
212 and let that go down to somewhere
like
235 I don't know when it was added in
state law but uh Somewhere Over The
Period of time in the last 57 years
there was a clause that was put in it
said if you received one of these civil
citations and you didn't remediate that
citation that that citation was turned
over to the revenue department and you
couldn't get it you couldn't have get
your tags or titles we have stricken all
of that
language so it'll no longer go to the
revenue department for any of these
civil
citations if you'll look on line
241 and we tell you what this does
before I get into where the money is
going to be split we have described what
is a school safety
purpose school safety purposes for
public private elementary secondary
schools and enhance and ensure the
protection of students staff visitors to
such a school including but not limited
to access control systems communication
systems cyber security measures
perimeter systems surveillance system
visitor Management Systems employment
Crossing guards safety protocol training
now I say that for your attention
because when we get down to the real
gist of everything it's always about
that saying follow the
money and the follow the money is the
local jurisdictions won't be able to
keep the bulk of that money anymore they
will divide that up into half 50% of all
money will go to school safety within
their school jurisdictions and they'll
have to show that every year of every
quarter
because they'll have to report it on
their website and they'll have to report
what schools and how much money is being
sent to
them Mr Speaker that's the Gest of the
bill there's a lot of guard rails
there's a lot of parameters put on here
um I tell people over the years to ban
something has never been a there's never
been a success in Banning it's always
about putting the proper guard rails
into parameters on things what happened
in this leg legislature over the years
it started out as an idea for school
safety and it got out of hand I've heard
everything in the world about the C the
companies that provide these cameras to
everything else but at the end of the
day what we have found is that roughly
70 65 70 70% of all the money that has
come in has gone to the local cities and
counties that run these uh speed zone
cameras so if you look at this ladies
and gentlemen with a 10 mile variance
that puts them under the same guard
rails as the state patrol and any radar
citation and you put all this other
stuff
together send this over to the
Senate that way we will have sent two
bills representative wason's Bill to ban
and this one with extreme guard rails to
clean it up the way it should be to give
the Senate an option to look to let it
be known that this House of
Representatives is is very serious about
dealing with this uh with this problem
and this issue and that Mr Speaker is a
presentation on this bill I thank I'll
again thank representative wasman for
making an issue you know we'd made an
issue over the years uh with
representative Collins did to no avail
we understand through the Great Vine uh
that they have no appetite for ban over
in the Senate so hopefully with two
bills that go forward hopefully with
these two bills that you will see the
Senate actually deal with this issue and
come up with some ideas as they should
have done a few years ago Mr Speaker
I'll be glad to stand for questions will
you have a couple I'm sure I do I want
to recognize the minority leader of this
house representative Carolyn hugley from
over Columbus for a
question thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield certainly this is isn't
it true that it's unusual that we would
send two bills on the same subject on
the same day over from this house to the
Senate you could probably say that but
you know we have to deal with the state
senate I hadn't seen it in all these
years the great state of Utah has the uh
Infinite Wisdom that they have a
unicameral form of government but we
have a state senate that we deal
with would you further yield yes
IAM is't it true I've never seen us
yield to the Senate and in imply that
the Senate could make a better decision
than the
house still it's got to go through the
Senate takes two it takes two to
tango gentleman y for another question
certainly chairman Corbett to your right
recognize for a question chairman
Corbett thank you Mr Speaker does
gentleman y yes sir is it not true that
we sent both of these bills to the
Senate last year you know not back to
back but we did send them both last year
we did we sent two bills over there that
would clean up this uh this Red Lake
this speed zone camera and they didn't
so maybe out of these two bills this
might get their
attention gentleman to your left
represent Mary Francis Williams is
recognized for a question thank you Mr
Speaker does a gentleman yield yes ma'am
thank you so much Mr chairman for
bringing this bill I'm I'm lucky to be
in an area where our speed cameras are
turned off um when uh you know when you
know
I at you know when school's not in and
in the summer they're totally turned off
so so we're lucky in that way we haven't
had the abuses and I although I am um
sensitive to the fact that other
communities are seeing those abuses but
the other reason I'm grateful to you for
offering us options is um in in Marietta
and cob our high school is on Dallas
Highway Highway 120 and if anybody has
ever driven that that's a major highway
and without speed cameras to to slow
things down a little bit during those
few hours it would be a really dangerous
situation um and we've got other areas
like that um an area like Marietta and
Cobb we have we have schools that are in
major you know on major busy roads and
speed cameras have helped protect our
children so um I'm grateful to you for
bringing this and for offering options
and I hate to see us turn away from
anything that protects children thank
you thank you ma'am is it not true I
only comment I would make that a lot of
jurisdictions do it the right way but
there are so many that don't do it the
right way so many jurisdictions have
opted out that this is a money uh money
maker for their various Inc departments
so that being said this would clean it
up for all
departments Mr chairman you have a
couple more if I can recognize them yes
sir uh representative yasman Neil to
your left is recognized for a question
to your left Mr
chairman thank you to the speaker thank
you to the chair thank you for the bill
uh is it not true that in my county in
my district I've had countless erroneous
tickets issued to my citizens to include
those that are in lower income
communities um and they've had a lot of
trouble getting them rectified as they
being they receive these tickets far
outside the necessary hours um so my I
do have a few questions in relation to
the bill
itself um if you look at lines 85 you
have to go to all of them I'll just tell
you what it is line 85 108 130 137 151
153 we remove photographic
photographically and for instance like
on 153 law enforcement is to review
photographic images to determine guilt
or
innocence my question is if we're
removing
photographic what are what is law
enforcement supposed to use to determine
guilt or innocence in these moments so
legislative Council chose to do that to
clean up the bill my understanding is
that that these cameras take a snapshot
and these camera and these photographs
are on
a laptop or a video screen of some sort
yes and that's where the images are
broadcast back to the to the offender
yes so granted I do support both the
bills I just find that we might have
trouble um if we don't clarify a
definition or if we remove
photographically and don't put what we
are replacing photo the photograph with
we might have trouble so it might be
necessary to adjust in the future I'm
not sure how they Define what the legal
definition is of photographic but these
are images that are taken by these
cameras yes but we removed photographic
in this
bill that's how the council wrote it I'm
not I don't think that it I don't think
that it removed it I think that it so
these photographs are made or the images
are then cast over the computer and
that's how they take those images and
send them out okay all right thank you
sir remember that the local law part of
the part of the process is the local law
enforcement agencies are supposed to
review every one of these and quite
frankly we know of a lot of cases that
they have it yes so granted I I support
the bill I'm just making a
recommendation as we move forward that
might be a good fix yes ma Mr chairman
we have a legal Authority that may have
an opinion on that part love to hear
representative Leverett is recognized
for our question thank you Mr Speaker
with the gentleman yield yes sir to the
ladi's question my dear friend's
question in uh over there is it not true
that a photographic image would not
necessarily include a digitally recorded
or created image and thus that is for
the reason for the uh striking of that
language if the gentleman so States
because that's the reason you're an
attorney and I'm a real estate broker as
as I'm sure it's a source of great pride
for your mother Mr chairman thank you I
am as you are
yours Mr chairman we need if you don't
mind one more question from gentleman
who needs to defend himself on that Luda
whsy situation chairman Hitchens to your
left is recognized for a question yes
sir gentleman y yes sir is it not true
that even though you get a civil
citation and you have to pay a fine you
don't get any appoints assessed on your
driver's like like you would with
another speeding citation you are
correct Mr Speaker I hope I've answered
most of the questions I think everybody
in here is they know what the drill is
on this um we have two distinct
different bills but both are hoping to
get us to the same uh solution one is to
ban them in this entirety and the other
one put some very rigid guard rails
around them to send them over to the
Senate to see if the Comm over there
will'll take a look at them and realize
how serious this house is with that Mr
Speaker I'll yield the will and ask for
your favorable consideration gentlemen

asking your support for it simply
confirms existing law with regard to the
vicarious liability or lack thereof of
vicarious liability of rides share
Network Services for the acts of their
drivers this basically means because
they are independent contractors that
was a bill that uh chairman Jones had a
few years ago independent contractors
are not do not create liability for the
employer unlike full-time employees that
is already existing law this just puts
it in a different place in code um for
to make sure U potential planers are
aware of it and also it it would help
with the rates charged by the insurers
this is something they've requested uh
GTLA is fine with it again it doesn't
change existing law we're just
confirming existing law at one more
prominent place in the code so would
appreciate your support and I'm glad
that oh but one other thing the section
one since we were in title 40 uh the
legislative Council wanted to clean up
that definition of elderly or disabled
passenger so that's simply just cleanup

representative Kelly to present the

the house I know a lot of us in here uh
both personally and with our
constituents enjoy spending time in our
outdoors and one of our you know
Georgia's most famous outdoor activities
is turkey hunting and I the measure
before you is aimed at helping to make
sure that generations to come have ample
turkey hunting opportunities and I'm
proud that this is a measure that was
brought to me by some of my constituents
uh back in P County Colton bosan Brady
Garrett and Dave Owens who is a two-time
National Turkey coling Champion they're
passionate about this Sport and they
wanted to make sure that we preserve it
for future generations and so what this
legislation does is two things one it
creates a separate turkey permit from
our big game permit this will
effectively allow the Department of
Natural Resources to calculate how many
people are hunting turkeys in Georgia uh
there will be no charge to our instate
residents there will be a $100 fee for
out of state residents and then it will
also create a voluntary turkey stamp
where the funds will go to uh preserve
uh the turkey populations and their
environment uh again that will be
voluntary uh and something that the DNR
will develop every year so um Madam
speaker I'll be glad to you for any
questions the gentleman has questions

maybe sorry maybe I should maybe I
should well maybe you can answer this
question um on this turkey stamps are
these forever stamps actually it says
thank you for the question I know we
were just having an in-depth uh
conversation and education opportunity
about turkeys in our state and this is a
stamp that will be designed annually by
our Department of Natural Resources that
people can purchase voluntarily that
will help raise money for our uh turkey
preservation chair recognizes
representative Canon for a question
thank you m speaker do you yield uh
certainly awesome so here in Atlanta we
don't really have much of this help me
understand so it says line 35 starting
next year anyone 16 or older to hunt
turkey in this state has to have a
permit what happens if they don't have
that permit so they already today have
to have a permit but the permit is
included in the big game license which
includes deer and others but there's
fines and penalties if you don't have
that today this is just separating the
turkey permit from the big game permit
so that we can more accurately track uh
the uh individual turkey
hunters okay how much is that fine
I don't know off the top of my hand
right now but we're not changing the
fine with this bill and for any of my
friends in Atlanta that want to get out
and Hunt some turkeys we'll be glad to
take you out in Ral
Georgia I'll be glad to take a few more
questions Madam
speaker how many more I'll take one more
all
right chair
recognizes representative gamble for
last question all right thank you thank
you madam speaker do a gentleman you'll
I certainly will there seems to be great
debate over the author of this bill and
how many Bill how many turkeys you may
have killed versus how many turkeys you
may have bought at Publix well this I'll
tell you that this is a complete not
self-serving Bill I've never killed a
turkey I like to hunt birds as I showed
you a few weekends
ago but I never killed a turkey this is
something completely driven by my
constituent so I appreciate that
question with that M speaker I'll yield
the well the gentleman has yielded the
well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair he is none the previous question

Bill 443 by representative Petri of the
166 to be entitled an act to amend code
section 272 23 the official go to
Georgia annotator relating to license
permit tag and stamp fees so to provide
for fees for reef and migratory fish
endorsements this bill have referred to
the committee on game fish and parks
that committee recommends that this bill
do
pass representative patri has Rec
to present the bill representative
Petri thank you Mr
Speaker uh this bill is very similar to
that which was just presented by
representative
Kelly Mr Speaker this bill House Bill
443 has been uh is sought after by my
offshore fishermen so this is another
Coastal Bill and in this bill what we do
is create new a new fish endorsement a
license if you will for refit fish a
migratory fish endorsement uh and we
have a $10 fee for residents and $20 for
non-residents so our fishermen are
asking for this and let me make sure I
explain why so right now all everything
offshore which is three miles off the
coast for those of you that are not
Coastal everything 3 miles offshore is
regulated by the feds and they are
controlling our fishery they don't do a
very good job of that and they use a lot
of data to by their own def definition
lacks uh statistical rigor is the word
they use and so most of the Gulf States
and Florida as well have uh taken those
Waters under their own management as
well this bill will allow us the revenue
to survey our own uh to do our own
surveys on our populations of fish over
3 miles out so that we can take uh that
fishery under management by Georgia DNR
that is very simply what this uh Bill
does Mr Speaker and I'm glad to answer
any questions gentleman has no questions

Speaker and members I appreciate the
opportunity to speak to you today about
House Bill 426 this bill proposes
nonpartisan elections for all magistrate
judges it places magistrate under the
same code section that provides for how
and when nonpartisan elections are held
as we heard during the state of
Judiciary dress on our house floor we
were told that judges should be running
nonpartisan that the way we maintain the
Public's confidence in an independent
Judiciary is to be nonpartisan a judge's
duty is to be impartially following the
Constitution and the law and there is no
room for partis Politics on the bench
requiring some judges to run in partisan
elections makes it difficult for them to
comply with the code of judicial conduct
and maintain impartiality and the
appearance of impartiality the judicial
councel and the Council of Magistrate
Court judges support this legislation
that's the bill sir I'll answer any
questions lady has a couple of questions

thank you Mr Speaker and colleagues I
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
you today about House Bill
516 this bill allows County and Regional
Library boards and community service
boards to conduct meetings through
teleconferencing currently state law
allows for Statewide agencies to meet
remotely however Public Library boards
and community service boards are not
included in this provision these boards
are experiencing increased difficulty in
recruiting trustees and maintaining
quorums for the meeting
due to the work obligations travel
distance and conflicting family and
Community demands of the members while
there is a great value and in-person
meetings it would be extremely helpful
if virtual par participation could be an
option for these unpaid busy volunteers
who provide meaningful governance and
support for our libraries and community
service
boards the county and Regional Library
System of Georgia as well as the csb
association support this bill thank you
I'll answer any questions at this
time representating Park Cannon to your
left is recognized for a question thank
you Mr Speaker do you yeld I will what
would you say to those who say that
right now in this political climate
there might be more of an interest in
what books are in which libraries and
who can tune in and possibly have impact
on that how would this bill impact those
meetings so to be able to have meetings
they've got to have a quum and right now
they can't call in and so if they they
travel especially on Library boards some
of those trustees have to travel over
Seven Counties because they're on
District Regional boards and they cannot
have a quorum so they can not do the
business of Georgia or make any
decisions for any of our library systems
or our Comm community service boards
thank you for the question thank you do
you further yield I will okay so there's
nothing in this bill you feel that would
impact the types of books that are in
libraries and the impact that people
could have on those books on those
shelves well this impacts what this bill
does is impacts the people that serve on
those boards and so they do in fact
impact those those books but thank
you representing representative Lynn

present House Bill
449 thank you Mr Speaker uh colleagues I
have before you House Bill 449 this bill
as a result of a study committee that
we've had uh and a lot of work has gone
into that and I want to thank the
speaker for for letting us do that
basically this bill is about private
water companies this is not city or
municipal water companies this is
privately owned water companies that
many of our constituents are having to
deal with these days and and let me just
say private water companies have their
place but what this bill does is it
helps make sure that our citizens don't
get taken advantage of from Runway
freight train of high rates and high
fees and that's what this bill does Mr
Speaker and I just want to mention we're
one of five states that do not regulate
private water companies and I I want us
to uh trim that list down so if there
are any questions I'll be glad to answer
them gentleman has one question
representing Parson to your left
recognize for a question thank I thank
uh speaker
gentleman yield yes sir yes sir just a
really quick question I'm looking at uh
lines 35 which kind of proceed to tell
about how that raise how much the raise
can be 15 15% over the lowest rate over
the last three years I think it is then
uh it goes on and says that the PSC has
authority over that but then on line uh
let see here 39 this what I want to
clarify as far as the PSC actually
having that hearing it says the
commission upon its election to enter
into a hearing does that mean that they
will automatically have the hearing or
they have to kind of get together and
decide whether to have a hearing on that
race I can't exactly hear you from the
noise in here but basically what but
basically what that what that means is
if their hearing is Justified then they
will not have another hearing for
another three years if you just one more
but the the initial after the initial
raise though does the PSC have a hearing
at that time or do they decide whether
whether to have a hearing or not if they
raise their rates 15% or more over a
three-year span then they will have a
hearing in front of the PSC thank youe
yes sir gentleman has there further
questions I yield well and ask you to
vote green is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered hearing

design a program that works best for
them um we also uh give them maximum
flexibility I'll tell you just in
closing here Grant Rivera school
superintendent for marota schools came
to committee and said Scott this policy
in our schools has literally transformed
our schools taking out the cell phones
my lunchroom was quiet before now kids
are talking they're socializing it is uh
truly transformational it's time I just
want to thank all of the organizations
the teach teacher groups the
superintendent but most importantly the
parents that reached out to me who have
said thank you Scott it's time we get
back to the teachers teaching and the
kids learning let's get the cell phones
out of the classrooms and Mr Speaker I
yield for questions you have a couple in
fact you have several representative
Barry to your left is recognized for a
question gentleman recognized thank you
Mr Speaker do a gentleman you yes sir
thank you I I just wanted to use a
scenario for my own classroom if that's
okay with you um my classroom I have
about 23 students but I have 15 working
computers is there a car route for our
lessons that might need a cell phone in
that particular day because we don't
have enough working computers in the
classroom great question so this bill
applies to personal devices right so
there's nothing to stop the locals from
they have their own you know your laptop
you can learn on that but yes it it does
apply so you no longer to be able to use
this to to learn and that's part of
really a nationwide policy that we're
seeing a best practice in the
classroom thank you thank you speaker
and thank you to all those who are
texting me right now while I'm up
here represent representative Barnes to
your left is recognized for a question
represent M might Barnes thank you do
you yield yes
ma'am I have I understand your reasoning
behind this and I appreciate it my
question
is my son text me last week while we
were sitting in here Mom we're in a
level three
lockdown what do we do in those type of
situations it's terrified me um and he
sent the information firsthand quickly
from his phone I do I don't want him on
his phonewise in class but what what do
you what are your suggestions in those
situations that is a fantastic question
I'll tell you as a as a dad of three
kids school safety is on the front
Forefront of my mind every single day
when I drop them off at school we have
talked to safety experts Across the
Nation across Georgia all of them agree
on one thing is that in the case of
emergency the last thing we want as a
child to have a phone in their hand they
want the the undivided attention of that
student on the teacher getting
directions as to where to go and then
immediately after the situation is
resolved absolutely get get the phone
back get communication again and the
bill does provide an outline for
policies that the schools ought to have
once a situation is resolved but yeah
safety experts agree in that situation
but also in regards to think about
buling that takes place we had teachers
that said kids are organizing fights hey
third period let's go fight schools that
have gotten rid of cell they've seen
gang activity spiting all of that sort
of violence within schools come down
this is truly a public safety Bill and
with that Mr Speaker I know we're late
in the day so I'm going to go ahead and
yield the well and I ask for your
favorable consideration thank

parliamentary inquiries representative
Jasmine Clark is for what purposes the
lady rise I'm parliamentary inquiry your
inquir um Mr Speaker is it not true that
I would I completely understand why we
would not want cell phones in schools
but I'm actually very concerned about
not allowing e-readers and things like
that as this is how a lot of children
read their books in
2025 I could understand the lady's
concern I think she'll get with the
author that may be something could be
addressed if if you make that
case thank you for the question for what
Pur does representative Town
surise parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry is it not true Mr Speaker this
both supports instruction school safety
and local school systems do have the
resource to provide those tools in the
classroom through various grants various
projects plus you can also use the
utilize the peach tax credit to get more
instruments or computer for your school
that would help with these typ
projects I know the gentleman comes from
that world so I'm sure he knows of what
he speaks for what purposes represent
Mary Francis Williams
rise thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry is it not
true that um I represent the city of
maretta schools and uh the
superintendent that uh representative
Hilton mentioned was uh Grant Rivera who
was a wonderful superintendent but I
have had many many many calls from
parents of the maretta seal school
system who are very concerned about
bellt Bell um keeping the phones away uh
they have children who have to check
their blood sugar with their phone they
have uh they worry about children
missing rides home and um there anyway
it's it's how it's is it not true that
it's how it's implemented and the words
Bell to Bell are of great concern to me
and and is it not true that parents in
the marota city schools are not happy
with their superintendent's decision
about how to implement it thank you sir
sounds like a local decision to me have

this bill have referred to the committee

recommends that this bill do
pass representative alen Powell is
recognized to present the bill
455 thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen I bring before you a very a
lot simpler Pro simpler Bill than I had
had earlier tonight this is your bingo
bill in the state of Georgia there's
only two forms of gaming or gambling
that's allowed under the state constit
stitution one of them is a lottery and
we know where that money goes most of
the time and the other is
Bingo and bingo is one of those things
that they register with the Secretary of
State's office they have to be not
for-profit and any proceeds from Bingo
has to go to a charitable uh a
charitable organization what we're doing
in this bill we're updating it hadn't
been updated in
years um we yes I need to put my glasses
Z we're changing where right now they
can only have one location so if a Amed
or BFW or whatever group is having one
of these Bingo if they have a ballroom
or they have a dining room or something
they can move it from room to room
because they have to register these
locations we're changing it from one to
up to three Bingo sessions a day and
we're raising the dollar amount of gifts
and prizes it could be given away from3
to
$6,000 last but not least
old statute where most of these bingo
games are run by professional
auctioneers and all of these
organizations they were limited to a $30
salary that they could pay them and they
found they can't get them for $30 so
we've raised that to
$150 I would tell you that they're still
restricted to no more
than if it passes it goes to $3,000 in
the calendar week so if they have these
three Bingo sessions and they would be
limited to $2,000 per session that Mr
Speaker is what this bill does and I
would ask you to support your churches
fraternal organizations El moose the
AmVets the legions and those type of

sad note uh if you're in the Atlanta
probably throughout Georgia you know
Miss Alice busy uh she passed over the
weekend and uh miss busy was like an
amazing Champion for entrepreneurship
especially for black businesses so if
any everybody knew her miss busy was
always saying what we going to do for
the entrepreneurs what we going to do
for black businesses and she was always
always wanting us to do uh something to
ensure that we were doing the right
thing so they will have a viewing for
her on Friday at her home church at
popular Springs Baptist Church from 4:00
to 8 and her service will be Saturday at
11:00 at greater Piney Grove Baptist
Church and if you would join me in a
moment of silence for miss busy
thank you amen thank you members one
more condolences chairman n Williams
speak to us about our great
agriculturalist in our estate that died
uh thank you Mr Speaker um members I
would like to honor a great man from
cordal Georgia you can see him up here
his name was Buddy leer he was very
instrumental in the watermelon and pcan
Industry um he was nominated he had a
ton of awards um um throughout his 93
years on this Earth he went home to be
with his Lord on Friday um he one of his
most significant things he did was he
was in the transition team between the
Reagan and Bush years and agriculture
for the state of Georgia um like I said
he was in college Hall of Fame from the
University of Georgia College of a in
2012 and he leaves behind a wife
margerie and three children just a great
man and a great American and I think
these two might want to say something as
well well I know buddy my whole career
and when buddy was we were in meetings
uh when buddy spoke everyone listened he
I don't know of a person who had more
credibility and more honesty and could
uh analyze a position better than buddy
lir and he had a great impression on
me Mr Buddy was one of the first people
that I met after I graduated from
college and entered a career in politics
and one thing about Mr Buddy and and the
what chairman dicki just said is
absolutely correct uh when he spoke
everyone listened and when you've been
in the industry for more than 75 years
in agriculture you've taught you've
taught some of the younger generation
something and that was what Mr Buddy in
my opinion spent his career doing and
those of us that are still involved in
agriculture stand on the should
shoulders of those Giants and he indeed
was a giant in the agricultural
Community when it came to watermelons he
knew more about it than anybody else uh
as well as pans but uh Mr Buddy was near
and dear to my heart he actually called
me back in December uh randomly one
afternoon and we talked almost an hour
uh but he was just one of those guys and
from the look on that face you pretty
much know you always knew where you
stood with Mr Buddy uh there was no
doubt uh but Mr Buddy was laid to rest
today and as uh representa William said
leaves behind a wife marging and several
daughters and son Greg which is still
running the business today so uh if we
will just take a moment and U moment of
silence and remembrance of Mr buddy
lir thank you Mr Speaker will yeld the
