you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you House will come to order. I apologize, I'm running late. House will come to order. Miss Clerk, how about Ring the Bell? House will come to order. House will come to order. House will come to order. Mr. Clerk, Paul Zat, Representative Williams, could I see you? House will come to order. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1125-1125? House Bill 1125-1125, Representative Cooper, the 45th and others to be entitled to amend Title 34, the official go to Georgia and Integi, relating to labor and industrial relations. So, sufface out the payment of sub-minimum wage to persons with disabilities. This bill haven't referred to the committee on industry and labor. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Sharon Cooper is recognized to present the bill. Representative. In the House I was bringing a special bill, it's House Bill 1125. Years ago the federal government came up with a program called the 14C certificate. It was for the establishment across our nation of community rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities. It was a great idea, but it's one that didn't always work like it was supposed to. It was supposed to help people with disabilities learn a trade and then go out into the community. What many of them became were like sweatshops where disabled people were caved together and they worked on a very boring type of repetitive behavior often. And even worse they were paid a subminimal wage, that's what the government allowed, as little as 22 cents an hour for their work. In 2001 we were down to about 30 of these across our state. In 2015 we were down to 15, but there are eight holdouts. In fact as the people from this community and there's a program to help them face us out, their reaction has been, yeah we know we shouldn't be doing this, but we'll just do it until somebody tells us we can't. So what we're doing this with this bill is we're going to tell them that state government does not approve these. And there's this bill allows for a phase out and there are federal grants to help these people, these last eight industries to help them face this program out so they can get money to help them. But we need with this bill we will be sending a message to people with disabilities across our state is that we value them, that they have a great deal to give their communities. That they can be employed and that they are very valuable employees if you talk to the people like publics and croakers that hire them. They will tell you that when other employees don't show up on rainy days, people with disabilities that work for them, they are there for them. And I just saw something and it said that with people going back to work, a huge percentage of the people going back to work have been people with disabled, with disabilities. I am lucky this session, my college intern, if you haven't met her, is named Leah. She is one of the best I've had, Leah is in the wheelchair, she can walk a few steps, she has one hand that she can use and I'll tell you she will out work all of you, she is a great help. If you haven't met her, you may see me pushing her around to give her a break from using that one hand as she wills herself around. She is an example, she is a senior at Georgia State, she wants to go on to law school so that she can work with her disability community. I am so honored to have her and thank you Mr. Speaker of that program. So like I say, this is phasing out the last of those eight programs, it affects no others unless they were a 14C certificate. So it's only eight and there is money to help these people phase out and Mr. Speaker if there are no questions, I will yield a well and ask for a favorable vote. The lady has a couple of questions. Okay, I'll take them. But only a couple because I know time is short and I don't want to keep somebody else from getting their bill on the floor. I appreciate that, let's take a couple to your left, German Parsons has a question. Thanks for your humanitarian, I appreciate all your work on these kind of things. I think I'm familiar with some of the places that you talked about. My question is, I'll just say direct question, why are these places exempt from the minimum wage? Because the federal government years ago, I'm being allowed to do it. Okay, thank you. I think they thought it was a good idea that it would help people, that they would train people and they would get them out into the community or among other people, let them be integrated into the community as a whole. Instead, they ended up working in almost for many of them like sweatshops where they were paid so little. Representative Sebaugh to your left, has a question. If the lady were yielded. Yes ma'am, yes sir. Madam Chair, is it not true that a recent study found that 54% of Georgians living with a disability want to pay job but cannot find one? That's true. Thank you for that. But they want to be paid a fair wage for what they can do and they can do. They're not the kind of imagination that many people have them that they can barely function. They're high functioning, they're smart, they are capable and we with this bill will be sending that message to Georgia people with disabilities all over our state. Mr. Speaker, if there are no other questions. You have one last question, one of your seat makes back there. Representative Chairman Carpenter has a question if you'll yield. This is General Lady Eult. Yes I will. Is it not true as an employer of six or seven individuals with disabilities that these employees add great value to your team? And the least we can do is pay a minimum wage for the job that they do and the value that they add to your team. I really think that's exactly right. I wish everybody out in the general public would do this. This bill only applies to eight that had that special 14C exemption. But I hope that it will send a message to other employers in the general public that they deserve a fair wage and at least the minimum wage. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favourable consideration and I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Thank you for the presentation. Representative Holly has signed up to speak in favour of the bill. Representative Holly. Thank you Mr. Speaker. My colleagues. As we sit here late today trying to do best to pass these bills. We have watching all of us at home a very sweet individual who was located directly in Henry County. If you'll see on your screens you'll see the lovely face of Miss Hannah Hibbim. Hannah has been active at the Work for Eli program. This is a program that was put on through the digital technical partners or DTP. It's a program that was started by Jonathan Kendrick. He started because he has a son Eli who has Down syndrome and needed to be able to find a positive way within which he could be able to contribute to our society and still be able to earn a wage. Hannah has worked with that organization and has actually been on the job since 2018. She's made those who graduated with her at Ola High School very proud and is someone who has proven day in day out that she can be trusted to do the job of breaking down the technical equipment of dental offices. We understand this. That she is just a face like so many who are working as best to try to earn the respect that we grant to all those who choose to get up every day, put the clothes on, get in their right mind and work eight hours straight. We thank you for, and thank you Chairwoman Cooper for being able to not only keep in mind persons like her, but thank you for taking a bill that I tried to push forward and making it even better. We appreciate those who are in the Biden administration for the sub-minimum wage, competitive integrated employment fund, which is otherwise known as Switzerland. So fortunately where money may not be necessarily available through our state, fortunately George was able to apply.

And we're hoping that for those eight programs have been granted, so too may the others be able to phase out from their certification and actually go and apply for money that may be available from our federal government. What it goes to show is in order for our state to be considered the number one state in the country for doing business, we cannot be the number one state for giving people the business, especially those who have developmental disabled needs. So if you can, just from your desk, just because she is watching us live from Henry County and McDonough, please just have a hand clap to this beautiful soul watching us do this good work. Thank you. I yield the well. General Mazzio to the well after talking about a hard work in Georgia. We appreciate that. That concludes our comments on House Bill 1125. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that here? He has none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agree to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shout this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1125. The yays are 160. The nays are zero. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 1104 11104? House Bill 1104 by the represent of Crawford. The 84th and others to be titled back to amend article 4, article 6, the chapter 2, the title 20, the official code of Georgia annotated.

This bill, having referred to the committee on education, that committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Representative Murray Crawford has recognized to present the bill. Please give the gentleman in the well your attention. Representative Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, today I bring you H. Bill 1104, which will inform and educate student athletes, their parents and coaches about the importance of mental health risk and is going to help raise awareness of mental health resources available to them from organizations like the Department of Behavioral Health. What this bill is going to do is simply aggregate all of the important mental health statistics and information that we have to better protect our students. It creates no further obligations from parents or students. This bill was supported by Georgia High School Association, and if passed, this proactive measure can save lives. This bill means a lot to me because as a former student athlete, I understand the pressures and the anxiety levels as student athletes face. And I want to make sure that we can help those. And so again, I ask for your favorable support. And I stand for any questions. And gentlemen, has a question. Representative, gentlemen, you know, I do represent even Neil. To your left. To the gentleman, do you yield? I do. It's not true that this is your first bill. And being a proud man of Omega-Sy-5 fraternity, we're wondering why you didn't present this bill in your gold boots. My friend knows of what she speaks. He's fast on his feet. I know that much. I watching all the time. Representative Fry, to your left, has a question. If the gentleman will yield. Does gentleman yield? I do. Representative, isn't it true that you probably would have had better success passing your first bill if you had worn your track shoes up there? I have my shoes at my desk. Thank you. From one athlete to another, Bert Chat has a question. Let's see how this one goes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? Yes, I do. Well, thank you very much for bringing this bill. I was wondering you being a former athlete. Isn't it true that because we've had a pass in athletics, it's possible or at least likely to say that there may be some mental health bans we've got elected to these positions, that's true? That is absolutely true. Yes. Thanks for bringing the bill. Thank you. Representative Crawford, I don't think Representative Bert Chat could have run you down to hit you when you were playing football. I think you're a lot faster than he was. So the gentleman has no further questions. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and Francis Aspel, your favorable support. And with that, I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well.

Congratulations. Some milestones getting the first one under your belt. If you all think that one was good, wait till this one comes along. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 349-349? House Bill 349, a glimpse of Fleming of the 125th and others to be titled Act to amend Title 43, the Fish Go To George Antietta relating to professions and businesses, shows the repeal chapter 10 relating to Barvers and Cosmetologists and enact a new chapter. This will have referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Please give the gentleman in the will your attention. Gentlemen from down in Liberty County, where the water tastes like cherry wine, cherry wine, everything. All Williams is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Some years ago, Edda James made a song very popular. It was called Atlas. Somebody get that on the way home. I was a little dull from Mr. Speaker. I thought that the partial, the thinning, and the bald caucus had won again and delayed this bill. But after 12 years and many tearful nights by Georgians all over the state who waited for the mobile Barbershop bill. God is a good God. I want to thank first Chairman Powell and Representative Erhardt. Certainly thank you. One of the chairman of the bald caucus representative Jason Rittle, who I brought around gracefully. This is the bill whose time has come after 12 years in the trenches. There's some bills that you fought hard over but there's none that you fought long over over. But all this bill does is that let's Georgia move into the 21st century after puddles have been able to get mobile service. I mean just fluffed up, blow dried everything. You've been able to buy food of any description in a mobile food truck. You could get a toothbrush, a root canal, X-ray, give blood. I think there are even a few mobile nightclubs you could do it all. Finally Georgia. For those of you who still need it you can get a haircut. So I moved this evening and I'm tempted to give you about 30 minutes. And if I'd gotten called early and I think to speak and know it I was going to give you the 30 minute piece. But now you've heard so you can relax and I know you're happy. Don't be overly joyed we have a long ways to go tonight. But with that Mr. Speaker if there are any questions I would gladly answer them or turn them over to you. I'll take a couple of them and I'm going to let you take a couple first if you don't mind. It's the gentleman we yield. It's Adam and you. The representative Jason Riddell to your right has a question on second thought. But my dear friend Mr. Vice Mr. Chairman. Do you yield my friend in the world as he yield for a question? I yield for a question. Can you riddle me this? How many lines was your bail to start with and how many did we finish out with? Because of the complexity of this issue we started out with at least 35 pages. Lines almost into infinity. But because of the genius of the sponsor. I was able to narrow it down to a page and a half. Do you feathered yield for one more question? Yes I yield. Is this your first bail? Well believe it or not. Having come into this house 22 years ago in the majority of the year. With a big M I passed a few early on and then I've had a terrible drought. Well when I opened up until the energy said a change going on. Well if I can get you out of the well with too much longer the drought may be broken but are we going to wait to see how that works. Now I think this is a member of that caucus you alluded to representative of Corrie has a question to your left. Yeah he's one of the officers. Does it give me yield for my friend? Look at my head. What hair? Why do I have to vote for this bill? You make a great reflection of some people that have here. The gentleman yield to a question to your right. I will you represent the Mac Jackson's in the same position. Another member of the caucus. Thank you for speaking to the gentleman yield. I will you. We were just wondering when the mobile haircut vehicle goes from county to county will it have the water from that county or will it bring the water from the coast that tastes like cherry wine? Well unfortunately for most of you with the exception of representative delobs and representative patriot sayings a few others we just don't share our cherry wine with anybody. You have to come there drink it and if we approve you we'll let you stay there. General has a couple more life for me to take one more tea there from a lady I think will offer some good insight here. Representative Stacey Evans is recognized for a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield? Gladly for you ma'am. Sir you referenced coming in some number of years ago when Democrats were in the majority and as someone who's never had that honor I was just wondering if you could tell me about the good old days. Representative it would take all night. The difference in today and 22 years ago is the difference in a salty pickle and some great ice cream. It's a little different trust me and I was an officer in my freshman year and I welcomed in a young man a few years later from a little county co-lepping ham who was trying to make a name for himself and now he's the speaker. Only because I have friends with their know all the questions Mr. Speaker you'll the well. Gentlemen has yielded the well. Let me hear it now. Good job good bill you've worked it long enough to perfect it is no doubt about that. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here has done the previous question is ordered is there an objection to adopting the committee substitute. Chair here's known the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair here's known the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted for what purpose is represented McClain rise. Thank you Mr. Speaker commentary inquiry. State you inquiry.

This bill having further the committee on health that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair Lady Matthew Hack is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think this bill has been over vetted, but here we go. This bill looks to protect independent pharmacies while bringing transparency and savings to the state health benefit plan. So that affects all of us with our state health insurance. It does this by requiring an actuarly, actuary study to assess potential savings by requiring SHBP to pay pharmacies using the market based, NAD Act index plus fair dispensing fees. I think that we've heard a lot about this bill and this actuary is going to help us understand exactly what has been paid to our pharmacies and be fair to our independent pharmacies. And with that, Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions. You have no questions. Thank you, and I will yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Good job, the lady has yielded the well.

I know the gentleman is a wise person when it comes to PBMs, act and drug charges. So I respect your thought. I respect your question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and we appreciate the support and to protect our Georgia citizens, especially our state health benefit employees. Thank you.

This bill haven't received it. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 14071407? House Bill 1407 by Representative Lahoud of the 175th and others to be entitled back to amend Chapter 70, entitled 36th, the fiscal code of Georgia and it's clearly in the coordinated and comprehensive planning and service delivery by counties and municipalities. So as we revised provisions for establishing, negotiating, reviewing, revising and filing local government service delivery strategies, this bill ever further the committee on governmental affairs. It recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Lahoud is recognized to present the bill, Representative Lahoud. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members. House Bill 1407 is the result of a joint study committee that I co-chaired over the summer and fall to find some solutions to our service delivery strategy and the speed resolutions that are counties and the municipalities that lie within those counties go through every 10 years. And so we came up with a list of recommendations. This bill addresses most of them. GMA and ACCG were heavily involved in the bill and they're supporting it. And so I could go in depth, but at this late hour, I'd like to just ask for your favorable consideration. You have no questions? I'll yield the well. Thank you. Mr. Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted.

Child, this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. So the clerk will lock the machine. All the passage of House Bill 1407, the yeas are 167, the nay is one. The bill, Henry C. The requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1371, 1371. House Bill 1371 by Representative Gertrude Chattel, 176 to be entitled to elect to a man of the North Carolina champion three, title 51 of the fiscal to Georgia and it's headed relating the general provisions regarding liability of owners and occupiers of land. So it's required for legislative findings. This bill then referred to the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee's substitute. But Bercett is recognized to present the bill. Represent James Bercett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, folks, House Bill 1371 is a culmination of about four weeks of negotiations. And as you can see, we haven't gotten very far. What this bill does do though, it moves the ball in the direction necessary. We got businesses that are out there having issues with litigation and everybody realizes that there is a problem. We're just trying to figure out how to fix it. Now, this bill does two very distinct things. Currently in state law, if a criminal comes on your property to commit a felony and if they get hurt or if they're injured, they can turn around and sue the premises owner, the land owner. Well, this bill would make that unlawful if it were to pass. If you go onto somebody's property to commit a felony and then turn around and try to sue the property owner, that just doesn't make good common sense. And this bill does away with that ability in the state of Georgia. The second event or second piece of this legislation is in lines 18 through 22. And what this portion does that, when a jury is considering or excuse me, a court is considering whether or not to find the property owner liable, owner liable in a case where there's a third party crime. The fact that your business is in a high crime area, in and of itself doesn't give rise to a claim. So you can't just say you're in a high crime area, you had a duty and this is your duty. You have to have more than one factor. Mr. Speaker, the hour is late. And I'd appreciate your favorable consideration of this bill. I know you have for questions if there are any. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions representing Corvitt to your right and the corner has a question. Mr. Chairman's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman you? Gentlemen does you? What, Burtchette? Is it not true that this bill would encourage businesses to open up, shop, and all corners of the state by making clear that high crime on its own does not increase business owner's liability? Yes, sir. That is a very good question. I appreciate the question. Do you write in the back, Chairman Carpenter has a question? Does the gentleman yield? Jim, he yields to a friend and a business owner. Thank you. Thank you for bringing this legislation. Obviously, tour reforms are a big issue for small business across the state. But I think this bill more than anything, if my friends on the other side of the aisle will listen up, does something to hopefully address food deserts and retail deserts in high crime areas that I think is important for their constituents. That's a fact. Thank you for the question. Representative Jasmin Clark to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentleman yield? I do. Could you define high crime areas I didn't see? There's no definition of high crime area in the bill. That is the language that is used at the Supreme Court. So it would be a definition that would come from common law. Thank you. Last question from Representative Reese to your left. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman does yield. Isn't it true that this bill basically prevents a person who was doing wrong from suing the individual and basically being rewarded for attempting to break the law anyway? That is a fact. And it's the most common sense piece of legislation that we've come up with for a tour reform here. I appreciate the question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, I have no further questions. A year of the will. Thank you for your work on the bill, Mr. Will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the Committee on Rules that Chair, here's none of the Rules Committee's substitute is adopted? Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair, here's none of the report the Committee is agreed to? Well, this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will unlock the machine. From the passage of House Bill 1371, the yeas are 168, the nays are zero, the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 12531253? House Bill 1253, by the way, Representative Anderson, to the 10th and others to be entitled to amend part one of Article 2 of Chapter 8 of Title 50. I'll leave fiscal code to George Anantetta relating to regional commissions. So as revised, the composition of the governing council for the regional commissions, this bill I refer to the Committee on Governor LeFaire's that committee recommends this bill do pass by Rules Committee substitute. Representative Victor Anderson is recognized to present the bill, Representative Anderson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The colleagues I would love to tell you that this bill was my original idea because it's a good bill. This is a bill that solves a problem that has been building for a long time. But this is a bill that came out of our Rule Development Council. It's a bill that was actually presented earlier this year in our Governor LeFaire subcommittee by Chairwoman Lynn Smith. And I'm proud today to bring it under the number and under my title here. What 1253 does, and if you look up at the map that's on the wall here, you'll see those kind of orange, pinky looking colors there. Those, that's 37 counties where you have clusters of at least three counties together that are contiguous that have had decreases in population and decreases in tax revenues for three years in a row. These are small, populous counties, but large areas. They have trouble providing the services that we as a state require them to provide to the citizens without having to continually go up on their taxes. What House Bill 1253 does is it creates a special rural district which would allow those counties through agreement to band together and look at providing services jointly to meet the requirements and the needs of their citizens without having to continually increase taxes and to get some economy of scale. That's the bill that a nut shell. I know that Chair Lady Smith is going to be speaking to the bill also, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield for any questions or— Do you know what House no questions? Okay. In that case, I would ask for your favorable consideration and we'll step off the podium to allow the next speaker. We do have a speaker in favor of the bill, Chair Lady Lynn Smith, as recognized as speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This is what you call a relay or a team play. I could not have done this to bill when I first presented the concept was a concept, but the problem was obvious and very strong before the rural council that was created early on by David Rostin. This problem is increasing. This is just the first hit at this or the first part of the relay. ACCG helps me with this map, but there are several more areas that they need to apply this to. This is growing. The best way to give you a concept of what is happening in the interim are appropriations, analysts put together a fact book for us. If any of you kept that, and they have a pie chart. In the pie chart, 79% of the population lives in 41 urban counties. 21% of the population lives in 118 rural counties. This is going to continue as our population concentrates in certain urban areas, but our state is only as strong as our weakest points. This is something we need to be aware of. I certainly appreciate the support of the committee and the help from both Representative of the Hood and Anderson and all the members of the committee who got engaged in this discussion. Thank you so much for your interest in this bill. I hope all of us will continue to track this as we go along. This is a resource that we are working very hard to develop. And hopefully at some point we can build up some of our urban areas, but this in the end gives an economy of scale and a chance to consolidate their governments over one administration, a striator who has the skill sets in which to help the governments comply with all the regulations and provide services. Mr. Speaker, are you the well? The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair here is none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1253. They're yeas 168. And they is one. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 12331233? House Bill 1233 by the way of his own. Hitchens 161 and others being titled back to amend. Chapter 3 entitled 25, the official go to Georgia annotated relating local fire departments generally. So as expressly authorize the levy and collection of extra territorial taxes and fees to support local fire departments. This bill I refer to the committee on Governor LaFaire's that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chairman Hitchens is recognized to present the bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. This bill came to me as a result of a Supreme Court case. And the case was actually Bill's cell telecommunications V. Cobb County. What occurred there was there was some issues in 911 services for five different phone companies. Cobb County sought to collect money that they were supposedly authorized to collect in a prior agreement. And it went all the way to the Supreme Court and they ruled against Cobb County. As a result of that, there's a law firm in Brunswick. They have office in Brunswick in Savannah. And they are suing several municipalities in a couple counties. And the plaintiffs' attorneys have, I think, brought in the scope of the bill's cell telecommunications case to say that in my particular case, the city of Portland was being sued for three and a half million dollars. Because they charge fees for fire protection outside of their municipality. And what happened here is they have a great fire department because they also provide fire protection for the Port of Savannah, which is a but some. But the county in that area who has a fire department, but they don't have any resources in that area. So the response time is negligible. So we've gone up this bill and the legal counsel says that it will rectify the problem. There have already been a couple of questions to ask to me. And we've contacted, after hours tonight, the legal advisor. And I think I'm going to get a question or two, so I'll just reserve that until I get a question about it. And that's the bill, Mr. Mayor. You don't have any questions. You did a good job. I want to thank you. I yield to you. For change. Oh, excuse me. That's slipped. I'm sorry. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered that here here's done the previous question is ordered? Is any objection to agree to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? It's here here's done the report of the committee is agreed to. Now, this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1233, the yeas are 167, the nays 1. This bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Mr. Clerk, were you ready to caption to House Bill 1031, 1031? House Bill 1031 by ribs in a black one of the 146th and others to be titled to amend chapter 5 and title 48. The fish go to Georgia and Tetti really add Valorum taxation to property. Social and foreign mandatory reappraisal parcels. This bill I'm referring to the committee on ways and means that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Reptenti Washburn is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House, I present House Bill 1031. We I was privileged to chair a study committee on Abraum taxation for Chairman Blackman last summer and we met for two days and these are some of the things that came out of that study committee. The first thing the bill does is to require that an estimated rollback be published when there is a reassessment to match up with the increased revenue that come from the reassessment. So that is required. There's also a statement that was put in that I think is very worthwhile for you and for the tax pay as you represent. In the bill it is stated that the tax assessor's notice has to read as follows. The adopted millegraded exceeds the estimated rollback rate as stated in the annual notice of assessments that you previously received for this taxable year which will result in an increase in the amount of property tax that you will owe. So that's a very plain statement that I think is appropriate for the tax pay as to see. One other aspect of the bill is the chief of praiser in every county is required to reassess a reapprace properties at least every three years. There's some improvement to the sales ratio study language and lastly there is an opportunity to appeal the digest to the superior court if the folks are appealing don't like what the Board of Arbitrators has ruled. The last thing it removes the dollar amount of the property taxes from the assessment. Previously that was there based on the previous year's millegraded causes a lot of confusion with people they would come and try to appeal thinking they could appeal their taxes. So that is a summary of the bill. Mr. Spick out, be glad to entertain any questions. You have several questions. Representative Kamp to your left has a question. Representative Beth Kamp. This is gentleman yield. We have a deal for the chair lady. Thank you so much. Thank you for bringing this bill. Isn't it true that this whole package of HB 1031 is really an opportunity for the tax payers to have more transparency and more understanding of their tax bill. So hopefully there will be an easier transition with milled rates and assessments change and also for our tax commissioners who have been struggling with sales ratio studies especially in smaller counties. That is true. Thank you. Gentlemen yield for another question. Representative Kelly to your left again has a question. Representative Kelly. Thank you Mr. Speaker. We're the gentleman yield. We yield to my forehand. Thank you, Representative Washburn. During our committee we had a lot of conversation about transparency and clarity for the tax payer but isn't also one of the big goals here is also accountability for the local governments. That if they don't honor the estimated rollback that they have to put that very clear and concise statement advising the tax payer that they will now receive a tax increase. That is true. Thank you for the bill. Thank you. Gentlemen yield for another question from Representative Wilkerson to your left in the back. I will yield for one more. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? I do. As far as the taxpayers, the, I guess there's different parts of the bills and the transparency piece correct that we'll let the taxpayers know. Is it not true that I guess my one concern is that rollback provision that you only get though the three year lock, you only get the three year lock if you are successful. Corporations tend to be more successful in those appeals so they're going to get that three year lock whereas the regular homeowner who appeals may not win their appeal may not get a reduction but they will now lose that three year lock they get on their property taxes. Is that true? That was discussed and I am not sure that that was included in this bill frankly. Thank you. Mr. Speaker I will yield a well. The gentleman has yielded the well. He had a couple more questions but he yields the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair here is none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is representing Paris rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker is it true that ACCG has a problem with this bill? I don't know how many problems ACCG has. They are probably multiple but I am not sure about this but I am not giving you short answer. I wasn't a question but thank you sir. For what purpose does chair Lady Halston rise? She weighs. For what purpose does represented Kelly rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that earlier this afternoon I met with the chairman of the Paul and County commission and he was very much in favor of this legislation. I am sure the gentleman knows what he speaks. For what purpose does the author rise representing Washburn? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that it is absolutely incorrect that the ACCG is not in support of this bill? They are very much in support of it and wanted it presented.

this evening. I hope you all can get together on that. I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he speaks. ACCG is very popular. They are fine organization and I'll vouch for them. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute that Chair, here's none? The Committee's substitute is adopted. How did he do that, Dana? Oh boy, I was in a hurry there. Have, yeah, I think you all all have voted. Have all the members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The Yees were on House Bill 1031. Yees 146 and Yees 24. The bill, Henry C. the requisite Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of the House Bill 441? House Bill 441 by room, Senate of Dempsey, the 13th and others to be entitled to an act to amend Chapter 11 of Title 43, the official go to Georgia and it's either relating to Dennis, Dennyl Hygenists and the dental assistants, those authorized and regulate, tell a dentistry in the state by licensed dentists. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Health, that Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Rules Committee's substitute. Representative Katie Dimpsy is recognized to present the bill, the lady from Rome. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know we've had a lot of paper on our desk today, but early this morning you received an important one that I want to remind you about. Many of you may have gotten text messages and emails and calls from dental hygienists who were not so sure about this bill. But it's pretty historic that you found somewhere in all that paper a letter from the Georgia Dental Association and the Georgia Dental Hygenist Association supporting this measure. So if that is in your mind right now that the hygienists are not in favor of this, you can hit the erase button because they are and that is because of much work that took place on HB441. This is simply a measure that authorizes and regulates the practice of teladenistry in Georgia by Georgia licensed oral health care team members, particularly in our rural and underserved areas of this state and our Title in Schools assisted living facilities will benefit greatly from this. It codifies teladenistry into Georgia law as it was first practiced under executive order during the COVID pandemic. It is a good measure. It will help people who need services and are not getting them right now. Mr. Speaker if there are any questions I will be glad to take them if not I will yield the well. The lady has a question from one of the learned practitioners of dentistry in our state chairman Hawkins. This is chair lady you. I certainly do. This is very good bill. And won't this bill increase the access to health care throughout Georgia? It absolutely will and thank you for your hard work on this measure. Thank you. Lady has no further questions. I will hold it just for a moment. I had a good question. The lady is also a knowledgeable about rural health. Chair lady, Houston. Is it not true that this is going to be a, it could be a lifesaver to a lot of people in rural Georgia who have no dental care. I appreciate you bringing this. Dental care is a passion of mine for people in rural Georgia and I do appreciate it. It absolutely will. Chairman Halston I know you have told us all that you are committed to this measure. To continue that work when you step away from here. So thank you for that good question. If there are no further questions, Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for everyone's favorable support. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair here is none. The committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection? Objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules. Chair here is none. The rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the pass to the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted now? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 441, the yeas are 167, the nays are zero. The bill haven't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 218? House Bill 218, by the way, I have hilted in the 48th and others to be entitled to amend Article 2, chapter 8 of Title 24 of the Fish Coda, Georgia, Annotated, relating to admissions and confessions. So it's required for sexual assault hearsay for disabled adults and 17-year-olds. This bill is for the committee on judiciary non-civil. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Scott Hilton is recognized to present the bill. Representative Hilton. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We've heard you say it many times. It's a good day in Georgia and I'm going to say it's a good night in Georgia because we are standing up today for those who need a voice. And we're doing that once again with House Bill 218. Those who suffer from elder abuse, who are either an elder or those with a disability, we are allowing their hearsay to be allowed in court. I want to thank Chair Lady Cooper for bringing me this bill. We've worked on it for a couple of years now. Prosecuting attorneys are on board, defense attorneys are on board, and judiciary it passed unanimously. And so with that, I'll pause for any questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Hearing none, I'll yield the well. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? The Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 218, the yeas are 164, the nay is won, this bill, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption, the House Resolution 1042, 1042? House Resolution 1042 by Representative Levert of the 123rd and others, a resolution creating the Joint Study Committee on Judicial System Compensation. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by Committee substitute. The gentleman from Elpertun, Representative Levert, is recognized to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. House Resolution 1042 would create a study committee, a joint study committee. That's why we're doing it on crossover on Judicial System Compensation. This is sort of a accompanying legislation with our Judicial Compensation Bill, which this house passed several weeks ago. It creates a study committee to look at compensation of the other officials involved in our Judicial System, primarily the local paid officials, state court judges, probate court judges, juvenile court, matastric court, and then DAs and public defenders. And that's what the bill does, and Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. The gentleman has a question, Representative Donna Houdt, to your left, is recognized for our question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir, I yield. Is this your first bill? It's the first one in the last ten minutes. I sounded like a rookie. Gentlemen, has no questions. Mr. Speaker, thank you all. We yield the well, ladies and gentlemen, before I leave, I want to just leave you with some wisdom of that great child advocate, Yogi Berra. Don't buy your children in Encyclopedia. Let them walk to school the way you did. Thank you, I yield the well. Okay. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not. The previous question is ordered. Is the objection, any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The chair here is done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All in favor of the adoption of the resolution? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House Resolution 1042. The yeas are 164. The nays are zero. The resolution having received their requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. The clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 910, 910. House Bill 910, by the way, representative Jasper, the 11th and others to be entitled to amend Title 39 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to minors, so to create a civil remedy for damages against commercial entities that distribute material harmful to minors without performing age verification. Mr. Bill, I'm further from the committee on. Would you just share in that committee that recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute? Chair, I recognize the representative Jasper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Since I brought up Speaker Ralston earlier today, I believe he would say as many of you have talked to me over the past few days about this bill, in his very distinctive voice that some of you may have heard, why are you doing this? Because I'm probably not the guy that you would think would be in the well of the House talking about porn. And you know, we've had a lot of questions about it, but I bring to you a simple law, a solution that may in our country do the impossible. That's making online porn retreat. I want to thank my friend and constituent Jeff, who he's probably not listening now he did earlier, for contacting me in January, because he had saw this online news and seen it said, Rick, this could be big if you're brave enough. And of course I'm brave enough, maybe not smart enough sometimes, but brave enough. And I had a great intern, Jackson Collette, and his help on this has been invaluable. You know, we sometimes underestimate the value and smarts of some of these interns, but Jackson's been great. So what it'll do, the law requires that users of porn sites prove they're 18 years old. Before accessing a site that has over 33% of pornography, pornographic material, to meet the requirement, the potential user must show that government issued ID like a driver's license or whatever to do that. It's very clear in the bill what these are. Companies that violate this law can be sued for damages in the local court by the parents of the minors who were able to access the site without being verified. This will ensure compliance. Why we're doing this, I don't have to tell you about the going to detail why porn was bad, is bad. If you really want to listen to a good part of it, go back and listen to just judiciary hearing and get a good earful. But two things I think about most is promoting negative attitudes toward women, which can and has led to violence and sex trafficking. And yes, these sites have young women who are trafficked worldwide. If I had teachers and parents talk to me after I dropped this bill, tell me the issues that they have they see in their schools. I was asked yesterday about user privacy, wondered if it would lead to the collection of sensitive personal information. Well, first you don't have to get on the porn site and not worry about it. But the law protects privacy by requiring that all information collected be deleted upon verification. The law only requires a user to produce a government ID, which is already required for many activities that prohibit minors from attending, vaping, driving, boating, going to adult bookstores, other things like that. All require this ID. So what happens, Mr. Jasper's, we do this. What happens? In the nine states that have enacted this bill, most of them have left the state. Geofence, their pornography site out of the state so it's not available. It worked. And it's been going around. Yes, there is a bill in Washington to do it, but they'll never get it done. We know that. And so porn sites just leave the state. You know, Mr. Speaker, members, I'm glad Jeff me about, asked me about this. I never had thought about it until he got with me and talked me about it. And I'll be glad to answer questions. You know, it's a very legal bill. And I really want to thank the Judiciary Committee for being so kind to me. Helping me through this was some very legal questions and ideas and changes and, you know, Chairman Gunners Committee is very, very helpful. I'd be glad, Mr. Speaker, to answer any questions. And I hope we can do this. So we truly can protect children. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You have a couple of questions. Representing Jasmine Clark to your left has a question if the gentleman will yield. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman yield. Yes, ma'am. So how does this work for sites that are, how do I put this? There are sites that are used where people upload the house. You have to speak up. I can barely hear you. People upload themselves, let's say only fans. I don't know anything about only fans, never been there, but I'm just saying. How would this affect that? Because in that case, that is an individual's page. How do we make sure that people's government information is kept private from these individuals that are posting themselves for other people's entertainment? Well, I certainly haven't been there either as the General Lady hasn't. But it goes back to the 33%. When you're looking at the site, if there's 33% over this photographic, and it's harmful to minors, you read the bill that describes what is harmful to minors, and the substantial portion is very clear in the bill too. So then they would have to do age verification. Now, that's just for you to get on it to view it. I'm sure there's contractual between how you get on it and pay yourself to have your self exposed, but we're just after the people that go to watch. That can't decision them in further yield. Sure, yes ma'am. So what about the hosting of these websites? So if the website is not hosted in the United States, and say it's hosted in another country, we are now having to upload our government ID to foreign companies or foreign individuals just because we are accessing it in the state of Georgia. And to be clear by we, I just mean people in Georgia, I'm not talking about me and you. I'm sure we're not. You know, yes ma'am, that's a risk. I mean, yeah. But I think the bill's very clear. And there's some federal law that protects the people who operate the big websites and like Google and stuff that move a lot of this stuff around. There's federal law that protects them. The committee changed the bill a little bit because they felt that they were already protected. But I think, yeah, that's the risk. You have that's the risk you take down when you buy something online that is worldwide. Thank you. Yes ma'am. Of course. Representative Stenson, in the back to your left, Mr. Chairman, has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. gentlemen, you. Yes ma'am. I'm just trying to understand your legislation for someone who is not a poin watcher. I'm trying to really, this is serious question. I'm trying to understand how would this legislation actually impact people in rural Georgia? You're saying they have to have a driver's license to be able to watch porn? Yes. Now, you know, but I'm sure that there's other alternatives. But, you know, if you're on a site that has more than 33% of pornographic material on it, you would have to verify that you were over 18. This is like if you were to verify that you went into an adult bookstore, about alcohol or anything like that, about alcohol online, you're going to do the same thing. I don't think rural, I live in rural Georgia and I don't think this has anything to do with rural Georgia. Well, I know in rural Georgia, we don't have, in my dish, we don't have any move with the aiders and I'm just wondering what people actually watch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for your work on this legislation. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. You're still rolling, Mr. Chairman. Well, I know. I'm represent to God there has a question. I'm chairman Goethe. I'm chairman's question. Thank you. I'm probably in health. Is it genuine yield? Yes, sir. All right. Is it not true that a recent study found that 51% of 11 to 13 year olds have been exposed to porn and that this bill would reduce that exposure? Yes, sir, it will. And that is a tragic of what happens in our world today. And I hope we can vote to do this to move it along to see if we can protect our children. Thank you for your help in committee. Mr. Speaker, I know it's getting late and there's a lot of people behind me and I appreciate everyone's comments. I appreciate your green vote. Thank you. You had a whole slew of questions, but the gentleman is yielded the well. Is is yeah, he said he'd be right over here. If you want to quiz him any further on the bill, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute that's here? Here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose is ribs under the hon. Ross? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. Stature inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that nothing in this bill will infringe on free speech or prevent an adult from choosing to view explicit material? I'm sure the learned lawyer that the lady understands the implications of the bill. I'm sure she's correct. For what purpose is representative Jason Ridley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that I'm really worried by my own fan side? I mean, I don't have any subscribers yet, but you ain't going to give me a chance. You'll get there, I'm sure. We'll take a couple more. For what purpose is representative Gledney rise? Parliamentary inquiry, sir. Stature inquiry, ma'am. Is it not true that my youngest son, who is now 23 years old, saw the committee Kardashian video when he was in the third grade and it changed his life forever. Forever. Forever, yes ma'am. Forever. Those glasses are doing that for me too, I can tell you that. For what purpose is representative Wade rise? I don't know how to follow that. All right, Parliamentary inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true that this house has a record of bipartisan support for the protection of children, their innocence, and their safety all across every corner of this state and I commend the carrier of this legislation for his effort? I know that to be true. Thank you for your inquiry. We'll take one more. Representative Amadi Barnes is recognized for a question, for a Parliamentary inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that 13-year-olds have access to all different kind of apps that can get away around this anyway? I'm just not sure, so I'll trust the ladies' opinion. Have all members now voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 910. The yeas are 165. The nay is won. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 1149 1149. House Bill 1149, I represent a remainder of the 56 and others being titled an act to amend Article 1881 of Title 36 of the Efficiency of the Church of Antietta, where there are new local governments, budgets and audits. Those require local constitutional officers to annually report audits of discretionary funds to the General Assembly. Ms. Bill 11, referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Rules Committee Substitute. I'm having way too much fun, so you guys are going to listen up. Give the lady in the well your attention. Representative Maynard is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to make this very short, because I told you I could do it in 30 seconds. The only thing that this bill does is right now we have constitutional officers that are defined on pages 65 to 66. They have to report how they spend the appropriated funds. There are funds that they have that are discretionary, that they do not have to report at the moment. And so this bill simply says they must report their discretionary funds to the county. What they do with the discretionary funds, this bill has nothing to do with that. They will still be able to use the discretionary funds as they choose to. I yield the will if there are no questions. You have a question to you, Liv, representative Oliver, is recognized for a question. Does the lady yield? Well, let me first say that we fixed the question that you had. I will yield. If you're thinking ahead of how I'm thinking, the question in committee is if my clerk of the Cab County Superior Court gets personal income from passport fees that in no way belongs to the Cab County under the law, doesn't your bill require somebody to audit her personal income from passport fees? How did you fix that? Okay, your question and if I may, your question in committee was how do you define discretionary funds? So it is now defined in this bill. Any further questions? Does the further lady further yield? I don't. Yes or no? Sure, yes. Thank you. I guess my problem is with your definition of discretionary funds. It's personal discretionary funds. It's not public discretionary funds. It's my problem. So my issue about us auditing the tax commissioner of Fulton County's personal money or the Cab Clerks personal money is still a problem for me. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So I'll answer that question. Discretionary funds are the county, the people's money. There is not a probate judge, a tax commissioner that has their name listed on any government building. Any money that comes in through the government is the government's money. Now if a constitutional officer wants to use the discretionary funds for their income, they can still do that. This bill does not say that they cannot do that. This bill simply says you have to report to the county the money that you have received. It's only money that's not appropriated and I yield the will. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

The lady has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there an objection to withdrawing the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the committee's substitute is withdrawn. Is there an objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The Chair, here's none of the rules committee's substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Chair, here's none of the rules. If so, the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1149, the yeas are 100, the nays are 62. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 12551255? House Bill 1255 by Representative Jones of the 60th to be entitled to amend Code Section 5, 6, 42, the official go to Georgia, and to any relating to procedure for preparing and filing of transcript of evidence and proceedings where the appellate designates matters to be omitted from the record on appeal and extensions of time for the completion of the transcript. This bill, for the committee on judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The bill is represented by the bill. Representative Sheila Jones is recognized to present the bill. Representative Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I bring to you HB 1255, and I am working from LC481179. HB 1255, in the current statute, it does not make it clear who makes the request for the transcripts. In some courts like Fortin County, the request is made with the judges' staff attorneys or staff members. In the CAHP County, the clerk of court makes the request as a courtesy to the appellant. In TABBARD County, the clerk uses another method, then the clerk orders the transcript. This has posed problems in the past. The appeal is against the judges' order, and the transcripts never get ordered, placing the appellant in jeopardy of getting their appeal dismissed. This small change to the bill will allow the process to be the same in all courts in Georgia, and provide a clear path to hold the appellant accountable for not adhering to the new clear directions in causing the transcripts to be produced. I ask for your favorable consideration on House Bill 1255. You have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good job. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Is there an objection to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? I have all members voted for what purpose is representative Nullowitz-Ross? Is it not true that this House has a legacy of excellent terries who have been in service to the state of Georgia and that in supporting the Terry Act, we will continue to cement the legacy of terries in Georgia. That's pretty self-serving. Never ceases to amaze me around here. For what purpose is representative Stenson? Why, yes, the terries are pretty great. I'm sorry. The state's inquiry. Is it not true that my colleagues want me to be the chairman easily teag of the night and let you know that everybody's ready to go home? Is that not true, Mr. Speaker? You forgot your hat. For what purpose is representative Brad Thomas-Ross? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State's inquiry. Is it not true that I also like terries and I'd really appreciate it, Terry England, who could be my most favorite Terry if he put my bill on the floor? That won't work. Is, have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1255, the yeas are 167, the nay is one. This bill, having receded requisite, Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will yeary the caption of House Bill 14101410? House Bill 1410 by Representative Abstration of the 104th to be entitled next to amend. Chapter 3, title 8 of the Efficient Court of Georgia and Int. Relaing the Housing General issues to establish a stable housing accountability program. This bill, having referred to the Committee on Budget and Physical Affairs oversight, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Rules Committee substitute. The gentleman from Gwyneth, leader of the bill, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a House Bill 1410. This bill would create a voluntary program for the homeless, which would provide stable housing with an accountability court-like structure that would be administered through local charitable organizations. This would allow for funding that is not bound by federal housing first requirements, and would allow for private contributions, such as from Quick Trip, who supports this measure, would allow for private funding, and provide structure, which I as a former judge. The former drug court prosecutor have seen the success of an accountability court-like structure if we could allow the homeless voluntarily to enter into these programs. We think that we could have some great success, providing stable housing for a set period of time with work requirements, with opportunities for substance abuse treatment, therapy, mental health treatment as well. Would appreciate your favorable consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, you? Yes, sir. We're representative of your order to your right, and has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does gentlemen you? Yes, sir. Leader of the administration, is it not true that nothing in this bill mandates an individual enter into the program? That's correct. That's absolutely correct. It's completely voluntary. There's no criminal component, no criminalization of anyone who doesn't participate. The voluntary program, if someone is homeless and needs stable housing, is willing to commit to the requirements that are part of this structure would allow for stable housing for that person to get back on their feet, be gainfully employed, and be self-supporting at the completion of the program. Thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen, you? Yes, sir. Representative Becky Evans to your left. Has a question. Is it gentleman Yeal? Yes, ma'am. Yes, isn't it true that I'm very glad to support this bill as there is a great need for housing in Georgia? Thank you for your support. And is it also true that I'm very glad to see that we are using the Housing Trust Fund. And the Housing Trust Fund does have the statutory authority to hold funds. And in addition to providing this specific homeless service, we could also be using funds from our undesignated surplus to provide one-time grants to do all types of housing assistance, to build new buildings to provide grants to municipalities and nonprofits to do even more to provide housing for the citizens of Georgia. Well, I have to respond saying this house has really shown a great commitment to addressing homelessness with funding that's been in previous budgets that we passed. The issue has been that state money that we're putting up often is tied to federal funds that we're receiving that have strings attached as to how they're to be used. And so the concept here would allow us to have a Georgia program to address this issue with the structure that's provided in the bill. And that again, that'd be administered locally, but it would actually allow for getting at issues like substance abuse, like a need for job training, a need for mental health, counseling therapy for substance abuse treatment so that we can really get folks on their feet and it's for a set period of time, maximum 18 months so that they can be self-sufficient at the end of that period. Yes, thank you. And I am supportive of this, but I'm just also, I hope that at some point in the future we can can use the housing trust fund for other purposes for housing as well. Well, I'll just say the house again should be commended because we have had strong appropriations in that area. And in my view, the strings attached to the federal funds have been a great obstacle, but this is going to give us an alternative path, which I'm very proud of. Mr. Speaker, I know the hours late. I will. Okay, Mr. Chairman. You take one more? One more question. Yes, ma'am. Okay, yes, sir. Chairman Tarvan, do you're right in the back of the room? Has a question. Hey, Jim and Hill. Yes, sir. I may have missed this, but I support you, Bill. I appreciate you bringing it, but if I remember correctly, this bill does not mandate the spending of any state money. Is that not correct? That is correct. No state money is required to be spent as part of the bill would just allow us a structure should the general assembly in the future decide to appropriate money for this purpose. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know the hours late. I'll yield the well and ask the members favorable consideration of House Bill 1410. Thank you. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that chair? Here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair, here's none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to report the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. We'll vote no. Have all members voted for what purpose is represented fry rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that I appreciate this bill being brought by the leader and that we've discussed a couple of issues that we're going to work on as it goes through the Senate and that this bill will put a dent in the homeless issues that we face in the state? The gentleman knows I feel like that's the power of this house. We work out our differences and move things along. Thank you. For your inquiry. For what purpose is represented McCullough rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State your inquiry. Is it not true that a lot of homeless are veterans and we know the house loves the veterans and I appreciate the leader bringing this? We certainly agree on that sir and I think that's one of the strengths of this house caring about our veterans. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of house bill 1410 the yeas are 167 the nay is one this bill had received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.

Members I know the hours late and I'll get there this relatively quickly. There have been three bills three Ag Department requested bills this session that put some garels on Georgia's hemp industry. The bill is 458 by rep purple addresses testing and validation. HB 1286 by rep Corbett addresses licensing and now this bill HB 1322 addresses advertising and packaging specifically as it relates to children. There's four primary components to the bill. The original one includes packaging restrictions for hemp and specifically requires hemp product packaging that is not attractive to children. It's not a look alike product is tamper evident and child resistant opponent to includes advertising restrictions on packaging and specifically targets and prohibits advertising that is attractive to children. Component three includes retail store restrictions to include the prohibition of selling or distributing consumable hemp products if the store is located less than a thousand feet from a school. And finally component four conform state law to mirror the federal legal limit for Delta nine THC concentration measurement as set forth in title seven of the US code which currently has a legal limit of 0.3%.

And they violate this what would be the compensation or they not allowed to sell this anymore do they go fine penalized do they go to jail what happens to the store part of the ongoing process with all three bills that have been introduced is to come up with those ideas through the college of the department.

So it was required the establishment of an adult abuse neglect and exploitation multidisciplinary team in each judiciary circle this bill ever further the committee on judiciary non civil that committee recommends a dispelled do pass by committee substitute. Members I know the hours getting a little bit late especially for some of us they like to go to bed early but we do have several more important propositions that we need to take up before we adjourn tonight. So if you will help me give my attention and your attention to the member in the well. Chair recognize representative bear it to present the bill represented court of bear it. Thank you Mister speaker ladies and gentlemen house bill 1123 this bill is another important step in Georgia's fight against elder abuse neglect and exploitation. In 2018 House bill 635 was passed authorizing each of the 49 judicial circuits in Georgia to create an adult abuse neglect and exploitation multidisciplinary team or MDT. The original bill was passed unanimously in the house and the Senate. This bill makes three improvements to that legislation. First it creates a regional coordinator program within the prosecuting the attorneys council of Georgia. These regional coordinators will work closely with the MDTs around the state. Second it sets the expectation that each judicial circuit will have a multidisciplinary team though it gives broad latitude to each circuit to tailor this to its own specific needs. And is not required unless the regional coordinator program has been funded under the prosecuting attorneys council. Finally it proposes the creation of an elder abuse justice coalition comprised of a broader restakeholders. This bill is supported by the Georgia Council and aging co-age the Alzheimer's Association the Georgia gerontology society and the prosecuting attorneys council among many others. This bill was passed unanimously in subcommittee and committee and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. You have no questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well.

House Bill 294 by reps at a percol 169th and others to be entitled an act to amend chapter 23, Title 50, the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority. So as to authorize the authority to finance and perform certain duties in connection with projects relating to natural gas facilities, this bill I'm referring to the Committee on Natural Resources and Environment, that committee recommends a disbile due pass. The gentleman who I'm down in Irwin County, I think that's right, yeah Irwin County, Chairman Clay Percol is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker, I have been informed no more farm stories about this. This actually came from the rule of the federal council when it's around the state. Natural Gas Capacity is one of the key pitch points in economic development many parts of the state as we heard as we went around with RDC. Some communities have zero excess capacity to track good paying manufacturing jobs. That will be my community, somehow no natural gas at all, no excess. This bill merely provides authorization for chiefa to provide financing for natural gas projects for cities and counties across the state. It is an extension of what they currently do providing financing opportunities. For water sewer solid waste it is actually symbiotic with the solid waste and the natural gas. I can't imagine a more important program growth need in this state than for having natural gas availability in some of the most economic and political distress parts of the state. Mr. Speaker that's what the bill does, provides authorization, I would appreciate a green vote on this one. Mr. Chairman would you take one question from a gentleman who understands the importance of this issue? Yes sir absolutely. Chairman Gerald Green Senator I'll the dean of this house has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker to the gentleman in the well do you yield? Yes sir I do. Was this not one of our provisions that we thought was one of the best economic tools for the council of real council this past summer and fall? I think you actually called it a priority of the council yes sir absolutely. This is another way in for the economic mentality of rural Georgia.

more. Thank you so much Chairman Green. Gentlemen has no further questions. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's done the report. The committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine?

The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 12741274. House Bill 1274 by Representative Hustlen of the 72nd and others to be entitled to amend part 6a of Article 7 of Chapter 3, Title 20 of the EFISCO to George Annotated relating to state and veterinary education so as to abide for limits on the student loan forgiveness program. This bill having referred to the committee on higher education that committee recommends a dis bill and do pass. Representative David Huddleston is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the members of the House. I'm going to bring before you today House Bill 1274. What this bill does is it's a veterinary tuition assistance program for veterinarians. This program was initiated in 2016 and what we've looked at doing is basically it was a year, one year program that you had to come back each additional year to apply for the assistance. Basically we've made it a three year program and we've went from 20 to $25,000 per year per student, five students eligible. A couple of the changes that we made in there is basically population. It had to be the counties that was eligible for the veterinarian's to serve was at 30,000 population. We moved it to 50,000 which that would basically affect 118 counties within the state which basically within this three year program we can make a very big dent make a very big impact within the state. What brought this forth was actually last year a few of us had conversations and we saw that it was a dire need of having a large animal food industry vets within the rural communities of Georgia and one of the things that we've heard from our commission commissioner of ag is food security as national security. So colleagues like said with this information here like said I'll yield for any questions. Gentlemen you have a couple of questions representing Barnes to your left representing at Mardi Barnes has a question to your left. This gentleman you. I do. Thank you. Does this apply to biomedical research veterinarians or just agriculture vets? It basically is for large animal food industry vets for the rural communities of Georgia. All right thank you. Thank you. Representative Angela Moore to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes ma'am. Can you tell me I am for any education that is free? Okay but does this apply to rural Georgia the entire state the people that live in my neck of the woods. It's a wonderful bill if it works for everyone. Yes ma'am basically it's statewide and basically like I said we have vets all over the state but there is a lot of number of counties that does not have large animal food industry vets. So basically within this program you may have a veterinarian that works in a urban area but that is willing to serve in one of those 118 counties and basically within the assistance they have to provide at least 20 hours per week for the large animal food industry. Gentlemen further you. Yes ma'am. It is a wonderful bill and I hope that it works on the east side of Atlanta as well. Absolutely. Thank you ma'am. To your right represent Jason Riddle has a question. I'm sorry I knew that was going to happen. Representative Jason Riddle. My bed. Mr. Speaker I know it's like this gentleman yield. Yes sir. Tell me again about that. What was the population number? Basically they looked at the counties the original intent of the program the counties eligible was population in the 2010 census of 30,000 and below they took the numbers of the 2020 census and they've increased it to 50,000 and below population which that would allow 118 counties to be eligible for vets to work within the program. Okay I just want to make sure I heard the below number thank you. Thank you. Representative Chairman Dickie Chairman of Agriculture I think you're aware who he is has a question. Does the gentleman yield? Yes sir. I just want a is this your first bill is this first time I've seen you up there? Yes sir.

House bill 1239, motion of Collins, 71st and others to be titled, not to amend title 40, the fiscal to Georgia, and tent everyone in the motor vehicles and traffic. So it's a provide for the operation of miniature on-road vehicles on certain highways. This bill will improve the committee on motor vehicles. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Collins is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring before the House bill 1239. As many of you know last year, we passed legislation that allowed ATVs to be on county streets and certain streets in our state. If you look on the board there, you'll see a Japanese mini truck, what they call a key truck. This legislation would allow these vehicles to be placed on county and city streets throughout the state. I talked with DOR and did a little research. We had tag offices that were issuing tags to these vehicles for the last several years. And during the year last year, they rolled that back. So we have a lot of people in this state that have imported these vehicles and they've been using them around for agricultural purposes. Around the farm, zip around town. And so DOR rolled that back and now they're kind of stuck in no man's land. The bill would just allow those to be tagged if they're over 25 years or older. If they're newer than 25 years, they have to meet certain federal requirements. They all have headlights, tail lights.

Breaklots, seat belts, some of these even have airbags. They have air conditioning, they're full-wheel drive, and they're used a lot overseas. So I would just like to ask your favorable consideration to House Bill 1239. Let's make these legit on county and city streets. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I yield the well. You have a question to your left, Representative Donner, who has a question if you're yielded. The gentleman you? Absolutely. Thank you for bringing this bill. Is it not true my brother has? One of these and my son has two. And basically they already have this tag, but then a lot of these people were scared that they invested in all this money in these machines, and they wouldn't be able to use it. Absolutely. Thank you for bringing it. Thank you. Any further questions, Mr. Speaker? You have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for 12. I'll allow me to present 1239. I ask for your favorable consideration. House Bill 1239. Good Bill, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for attending to the issue. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The board of the committee is agreed to shout this bill. Now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members vote of this so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1239, the yeas 168, the nay is one. The bill hasn't received the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10991099. House Bill 1099 by ribs that have huddlest in to the 72nd and others to be entitled to amend part one of Article 2, Chapter 7 and Title 16 for the official go to George Aniteta who will link the general provisions relative to criminal trespass and damage to property so as to provide for the crime of criminal trespass upon the knowing entry upon land or premises of another that has been marked with purple paint. Mr. Bill, I'm referring to the committee on judiciary. Now in civil-led committee recommends that this bill do pass. Will representative Huddleston you feel good about passing that first bill? Okay, the second one's always challenging. Isn't it Mr. Leader? That's the fact. All right, representative Huddleston's recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I'm referring before you, House Bill 1099, what this does, this adds language to an existing code to allow property owners to mark the property lines with purple paint markings to identify for any possible criminal trespass. The purple paint marks on trees and posts serve as a legal warning not to enter onto the property so long as they are clearly visible. Space no more than 100 feet apart on forested land and 1,000 feet apart on non-forested land and placed at the required height and also you can put it above high water marks and flood zones. What this does basically that signs are so expensive, this allows landowners to mark the property lines with the markings and it makes it a more affordability and they basically say that purple paint is more visible. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll ask for your questions. Gentlemen, has a question to your left representing Tyler Paul Smith. Has a question. This is gentlemen, you'll. Yes, sir. Okay, to my neighbor to the south, isn't it true that this bill makes our practices conform with several neighboring states that we have around us? That is actually correct. There's actually 16 states with the same language and all the surrounding states of Georgia has the same language within their code. Thank you for the question. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. You did learn something from that first bill. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none the report. The committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? For what purpose is represented if he'll turn rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Paul Minerianquery. State you inquiry. He's not true. The Senate adjourned about an hour ago. And I'd like to stand up and complain that we are once again working harder than the Senate. Life ain't fair, is it? But this is the hardest working group. In this capital right here, this House of Representatives, no doubt about it. We're getting closer, y'all. We're getting closer. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1099. The yeas are 167. The nays are zero. The bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there for past? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 12601260? House Bill 1260, the Representative of the House Bill 1260, the second 20th and others to be entitled to amend, entitled to the fiscal to Georgia and inted to relay an agriculture source to enact the Georgia, nicotine, vapor, products, directory act. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Regulated Industries, that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Gaines is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Tonight, I'm proud to present House Bill 1260 legislation that's aimed at getting the vape marketplace and Georgia under control. Right now, we have no enforcement of vapes on shelves in Georgia to confirm what is being sold as legal product. And I believe it's imperative that we get a handle on what's happening in our state. There are countless examples of young people in Georgia who've ended up vaping just one time and it changes their lives. Sometimes it's a flavored vape that gets them hooked. Other times it's a fentanyl-laced vape that puts them in the hospital or worse. The reality is the FDA's put in place some restrictions to try and address this issue, but there's no enforcement mechanism. We have Chinese manufacturers that are flooding the marketplace with illegal vapes that are targeting children. In fact, just last year, the number one selling vape product in America was Elf Bar. It's illegal. Yet it's on the shelves across the state and across the United States. We have no idea what's in these products. Nobody's monitoring them and retailers don't know what is legal to be sold. Instead they're coming straight from China and onto our shelves. Our bill will address this issue by creating a state level registry of vapes that are legal to be sold in the United States. That includes nearly 30 vapes that are FDA's authorized as well as hundreds of pending products. These products have not been denied so their eligible will be sold. However, products denied by the FDA would not continue to be sold in the United States. Other states that pass similar legislation, in fact the Florida House, pass this similar measure just today. Many retailers and convenience stores support this legislation because they want to know what's legal and what is not. And currently they have no way to know because there's not a registry that exists for them to check. This legislation would create an opt-in system to allow manufacturers to be able to have their products sold in Georgia so long as they're legally able to be sold. The registry would be housed in the Attorney General's Office with enforcement handled by the Department of Revenue, which is already actively visiting these facilities. I think law enforcement, if you ask them about this issue, would tell you they're seeing non-stop challenges with vaping in this state. And I believe this bill is an important measure to get this challenge under control. To speak, I'm happy to answer any questions if there are any under-hours late. You have a question to your left. How's the question? Does the gentleman yield? I will. Is it not true that according to the Georgia Student Health Survey, there's an epidemic in our high school and middle schools on usage of vapes and this bill addresses that usage specifically when it comes to unsafe products in the market? It does. In fact, I believe among our young people, there's been a 2,000 percent increase in disposable vapor products. So I believe it's an important measure to get that issue under control. Mr. Speaker, I know the hour is late, so I asked for body's favourable consideration House Bill 1260 and yield the well. The gentleman's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none of the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing the report of the committee, which was favourable to the passage of the bill, that Chair, here's none of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favour of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1260. The yeas are 163, the nays are four, the bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is there for passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to House Bill 935, 935. House Bill 935, I will announce in advance the 133rd, another is to be entitled to amend Chapter 14 and Title 40. The official go to Georgia, Anantator, relating to use of speed detection devices and red light cameras. Those are applied for standards for a conviction through the use of speed devices. This bill then referred to the Committee of Motor Vehicle, second committee recommends the Dispiddle due pass by Committee substitute. The gentleman from Millageville, Ripley-Kin, Vance has recognized to present the bill, Representative Vance. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Fellow TARD legislators. This bill as it was announced has substantially changed. It is now called the Back the Blue Bill. It's to provide bonus payments to certified peace officers. The person goes and applies for a tag in their county for a present car or a new car. They can voluntarily, voluntarily agree to pay an extra $5 that will benefit law enforcement throughout the state of Georgia. This money will be collected by the Department of Revenue who will turn it over at the end of the year to the Georgia Sheriff's Association. That association will write checks to every county sheriff's office in Georgia and the sheriff of those counties will be able to disseminate those funds equally, excuse me. They will write an equal amount of check to every county in the state of Georgia. Even the sheriff will be able to disseminate that money to deputies and jailers within that county. It is a great way, ladies and gentlemen, for people in every county in Georgia to support county law enforcement in every county in Georgia. I ask for your favorable support and I'll take any questions. Gentlemen, how's the question from Representative Chairman Tarvan in the back to your right? Gentlemen, you. Yes, sir. I do. Now this heading on here talks about the tickets from speed devices. That has nothing to do with this bill. No, sir, absolutely. This voluntary $5 added to your tag if you want to go toward there. That's correct, sir. Gentlemen, how's the further questions? I appreciate your support, folks. Thank you very much. The job, the gentleman's yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being in order that Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The Chair, here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes, all those opposed, we'll vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 935. The yeas are 170, the nays are zero. The bill, having to see the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, were you read the caption to House Bill 1314131414? The House Bill 1314 by Representative Romano, the 97th and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 11 of Title 31 of the EFISCO to George Annotated relating the emergency medical services, so as to designate emergency medical services, including ambulance service as an essential service in the state. This bill I refer to the committee on health, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. The representative remind is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I know that you are all very excited. Continue. So I know it's really early in the day, so I forget I'd give you the history of EMS since Napoleon times and then tell you why this bill is important. Or instead I will just tell you that EMS has not been an essential service, but we're actually not the only state that doesn't make an essential service. If we pass this bill, we would be the 15th state to do so. But I wanted to quickly just read one sentence from an email I received, completely unsolicited from somebody who is a current EMT and said that even when things are too hazardous for firefighters and law enforcement, he said we must always respond. And so I pursued this bill to recognize how essential this service is and I hope that you will vote for it and I ask for your favorable consideration. Lady has a question in the back of the room, Representative Stenson has a question to your left in the back. Mr. Chairman, does the General Lady yield? Yes, ma'am. Isn't that true that I do support your legislation. However, I would like to ensure that there's always conversation about emiluses always being checked and service very well before they placed on the highways, assisting families. And the reason for my suggestion is because is it not true that in January of 2021 that an ambulance broke down on its way to from making Georgia hospital to Savannah hospital with my late husband, Darryl Bentley, inside of their ambulance and I was on the side of the highway crying to my minority leader. Is that not true? Yes, ma'am. And this is why we're pursuing this bill. It's to ensure that we can start addressing some of these concerns. Thank you. And with that, unless there are no other questions, I yield the well. Lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here has done the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair here is done. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair here is done to report the Committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and declared will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose does representative Sharper rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stategy inquiry. Isn't it true that I support this bill because I've been in EMS in paramedic for 35 years and I still have my license and still practicing that if anything happens to anybody in this room that I'm ready at any time to make sure I give your body the best? I know the member is a professional. What purpose does chair lady camp rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Stategy inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true when I was an EMT and I'd get a call at 3 o'clock in the morning in the driving rain and someone had run off the road and me and my partner and whoever else showed up would try to get them to the ambulance to get them medical care. We were in essential service and I'm proud that this bill will now state that everyone in EMS is an official and an essential service in the state of Georgia. Our EMTs are essential to our quality of life here in Georgia. Representative camp, yes ma'am, that'll help. I thought you supported the bill. We just were making sure have all members voted. So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1314. The yeas are 145. The days are five. The bill had received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, we'll he read the caption to House Bill 625. House Bill 625, our resident of Mathis, the 149th and others to be entitled to amend Chapter 16 and Title 45, the official go to Georgia and Interior Related in Corners. So to provide the corners or full time county employees, this bill has been approved with the committee on Governor O'Fares. That committee recommends the dis bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Danny Mathis has recognized to present the bill. Representative Marcus, this is House Bill 625. If this helps any, I was an EMT too, there. And I'm a Leb Madei one. In fact, it tells you how long ago that was. And as Dean Green say, this is a good rule bill, Mr. Penny. So what we're doing to do here is to provide a minimum salary schedule for corners and deputy corners. Corners are kind of an unsung hero in some of the counties until you need them. As we were talking about several legislation parts here a little bit ago, we talk about debt certificates. That's what the corners do. They determine cause and matter of death. So trying to work with the GBI crime lab and those type of people, you need qualified people to run that. And it's my good friend from the coast down here said earlier about the shrimp boats. It's hard to get folks that want to do jobs that get you out on the weekends, get you out at night. But these jobs are doing it and it's a 24-7 thing. And I'd be a miss to not mention Ted Beryden with the corners association and say to him, how much he has worked on this and he has pulled representative real weight in on this to help the corners. We need to keep this system. This house has allocated money to try to get people to go to Mercer to be medical examiners or pathologists so they could do all topses. We had no takers on that. We've had to add money to the crime lab to extend the amount of folks that they can get to come in and do our op topses. We've had backlogs would be over three, four weeks. And that's somebody's loved one. And with the crimes that are happening today, we need competent people in these jobs. We need people that know what they're doing. So we think if we get a scheduled of a salary based on population, we can give them a qualified adepty. We can have good help. We know what happens when our pay is low. And we don't have competent people in jobs. We see that. We've been trying to raise things in this county. I mean, in this state, ever since I've been here, because we know it needs quality workers. Corners do work 24-7. Corners and deputy corners are vital to small rural Georgia. They're vital to a lot of big communities. We only have four medical examiners in the state. And that's infulting the cab, cab, and we're net. Clayton County has a contract deal. But we need corners. It is a job that we need to get right. Because when we have tragedies, when we have these things of COVID, when we have things of natural disasters, these people need to know what they're doing. So I, that is my request, Mr. Speaker and House. I think when I finish that, Representative Wade would like to say a few words, but I will yield well unless you have some questions. Representative Wade is not speaking, but you do have a question from the chairman if you'll yield for a question. Chairman Collins. How you yield? Jim Neal. Yes, sir. Is it not true that corners are an important and often unrecognized part of public safety? Filling an important role, helping us to investigate unattended deaths. And most importantly, serving as an advocate for the deceased. Yes, sir. You're absolutely right. We need competent people in these things. And I've just been over 30 years since anything's been done in confidence, say, corners. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield well. Gentlemen, yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered to hear? Here's none of the previous question. Is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here's none of the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The here's none of the report of the committee. Is agreed to shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote. Yes, all those opposed will vote no and Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted this so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 625. The yeas are 160. The nays are 5. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10531053? House Bill 1053, by reference to the bearer of the 24th and others to be titled an act to amend title 50. The official go to Georgia and it's had a relating state governance. It's a privilege to prohibit governmental agencies from using central bank digital currency as payment and from participating in testing the use of such currency. This bill I'm referring to the committee on banks and banking. That committee recommends the disbill do pass. Representative Carter Barrett is recognized to present the bill. Representative Barrett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. House Bill 1053. The Federal Reserve's contemplating creation of a central bank digital currency or a CBDC it would aim to supplement or eventually replace the American dollar with a digital currency. CBDC is a crypto currency that would be run by the government to replace the dollars in your bank account and your wallet with a programmable, traceable and trackable digital dollar. The creation of the CBDC is a little bit worrisome for about two reasons, really two reasons. First, it would be disastrous for our banks and our credit unions in favor of power concentrated with the Fed. That is why this legislation is supported by the Georgia Bankers Association, the Community Bankers Association and the Georgia Credit Union Association. In addition, the creation of a CBDC raises some privacy concerns. It would essentially allow the government to know every single thing you spend your money on and exactly where you are when you spend it. No one I first started working on this bill many months ago. I found an information of the words of the former Supreme Court Justice, Lewis Brandeis, who was a champion for privacy. Justice Brandeis said, the right to privacy is a person's right to be left alone by the government, the right most valued by civilized men. House Bill 1053 discourages the creation and implementation of a CBDC. First, it prevents any government agency in the state from accepting a central bank digital currency as a form of payment. Second, it ensures that the state of Georgia will not participate in any pilot program of such a currency. It's a simple bill, strangely enough, but it's an important bill. If you picture it, imagine finding my friends on your iPhone. You might let find my friends, you might give it to your wife or your children because you want to keep up and know everyone's safe in the family, but you probably don't give it

neighbors, right? Privacy is kind of a fundamental right. But mainly, I'm a banker, as y'all know, I came through the ranks 35 year banker and I looked at what this would do to the banking industry and the credit unions and I talked to a lot of stakeholders and the impact it would have on the banking industry was just devastating actually. So I just appreciate your consideration on this bill. I would be happy to take any questions. And gentlemen, do you use for a question representing Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized for a question? Yes, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it, gentlemen, you? I yield. Does this bill prevent state agencies from accepting other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, any of those other types of cryptocurrency? No, this bill is tailored very narrowly specifically for the central bank digital currency. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes. Can you help me understand why we would prohibit this specific cryptocurrency if the concern is about privacy and other things? Why don't we have those same concerns about other cryptocurrency? Why are we narrowly tailoring this to just this? A lot of people think, well, we currently have, we're digital now anyway, right? We use debit cards and credit cards and those things. But there's a difference with those things are, those are things that are private that I choose. I choose to use those. I'm not forced to use them. And I think that's a very important distinction. Right now, I'm faced with the truth is, if I use those methods of payment, for example, there's something between me and government. There's the Fourth Amendment. There's my right to choose if government wants to see what I'm spending my money on. They have a process they go through. They go through the courts. They get a subpoena. And then they're able to pursue those things. With the CBDC, there's no intermediary. It's very direct. And I just don't think anybody, I don't want to go explain to my constituents. I don't think you probably do either. That G was everything you do is now on full display and is available to government. You know, it was interesting. I listened to a distinguished colleague a little while ago and he was concerned about another bill. He was all concerned that there's the ability of government to see personal transactions. And I thought it was interesting because that's exactly what this bill talks about. So it's really just a means to put a keep a little distance. You know, your life, we're all living in a fish bowl these days. So really, the trick is to let's have a little privacy again. I know my constituents are very concerned. But I get calls all the time about this. Gentlemen has a couple more questions he'll take them. I will take them. Yes, sir. I will take them. You want to take a couple more questions? I yield the well, sir. No, sir. I yield the well. They're restless. I agree. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Here, here's none. The previous question is ordered. We do have a minority report. It's waived. Is there any objection to agreeing to report? The committee was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk. We'll unlock the machine. I have all members voted. All members voted if so. The clerk will lock the machine. Film the passage of House Bill 1053. The yeas are 136. The nays are 32. The bill will have received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there four pass? Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to House Bill 1146 1146? House Bill 1146, by the way, I'm Stephen. Stephen's 164th and others to be entitled to amend Part 2 of Article 3, Chapter 5 and Title 12. The fiscal day of Georgia and the state are relating to ground. Water use generally so is required. The environmental protection division of the Department of Natural Resources to issue water permits to private companies and areas where no public service can be provided. This bill led me for the committee on natural resources and environment that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from down on the coast represents Part of Brian County. Chairman Ron Stevens is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Miss Speaker. Ladies, gentlemen of the House, I bring you today House Bill 1146. This week we've heard from Mr. Munoz, who say came down and told us all the great things on the largest economic development project in the state's history. 12 times larger than anything that we've ever landed. The jobs are phenomenal. Nobody dreamed those 3,000 acres were going to be cleared like that, but they were. They're ready to start producing cars. We crossed every tea and dotted every eye from the Department to make sure that these folks could do the job. We made sure we were even pumping water because we've got a restriction, as you know, Donald Coastal Georgia to pump water into this plant to make sure that they could operate. All of this stuff was worked out except one little thing. Workforce housing. Just a little piece of workforce housing, well we've already had our first casualty before they open. Why don't you put up the first slide. Yesterday, as I dropped the paper, yesterday, this was in the Savannah Morning News. For months now, there's been planning going on to try to get workforce housing in the area where this plant is going to be built. They're depending on that, ladies and gentlemen, workforce housing. Over 500 homes were planned there. The problem is the county doesn't have one drop of a withdrawal permit. What this bill will do is it says that if you cannot supply water after 18 months, then a private system can go in and supply the water. That's all this bill does. Put up the second slide. In our committee, we have folks that were asking questions, well, we've got a private water system. We're not sure they can even supply. As you'll notice, the red spots up here, there's 5,000 homes that are already supplied by this water system. Over 17 counties use this private water system for workforce housing. So what do you do with the wastewater? You see the yellow spot up there? That's 500,000 gallons a day of wastewater treatment on a private system waiting to take this waste water from these homes. Ladies and gentlemen, this company Fetzer backed out yesterday. They couldn't get the water from the county. They even tried to annex in the city to supply water from the county. With all the roadblocks, he's spent over $400,000 to try to get water for this workforce housing. We've got to have workforce housing, ladies and gentlemen. And I know that there's a minority report for those folks that need to come up and speak. But understand, this project is a must do. We have to have workforce housing. I'll ask for your favorable consideration, and I'll accept questions if there are. You have a couple of questions. Representative Owl Williams to your left house equation. Representative Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, gentlemen, Yale. Yes, sir. Isn't that true that I had a lot of reservations about this bill initially, but it's chairman of the development authority in Liberty County. We have 19 projects in Midway that are unable to move because we don't have the water. There's only one county near us that has the permit to pump any water, which we would have to buy water and re-sow it here. Is it not so that in spite of some shortcomings, this bill is vitally necessary to continue economic growth and the worker housing that we must have in order to accommodate Hyundai in Southeast Georgia? I appreciate the question. The gentleman's absolutely right. It is the missing piece that we have to have, and ladies and gentlemen, as the gentleman brought up, this system's in 17 counties already. The missing piece for this massive development we've got on the coast is workforce housing, pleading with you to allow this to happen if they cannot supply after 18 months. Gentlemen, you yield. Yes, sir. Representative, Vince Smith to your right. That's a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Gentlemen, Yale. Yes, sir. In a true representative that I served on that committee and I heard a lot of testimony, but number one, you extended the date from 12 months to 18 months. So that gives time for planning and we come back through another session if something else needs to be done. And number two, in a true, that this no-way circumvent's EPD, they're going to still be involved. Whatever planning goes on in that area down there, so I commend you for the bill. Thank you, sir. The gentleman's correct. Thank you for the question. Minority Leader has a question right in front of you, Mr. Chairman, if you all accept. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Are there any price controls that you're going to place in this space? Because once you have a utility that becomes state-sponsored monopoly, potentially, then the price can get out of whack pretty quickly. Are there any price controls within this bill? Was that something we anticipate dealing with over the next several years? You know, I hope not. This is a private system. Again, over 17 counties already, they do a phenomenal job of selling water below the rate. Quite honestly, being very competitive, and I appreciate that question. Gentlemen, further yield? Yes, sir. I'll read you for another one. Representative Lin Smith, the chairman. Chairman Lin Smith, that's a question. Ladies, recognize. Thank you, gentlemen, yield. Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that one of our forefathers, Ben Franklin, made the statement, we know the worth of water when the well runs dry. There isn't a thing you can do if you don't have any water. Is it further not true that this huge construction, this huge building will remain unoccupied? Is it not true if we do not give these workers a place to live? The lady is correct. We're already seeing with the 5,000 workers that are there, the massive traffic jams for people coming. Counties away to try to come in here. We need to get these workers close to the factory, and I appreciate the lady's question. Mr. Speaker, I ask your favorable consideration. I think there might be other speakers. I'll yield the well. You had some further questions, but we do get them as yielded the well. The wisdom of the rules committee, we do have a limit on the time here for discussion. We have some folks signed up that are opposed to the bill. They will have a total of 30 minutes to speak to the bill to be apportioned among themselves. And the representative Debbie Buckner is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Robert Frost said that the afternoon knows what the morning never suspected. And I think that's kind of what happened here. I appreciate the importance of fully evaluating the need for water and where it's going to come from for these projects. And I understand the need for exploring alternatives and different thoughts and different plans of action. But I think we find ourselves at a juncture between success of a huge development and economic opportunity and growth and a severe lack of adequate planning for an essential thing all of us have to have and that's water and water supply. I understand that there's a concern that the communities, when you look at a private water system versus a public one, they lose control of the pricing. They are concerned and have worries about the quantity, the quality and the prices of it. And they lose all that with a private entity and they have concern of not having that oversight. What I do not understand is where was water in the pre-planning? Where was it? Where were... Everybody knew that if there was a house it was going to have to have water and everybody knew if there was going to be that huge plant they would have to be water. This is a location of our state where water has been talked about a great deal. There has been massive water planning to keep salt water intrusion from coming inland. And for years communities along the coast there have worked very hard to keep the salt water intrusion back to keep the volumes up to cover the needs of the community. The plans for those water plans involved multiple counties and due to the complex nature of the water needs and the restraints and the limitations that were required they've worked hard on their water plans and they've stuck to them. And I just can't understand how we can overlook all that work, how we can say that not planning for this is okay. And I understand this bill will likely pass and I understand it needs to pass. I know people have got to have housing around the big plant there that we're all seeing and proud of. I know we want Georgia to be the number one place to do business but I want this to be a one time fix because I want us to learn from this and in the future so that people can come to Georgia and know that they're going to have the basic needs of water that is clean and available that we will be more diligent in our pre-planning from any development but especially a major development such as this one. Water is scarce, it's precious, it's a limited resource and it must be our highest priority when we are planning. With that Mr. Speaker I yield the well. And he yielded the well. Representing Drenner has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I also understand the need for the bill and appreciate the fact that it's a trigger bill and that this area needs housing. I share the concerns of the previous speaker that how did we get to this point and the process without having the local governments plan for water. But I also want to raise another point here today and my other committee meetings, this 10-year cycle that I think we're in today, it feels like 10 years, right? Representative Houston. Feels like we've been here 10 years. This bill raises an additional issue for me and that is the issue of unregulated private water companies. Now I have received hundreds and hundreds of emails relating to House Bill 1220, unregulated private utility companies. And you know what, this bill sets up the exact same scenario in which we are trying to address in House Bill 1220. So my recommendation is before we pass to this bill, we need to pass House Bill 1220 to move on. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well and ask all of you to vote no because Georgia is one of five states that does not regulate water. Thank you. Ladies, you are the well. Representative Davis has recognized the speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to add to my colleagues. My question is very simple. If you look at this bill, it talks about code section 12-5-108. If you look up that code section and look at section 11, you will see that a local county government and municipality cannot finance a private entity. Now they did say that the private company is going to finance this water, but think about it. Here, when we are financing the infrastructure in water, here locally, we are talking about in the billions of dollars, who is really going to finance this development and how much is it going to cost? What happens if that private company cannot complete the job? Does that mean that the state steps in and provides any funding? What we are asking is can someone really tell us how much is this going to cost and then then in who is going to truly finance this, especially if there is any type of risk or problems? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the bill. Ladies yielding the bill. Representative Lisa Campbell has recognized the bill. Thank you, Speaker. Good evening, colleagues. Tonight, I rise to oppose HB 1146 because our plans for communities for Georgia's working families should not be an afterthought. And long-term plans for sustainable water infrastructure shouldn't be easily overlooked without long-term oversight for things like water safety, our environment, and the well-being of our families and communities in Georgia. Our decision on this bill and this community is specific to this one business potentially. But in my view, it may set a dangerous precedent for all future developments throughout the state and especially in rural Georgia, where we have so many communities like this that will have the exact same infrastructure needs. And we welcome businesses to our state and we do, especially to rural Georgia, I think and I would imagine most of us think that it's reasonable to expect that these businesses, especially those with global resources and deep expertise, that they should come here with strategic plans to work hand in hand with our local communities for basic, basic infrastructure development. And when they receive billions in tax incentives, credits, and abatements, we should be able to rely on them to be equally valuable community partners. They should come to us with prudent, straightforward, and strategic plans as they develop not only in their own business interest, but for the long-term viability of these communities. Yes, they're in a hurry to get set up and yes, we all want that. But we also hope, don't we, that these communities will be here for decades and generations and that they will have the infrastructure that they need for safe water. At first glance, this provokes privatization of water and our water supply as a potential solution may sound appealing. But another point we want to talk about might be that the performance of private vendors over water, air in Metro Atlanta, we have experience here and it's definitely not been perfect. And we've all heard and probably received these high water bills if you're from Metro Atlanta and had issues, unfortunately, with lack of insight sometimes in private companies responsible. And we can look to places like DeCab County, Fulton County, I've had these personal experiences and places like Flint, Michigan. So one of the primary issues that we should all have in common are essentials like water and sewer, not be controlled by exclusively profit-making corporations without best practices for collaboration. A few other issues to consider. HP 1146 could set up circumstances for developers and private water providers to overthrow responsible planning efforts that are limited by a shared public resource. Worse, this bill could allow the limited public resource to be privatized and in doing so bypass public utilities mandated to ensure equitable and responsible distribution. If enacted access to our limited as was previously stated, shared drinking water supply could be granted to the highest bidder. And I don't think that's what anyone in this chamber wants. Another point it's my understanding that this bill addresses access to water but not sewer. And this is very likely that providing water outside of local government growth, priority areas will result in a proliferation of septic tanks to accommodate this growth. This is very important because again, as we know here in high density areas, this is not a responsible or sustainable method for dealing with wastewater, especially in residential developments. Another point to consider is that as we rely on private water providers, what happens if they go out of business, the system fails, who becomes the responsible party in those scenarios? It's us, the taxpayers, and not just the taxpayers in this community. If they circumvent the local community and go directly to the state, we will all be responsible. Pushing privatization and rushing weekends are control oversight and accountability, and really water, as was already shared, is one of the final frontiers and one of the essential core components for human life. This bill offers no reassurances that the future need for water for all residents has been addressed, but it does raise serious concerns about the long-term impact, a planning for economic growth without considering how we'll provide for water. And I just want to point out earlier tonight, there was a bill where we established regional rural districts to come together to plan for things just like this. And that's why I think this bill we should pause, and she would think about it in that same way to make sure that we're doing the right thing for the long term, for the water, for all of us in the state of Georgia. I urge you to vote no on this bill. Thank you, and I yield the will. The lady has yielded the will. That completes those are posed, speaking to oppose the bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. We do have a minority report. That's being waved. We do have chairs time for up to, up to 20 minutes, Madam Chair. But I'm sure you can shed some light on several of these issues. So the Chair of the Natural Resource Environment Committee, representing Lynn Smith, is recognized to speak to the bill, representing Smith. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This is a serious problem. We can't pretend it's not. But when you're a parent, when you are a business owner, when you're a decision maker, you don't look at what happened, you look at how do we solve it. So this is before says the body. We have had successful public-private partnerships when we built our roads. Hello, Payton, whatever. For right now, we've been dealt a hand that says the option, the only direction we can take is if this county will relinquish its letter of concurrence. That's it. That's what this bill is about. Yeah, I wish it had been better planning. But you can't deny the fact that you need the people to have the homes to do the work. That's before us. My dad used to say, honey, what's the reality check? The reality check is there's no choice. So this is before us. The letter of concurrence lets this go forward. The relinquishing of that for a short period of time. I think all of us should watch this process as it goes forward and pay attention to it. But when I used to fold my arms as I don't like what just happened, hello, it's happened. How do you deal with it? So my point to our body is, I think we've got to do it. We do have an obligation to watch this. But I also think we have a primary obligation to fulfill the commitment for the state of Georgia to this huge employment opportunity we have for our community. So let's just join together and keep an eye going forward.

If this letter of concurrence is deterrent, deal with that, move forward, and we all better keep it on what's going on. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're the well. The lady has yielded the well that completes all of our discussion on House Bill 1146. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair, here's none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair, here's none. The Report of the Committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. All members voted if so. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1146. The yeas are 105, the nays are 58. The bill will hand receive the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to our last bill of the evening? The last bill of the evening? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 780780? House Resolution 780 by a representative, Petrie, the 166th and others, a resolution, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Georgia so as to clarify that only citizens of the United States shall have the right to vote in elections in this state. This resolution I have been referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes representative Petrie to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to be last and I'm glad to end on a good note. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you today a bill, a resolution, that is something that everybody we represent agrees on, apparently. So in any poll you look at, over 80% of Georgians, and we have recent polling on that, of every race, every political party, Democrat Republican, conservative liberal, everybody, supermajorities of almost everyone agrees that only citizens should vote in the United States. Let me tell you what this measure deals with, an issue that has taken place around the country where I'll just begin by telling you what we have. We have language in our Constitution that says every person who is a citizen of the United States and resident of Georgia as defined by law, dot, dot, dot, shall be entitled to vote. In that language, because it is not prohibitive, has allowed states with that language to allow non-citizens to vote in local elections. Not, I want to be very clear, not in state and not in national elections which are dealt with in our U.S. Constitution, but in local elections. So where is that happening? This is a trend today. So in multiple states, Boston, some of the largest cities in our country, by the way, you all may not know this, are allowing non-citizens voting. Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Oakland, multiple towns in Maryland and Vermont. So the language, because it's not prohibitive, was the challenge. So 11 states have now amended the Constitution because of this issue where they have similar language that is not prohibitive, and they've changed their Constitution to make it so. And if you look at that language and it's hard to understand, just think of it this way, every, the word every, and our current Constitution is a floor. It is not a ceiling. And this measure does very simply. It changes the language as you'll see here to only individuals who are citizens of the United States, and residents of Georgia's defined by law, who at least 18 years of age, dot, dot, shall be entitled to vote. So my friends, this is simple. We're trying to, we have statute, everybody I want you to know this. Georgia's statute, very clearly in better language, shells you shall not vote unless you're a citizen. The statute is fine. But obviously, the integrity of the vote, that obviously we know legislative intent of this Constitution was it only citizens vote. We all know that to be true. We all know how important the vote is, how sacred it is to all of us that only citizens vote. And so the right thing to do is to make sure we're clear and not ambiguous in our Constitution that only citizens should vote. So my friends, that's clearly what we're voting on today as a measure to have a constitutional amendment. It simply states, only citizens of the United States shall vote in all Georgia elections. Mr. Speaker, it's a late night. This one's pretty simple and super majorities of everybody in this state supporting this measure. I don't believe I need to stand here and waste any more time, Mr. Speaker. If you're good with that, I'm going to yield the well. I can agree with you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Jim, as you did the well, we have some speakers that are opposed to the bill. Now, recognize Sam Park to speak to the bill. We'll park. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know it's late. I want to encourage you all to vote no to House Resolution 780 because of Georgia Constitution already prohibits non-citizens from voting in the state. I encourage you all to read the state Constitution. It is very, very clear. This is unnecessary. This is unneeded. If you believe in the Georgia Constitution, if you support it, vote no to HB-HR-780. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Are you in the well? Thank you, Witt Park. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. We'll now have the chair's time. Chairman Stan Gunther is recognized to speak to the bill. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am going to wave my time to the leader of the House. Majority leaders recognize to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I think the committee chairman, as the sponsor chairman, Petrie just covered, this is really a simple measure. What we're doing is making clear reflecting what we've seen in poll after poll is that Georgians are really unified. There's overwhelming support for only citizens voting in our elections. And the vote that's before you here today is to pass that show support here within this chamber. And then that will be a ballot measure before Georgians to weigh in on that issue going forward. And there's nothing wrong whatsoever with putting this question to Georgia voters. Certainly, I would submit to you that this is an important policy moment for us. It's the chance to make clear that citizen should vote and that that is an important concept to enshrine not only in law, but in our constitution of our state. So it's with that. I know the hour is very late. We've done a lot of work throughout the day. But this is a very clear decision. It's, are we going to reflect the will of Georgians that only citizens should vote in our elections? And are we going to give Georgians an opportunity to vote on that on the November ballot? Not encourage your favorable consideration of this resolution and ask you to vote yes. I yield the will. That completes our discussion on the bill. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? Chair, here's another report of the committee. It has agreed to shall this resolution now be adopted. All in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does representative Carpenter rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Is it not true that me and Chairman Petrie don't always see eye to eye on immigration issues, but I appreciate this legislation to protect the sanctity of the ballot box and make sure that U.S. citizens are the only ones voting in it. I'm sure the gentleman speaks the truth on both of those issues. For what purpose does representative Roberts rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Isn't it true that the Georgia Constitution, Article 1, Section 2, paragraph 2 states expressly every person who is a citizen of the United States and a resident of Georgia is defined by law who is at least 18 years of age. You get the drift. Isn't it further true that this is more performative politics at 11, 10 at night wasting Georgia's taxpayer dollars in time when we should be passing bills to help Georgians? I think the lady is exactly on target with that. I've heard several of those statements tonight, including that one. What purpose is representative Williams? Representative Williams rise. Representative Al Williams. They may speak. Is it not true that while I respect the will of the people of Georgia, if what we're saying is true, why haven't we given the people of Georgia the right to vote on casino gambling? Well, the gentleman has lots of opinions about lots of things. And I respect most of them anyway. For what purpose does chair lady Houston rise? Isn't it not true that every once in a while we need to have a vote to show people that we are Americans? And that's what this vote is about. I'm sure the lady believes that. And states it succinctly. Last one for what purpose does Wipbert Chet rise? Well, let me drink. State's inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that decision we're making here with your vote on the board tonight is that whether or not you would like to allow someone that is not a citizen of the state of Georgia to vote in our elections? I'm sure the gentleman believes exactly what he says. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of house resolution 780. The adoption has failed. The proposition failed to reach 120 vote. The yeas are 98. The nays are 61. The resolution having failed to receive the requisite constitutional majority is therefore failed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Honoring a life and memory of Melda Woodle Blackmore. Congratulations, commending Faye Clark Purdue for receiving the 2022 Yellow Rose NICETE Randall Service Leader Award, recognizing commending John Terry for service at Talbot County. Congratulations, commending Jan Dunnaway for receiving the 2024 Yellow Rose NICETE Randall Service Leader Award and congratulating commending EMC Engineering Services Incorporated. For other purposes, that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions. Is there any objection to adopting the privileged resolutions? Chair here is done and the resolutions are adopted. We have two afternoon orders. I'm going to ask both members to have a one minute afternoon order, one minute for these two afternoon orders. Represented trend is recognized for a very important afternoon order representative trend. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A year ago, I stood up here to wish my mom a happy birthday and I'm doing that again. But last year, if you remember, I talked about my mom being diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. So a little good news and a little bad news. The good news is she's winning the fight against cancer. It's gone from one lung and so she's hanging in strong but it has been a rough year. I also want to take this time real quickly to thank my colleagues who reached out to me this summer when my dad passed away. It was a tough time for my mom as she's fighting cancer. But she's getting healthy and she took off for Vietnam a few days ago. So happy birthday, mom. And yes, I'm going to go get some sleep. Happy birthday, mom. A beautiful lady. Take care of your mother. You only have one. Represented bail is recognized for an afternoon order. Y'all give the representative bail some room. If you can do it in one minute, sir, that'd be a appreciate. I might can do it in less than this, sir. Thank you, Speaker, for the acknowledgement. Your back history month today, your back history factor today is if you didn't know that Grady Hospital was the first hospital to desegregate the lead to the desegregation of all hospitals in America. And that was done by, I'm honored to say that by my grandfather, Dr. Roy Charles, Bill and my grandmother, Dr. Clarice Bale Church. As you can see in the picture, the two at the head of the table in 1962, my grandparents filed to desegregate Grady in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in 1964 to desegregate Grady Hospital, which led to the desegregation of all hospitals. So thanks, Grandpa. And anyone that was born in a desegregated hospital, you can thank him as well. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Bale. That completes our afternoon orders. We have one announcement that you need to hear. Rip Chairman Knight has an announcement for us. Just so you can repair for next week when we come back for those who are far out of town, we're going to have our annual legislative sportsman's caucus event, which is a range day. So again, if you want to participate next week and you've got your own firearm that want to bring it back for the range day, we appreciate it. That is going to be on Thursday, March the second. I mean, it's a seventh. Thursday, March the seventh, and we'll be back at Stoddard's like we've done in the last couple of years. Thank you, and I hope you'll join us. That completes our work for the day. I think to send it, close out their work for it got dark. So I'll just tell you members, this house is about doing the people's business. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate and honored to be a part of this house and this house family. Thank you for working for the people of this state during these first 28 days of this session. And especially your work today as we all work together and pass some very important, very significant legislation that will benefit every Georgian. Thank you members of the house. I want to give you a round of applause. Give yourself a round of applause. The majority leader of this house has recognized for a motion. Thank you, Miss Speaker.
