If we can pledge, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. And the Georgia flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the public for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Mr. President, and members of the Senate. It's an honor today to introduce my pastor, Purpose Church, which is a little church behind the fire station off the Habersham Mills Road in Habersham County. This is Pastor Ryan Ginn, and he serves as the senior pastor of Purpose Church, where he is passionate about helping people grow in their faith, discover their God-given purpose, and serve their communities. His ministry is centered on sharing biblical truth, strengthening families, and reaching the next generation with hope and encouragement. Under Pastor Ryan's leadership, Purpose Church actively serves Northeast Georgia throughout reach events, youth initiatives, family programs, and partnerships with local schools and organization. He believes the church is called to be a light in the community by meeting both spiritual and practical needs while demonstrating the love of Christ through service and unity. Pastor Ryan serves alongside his wife Kayla, who's here today in ministry and leadership, together they are devoted to investing in families and encouraging people to live lives marked by faith, generosity, prayer, and service to others. He also serves on the Habersham County Boys and Girls Club Board, where he helps support programs that provide mentorships, leadership development, and positive opportunities for local youth. Pastor Ryan considers it a sacred honor to pray and encourage leaders who serve the citizens of Georgia and is committed to promoting unity, wisdom, and godly leadership within the communities he serves. On a personal note, Pastor Ryan came to Habersham County two years ago. He has poured, him and his family have poured so much in our church, and church membership has grown ten times since he walked through the door. So it's a treat to hear from him, and I'm honored to introduce Pastor Ryan again. And what an honor it is to be here today. I am very, very grateful for this opportunity, and I just want to tell each of you that it's an honor and a privilege to be able to share a moment of courage with every single one of you here today, because I know this is a humbling experience to stand before men and women that are entrusted with leadership that shapes families, communities, and the future of this great state of Georgia. I also want to take a moment and just tell you that I've been married down for 20 years, my beautiful bride and my family are here today, and man, I'm honored the kids were looking forward to skipping school, and being a part of this today, so I'm joined here by my beautiful bride, Kayla, my son, Eli, and my daughter, Ellie, and I'm so thankful for them being here today. And of course, with this opportunity, Senator Bo Hatchett is a privilege that he would ask me to do this, but on top of that, I can tell you this from personal experience just getting to know Senator Bo over the last year or so is that he leads with integrity and trust, and I'm thankful for your leadership. Thank you very much. You know, I stand here today not only as a pastor, but as someone who believes in true wisdom, who believes in strength, and also believes in guidance, ultimately, that comes from God. Scripture actually speaks on this in Proverbs 11 verse 14 that says, without wise counsel, a nation falls, but in abundance of counselors there is safety. In other words, God's Word teaches us that leadership was never meant to be carried alone. It wasn't meant to be done by yourself. Leadership flourishes when it's grounded in wisdom, when it's surrounded by Godly counsel, and it's guided with and by humility. You know, the decisions made in this chamber carry a tremendous influence. They impact real people. They impact real families and real communities. And leadership is not simply about authority or a position, but rather leadership is a stewardship given by God. A responsibility to serve the people. A responsibility to pursue what is right and to protect the future of those who are called to lead. You know, one of the greatest things about Scripture that I love is that Jesus Christ himself even came to earth to serve and not be served. And I'm so thankful for the opportunity to be here today to speak to men and women like yourself that are honored to serve this great state of Georgia. You know, another powerful truth is found in Scripture in Micah chapter 6 verse 8 and it says this, he has shown you what is good and what does the Lord require of you? He requires you to act justly. He requires you to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. You know, these are not just leadership suggestions necessarily, but there are spiritual principles that have shaped strong and faithful leadership throughout history. What does it mean to act justly? Well, I can tell you it means seeking what is right according to God's word, to God's standard of truth, a justice that brings truth and protects communities. What does it mean to love mercy? Well, it means it means to remind us that leadership is not only about laws and policies, but it's also about people creating the and created in the image of God. And behind every decision in life, or should I say in every decision, there is a life that matters to him. Mercy allows us to lead with strength while also leading with compassion to walk humbly with God reminds us that no leader carries ultimate wisdom on their own. As a matter of fact, as a child, I've been praying this all my life and I know many of you in this room, you do this because of the weight that you carry. I pray for wisdom daily. I pray that God gives me wisdom to carry that out and to do the right thing. You know, leadership often carries a weight very few, very few people see public service. It requires sacrifice long hours, difficult decisions and even conversations and in those moments, human strength that can't be done alone. And that's what we lean on a scripture that you probably heard, majority of your life. In any church service or any Bible that you've read is Isaiah chapter 40 verse 31 that those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on wings like Eagles. They will run and not grow weary and they will walk and not faint. That promise reminds us that as leaders, we seek God. And if we do, he provides clarity. He provides strength. The senator is also provides endurance. My encouragement today is simply this lead with integrity because God sees both public decisions, but he also sees our private character serve people faithfully because leadership is a calling to care for other people. Seek God's wisdom before making decisions that affect the lives of so many and remember that leadership has the power to reflect God's word, but also God's justice, compassion and truth to the people you serve. Your service matters. Your leadership matters. And the influence you carry gives the opportunity to impact the lives of so many that reach for beyond this chamber. Thank you for all that you do. I sincerely mean that. Thank you for what you do for this state. We absolutely are a part of one of the greatest states in this nation and I'm so thankful. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day and for this opportunity together in this place of leadership and responsibility. And we thank you for every individual here and for the calling you have placed on their lives to serve the people of Georgia. Lord, we're we asked that you grant them wisdom as they make decisions that affect their cities, their towns and families across this state and give them clarity and moments of complexity unity and times of disagreement and also peace when the weight of responsibility feels heavy. Strengthen them with leadership that feels at times demanding but also encourage them when the progress feels slow, surround them with wise counsel, sound judgment and hearts to committed to be committed to what is right. And Lord, God this legislative body to make the decisions that promote justice, compassion and the well-being of all the people throughout this state of Georgia. We thank you for your presence, your guidance and your grace is in your precious name we pray. Amen. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You All right. We have our doctor of the day and as always we appreciate our doctors coming here and donating their time and efforts to come to the Capitol. And provide their services for us if needed. So with that I will call on the senator from the 7th to introduce our doctor of the day. Thank you. I have the pleasure of introducing the doctor of the day for my district. Dr. Indran B. Indra Krishnan is a nationally recognized gastronologist at Gwyneth Digestive Clinic PC in Lawrenceville, Georgia. His passion for cancer awareness earned him unanimous support in a Georgia Senate resolution for his exemplary service to the community including increasing the public awareness of color rectal cancer screenings. Very important. Dr. Indra Krishnan has performed thousands of colonoscopies and indoscopies in his effort to help patients improve their gastrointestinal health. He gained his extensive gastronology training at various prestigious medical institutions such as King's College, Affiliated Hospitals in England, St. Louis University Hospital, and St. Louis and Queens University Group of Hospitals in Canada. Along the way he had the good fortune to study under gastronology standouts such as Dr. Roger Williams and Ivan Beck. During his training he became a fellow of the American College of Gastronology, the American College of Physicians in the Royal College of Physicians in Surgeons of Canada. Dr. Indra Krishnan is also a graduate of the Georgia Physicians Leadership Academy in a program that identifies and trains physicians leaders in Georgia. He put his training in good use and received a gubernatorial appointment by Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to the Georgia Board of Physician Workforce and he's a peer reviewer for the Georgia Composite State Board of Medical Examiner's. Dr. Indra Krishnan lives in Duluth, Georgia with his wife Gaia III, a certified public accountant in his daughter, Harini, an undergraduate at Emory University. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, all of you. So today I want to say a few words about the word C, the cancer. Last week I requested our Governor, Brian Kim, to declare a proclamation, a Georgia cancer day and a very kindly applied. The first time in the history of Georgia a cancer day been proclaimed covering all the cancers. So for that proclamation event I brought a lady by name of Miss Kathy Lemme who lost her son at the age of 30. He was my patient for the diagnosis of late. He went through the treatment in one of the renowned cancer institutes in the world, Winship Cancer Institute, which is not far away from the state capital. But we lost him a few days after he celebrated his 30th birthday. Yes, I meant 30th birthday. Cancer does not discriminate. It can affect any age, old, young, any ethnicity, whether you're from rural area or urban, rich or famous, it doesn't matter. We all are the risk of cancer. There are certain cancers which we call, physicians call, a death sentence. We are detecting early, it's not going to help. The lifespan is not going to be changed. But on the other hand there are few common cancers which if detected early we can change their life.

life for better and in fact even clear there. I want to say a few words about those cancers. Number one is breast cancer being a mammogram on a regular basis would help detecting the breast cancer early. Then colon cancer which is in my department, coronoscopy saves lives and the people who don't like coronoscopy, there is a relatively new test called cologot, which way they do the screening, a cologot doing this stool test for DNA, the cancers. And then of course prostate cancer and prostate cancer for doing the blood test for prostate cancer and a physical examination and also cervical cancer, perhaps me. A good lifestyle changes also can deter cancer risk like healthy food habits, physical activities, reducing the alcohol intake to minimum can definitely get the cancer first down. So with this I wish you all the best and healthy life in the future this year, this year being a election year you might have been got a little bit more stressed out, stressed too can increase the cancer risk. So take it easy and wish you all the best and we will see you next year. Thank you. God bless you. We have some very special guests here today, we have got our friends from the state of Georgia Farm Bureau is here today and they are well represented, how in the hallways we have their leadership team behind us and we have a special presentation for them here today. Secretary, read the caption. Set a resolution 630 by Sen. Goodman of the 8th and others. A resolution recognizing February 10th, 2026 as Georgia Farm Bureau Federation Day at the Capitol and for other purposes whereas from its humble beginnings in northwest Georgia the Georgia Farm Bureau Federation has grown to 158 county chapters with the current membership of 235,000 led by volunteer farmers. Now therefore be a result of with the Senate that the members of this body recognize February 10th, 2026 as Georgia Farm Bureau Federation Day at the state Capitol. Mr. President, I go please see you order. Is there a objection to the adoption of resolution? Chair here is done and the resolution is adopted. I would like to call upon the good senator from Coxdale, Georgia from the 8th district of this great state of Georgia, the Ag Chairman himself, Mr. Russ Goodman. Come on up here. Well thank you Mr. President. It's an honor to be here today with my friends from Farm Bureau. Of course Farm Bureau, what 230 something thousand families across this state are members of Farm Bureau which if you look at that it's probably close to a million people, one in ten Georgia's probably close to that number and so I appreciate all the work that they do on behalf of our state's number one industry. I'm actually on the board of our local Farm Bureau. I made a mistake one time, Mr. Tom and Mr. Meeting and when I came back they had made me present at the local, the county Farm Bureau so you learned that lesson pretty quick but anyway thank you for everything we do. I also have my very good friend and constituent Daniel Johnson back here who was sorry that you don't have a better senator Daniel but we also have Mr. Ralph Calwell here and so thank you all for being here. Thank you for everything you do to advocate on behalf of our state's farm families and I'm going to turn it over to a dear friend to all of us, a dear friend to all the farmers in this state. Of course his lovely wife is a better half Miss Jane is here. They've been married for 44 years and they actually made it a Farm Bureau meeting but Mr. Tom is a great American and if y'all will give him a warm welcome. Thank you Miss Chairman. Thank y'all real quick. I'm not going to stand up here all day but we want to tell y'all thank you for what you do for agriculture. Always keep in mind the profitability of farms in this state. High input prices and low commodity prices has got your farmers and a pretty rough state right now. Keeping in mind that agriculture is the largest contributor to the economics of Georgia. What we contribute gives y'all all the money y'all get to spend. Why are you sitting in this chamber and sitting back home. Thank you for what you do. We just want y'all to know how important ag is. At lunch at 12 o'clock we have about 600 people from all over the state of Georgia. There's one from each and every one of y'all's districts. Some of them are up in the gallery right now. They vote. This is an important election year and y'all all know it. This chamber may not even look the same after November. I spent 26 years in that chamber on the other side of the capital and I understand how important elections are. Good luck to all y'all that are running and we appreciate what you do for agriculture. Come eat dinner with your people that actually go in a voting booth and click the button for each and every one of y'all. Thank you very much. We have some more guests here that we would like to recognize Secretary Reed the caption. Senate Resolution 660 by Senator Jackson, the 41st and others. A resolution recognizing February 10th, 2026 as Interfaith Children's Movement Day at the capital and for other purposes. Whereas rooted in faith values and guided by principles of equity, justice and human dignity, ICM works to ensure that all children in Georgia regardless of income, race, geography or background have access to opportunities to ability and well-being. Whereas ICM engages in legislative advocacy, policy analysis, coalition building and civic engagement to address structural bears impacting children and families. Now therefore be resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize February 10th, 2026 as Interfaith Children's Movement Day at the capital. Mr. President, that completes your order. Is there objection to adoption of the resolution? Chair here is done and the resolution is adopted. Recognize the Senator from the 22nd, the minority leader. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today on behalf of Senator Kim Jackson, recognizing February 11th, 2025 as the 14th annual day at the state capital for the Interfaith Children's Movement. Since 2001, the Interfaith Children's Movement has brought together people of faith from across our state. Since 2001, the Interfaith Children's Movement has brought together people of faith from across our state to advance policies to improve child well-being, promote justice and expand opportunity for Georgia's children. Their work has helped move real protections for it, from access to health care, meaningful juvenile justice reforms and a strength and collaboration between community leaders, advocates and policymakers. Quite frankly, colleagues, this is the type of organization that represents the kind of study. Service-driven leadership are children and families need. And today to actually say a few words is the executive director of the Interfaith Children's Movement, with Reverend Cassandra Henderson. And she has obviously brought students here with her today. And I believe that over 200 students with us and some are in the gallery. Could we please give a warm welcome to our students in the gallery and please stand of the Interfaith Children's Movement? Thank you. Reverend Henderson. All right, Reverend. Good morning, friends. Mr. President, Minority Leader Jones, members of the Sisteme D'Body, we are so grateful for the recognition of our movement and the work of our movement that has grounded and rooted in a simple truth. That how we treat children tells the story of who we are and who we are becoming. For 25 years, our movement has been telling a great story about children in our state. But this story gets deeper and grows very strong if we work together. Georgia has become known as a great place to do business. And we believe that Georgia can also become known as being a great place to raise a family. But we must work together and order to make that happen. Right now, when people are in need, they come to two institutions first, to the government and to the communities of faith. Now, I understand that we have stipulations that keep our work divided, but that is about proselytizing, not healthy partnership. And if we can work together, rather than dividing across our political lines and our religious lines, if we can find one piece of common ground and have that ground be child well-being, whether you add your pinky toe or your heel or your whole foot. If we can find common ground to stand on, we can make our state the kind of state where all children thrive. We thank you again for this honor, for this recognition. And we invite you to be a part of the great story that we are hoping to tell together. The story that makes Georgia a great place to raise families and to raise children. Thank you again. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. One more side note. I have four friends down here with me and I wanted to just shout them out. Madison Drew is a senior at North Cobb High School. We have Aya Caffed, who is a student at the Muhammad Schools of Atlanta. We have Liam Newman, who is a student. He is a sixth grader. And we have Joshua Vargas, who is an eighth grader from Liberation Academy. We thank them for joining us today. Thank you. You You We have some more special guests here today. Secretary Reed, the caption. Senator Resolution 727 by Senator Anderson, the 43rd and others. A resolution recognizing the ETA Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated and for other purposes. Whereas the ETA Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated and was founded in Atlanta, Georgia on December 1, 1919. And was the first of any black Greek letter organization to be founded and chartered in the state of Georgia. And whereas ETA Omega was comprised of brothers upholding the principles of Omega at Atlanta University, Clark University, Morehouse College, GAM and Theological Seminary and College graduates in the Atlanta area. Now therefore be it resolved by the Senate that the members of this body recognize the ETA Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated. Using the Chapter's long history of public service and extend best wishes for the organization's continued success. Mr. President, I hope you see order. Here's the objection to the adoption of resolution, Chair here's none, and the resolution is adopted. We're going to have Senator from the 43rd to speak to the resolution. Senator? Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning colleagues. Today is Omega Sci-Fi Day at the Georgia State Capitol. Omega Sci-Fi fraternity was founded on November 17, 1911 by three Howard University students Edgar Amos-Love, Oscar James Cooper and Frank Coleman and their faculty advisor Dr. Ernest Everett. Just. It was the first national fraternity to be established at an HBCU. The fraternity's purpose was to attract and build a strong, effective force of handsome men dedicated to his cardinal principles of manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift. Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated was incorporated in Washington, D.C. on October 28, 1914. In 1924, at the urging of fraternity member Carter G. Woodson, the fraternity launched Negro History and Literature Week to publicize the growing body of the scholarship of African-American history. In courage of eye public interest, the event was renamed Negro Achievement Week in 1925 and given an expanded national presence in 1926 by Woodson's Association for the Study of Negro Life and History as Negro History Week. Expanded again to the full month of February from 1976, this event continues today as Black History Month. The fire and fervor within this organization, this culture, this manhood has continued on throughout American history and Black history. From the 80s through the 90s into the new millennial and up to today, Ada Omega Chapterman have continually played active roles in Atlanta's progress. Today I have the leadership of the Ada Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated. Chapter President Dr. Kirk McDonald, Will Reader, Alex D'Amand Jr., and Kenneth Mitchell. The strong leadership of Chapter Bachelors Kirk McDonald, the Ada Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated will continue to fulfill the Cardinal principles of manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift. Please welcome Dr. McDonald to the platform. This evening honored guests. I have the pleasure of being the 49th boss list of Ada Omega Chapter of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated. We've been here since 1919, the first Greek letter organization here in the state of Georgia and in the South. We are honored to serve our community in multiple ways. We've been serving our community through economic empowerment, through community service, through food banks, and the multiple other aspects that we do. Today is actually the Omega Day at the Capitol, and we have several of our brothers across the street, so it's every guy's going to be an opportunity to go ahead and meet them. This has been a true honor to be here. Thank you very much. Right. Additionally, I have to give a acknowledgement to Trooper Burgess, who serves at our welcome desk. He's a member of Omega Sci-Fi fraternity incorporated. So if you see him, speak to Trooper Burgess and congratulate him. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Thank you. We'll get a picture. Glad to have you. Thank you. Thank you. you That was busy. Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank you all for the wonderful birthday wishes yesterday. I had a fantastic day. So I rise today in honor of Black History Month. And it is my honor to do a personal point of privilege for Harriet Tubman. Harriet Tubman was born into a system that treated human beings as property and called that injustice legal. Through the Fugitive Slave Act, the federal government empowered slave catchers to hunt down Black people and returned them to bondage. Harriet Tubman rejected the legitimacy of that system outright. She did not wait for permission to do what was right. Instead, she risked her life to guide and slave people to freedom. Giving that no law which dehumanizes human beings deserves obedience. Today, ICE operates under a different legal framework, but many of the tragedies we witness echo the same history. Families are separated. People are detained for years without certainty or compassion. Those fleeing violence or poverty are treated as threats rather than human beings. Raid spread fear through schools, workplaces and churches. Like the slave patrols of the 19th century, modern immigration enforcement disproportionately targets vulnerable communities and relies on surveillance, detention, and force justified by a claim that they are executing the law. But history is clear. They were not just executing the law then. They were humane and cruel executions of the law, just like we're seeing now. The Underground Railroad was not merely a network of routes. It was a network of people who chose humanity over compliance. Harriet Tubman showed us that freedom is not handed down by institutions. It is built when people come together to refuse to look away. Our generation must build a new Underground Railroad, not of tunnels, but of community, advocacy, protection, and policy. One that insists families deserve safety, dignity, and the right to exist without fear. For those of you not following in the news now, I know some of you have seen the current video of President Obama and the first lady Obama being shown his apes. And a country stained with the legacy of slavery and tainted by the horrific events of Jim Crow. We had a president in Barack Obama who won almost 53% of the vote and 365 electoral votes to win the biggest presidential landslide in the American history. President Obama stands as one of the most influential Americans in US history. During Black History Month, when this full body cannot even honor and defend his legacy because they have deemed it too controversial, is it so hard to denounce blatant racism? We have a resolution, SR729. I do hope it receives a hearing and passes out committee for a vote. This resolution simply says what should be obvious to everyone, this body condemns with a bipartisan vote, this blatant gutter racism by an administration that has shown us many times that they are okay with racism. And we have many in this body that still support this administration. During Black History Month, we celebrate not only where we come from but we need to commit ourselves to where we need to go. Harriet Tubman, I'll bring this back, Harriet Tubman showed us the way. She pushed against cruelty, she pushed back against inhumanity and found a way to help those who were most vulnerable and who needed it. Now it is our responsibility today to continue the spirit of her legacy and keep walking together as a community. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. I yield the well. Bring it down to the center from second. Thank you, Mr. President. My colleagues this morning, I rise, yet again to talk a little bit more about affordability. And under Senate Bill 476, my grandmother would say some folks got more lies than carters got live appeals. And Senate Bill 476, it's got some good stuff inside of the bill. But Mr. President, I want to draw my colleagues attention this morning to park for a section of four dash one, the line's 127. When we talk about affordability and we talk about affordable housing in this state, this bill will decimate affordable housing. And so where we talked about, we want to help folks get in homes and to stay in homes. This bill will not allow folks to do that because it is going to reduce the amount of qualified credits that will be available for affordable housing to be built. And when you look at the bill and I draw your attention to lines 199, it talks about what affordable housing actually means. It talks about who would qualify under the affordable housing, who would qualify in that subsection, how much they had to make to qualify for the credit. And when you read that, when you look at what the air and median income is for the state of Georgia, it literally says that a project means a housing project that has restricted rents that do not exceed 30% of median income for at least 40% of its units occupied by persons or families having incomes of 60% or less of the median income, or at least 20% of the units occupied by persons or families having the incomes of 60% of the median income.

50% or less of the median income. And so when we talk about affordability, I always come back to the well and say, we really got to get serious about it. Because in this bill, this is not being serious about affordable housing. We should not be reducing the credit. We should find ways to incentivize to create more affordable housing. But Mr. President, like I told you this morning, my family's from a little small portion out in Chatham County, call pin point. And this dog won't hunt. And so you can shear sheep year after year, but you can only skin his behind once. And this bill will skin affordable housing. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. I'm going to take this opportunity to let everyone know that today is the Okie-Fenokie National Wildlife Refuge. I hope you can find it. I recognize Senators from the 8th. I believe he has some special guests on the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. Just want to take this opportunity to let everyone know that today is the Okie-Fenokie National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Okie-Fenokie, Swamp Park, the capital. And so we have some special guests. We have two very special guests over there with our alligators. We've got Bog and Forest. So we really appreciate Bog and Forest being here. I also want to recognize Kim Bidnarek and Michael Lusk and Philip Solsey and Veronica Kelly and Miss Katie and Mr. Jolie, thank you all for being here. Last down in my district, it's a great asset to this state. 407,000 acres. You could put four and a half at Lannas into the Swamp Park. They have over 400,000 visitors a year. And it is the largest national wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi. It is truly a treasure that we have in our state. And honored to be able to represent you all. And thank you for everything you do not only on behalf of the Swamp, but on what that means for tourism, for South Georgia and our entire state. So, Mr. President, thank you for allowing me the opportunity. Thank you all for being here. And with that, I'll yield the well. All right, we've got our good friends from the Okie-Fenokie Swamp. And they actually do have a little gator tail over there. I'll tell you what. That is a live gator, huh? Two live gators. All right. Reagan Island Center for the 17th. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Colleagues, I rise to recognize the life and legacy of one of my former teachers at Fountain High School in Forest Park, Georgia, Mr. Henry Garner. Mr. Garner was a member of Flip a Temple AME Church here in Atlanta and taught over 30 years in the Clayton County Public School system. An active member of the honor-found and professional club, a retired education association. He was dedicated to the Minnesota students he served. He was a loving father and husband. He was devoted to his family friends and the community at large. So today we celebrate his long and wonderful life. He was born on June 19th, 1924 and was 101 years old this month. So today we celebrate him. Mr. Henry Garner and his life will be remembered. Mr. President, I ask for a moment of silence in honor of Mr. Henry Garner. Sorry about that, Senator. Senator's asked that his body rises for a moment of silence. Hey, men, thank you and I yield the well. Thank you, Senator. I bring a nice senator from the 14th. Thank you, Mr. President. We've been talking a little bit as a country about being neighbors recently. I would humbly submit the Super Bowl and end up being a little bit of a cultural forum in which we can discuss the issues of the day and there is a really pleasant, nice ad about being neighbors. Everybody has a cell phone. Everybody gets information on demand. Usually the information you want to hear. Sometimes that information says you're great and the people who are not like you are not as great as you are. And that information polarizes us and divides us. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. But we live in a time where neighborliness is a little bit under threat. A lot under threat. And there's a distrust of government that has been so that we have been experiencing for decades now, this idea of making government smaller because government is not doing what we wanted to do, etc. and wouldn't it be great if government just got out of our way? That sounds like a good idea to anybody who is not aware of what government does for us. And maybe it takes something like healthcare falling out from underneath us. The enhanced subsidies in DC that were not extended. Or maybe it takes deployments of armed federal troops for us to start realizing that our neighborliness is under threat and that our government is not reflecting a commitment for us to live as neighbors. This may sound like a dramatic frame for an income tax conversation, but it is not. The income tax is half the budget. And if you eliminate half the budget, you got to replace it somehow unless your intention is actually to destroy government. Now people need to know who are watching the tax conversation is affordability is a buzzword, you know, rising costs is buzzwords. There are politicians who would like to respond to the moment that we're in by just using more buzzwords as solutions, like tax cuts. Wouldn't it be great if we could just cut taxes and solve the affordability problem? The problem is we know who's paying the taxes. It's not the low end of the income spectrum that would maybe see a $20 or $200 rebate if the income tax were fully repealed. The people who are really benefiting from this are the very high income earners. Above hundreds of thousands of dollars per year who would see an income tax rebate of $20,000 on average each per year if the income tax were fully repealed. Who's ever flown on a plane? I'm just, I got, it's still green. Who's flown on a plane before? Anybody in here? Float on a plane? Anybody ever had somebody in front of you on a plane lean back the seat and then your knees get hit or you can't eat or you can't use a laptop? And you get really mad because the person in front of you is leaning back their seat. Most people in that situation get mad at the person in front of them. But who should they be mad at? They should be mad at the airline for not allowing extra space in the seat for building the plane in such a way that we're all crammed in there like Sardines. The airline would love for people who are sitting back to back to get mad at each other instead of getting mad at the level service that's being provided. And the same thing is true when it comes to neighborliness and our government and the way we use taxes. Senate Republicans would love for you to get mad at your neighbor who is not working hard enough or paying enough taxes so that when they cast distrust on government, you don't blink because you think to yourself it's my neighbor's fault or it's the government's fault. The reality is that income tax repeal is just a sales tax hike and it is a scam designed to make you distrust your neighbor and distrust your government because it doesn't become obvious until your health care subsidies fall completely away or your housing is completely unaffordable and the government's doing nothing about it, it doesn't become obvious until those moments how important government actually is. So the warning to voters paying attention to this income tax debate is in 2026, Republicans are going to tell you that repealing income taxes is a way for you to save 200 bucks or 20 bucks. But what's really happening is they'd like to defund the entire government and they'd like to give their rich buddies $20,000 back and act like they're doing you a favor. Thank you for your wrapped attention. Thank you so much for participating in my speech act. It's lovely to see all you senators and everybody in the gallery today. Thanks Mr. President. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you, my colleagues, our rise to recognize Fayette County's Chamber of Commerce and its leadership cohort. It's commitment to growth, civil-minded leaders and strengthen the future of Fayette County through the work bringing together professionals, public servants and community partners to learn and lead with purpose. Oh, there they are. Hello, Fay County. I just wanted to recognize you all. Thank you, colleagues. Chair recognizes the Senator from the 16th or a point of personal privilege and up next will be the Senator from the 28th if you want to start making your way to the podium, please. All right, Chair recognizes the Senator from the 43rd for a point of personal privilege. And if the doorkeepers would please help the Senator from the 28th, make her way to the front. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning, colleagues. I want to recognize Newton County Industrial Development Authority Day is today at our state capital. Along with me is a gentleman from the 42nd, say these numbers, mix me up. Gentlemen from the 42nd, as we share the wonderful county of Newton. Along with the Newton County Industrial Development Authority today, we have our Newton County Farm Bureau and Georgia Technical P Mont College. Our sponsors for today are Archer, Metta, Rivian, Snapping Shoals, Thomas and Hudson, and Baratheants. We have gifts for you if you would drop by. Capital Rowan, 25, to get this wonderful towel. Thank you, Chair. And the thing that you all love the most, the wonderful bridge stone in Newton County golf balls. I would like to thank the Senator from the 42nd for being Torontoite. Thank you. Chair recognizes the Senator from the 28th. Are you going to speak from your desk? I did want to come up and speak, but no walker, no scooter, they just disappeared. So thank you very much for allowing me to speak. I wanted to be up there because we have hundreds of our citizens who are having problems with HOAs that are here today. And I wanted to recognize them that dedicated to hard work every day. And they want to keep the roof over their heads. Housing represents basic dignity and scrutiny for families, seniors, veterans, and working people who often lose in everything because of policies that lack fairness and compassion. Actually the predatory HOAs and COAs and PPAs, yes, I said predatory because they are working to foreclose on people, especially those who have already paid for the houses because they get much more. And as we did our research, we realized that most of the people that are going on the courthouse steps and purchasing these HOAs homes are corporate, are international. They have never even been in this state of Georgia, they've never been in that neighborhood. And they have nobody in that neighborhood. They have a management company that they're working with. So they find this out. We need to do something on so many different issues. And there are many bills now that many of the senators in this room and over in the house have introduced to stop the foreclosure on people's American dream, their home. And we will also make HOAs accountable. And there's no regulations on them. There's nothing but the covenant that people have to sign when they're closing for that property. They sign it and most of them don't even know what it is or why they're doing it. They just hold it, they have to do it to buy that house. So it's my responsibility as a legislator to hear them. We've had five hearings already. The first one we had, we had standing room only and we had to reschedule. And each time we had to have people in the hallways looking at what we were doing inside because the fire marshals would not allow anybody else in those rooms. In other words, it's not just my constituents, it's all of our constituents. We found out it's not this neighborhood of that, it's happening all over. And all 159 counties, please, please help us on this. And I'd like to recognize if we still have people, some people up in the gallery that are here today, please stand. And they're over in the house in the gallery. Please give them a round of applause because they took time off today. Thank you for taking time off and coming and staying with us and coming down and call some of your legislators out and talk to them personally. Because they would love to hear just exactly what's happening in their communities. So by encouraging all of the legislators on the house in Sinisat to take a little look at what's going on because housing stability, strengthens communities and strong communities, strengthens Georgia. So on this HOA day, let us recommit ourselves to justice for every homeowner and tenant in our state. Thank you for listening and knowing that it is a horrible situation going on and we must do what we can to stop it. Pass these bills, thank you. Thank you people for coming today. Chair recognizes the center from the 25th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. It gives me great honor to come and recognize the logger of the year who happens to be from Butts County. If you want to know what real work is in the state of Georgia or anywhere, you talk to a logger. Mr. Cornelius Toby McDowell is over here on the wall. I'd like to invite any of you to come over and speak to him. Shake his hand. Thank him for the hard work. Timber industry is a big industry in Georgia. We all know and what he does every day is putting his life on the line and out there working hard to make a living and to promote the great state of Georgia. If you all would come over and have a resolution and recognizing him as a logger of the year, I have Senator Lee Anderson over with him. Senator Anderson introduced a logger of the year last year. So thank you again. If I could get him a warm round of applause, please. Thank you. Chair recognizes the center from the 55th for a point of parcel privilege. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Black history as it unfolds even before our eyes today. In 1895, the Atlanta Compromise, known as the Accommodationists or Commodation, was the repulsed of Sep 4th right up the street in Piedmont Park. An African-American leader, Booker T. Washington, and a speech he gave at the Cotton States and International Exposition, he urged Black southerners to accept segregation and temporarily refrain from campaigning for equal rights, including the right to vote. In return, he advocated that Black people received basic legal protections, access to property ownership, employment opportunities, and vocational industrial education. Upon this speech conclusion, the White attendees gave Washington a standing ovation. Why? Because at this time, there was a backlash of what was called reconstruction. There was an attempt to give the formerly enslaved Black Americans an opportunity to fully participate in the American dream. But that dream was cut short as people began to dehumanize African-Americans, to have mass violence, to have lynchings, and to have all types of injustices in play put upon those of color. I say this because it took almost from that time 1895, all the way to 1954. We had a policy called separate but equal. And it took a guy by the name of Thurgood Marshall, who was an African-American civil rights lawyer, and jurists who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1967 to 1951. He, along with Charles Hamilton Houston, formulated a strategy to use sociological data to show how unequal separate but equal was. And it emanated right here in Georgia. And it took all the way from the slave, the former century to 1954 for this country to say, wait, it is unequal. And I say that because we are now trying to expose those same conditions that existed in 1895, where we had persons standing up to say, we will retreat if you just treat us more humanly. And I stand because there was an inhumane act done just this past week. And the leader of our country stated and depicted the first African-American president and that first African-American first lady as apes. And that's what was going on in 1895. And that is what was supposedly peace. And that peace was a false peace, a false justice because it allowed people to be violently destroyed because they were treated as inhumane. And when we can see our brothers and sisters as less than human, when we don't stand up and condemn, when someone will call someone and ape being the first African-American president, then we are complicit when we don't speak up. And that's why I'm calling for all of my colleagues to sign off and condemn the racist depiction of our first president, our first first lady as an ape. I'm asking you to do this because if you don't condemn it, you are complicit in it. If you don't condemn it, you are saying that you agree with the humanization of others. You are agreeing that Atlanta is not a city too great to hate. You are saying that you will agree that you can dehumanize as the slaves were. The slaves were dehumanized to live in slave quarters to now allow adequate and affordable housing. The slaves were dehumanized and not given health care, expansion of Medicaid. Take away health care more than 200,000 Georgians losing health care right now. When you dehumanize people, you can justify not educating them. You can say it's against the law to educate a slave. And it's against the law to educate our great people of Georgia when we take away the educational opportunities. Join me in condemning those acts of dehumanization. Thank you and I yield the will. Chair recognizes the center from the 36th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, it's a busy day down here at the state capital, but it was really busy yesterday when we saw a bill get filed on Friday, posted at midnight, two bills. And then taken up on Monday morning, first reader, and low and behold, by that afternoon, yes afternoon at three o'clock, we were in there being asked to vote on this bill. That's a real speed of Rama. And I've been down here long enough to know when something has wings on it like that, line of you better bring it back down to earth and get very real about what's in that bill. And in this case, what's in the two bills that makes wonderful grandios promises to Georgians, but I'm afraid close scrutiny tells another story. It's typical in election years for wonderful bills to be rolled out that just sound like it's going to be man from heaven every time you turn around. So when you take a closer look, I will say to you that this legislation dealing with our income tax structure, I will assert it blows a $6 billion whole on our state budget.

Even with the effort to repeal every tax credit, that only gets us to $3 billion. So there's still a $3 billion hole in the budget. And so that means if you do the basic math, we have to either find new revenue or make massive cuts or look for something else to tax. What would that be? I'll tell you, in Texas, in Florida, in Tennessee, it's a consumer tax. It's sales tax, which disadvantages middle and low income households. Why is that? Because a sales tax is consumption, and you run through your money a whole lot quicker when you're middle and low income families, then you do, it's a very small percentage of those with wealth. So it's a regressive tax policy. And when you look at these sales taxes that are, I think, inevitable, and we've seen it in other states, I think there are only nine states that have done any version of this out of the 50 states. But we could see Georgians paying 12 to 15% on consumer purchases in sales tax. And so when you say it, cuts taxes, not raises taxes, it's like, well, wait just a minute. If you see grocery school supplies closed, prescription drugs, business purchases, purchasing a service, services from an attorney, or a tax advisor, etc., all those sorts of professional fees. You wind up with the promise of money coming in your front pocket, but you're taking out your back pocket. Hello? And sometimes you call it play money coming into the front pocket, while the real money is being pulled out of the back pocket. So I say to you, let's look at some of the tax credits. And it's fine to call all our tax credits corporate welfare, but that's not really an accurate description of a child care tax credit. Many Georgians are now spending the third of their income on child care. It will be more expensive. Affordable housing tax credit. So look at this one. We're facing a housing crisis in this state. Nobody will dispute you on that. But guess what? It gets worse when you reduce by half the affordable housing tax credit. Rural doctors, rural hospitals, rural jobs. We didn't expand Medicaid, so then we're stripping away support that we gave doctors and hospitals in our most vulnerable areas that are underserved with medical professionals and medical institutions. So I say to you, buy or beware, buy or beware. Look at the details, not at the big promises that are being made. We would be torching our state budget and our state's economy. Where we go down this path in the real world. Buy or beware. So I have the privilege of having some of my hometown folks here with us today. They're in the gallery. Members of the Perry Youth Leadership and the Perry Leadership Group. And I want to tell them, hello, glad y'all are here. Y'all give them a welcome, please. And now I'll recognize the senator from the 19th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. You sit in this chamber and hold your tongue and listen to attack upon attack and realize it's not true. And say, well, I'll just sit there and let this attack roll. But then it continues again and again and again. And you realize if someone doesn't stand up and stop the water from rolling downhill, well, the folks sitting out in the audience will believe it. And that's exactly what happened here today. You've heard member after member approach this podium and say that if your state income tax were reduced, you tax payer of Georgia, watch your state income tax be reduced, that hill stones would fall from the sky and the world would fall apart. But I submit to you balancing your budget that you know that's simply not the case. You're trying to pay for gas. You're trying to pay for groceries. You're trying to pay for childcare. You've seen your power bill increase nine times in the past two and a half years. You've been told that the emperor was wearing clothes and things were getting better, but they weren't. And the folks who walked up here to this podium told you if somebody were to make it better, oh no, hill stones will fall from the sky. That is simply not the case. One of our senate colleagues was correct. They bill went through this chamber or through the senate very, very swiftly this weekend. That bill eliminated the state income tax on individuals making $50,000. It eliminated the state income tax on families making $100,000. And my question to you is how is that bad? They want you to believe if you're a family who maybe you're a teacher making $70,000 in Fulton County. Maybe you're a firefighter into Cab County who's making $65,000. Under the senate Republican plan that came through, that's the senate finance committee yesterday, your state income tax will be eliminated. Yet the minority party wants you to think that that leaves you in a worse place. One of the members of the minority party walked up and said well that's going to give you an extra $20. Maybe $200 a year. Well guys, I knew they were good at saying lies. I didn't know they were so bad at math. If you eliminate the state income tax on a family on an individual making $50,000 at a 5.19% tax rate, that is $5,500 and $95 in that individual's pocket. If you're a family because maybe you're a police officer and you're married to a store clerk and together you make $90,000. You're going to see your income tax completely eliminated under the plan pushed forward by senate Republicans on Monday. If you're someone though who makes more than that, you go well how does this plan help me? Well let me tell you how. By eliminating the income tax on the first $100,000 for families, if you're making a half a million dollars, you're only taxed on $400,000. If you're making $250,000, you're only taxed on $150,000. But if you're making $90,000 because you and your spouse are average Georgians who make on average around $45,000 a year, your income tax gets eliminated completely. For someone making over $100,000, that's $5,190 in their pockets. That's not $200. That's enough to make a car payment a couple of times over. That's enough to invest in your child's education a few times over. That's enough to pay for a babysitter, maybe only for two or three weeks at the current rate, but that's real money. The sit back and say that doesn't help families is to have cotton in your ears when they're screaming to us that affordability is the biggest issue in our state. And when this issue comes to the floor, whether it be this week or next week, I hope that my friends in the minority party and across the aisle will realize that this bill helps families and that voting the party line to not help families too, is a recipe for a disaster and a map to stay in the minority for the next decade. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. Senator Geilder, the well chair recognizes the center from the 44th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise to recognize that today is dyslexia awareness day at the state capital and the halls are buzzing with advocates who have been hand in hand working with us on our path to address kids with dyslexia in our public schools and also pushing us a bit along the way. And dyslexia is the most common learning disability that exists and it affects one in every five Georgians. It causes difficulty with phenome segmentation, which is the ability to break words down into individual sounds. So therefore those with dyslexia may have a weakness in decoding words and reading fluency, but there is no connection with intelligence and early remediation is key. All of this has been recognized by the General Assembly in the last few years. I actually was with former senator Fran Mullar at a education, PTA, north central to cab, PTA education group meeting when someone a mom raised her hand and said, why don't we do anything with dyslexia and send her a lot of things with dyslexia and send her very much credit said, why don't we? And hence was born the very first bill to start to try to get our hands on this issue. And that was about eight years ago. And since then we have made a lot of progress. We made a lot of progress. There is friends a long way to go, but I am excited that we are on the right path. And a lot of that does have to do with the advocates with decoding dyslexia, who have had steadfast advocacy on behalf of Georgians with dyslexia. It is important for us to tackle this, not just because it is the right thing to do, but when you have got a student population where two thirds of kids have not been able to read fluently at grade level and a huge part of that is kids with dyslexia. It is not only our responsibility, but to address it, but it behooves us. This is our future workforce. This year we, I am so happy to stand with the senator from the fourth, the speaker and other members of the House in support of the Georgia Early Literacy Act that will put a literacy coach in every K through three school. This work couldn't be more important. What we need to do is recognize how fundamental it is. And it is that reading is fundamental, right? And as we go through the budgetary process to recognize that along with other priorities, this does need to be a top priority. And I really do commend the speaker, senator from the fourth, and many others who have been trying to push us forward. So let's honor these dyslexia advocates by continuing their work with our critical funding and support for high quality literary resources. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield well. Thank you, senator. Thank you for your work on this issue. And thanks for speaking to that this morning. Chair recognizes the senator from the 35th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I come today because I was elected, newly elected, to consider a little nuance and appreciate the idea that maybe the best ideas don't come from one party. Maybe the best idea is just the best idea. But I have one question about this income tax situation. Where is the work? Show me the work. If you can't show me how you get to your number without showing me how it's not going to affect families in Georgia on the back end, how can I trust you? We have to remember that we live in a society where trust is very low in our government. If I'm going to go with the plan of somebody and groups of people who are already following a President Donald Trump, trust is already low. Trust is already low. If we come in and say, hey, here's the tax plan. You're going to save $5,000 for you and your family. That sounds great at first. But if it's going to cost my family $7,000 on the back end, that's a problem. The thing is, I can't stand when somebody comes in and they sell you something. They can't tell you how they get there. Here's this new product. Here's this new dental product. You're going to need it for your office. It's amazing. We'll show me the work. Oh, yeah, yeah. We did a study and then it starts getting a little interesting. Show us the work. Our educators, if you have somebody that has a habit of having low trust and all of a sudden they have a wonderful answer to the question and math. Your teacher wants you to show the work because trust is already low. So let's not be amazed that we don't have bipartisan consensus on this plan. There's not even consensus among Republicans. On the other side of the hallway they say, you know what, that's a ridiculous plan. We have a better tax plan. They're talking about property taxes. Here we're talking about income taxes. Every day person in Georgia doesn't care how we get there. We do want to make sure that we take control of the cost of things. Both of these Republican plans are trying to take care of revenue. But both plans don't do anything when it comes to sales tax. Everyone is talking about affordability on the things that they buy. Go to the grocery store and every time I go I get a little irritated more and more every day. And with the plans that I've seen, the only way to make up for the revenue hole is that you have to have more sales tax. That means the ground beef is going to cost even more. That means that the toilet paper is going to cost even more. That means that the eggs are going to cost even more. And for seniors, you're not getting much benefit from this tax plan that's been introduced. But you're going to have to pay a whole lot more every time you go to the grocery store. Notice that that conversation isn't happening. Notice across the hall when they're talking about property tax. But you don't hear about is, oh, our schools are already struggling. And I know they're paying more and more for health insurance. We're not going to help them with that. We're just going to ask them to keep doing more with less. Do we ever get tired of this? Again, I know I'm new here. But just a message from the people on the ground is that they don't care who has the best plan. They just want a real plan. Not an election year plan. Not an election year plan. And then we'll pay for it when things fall apart next year when you can't vote us out. They want a real plan. Show us the work. You can't do that when you drop a billhead of Friday after everybody leaves Super Bowl weekend and then have it passed through and then committee without a fiscal note. Can't do that. Show us the work. Are you? I'm Senator for the night. What part of the rise? Thank you, Mr. President. I rise just to recognize. I guess we have over here, Mr. Reginald Hall. He is from Hog Hammock in Sapporo Island. For those of you that don't know, that part of Sapporo Island is the last intact Gullah Gigi community. And it's in the sea Island of Georgia. And it's where the first enslaved West African settled and him and his family are still there. And they have been fighting just to keep their community intact. They face threats not from nature, but man made threats. And just trying to he's always advocating just to hold on to the way of life they have there in their land. So please go introduce yourself to him. He really needs our support as he is fighting for his community. Thank you, Mr. President. Chair, recognize Senator from the 16th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. One of your big colleagues on our US Constitution empowers the states to recognize gold and silver as legal tender. And today the technology exists that makes metals fully functional as everyday currency. Other states, Texas, Florida, Arkansas are already moving in the direction with bipartisan support. Texans voted on this overwhelmingly with 1.6 million voters 77% calling for gold back money. This is an initiative that strengthens trust. It reduces taxation and provides citizens with the potential of federal overreach and future taking a private gold. By authorizing gold and silver as legal tender establishing a state backed electronic transfer system and removing state taxes, we give our citizens stable constitutional money in certain times. This is a US constitutional right. All we have to do is act on it as the citizens. That bill numbers SB 424. 4 is for Georgia and 24 is 24 carat gold. Thank you, Mr. President. Chair, recognize Senator from the 22nd minority later for a point of personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to say that minority parties are going to look forward to the fact that we're going to have an opportunity to point out the flaws of these particular tax bills or tax schemes. Have you want to kind of qualify them? Basically this bill that we're talking about today is going to be quite simple. If you like tax hikes and lots of jobs, you're going to love this particular bill. We want to talk about teachers and plumbers and things of that nature. The savings that you may think you're getting are going to go right out the door with higher sales taxes. The fact of the matter is that Florida and Texas, two states that basically done something similar, their sales taxes much higher than Georgia's. I only say that maybe a little bit lower is Alaska. Alaska's sales tax maybe a little bit lower because they struggle oil. Have we struggled oil? That's how they're actually fund their budget. The fact of the matter is within the southeast Georgia has one of the lowest sales taxes within our particular region. That will all change after this particular bill. And we start talking about sales taxes and won't just be on your groceries. It also be on things like your barbers are going to be collecting your sales tax. And yes, Mr. President, believe it or not, I actually still get a haircut every week. And I can't imagine having to pay my barber who charges enough as it is to actually pay him sales tax every week. You start talking about a lawyer. You got a lawyer need lawyer to do a house closing or something of that nature. Guess what? You're going to have to pay him or her sales tax too. So the savings that you may believe you're finding are going to go straight out the door because you're going to be paying sales tax on everything under the sun. And so all of those savings will be gone. But it does not stop there. You don't have to worry about necessarily even paying income tax because the fact of the matter is Georgia is going to lose jobs because one of the aspects of this particular bill is getting rid of every tax credit you ever heard. That actually put jobs within Georgia. Oh man, people have talked about for years and years, Georgia is the number one state to do business. How did we get to that particular point? One of the ways we got to that point was to the use of tax credits when we started talking about manufacturing credits and things of that nature. That gives people jobs. And now we're going to just snatch all of that away. Destroy the economic engine that has made us the number one state to do business. That economic engine is actually people with jobs. So all of those people are going to lose their jobs. So what are you going to tell those people about this tax scheme that you actually have going on now where they're actually going to lose jobs that were brought here because of those particular credits. But it doesn't end there either because one of the things last year I remember that our lieutenant governor talked about the fact that one of his single piece of legislation was the fact that he actually did a child care tax credit. Well, that's going to be gone too. So when you start talking about savings and child care, Georgia has some of the highest child care costs within the nation. But one of the things that actually offsets those costs is our child care tax credit. That will be gone too. So any savings you think you'll see will be going to your barber will be going to groceries will be going to your lawyer will your child care will actually go up. It will be lost. And then if you're lucky enough to actually still be employed in this particular state, then you actually will actually have an opportunity to take care of your family, hopefully. But it doesn't end there either because let's actually talk about the fact when you start talking about rural communities, one of the things that has actually helped rural communities is the physician tax credit. That is now gone. Everybody talks about rule rule rule. And one of the things that we said would actually help get doctors into this particular state was a rural tax credit. We're going to get rid of that too. So rule communities, if you think you're having trouble right now, getting medical care, imagine what it will be like when this particular bill goes to effect and no physicians actually there to serve you at all. It doesn't end there. The bottom line is if you were in favor of higher taxes and job loss, then you'll love this bill. We cannot wait to actually debate this particular legislation. But if the majority was so right, then why would you have a bill present a bill in one hour that basically causes all of this job loss and tax hikes. If you were so right, why would you only have an hour to do that? So let's bring on the fight. We can't wait. Thank you, Lee. Members of the Senate, middle Georgia, lost a great leader last Friday unexpectedly. Ron Shipman of Macon passed away at Friday evening. He was a public service giant. In my part of the world, he served as president and executive director of the Macon Water Authority. Prior to that, he was an executive with the Georgia Power Company. During his tenure, he worked alongside board members, employees and community partners to advance critical water sewer and stormwater infrastructure projects that supported the health, safety and economic vitality of middle Georgia. He was described as a leader who served the community and many capacities in his passing as a profound loss, not only for the Macon Water Authority, but for middle Georgia as a whole. Today, we want to especially lift up his wife, Anita, the Shipman family and all who knew and loved him. His career reflected a lifetime of service, work that strengthened essential infrastructure, supported economic development, and proved the quality of life for countless Georgians. His legacy will endure in the community. He helped build the community, helped build and the people he inspired through his leadership. And so I asked for you to join me in a moment of silence as we remember and honor the service of Ron Shipman. Thank you. And we extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. Thank you very much. Chair will recognize the center from the 31st for a point of personal privilege. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief. It sounds like the tax men and women showed up in the well today from the Minority Party are typical cradle to grave government that they promote. And I think all we heard was, give me, give me, give me your wallet, give me your pennies, even though they don't exist. They still want your pennies, they want your dollars, and all they want to do is grow the size of government. They want to debate details while the other day they voted against every property taxpayer in this state, which you can't reverse, like that's what you all did and you want to talk about affordability. Every single day you want to talk about, you want the unlimited access to the taxpayer, to the mom and dad trying to go to work every single day. You want to take their money from childcare, you want to take their money from paying the bills and putting gas in the tank to go to work or get their martybries pass to get on the bus and travel into Atlanta to bank and meet every single day. Give me, give me, give me, that's what we're hearing from the Democrats today. They're from the government and they're going to help you. I like to see them help, but the hypocrisy is just unbelievable. Every single year you all come in here and you vote for the budget. The budget that is taking the income tax right down again and again and again. Are you all going to actually vote against the budget this year? So, is y'all coming down here and talking about affordability, affordability rests with the citizens of Georgia, not growing the government, not growing county government, not growing city government is getting government out of the way. So, while we're crying about details and the details are there, just remember the citizens are paying attention to who's not just saying what but who's actually doing what. So, Mr. President, I look forward to the continuous debate over affordability in this state. And at least one thing both Republicans and the House and the Senate are doing is I would rather be having a debate over lowering taxes than a debate over growing the size of government. Without Mr. President, I yield the well. Does any other senator wish to rise on a point of personal privilege? I think we've got two or three that have not come to the well last call. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolutions on the, excuse me, you have before you a consent calendar of privilege resolutions.

Does any senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution is on the consent calendar? The chair here's none and the resolution is on the consent calendar are adopted. Are there any motions to withdraw or commit or withdraw and commit? The secretary will read the caption to Senate Bill 384. We're on to our rules calendar it's 12 of 5 so maybe it's about time. Senate Bill 384 by senator Hatchiv the 50th and others. A bill to be entitled an act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 9 of Title 14 and Title 40 of the official code of Georgia annotated related to motor vehicle emission inspection inspection and maintenance and motor vehicles and traffic respectively. So as to provide for an optional five year motor vehicle registration and revalidation for certain motor vehicles to revise and provide for definitions to provide for conforming changes to provide for related matters to provide for an effective date to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. Senate Committee on Public Safety recommends that this bill do pass by substitute by senator Albers. Chairman. The Senate Committee on Public Safety offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 384. A bill to be entitled an act to amend Article 2 of Chapter 9 of Title 12 and Title 40 of the official code of Georgia annotated related to motor vehicle emission inspection and maintenance and motor vehicles and traffic respectively. So as to provide for an optional five year motor vehicle registration and revalidation for certain motor vehicles and for other purposes. Mr. President that completes your order. I recognize the senator from the 50th to speak to Senate Bill 384. Thank you Mr. President and good afternoon. I rise today to bring you Senate Bill 384. What this bill does essentially is when you go to the TAG office to renew your vehicles to TAG. Right now you only have one option which is an annual renewal. What this does is it creates an optional five year motor vehicle registration for non commercial vehicles. It maintains annual emission compliance. Essentially what this does is just allow more convenience for Georgians who are working who don't always have time to run by their TAG office. It's completely optional. You don't have to do it. But I think it's a good bill that we can all get behind and I'm happy to answer any questions. Chair recognizes the senator from the 31st what policy rise? Senator is it is it not true that this is another example of getting the government out of the way of the taxpayer? I agree. No other question senator. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the bill. Does any other senator wish to speak for against the measure? The chair here is none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none and the previous question is ordered. The question is only adoption of the committee substitute. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? Hearing none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? The chair here is none and the main question is ordered. The question is on the passage of the bill by substitute. All those in favor of the bill of a yay opposed nay the secretary will unlock the machine. These are 45 and the nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed by substitute. Senator from the 33rd what purpose do you rise? Thank you Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the 26 for business outside the Capitol. Is there objection? No objection to the senator from the 26 is excused. All right the secretary will read the caption of Senate bill 435. Senate bill 435. My goodman of the 8th. A bill to be entitled an act to amend the fiscal code of Georgia annotated so as to rename the Georgia Development Authority as the Georgia Agricultural Development Authority to make conforming changes to provide for a later managed to repeal conflicting laws and for other purposes. The Senate committee on agricultural and consumer affairs recommend that this bill do pass. Senator Goodman, chairman. Mr. President that completes your. Chair recognizes the senator from the 8th to speak to the bill. Thank you colleagues. We have the opportunity here to correct a great wrong that was done about 66 years ago. The Georgia Development Authority was created from funds from the rule rehabilitation act. It was known as the Georgia livestock development authority for a long time and the legislature actually created a they're going to give it bonding authority for water and soon they didn't realize they already had another one and in the meantime they took the agriculture out of it and we obviously already have the Georgia Finance Environmental Finance Authority and all this bill does is asked that we put agriculture back in the name because our friends at the GDA are getting phone calls from mayors and county commissioners wanting to borrow money from infrastructure and the Georgia Development Authority is for farmers and GFA is for our municipalities and counties. With that Mr. President I will yield the well or I'll answer any questions. Chair recognizes the senator from the 29th. Thank you Mr. President. I'm Senator Gil. I do. Senator is it not true that this is the most important piece of legislation to ever pass out of the Georgia General Assembly? The senator knows of what he speaks. Thank you. Mr. President.

Is there objection to the main question being ordered? The Chair here is none and the main question is ordered. The question is on the pass of the bill. All those in favour of the bill vote. Yay. Those may, the Secretary will unlock the machine. Senator from the 14th, what purpose do you rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. State your inquiry. Mr. President, do you like to eat? Clearly yes. Further Parliamentary inquiry? What's your inquiry? Mr. President, if you like to eat, is it important to support Georgia farmers, Mr. President? Absolutely. Senator knows what to speak.

Therefore, rolled out proposed senator Biden to deliverne a amendments in assembly byeny Barton essentially led to reforms agreement. Thank you, Mr. President. This is an issue that we voted on about four times here in this chamber. And this will simply put four words into House Bill 54. It basically strips out the language relating to that underlying bill. And puts in four words and those four words are relating to puberty blockers. And let me give a little bit of background relating to this. We pass legislation sponsored by the senator by myself and the senator from the 13th relating to treating minors with gender dysphoria. We forbid in the state law that physicians could not prescribe hormones, i.e. estrogen or testosterone and could not do surgery again on minors in the state of Georgia. And at that time we left in puberty blocking medicines. And this is where we're re-adding that into that law, that section. You may recall that prior we had a very long bill, several different pages that described other issues related to that that has already been passed into law. And this is the only thing that lacks being put into the law. What was testimony showed in HHS is that if minors are left on puberty blockers or put on puberty blockers, then they are close to 95 percent going ahead and making their transition from male to female to female to male. But the fact is if they're allowed to go through a natural process called puberty, then they're much less likely, most do not go and transition to another sex. And nobody in this chamber thinks that gender dysphoria should go untreated. Mental health professionals are certainly available and should be treating this underlying mental health issue. Certainly after the age of 17, so 18 years and above, if you're an adult and you choose to do that, then that is on you. This does not cause anyone that is an adult not to get this treatment, but minors, you can look at that as enabling. And I think that is not an understatement. Some people would call it grooming. I think that may be a little bit of an overstatement, but some people feel that way. Let me just touch a little bit on the health care and the science related to this. Puberty blockers that are used, they're off label. They are not approved by the FDA for this. There are side effects we have discussed in detail, including osteoporosis. But let me just digress. What is the own label usage of puberty blockers? Where they're not used in puberty blocking except under exceptions of which the bill already allows exceptions to this. They're used mostly in prostate cancer and so forth to block the male hormone that prostate cancer feeds on. So there are significant side effects and the risk is not worth the benefit by any means. And again, does not mean that it does not get treated, just treated as a mental health disorder. And then at age 18, if you continue to desire that, you can. Mr. President, I would ask for your favorable consideration. I'll go ahead and discuss amendment 1a, which the senator from the 19th will come down and discuss. But that is a friendly amendment and I would have no problem with that if they both pass. Mr. President, I'll be happy to entertain any questions. You do have a couple questions, Senator. Regan, I'll send it from the 14th. Thank you, Mr. President. Is the senator yield? Yes. Senator, if I'm not wrong, we had a bill about home health relating to advanced practice registered nurses. And the current version of the bill before your amendment has nothing to do with gender dysphoria. Is that correct? It is in the same section, but no, it is a health care related section of the law and is not relating to home health care. When you say section, what do you mean exactly? What do you mean the same section? I've had legislative council look at this and they feel as if it isn't the this is germane. Okay, so that's forgetting to center for the yield. Yes. So what I'm understanding is that you are looking for a way to introduce puberty blockers legislation. You're saying legislative council told you this bill might be an acceptable vehicle for that. Am I understanding that correct? Yes. Okay, thank you. So I guess my next question is why if we have a bill about home health and health care in general and advanced practice registered nurses, why on a day like today with a bill like that are we suddenly talking about trans people? I'm not suddenly talking about this. This is an issue that's been going on for about four years. Do you further yield? Yes. So the senator is saying that for four years the senators hat you have had a policy priority of talking about trans kids. Is that right? No. Okay, but you're saying center yields? Yes. The senator is saying, but it's true that this is not just a new thing for you. This is something that you've been working on for four years, correct? This issue I will tell you back four years ago, I really did not realize the scope of this issue. It's something that I've certainly learned a lot about more than I would like to know, but to recognize what it is and to recognize that this piece of law needs to be adjusted. And to the point that we should add back in should add puberty blockers to this particular law. Senator further yield? Yes. Senator, are you aware of any Democrats that are trying to introduce any legislation about puberty blockers? The, I would not be privy to that. Okay. So why then do you think that the Republican Party and specifically you for the last four years have been dedicated to legislating about trans people? You know, this, you know, you can spend the words however you like, dedicated is not a word that I would use. So you'll have to speculate on your own. Thank you, Senator. And at the perfect time, Mr. President, I would like to make a point of order relating to the procedural validity of this. Thank you, Mr. President. Any other questions? You do, no, no more questions. Okay. Thank you very much. Again, amendment one is my amendment and would ask for your favorable consideration. And amendment one A is a friendly amendment that I would ask for your favorable consideration. And the senator from the 19th will discuss that. Thank you very much. I'll get you point over. I was going to. Senator from the 19th, you like speech, your amendment. And then I'll. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, amendment one A is essentially Senate Bill 39 that passed out of this chamber last year and was not brought up before Sonny died in the House. As you remember, we found in discussions with the budget that the state was actually paying for transgender surgeries with state taxpayer funds. Senator from the 29th introduced a bill that handled that in the prison setting, but Senate Bill 39 addressed it with all state taxpayer funds. Should state taxpayer dollars be used to pay for transgender surgeries? And the decision of this body, although not unanimous, was that no, those state taxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for transgender surgeries. That bill went across to the House, got it caught up in the things that happened between the House and Senate chambers and did not come up on the House floor for a vote. So it is now section, the section of it that handled state funds is pulled out and made as a amendment one A. And now is there for your consideration. I appreciate your favorable consideration, those who voted for it before and those who voted against it. Appreciate you considering it again this time. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll yield the will. We're going to have Senator from the 14th. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a point of order. I think this is a procedurally invalid amendment because I'd like a ruling from the chair on germainness and the reason is we have an underlying bill about home health and amendment that's supposed to be about gender dysphoria. Now suddenly we're plunged into this very predictable policy debate from 2024 beyond. So it seems like the purpose of the underlying bill has very little to do with the amendments have been added. And I would just like the chair to make a ruling on whether this is really relevant or not. Again. All right. One second. I have a matter of view and since this is a health care bill and we retunally usually are putting adding language or taking away language to house bills and since this is a pertained to health care and the underlying issue that this the students from the first is trying to get to his pertained to health care as well. So I'll rule it your main. Thank you, Mr. President. I've peeled the ruling of the chair. I figured that would be the case. All right. He's. Senator from the 14th has moved the challenge ruling of the chair. Chair's rule that. The measure for HB 54 is germain all those. Question is, shall the ruling of the chair be sustained all those in favor of the ruling being sustained will vote yes. I recognize from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Point order. Because you walk us through what a vote yes and a vote no would do with a vote yes sustained the ruling of the chair or a vote no. Help us understand what we're doing right here. A vote yes would sustain the ruling of the chair. That's correct, Senator. That is correct. A vote yes is for me and a vote no is for Senator from the 14th. All right. Here we go. All those in favor of vote yes. All those opposed nay secretary will unlock the machine. All the appeal the ruling of the chair the a's are 30 and the a's are 17 and so the ruling of the chair is 17. And so the ruling of the chair is sustained. And I'm Senator from 38. Speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, Georgia. The Georgia State Senate has brought caught your orders back. We just spent all this morning talking about affordability and taxes. And now we are sliding in to amendments to a bill to take away the rights of Georgians and take away the rights of parents to make decisions with their physicians about their children. We are about to decide whether men that sit in this chamber should tell parents what they should do with their children. Whether women in this chamber are better suited at telling parents and doctors what is best for their child. Legislating fear does not reduce the cost of Georgians everyday lives. Legislating fear just continues to divide us. This is not how we move forward in a country and a state that is calling on us to work together and reduce their costs. What we are now doing is separating those of us who feel comfortable with who we are from those of us who struggle with identifying with who they believe they are. That is not how we should be legislating in this body. President has already shown us that lawsuits will be coming to this state. People will sue as a result of these amendments being added to this bill shall we pass it. I strongly urge those of us in this chamber to stop these culture wars. Stop making it feel as if there are some of us in this state that should not have the right to make their own decisions. It is about their body. It is not upon us to make these decisions. I strongly urge us to vote no on these both of these amendments. This is not making food more affordable. This is not lowering the cost of taxes. This is instead telling parents that your child should not have the same rights as other children in the state. Your child should be forced to live in a body that they do not feel comfortable with. At some point this has to stop. I don't care how you feel about trans children in this state. At some point we just need to leave them alone. Stop it. I am no better than a parent or physician to make a decision about a child. I would be darned if I counted on anybody in this room to tell me what I should do with my children. You would feel the same. I should not walk into your child's doctor room and tell you what to do with your child. So we should not be entering somebody else's child's doctor room. I strongly urge you to vote no on these amendments because we have much more important business to discuss.

to reduce the cost of childcare, to reduce the cost of food, to reduce the cost of milk. That is what people care about. Other people just want to be left alone and be able to live their lives. We are better than this. So please vote no on this bill and Mr. President, I will take any questions if there are any questions. I can't have questions. So vote no. I do have a question. Okay. President Sen from second for a question. You will move on to well. I recognize Sen from the 55th for a question. Will the gentleman you? Yes, sir, I do. I have a very unusual question, but I want to ask that I couldn't ask it of the previous, the author of the amendment, but I read on the amendment 1A, no state fire shall be expended for healthcare. Benefits coverage, including coverage for gender affirming care. As gender affirming care, would that include, for example, if I as a man want to get testosterone, if I am low on my testosterone to affirm that I need some testosterone, would that be included? That is a great question, but my understanding is that would not be included because we rather attack folks that are not like us. That's much more comfortable to do than to stop the care of those of us who do need some testosterone. You can still do that. It's just the folks that are uncomfortable with who they believe they are. That's who we are attacking. We're not going to attack those of us in this room. It's much easier for us to attack those who are not in this room. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. I don't know how to deal with the will. Bring it out of the center from the second to speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, but I tell you, we're getting better and better at this right here. Let me tell you why colleagues, I'm opposed to amendment 1A authored by the center from the 19. Who is my friend? I'm going to tell you why because this amendment is anti-freedom. This amendment will allow the legislature and the general assembly from this point moving forward to decide what we want the state health benefit plan to pay for and what we don't want it to pay for. So if next week you decide you don't want to fund asthma, you'll take it out. If you don't like sickle sale treatments next week, you'll take it out. If you don't like taking care of folks that have cancer, you could just take it out. The general assembly now has the power by voting on this amendment to decide what people can do with their health insurance. Now, I have heard many of you talk about the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare. You can keep your doctors and y'all have railed against that. What's the difference between that and this? If the legislature can decide what you can get treatment on, how you can then be treated, then there is nothing stopping us from making that determination of what you can cover and what you won't cover. Well, I think it's a slippery slope, colleagues, that we will intervene and what a person's health insurance can cover. That's negotiated in network, out of network, all that stuff. Listen, you may have an issue with people who are transgender, got it, understand. But I always remember, do onto others as you would have them do unto you. That's the golden rule. And I don't want anybody telling me that my health insurance can't treat asthma. You may not want your health insurance to tell you it can't treat geriatrics. You may not want any of that stuff. But guess what? If you vote on this amendment, what's the stop of bill next month or when we're coming back in the next legislative session? What happens when the balance of power changes? Whether majority is not the minority, the minority is not the majority. What do you do then? Will you come make the same argument that I'm making today that if you're focused on this issue and you say state funds, well, guess what? We're state employees. We're on the state health benefit plan. So you get to decide what type of treatment I get. I didn't know that you all had medical licenses. I didn't know that you were MDs. I didn't know that you're my primary care physician. And you may say Senator, but that's not what this bill is about. It's a very specific issue. Oh, no, it's always about a bigger picture. And for folks to talk about big government, well, this is making government a hell of a lot bigger. Because if you want a small government, you let folks make the choice as to what they were going to have offered in their health insurance. But now you want to come and bring big government to tell you what your insurance can have. And it's only if you receive state money. So if you're on a state health benefit plan, if you are a state employee, talk about folks that work for the state for 25, 30 years and retired are still on the state insurance. They've worked for this state for 25 and 30 years. And maybe they had a point in life where they're making a different determination and you want to walk back on the contract. Well, those folks have retired and say, well, now we feel a little different about this. That's not a good way to do business. And I would leave you with this. Do one to others as you would have them do one to you. That's the golden rule. And I wouldn't want anybody making changes to my health insurance because you may not like the condition I suffer with today. And that's a slip or a slip because it might be trans folks today. But it could be somebody else tomorrow. And with that Mr. President, I yield the well. Greg, I'll send it for the 14th. Good afternoon, colleagues. It's February 10th, a little after 1230. And here we are talking about trans people again. Not because Democrats brought it up. We were about to talk about home health and advanced practice registered nurses, increasing health care access, the kind of bipartisan legislation that people around here brag about Georgia General Assembly being good at. And all of a sudden, amendments to target trans people. Now, I don't think the timing is any surprise, right? It's February. So qualifying for your primaries starts in a few weeks. I think there's two things that you think that these amendments will do for you. Number one, we'll put you in a good position for your primary to show your base that you're taking on the hard-hitting issues right before qualifying. So maybe people think twice about running against you. And the second thing you think it's going to do is get Democrats into a tailspin. You think Democrats are going to come up here and freak out. You can clip it and use it later and say that we're obsessed. But I think the procedural record today shows who's obsessed. I think let's be clear about what just happened. We had a normal health care bill at a time when people's enhanced subsidies have been ripped away. 200,000 Georgians lost their health insurance since the holidays in just a couple months. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to drop off the rolls. So we had a good access health care bill. What happened today is that Georgia Republicans swooped in like fighter jets over the Super Bowl dropping anti-trans amendments to make this entire debate about trans people. And we put the vote on the board. The president of the chamber said, yes, we should be talking about trans people today. And we put the vote on the board and every Republican senator whose presence said, yes, we should be talking about trans people today. And every Democrat voted, no, we should not be talking about trans people today. Republicans voted, yes, let's keep talking about trans people. Democrats voted, no, let's stop talking about trans people. So if there are people watching this and wondering who's obsessed with continuing to talk about trans people, it's the Georgia Senate Republicans. They won't leave it alone. It feels very 2024 in here right now. And let's be clear about the second part of what you think you're getting out of this, which is that Democrats will do some kind of a tailspin and you can clip our speeches and make us look, you know, deranged or something. Who looked deranged in the Omaha mayoral? The one where the Republican candidate ran a bunch of anti-trans messaging as his mayoral platform. He got trounced, trounced by a Democratic candidate who said, I care more about potholes and good government. And this Republican candidate cares more about what's going on in your bathroom. Trounced. Omaha. What about the governor's races? Spanburger, Cheryl, Virginia, New Jersey, multi-million dollar attack ads about how they are obsessed with trans people. What do they do? They just ran on their record. They were the adults in the room. They said, I care about real issues like healthcare access, cost of living. So let's, I mean, this is a really easy playbook for y'all to run, but I want you to know maybe it worked in 2024. I think voters are tired of it. And I think you should expect that after a day like today, when the votes are on the board, Republicans vote yes, let's keep talking about trans people, Democrats vote no, let's stop talking about trans people. In a year where there's an affordability crisis and that's what's on the ballot, I think you guys are going to realize just how to fuel, how out of fuel the strategy actually is. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, Senator from the 44th. Thank you, Mr. President. First amendment would eliminate all discretion for doctors and parents, for children. Some of my colleagues have already eloquently expressed why all of us should hesitate to think that the 56 of us in this room know better than those esteemed professionals and the parents of the children that we are discussing in forcing through a bright line rule that leaves no room for particular situations. That is a very dangerous thing to do in the medical field. Bans are extreme and should only be done from a legislative point of view in cases where there is absolutely no reason or rationale that a given treatment could be useful in any situation period and that simply is not the case with what we are talking about in the senator from the first amendment. Amendment number two, eloquently spoken to you by the senator from the second, is basically saying that adults who are making their own decisions full grown adults who are paying for health care should not be permitted to get the same medical treatment that is available to everybody else. We have been through a list of cases, afflictions from the senator from the second asking everyone directly what is the difference between this and these other things that you expect and deserve to have treated. Again, a very dangerous thing to substitute our judgment for that of medical professionals and to declare that any one of us has a moral judgment on an adult's decision in their own medical care that we will make for other people. And clearly, if you're not going to allow an adult who is paying for their health care to have a medical procedure when no other medical procedure would be off the table for that individual, then you're just simply saying we are not going to allow transgender people to exist. We will do everything in our power to just deny their existence. And I would suggest to you that that is not what Georgians believe, that's not what Americans believe. But I think the bigger picture is the fact that we have had so many of these culture war bills here in this chamber for the last four years in particular. And that is because it's the culture war bills are the easy things to do, to pick on vulnerable populations and try to distract your voters and the voters of Georgia from the failure of the Republican agenda in this country and in this state to deliver a good quality of life for Georgians. You can try to keep your base happy by working them up about some supposed boogie man that has no basis in reality and hope they don't notice several really important facts. I would ask that all of you look at today's Wall Street Journal. It makes abundantly clear in some very easy to regrafts exactly what has happened in our economy for the last 45 years. And that is that the benefits of American economic output in the last 45 years have all gone to businesses, shareholders and a few executives. While regular workers, regular folks have barely gotten any of that pie. Shareholders, executives, business is like this over the last 45 years. What the workers get, what the average guy gets, what average Joe gets has fallen precipitously. And therefore it is no accident that we have had culture war bill after culture war bill in here to distract from the fact from those facts and that there has been no ideas offered by a Republican majority that has been in power for 20 years on how to reverse that situation. Instead what we are getting is we will cut your income taxes. But that doesn't work because the second you do any math you see that all the people who have gotten screwed over in the economy and are making less than they ever made in real dollars 45 from 45 years ago are the ones who will end up paying more. And see what's going on is that everybody knows it. Georgians are tired of politicians that lie and say one thing and do another. And the reality with this tax legislation is that it is getting panned not just by Democrats in this chamber. The other chamber won't stand up for it. Many Republicans in here won't stand up for it and that is for the simple reason that it's a scam and the math doesn't work at all. And so because we don't want to acknowledge that that's true, now we fall back to our old tactic of let's just go back to the culture war bills. Let's just go back to the culture war bills because we don't want you know it's not going so well. The wool isn't getting pulled over everyone's eyes with these affordability agenda tax bills the way we hope that they would. So that's out the window and now it's back to the let's just pick on people agenda. The things that very few people care about the things that impact very few people because the other stuff is hard. The other stuff requires real work and it's hard and the solutions aren't easy. So because I guess we don't want to just sit in here for 40 days into absolutely nothing we got to come up with something to fill our time and that's just to pass all these bills that do nothing but pick on a few vulnerable adults and children and do nothing for anybody else. I want to reach you some very telling statistics from an article that ran in the current a few months ago. So over the last 20 years Georgia's per capita income has fallen precipitously which is the same thing that I referenced from today's Wall Street Journal that has happened to average workers. That same thing has happened here but it's worse because our average per capita income has fallen precipitously in the rankings of states. So we are worse off. Georgians have less money in their pocket now than they did in the year 2000. Georgia's PCI that's per capita income between 2020, fell against the national average and we rank all the way back to 40th. We are worse off 20 years into the 21st century than we were 40 years earlier. And I'm quoting from this article is not me. Listen to this quote. It's impossible to ignore the fact that the reversal in Georgia's PCI performance coincided with the Republican takeover of Georgia State government. Governor Sunny Purdue who defeated incumbent Democratic Governor Roy Barnes in 2002 to become the first GOP governor of Georgia in more than a century presided over the biggest drop in per capita income performance in Georgia in modern times. If not ever. By the time Purdue left office at the end of 2010, the number of counties in Georgia that are in the bottom national quartile of wealth had nearly doubled. And the percentage of the state's population living in the counties where the bottom had fallen out on real spending dollars for Georgians had more than tripled. So I would suggest to you that that's exactly what's going on. There is no affordability agenda out of this chamber. There is no reckoning with the fact that Republican policies have contributed to the vast increasing income inequality that we have where people struggle to get by while the executives and the shareholders take home all of the gains. I would suggest to you that our political system is not reckoning with that. I think we all need to understand that this is exactly why Americans are so angry. They are furious that this foundational element of American life where the vast majority of American workers in the last number of years, in the last 45 years, has gotten completely screwed while the elites have made all the money, is why our society is struggling so much. And it is our responsibility as leaders to try to contend with that. But the minute that everyone can figure out that these tax bills are a scam, it's right back to let's just fill our time by picking on transgender kids. The baseline time spent in this chamber, dealing with things that would make Georgian's lives with serious issues, things that impact the vast majority of people. It's just been non-existent. And it is a waste of Georgian's time for us to sit up here and spend our time on nonsense like this to pick on people instead of admitting what it is that Georgians actually want us to do and want us to focus on. And I am hoping that as we turn to different leadership within this state, that we get serious again about being legislators and legislating for the common good. And stop trying to pull the wool over everybody's eyes by throwing shiny objects up, picking on people, bill after bill after bill. Who don't deserve it? They deserve our our respect as human beings. They have dignity as human beings. And using them as a punching bag to distract from your economic failures is something that everyone in here should be ashamed of. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the loan. I can add a senator from 22nd. Thank you, Mr. President. So it was always clear there was never a doubt that when folks were losing on the question of things that really impact Georgians lives, go back to trying true method of picking on folks. And what had been happening is they had been get whipped on the issue of what we call affordability to basically how to improve Georgians lives. Came up with the tax scheme and said this will do it. They'll back down. They'll stop talking about the real issues. They'll stop giving the real facts. They will be intimidated by it. Where our caucus wasn't. We gave it right back to them and said they said, you know, these guys are not going to stop telling the truth to Georgians. So let's do the old tactic. Let's try to distract. And let's bully. And as I tell people all the time, it's not us bringing up these issues. It's them. But I don't like bullies. And I'm not going to allow my fellow citizens to George B. Bulley. So absolutely, I always stand up for them. So when you see me standing up as not that I brought up the issue, but I'm certainly not going to allow, and this caucus would not allow our fellow citizens. People want to take care of their families. People want to do right by their wives and husbands to be bullied. And that's why we're up here when we fight against these issues. Not that we bring it up because we want people to be able to live their lives where they want to live their lives. We don't want the government and persons personal life all the time. They want that. And when that comes up, we don't fight against it. So that's what you see. You don't see us prioritizing it. You see us making sure the bully can't take advantage of our fellow citizens. But here's the bottom line. Those are rural Georgia who need in health care, ignore this and ask what does this have to do about improving rural health care. Those who cannot afford childcare throughout this state ignore this and ask what does this have to do with improving childcare. Those who seek a better job within this state ignore this and ask what does this have to do. We're getting a better job in this state. Those who care about issues such as child poverty because our child poverty rate is higher than the national average. Ignore this and ask what does this have to do with the end in child poverty. Those who want better schools ignore this and ask what does this have to do with improving our schools. So we're here to make sure everyone realizes in Georgia we're always going to stand up to the bully and we're going to be here for you to care about the issues that actually matter to you without a yield of well. I recognize Senator from 35th. All right. Thank you Mr. President. Again, I'm about a month into being a state senator and I come in with the open heart, open mind. I really appreciate all the conversations. Ninken that we got reasonable folks. But I'm standing up here because I thought we were talking about advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants and home health care. I actually thought like I was like getting prepared and I was like oh we're going to talk about home health care. This is what people think we do here and then these yellow pieces of paper started showing up and we're like what are these yellow pieces of paper with all these signatures of support. Oh this is about trans kids and trans people. And here I am new but I thought we're talking about home health care where we can actually do some good work because we only have 40 legislative days. I'm really glad we're talking about health care because we haven't been talking about health care and now we're talking about health care. This is good. And then these yellow pieces of paper show up to talk about trans kids. I understand that this may be a political game for a lot of you here. It is not a game for people at home. This isn't play time. Like folks are just key key and and ha ha and about like folks really can't afford health care right now. How many people do we know in that sandwich generation where you're trying to take care of your your elderly mother and father and in God parent and you're trying to take care of your babies and child care is through the roof and you're trying to go to your public schools and you have concerns about some of the public schools and do I do private. Do we drive across town? What about the little one that has to get pre K and you know pre K calis more than private school and you're just hoping to get to public schools. You can get a some kind of relief and in the middle of this they think we're here coming up with solutions about health care but they find out well I'm finding out that we we come here and we put up these little yellow pieces of paper with the signatures of a lot of you in here to say no no no let's not talk about solutions in home health care. Let's talk about trans kids and they tell their legislative aids to go hurry up and go da da da da da and they send a text message home let's we can get them here and then they have people running around this building doing their bidding and and these are really in general I find you know really good folks but then as I mentioned in my first time coming up here you know a tree by its fruit you know a tree by its fruit. Love God, love people, for real. This is not a game. I can rattle off a long list of things that folks sent us here to focus on everything costs way too much. You see wealth all around you but you don't feel it or see it in your own account.

people feel behind trust in government is super low. Ridiculous amounts of money just flying around in government. Local state, definitely federal. We'll have domestic violence bills here and then we don't say anything about the Epstein files. People do not care who has the right idea like which party came up with it. They just want us to do something good. Let's stop playing games y'all. And I know y'all have been here many, many years and you're probably thinking oh the new senator he'll learn how it works around here. But I'm a certain kind of stubborn and I know who my God is. He know a tree by his fruit and if we're going to talk about home health care to help out folks who are struggling at home what you don't want to do is throw a trans bill on top of it with all of your signatures to prove that you thought this was a great idea for whatever reason. I yield the will. We're going to send it from 37th. Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, Senate I rise today. I appreciate the thoughts of some of our colleagues. You see the diversity of opinions in the state to be sure on display here today. I rise to speak to folks in the political center. There's been accusations that have been flying around about intentions here. I would agree with my colleague from 35th. I think that's the same thing. And the health care does cost too much. The proposition before this Senate is a relatively simple one. If you look on lines 19 through 27 this proposal does nothing to limit what's referred to as gender-firmic care that's probably funded by individuals. This proposition simply does one thing. This state tax dollars appropriated through our state budget from going to fund sex change drugs for Georgians. It prohibits the use of state funds, state facilities, and state employed physicians and health care professionals from paying for that with the tax dollars of everyday Georgians. That's all this does. Folks that I know in my district and around the state across the political spectrum recognize public tax dollars shouldn't fund sex change drugs for people. They want to do that. They can do that themselves. This bill does nothing to limit individuals funding that themselves. It simply says state tax dollars can't be used for that purpose. State facilities can't be used for that purpose. And state paid and employed doctors can't be part of that with state money. That's all this does. People I talk to in the political center, they want to bring people together recognize this is cell policy. I reject the premises as bullying. I reject the premise that this is playing a game. I reject the premise that somehow rejecting this proposal helps lower people's health care cost. Friends, it's offensive to folks who are paying higher health care cost employees teachers to recognize that a small portion of their money is funding sex change drugs for Georgians at the state treasury. This is a common sense proposal. I'm really reaching out to members of our majority party and minority party. Democrats and Republicans, friends, this simply says the state treasury state tax dollars can't fund sex change drugs. That's all this does. This represents the common sense across our spectrum. I think every senator should support amendment 1a. There's no bullying. There's no gamesmanship here. It's a simpler proposition that supports the integrity of our tax dollars. Let's come together and support this proposal. Senator Gilded. Senator Mines. Thank you, Mr. President. We were almost home free. We had one last bill and then this lands on our desk. A perfectly good piece of legislation, which was HB 54, we all agreed to it. And the only reason these yellow sheets are here now is because last year, this is a whole bill attacking trans individuals. This bill didn't make it in the house. They don't want it. We don't have time for that. We have to do some other work. That's why it's back over here trying to get attached to a really good bipartisan bill so that we can attack trans kids again in this chamber, not the house, over here. It's what we're doing the bad work. This bill only did three things. The bill that we want to pass, the bipartisan legislation is on this yellow sheet that we all agreed to and it's back to us now just to say yes, we all agree. It's now gotten corrupted. This bill only did three things. Gay practitioners and physician assistants, the authority to provide home health care services, required training on deaf certificates, expands caregiving tax credits, which would help patients and their families and health care providers. Yet here we are attacking trans people in our trans community again. For what? Let me tell you something. People back home ask me and these folks in the center that you're talking about. Senator Mary, you're always going after Republicans. Why can't you all meet halfway? Why can't you work on bipartisan stuff? Why can't you reach across the aisle and work with them on good pieces of legislation that actually responds to stuff that we want? So I'm going to tell you why. It's because of stuff like this that just corrupted a very good bill that I fully agree with my colleagues on that would expand health care and give health care services at a time that has already been mentioned where people are asking us to respond to health care and do something. This is not something. No one in my district is asking is, hey, can you, you know, put more, can you ban more trans bills? Can you, can you please? Because that is such a priority for us right now. No, my folks are worried about eating. They're worried about paying rent. They're worried about paying groceries. They're worried about rising health care, health care costs. They're worried about being able to take care of grandma at home and a child with special needs at home. Not this. Not one is asking me to go after trans community. And maybe y'all think, hey, well, you know, we rolled out all those ads when Kamla was running and it really hit. Well, it's a new day. And people care about new things this election cycle. And you right now have, have one of the most hated administrations in the White House. And if you don't believe me, go Google it, hate it. Not just by Democrat. By everyone because they are not so much focuses on culture and attacking people and attacking trans and attacking others and who gets to live here and who doesn't. No one cares. This administration is not responding to affordability. People are hurting. But yes, by all means, let's spend more time attacking trans individuals. Enough is enough. Let's do real work. I'm encouraging all my, my colleagues on the other, on the other side of the, I'll say no to this crap. No. And let's pass a clean bill that was sent over here to us that actually responds to something. And with that, Mr. President, I yield the well. I recognize from 40th. If sent for the first be ready, we'll be able to stand by to close debate. Thank you, Mr. President. 15 days. 15 days is a record when we didn't mention transgender people once in this chamber. And I can tell you it's been great. I've been relaxed and I realized that the last five years, because I have trans children. The last five years, all this debate has been so incredibly stressful for me and my family. But these last 15 days, it's been great. In fact, I've been able to work on a piece of legislation that we can come together on. It's this bill that many of you signed today. It's about keeping kids safe online. It's a core piece of mental health protection for our kids and it's got Republicans signatures on it and it's got Democratic signatures on it. This is the kind of stuff we can do here together. But these, you know, we've worked on this transgender issue for five years. Isn't that enough? So all I'm saying is the last 15 days have been great. Thank you. I yield the well. Senator from the first. We just like to go to the base. Senator from first, close the base. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, at first, I'd like to read a statement from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, position statement. So the clinical management of children and adolescents, which is what we're talking about, minors, presenting with gender dysphoria or general or gender incongruence with the has undergone rapid change and American society of Plastic Surgeons offered guidance to members providing gender surgery services services for this population and that's the position statement. And this is what it is. Understanding the larger patient assessment process, both through the cast review and HHS report, emphasizes that the natural course of pediatric gender dysphoria remains poorly understood. Available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of children with pre-perputal onset gender dysphoria. That experience this significant reduction of stress by the time they reach adulthood, absent medical or surgical intervention. So in other words, if you don't give hormones, if you don't do surgery or if you don't use puberty blockers, they'll go through a natural puberty and outgrow this. And as I mentioned earlier, we discussed enabling and some people even called it grooming. Evidence regarding, I'll continue on, evidence regarding adolescent onset presentation presentations come increasingly common sense to mid 2010's HHS report underscores that this uncertainty has significant ethical implications when the likelihood of spontaneous resolution is unknown and when irreversible interventions carry known and plausible risk. It's a hearing to the principles and benefit and malfeasance related to that precautions, a precautionary approach. You know, today we've heard a lot of discussion unrelated to either of these amendments. We've heard the golden rule, we've heard the Super Bowl, we've heard about sports, we've heard about taxes, whether this is germane affordability, why America is angry is one quote from the 44th and the senator from the 44th. Let me read you a quote from that senator. That relates to what was said earlier. Let me find it here, apologize for my fingers. This is a conversation that happened on a Zoom call with our senator from the 44th discussing why she had voted with the Republicans because she thought that that issue was not a political winner for the Democratic party. In discussing political games and trust in government, I would encourage you to go back and look at that. Let me just simply say we're finishing up which should have been done after learning over three years of working on this piece of legislation. And this is the important part relating to that amendment one adds in those four words relating to Peabry blockers. Amendment one a adds in that no state funds will be used for transitioning like this in minors. I'm sorry in adults, but you're still as the senator from the 37th pointed out you can still do it with your own money from that perspective. With that Mr. President, I will yield the well and ask for favorable consideration. Thank you. The senator is yielded. All right, we'll move on to the question is on the adoption of amendment one a amendment one a is their objection. All those in favor of amendment one a will vote. Yeah, all opposed vote. No. Secretary on lot machine. You have a question. I'm sorry senator from the 44th what purpose you rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Isn't it true that when I had a conversation with the constituent that was just referenced by the senator from the first that was a bill dealing with prisoners. The senator's past is what about what she speaks. All right, on the passage of an adoption of the amendment one a the a's are 30 and the days are 18 and this amendment has prevailed. Now the question is on amendment number one as amended is the objection to amendment number one is amended. We have objection so we'll put it on the board all those in favor of amendment one as amended will vote. Yeah, opposed nay secretary on lot machine. You amendments it. The past admission and the past ed Senator handed the沒事, hey well. We're going to have a majority leader for motion. Mr. President, I move the Senate's adjourn until 10 a.m. on Wednesday, February 11th. The Senate's adjourn until Wednesday, February 11th at 10 a.m. Secretary, read the announcements. The rules committee will meet upon adjournment in room 450 of the Capitol. The Children and Families Committee will meet in room 450 of the Capitol at 2 p.m. The retirement committee will meet in room 310 and the CLOB at 2 p.m. The Education and Youth Committee will meet in room 307 of the CLOB at 3 p.m. The Higher Education Committee has been canceled. The Insurance and Labor Committee has been canceled. The regulated industries and utilities committee will meet in room 450 of the Capitol at 4 p.m. Mr. President, that police order. All right, the majority leader has moved. All those in favor? On the motion to adjourn? Was signify by saying aye? All those opposed? No. Aye, I ask for the heavy. Have a good day.
