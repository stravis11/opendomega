----------
Good morning, sir. All members, all
members will please come to the floor.
All members.
>> Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell to let
everyone know we're about to begin?
Good morning. All members, please
come to your seats.
We're going to have the morning roll
call. All members, all members, please
come to your seats.
All members present will please vote
green to signify your presence in the
chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the

Have all members voted?
All members I think have voted.
If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the

War keepers, if you'll please close the
doors and keep them closed.
As is our custom, we will begin our day
with scripture reading and prayer by our
chaplain,
after which we will pledge allegiance to
the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will uh be
introduced by a gentleman who's also a
pastor along with his duties here in the
house. And that's our friend from the
129th House District, Representative
Carlton Howard. Carries on a long
tradition of service from his family,
Representative Howard.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues,
uh it's my distinct honor and privilege
uh to introduce today's devotional
speaker, Pastor Claude Harris, Jr.
Uh I I don't know uh Pastor Harris just
in passing. I've known him and his
parents most of my life. As a matter of
fact, his father who's with us today uh
actually is one of my mentors in
ministry. I've watched uh Claude Jr. I
watched him grow in his faith. I've
watched him grow in his character and of
course now even in his calling.
He was raised in a home that was ground
as grounded in ministry uh as the son of
now overseer Claude Harris senior and
pastor Regina Harris and from an early
age uh it was evident just watching him
grow up that God's hand was on his life
before stepping into pastoral leadership
at the New Life worship center uh in
September 2024. Claude built a prolific
music career. He is a stellar award
nominated artist whose songwriting and
production credits include work with
notable artist gospel artists like PJ
Mortyn and Jonathan Nelson. Uh he's the
overseer once again as pastor over he's
the senior pastor at the New Life
Worship Center in Hebs, Georgia. But
what I appreciate about this young man
more than anything else is that he
represents the next generation of
leadership, but it's rooted in truth. Uh
he's respectful of legacy and committed
to service. And today he joins us not as
a musical artist but as a servant of
God. Uh here to center our hearts and
our minds as we carry out the work for
the people of Georgia. Please join me in
welcoming Pastor Claude Harris Jr.
devotional speaker for today.
Good morning,
Mr. Speaker, and members of the House.
It's an honor to stand before you today,
and I thank Representative Carlton
Howard for this opportunity this
morning. I stand not as one proclaiming
expertise in politics, but as one who
recognizes and deeply respects the
calling of servant leadership at rest
upon each of you. Scripture reminds us
of a truth that is both simple and
profound. Whoever wants to be great
among you must be your servant. And
whoever wants to be first must be your
servant. Just as the son of man did not
come to be served, but to serve. That's
found in Matthew 20 26- 28. In your work
here at the Georgia State Capital,
you're entrusted with the weighty
responsibility of shaping laws and
policies that affect millions of lives.
Families, children, seniors, neighbors,
all seeking hope and provision. At
times, the burdens are heavy. Decisions
are hard, pressures are real, and the
voices of many compete for attention.
And yet leadership at its best is not
about power, position, or pride. It's
about service.
Jesus tells us that true leadership is
measured not by what we gain, but by
what we give,
not by who we elevate,
but by how we lift others.
His model is one of humility,
compassion, and sacrificial love. As
servant leaders, your work matters.
Your service is not in vain. The hope of
Georgia is not merely in laws passed
here, but in the hearts that lead with
wisdom,
justice, and mercy. So today, I want to
encourage each of you with this thought.
Lead not for acclaim,
but for the good of those you serve.
Lead not for applause,
but for the flourishing of your
neighbors.
Lead not with pride, but with humility
and grace.
May your decisions reflect wisdom.
May your words build bridges where there
is division.
and may your service honor the dignity
of every Georgian.
Could you please stand and let us pray.
Gracious and sovereign God, we thank you
for this day and for the privilege of
gathering in this historic chamber. We
thank you for the men and women of the
Georgia House of Representatives, for
the calling you've placed on their lives
to serve the people of this state. We
ask today that you would fill them with
wisdom beyond their own understanding,
courage to do what is right, compassion
for those who are affected by their
decisions. Guide their hearts toward
justice, their minds toward clarity, and
their conversations toward unity. In
moments of stress, grant peace.
In moments of disagreement, grant
humility.
In moments of success, grant gratitude.
May they never forget that they are
called to serve first and that service
rooted in love, truth, and righteousness
strengthens the foundation of this great
state. Bless this house, their families,
and every citizen of Georgia. We pray
this in your holy name. Amen.
>> Amen.
>> Now, let's join in for the pledge.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the
republic for which it stands, one
nation,
indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.
>> Awesome.
members. I know we can all take those
words to heart and our service here, but
I want to make sure that we um
acknowledge someone who's here too, and
that's um
Elder Claude Harris, Senior, who's
responsible for these two young men up
on stage. Let's give him a round of
applause. And thank you for your
service.
Thank you, sir. Keepers, you may unlock
the doors. members where you can join
the pastors in the South Annie room and
get a photo and greet them and thank
them for their service.

29th, 2026, is Doula Day at the Georgia
State Capital.
Thank you. Doulas are non-clinical
support people who provide care to
improve paranatal health outcomes for
laboring, birthing, and postpartum
families, as well as loss support. The
hallmarks of doula support emphasize
community-based interpersonal
relationships, health promotion through
preventive care, child birth and health
education, emotional support, and the
improvement of health outcomes. The
state of Georgia has a rich history of
mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters,
and other close individuals who attend
births as supportive figures. And
research shows that even without formal
training, this support can significantly
decrease the likelihood of cescareian
sections, shorten labor times, and
improve the birthing experience. We
thank Georgia Doulas today from a number
of different agencies present. Please
stand when you hear it. YS Doula

>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. We
have another The gallery is pretty full
if you look up there. We have another
very special group as you came into the
chamber today. If you were coming from
outside particularly, you might have
bumped into a lot of strollers.
Today is strolling thunder at the gold
dome and that's when our friends at
Gears have their annual event for young
children birth to five. Those most
important years when the brain is
forming and habits are forming and there
is so much time for development. Their
families join us today with many many
little ones. Early childhood is an
incredible window of opportunity for all
of us. Our youngest children are our
future. Please say hello to any of your
tiny constituents that you might bump
into or that might stop by your offices.
And also feel free to join gears across
the street at the freight depot for
lunch today to celebrate early childhood
development. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
yield the well.
That was great timing, chair lady. The
doulas get them here and then you put
them in those rolling thunder. Oh,
that's awesome. Good stuff. Good stuff.
Thanks, members. Make them feel welcome
when you see them. Chairman Chocus and
Representative Teddy Reese recognized

Representative McQueen is recognized to

Representative McQueen and friends
>> and friends. Come on. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. It is a true honor to celebrate
the recently ranked number one college
for women. Full stop. Not the number one
H.B.CU. We've held that distinction for
nearly two decades. Not the number one
liberal arts college for women. We broke
that list almost a decade ago. Whether
it's recognition for educational value,
innovation across campus, or the impact
our graduates make in the world, if it
is rooted in excellence, service,
leadership, and a choice to change the
world, we are it. This morning, I rise
not only as representative for House
District 61, but as a proud alumni of
Spellelman College.
My time at Spellelman was a season of
growth. It stretched me, challenged me,
and sharpened the way I think about
leadership, service, and community.
Spelman did not make me who I am, but it
expanded who I could become, and for
that, I remain deeply grateful. Today,
we proudly recognize Spellelman College,
an institution that continues to push
boundaries, open doors for women of
African descent, and set the standard
for academic excellence and community
impact under the leadership of interim
president Dr. Roslin Ros Brewer, who is
here with us this morning,
along with Miss Spellelman, Taylor
Mills, Dr. Vasan S. Tinsley, National
Alumni Association of Spellelman College
Atlanta chapter president and Demetrius
Clemens, also with the National Atlanta
Alumni of Spellelman College uh in
Atlanta. Colleagues, please help me
welcome the women of Spellelman College
to the people's house.
>> Thank you, Mrs. I yield.

Welcome, Spellelman. We appreciate
y'all. Thanks for being here and telling
your story. We appreciate the
contributions Belman graduates are
making in our state. Thank you very
much.
Members, we have a resolution on the
rules calendar.
So, you may want to get close to your
seat.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to
House Resolution 1008? 10 Z8.
House Resolution 1008 by Representative
Smith the 70th and others. a resolution
to ratify amendments to a certain
comprehensive statewide water management
plan to provide for force and effect and
to provide for construction to provide
for an effective date and to repeal
conflicting laws. This resolution have
been signed to the committee on natural
resources and environment. That
committee recommends that this
resolution
be adopted.
>> Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair Lady Lynn
Smith is recognized to present the
resolution. Lady will pause just for a
moment.
>> Ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning,
members of the House. Um, it's my honor
today to present to you House Resolution
10008.
This is a long journey of the state of
Georgia taking a very important role its
citizens in the health of the state of
Georgia in the areas of natural resource
in particular. This is your issue
concerning water management. Several
years ago when I was first elected I
came to the cap and was very clear about
expressing my concerns about water
issues in and around my area. We were
south of Atlanta. Atlanta was cavalerely
polluting its rivers. U where I lived.
You could not go to the river. You the
smell was awful. Um and so I'd been
former chair of um the chamber of
commerce and we could not promote that
part of our of our county. So my tagline
was um I don't need to take you to the
Chattahuchi and show it to you. Just
take a deep breath. You can smell it.
So, it was good to help get me elected,
but when I got up here and tried it,
179 of you looked at me and thought,
well, we got our problems, too. So, um,
my journey was to learn that if I was to
be effective, I had to know and learn
the areas and the concerns of of the
rest of you and the rest of the state of
Georgia. Georgia was also under this
heavy anvil. We were involved in tri
straight water wars. Uh we were being
sued by Florida and Alabama. And then
all of a sudden nature started taking
over and we were struggling with
droughts and different things. But we
did not work nor act as a state dealing
with our issues. So began the long
journey. And what I'm going to present
to you today is the result of part of
the process. If you'll look up at the
boards, you'll see a a map of the water
planning districts for the state of
Georgia. There is a carve out and this
bill does not pertain to the
metropolitan Georgia metropolitan
Atlanta area. They they had as a body we
we determined that they needed to be
their own group because they could work
under the ark of the ARC, Atlanta
Regional Commissioner. And so they in
the beginning we passed a statute that
said you need to get organized and deal
with your problems. But we knew the rest
of the state need to do that as well.
And so began the study on how to create
regional
>> the if the lady will suspend just for a
moment.
>> Y'all know about water. It's pretty
important. This is an important bill, a
resolution. So, let's give the lady your
attention. If you have a conversation
that needs to take place, take it to the
either Annie room, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the
House, I knew I might put you to sleep,
but I didn't mean to do it that early.
So,
so back to the story of why we're doing
this today because I think it's
important. Most of y'all in this room,
some of you were not born in 1997. Hate
to say that, but it's true. So, you
don't know our water history.
State of Georgia was underwater with all
of our problems. We were not stepping
up. We were not taking action. The city
of Atlanta, the greater metro area had
to
be
encouraged by legislation to start
dealing with your problems. But then the
rest of state had its problems as well.
And along this process, we as a state
are now the example for the United
States, all the other states. But it's
been a long journey. And one of the
things we have to do now with House
Resolution 10008
is review the actions of all these
regions outside of the metropolitan
Atlanta area. Some are performing very
well, some not so well. And um that is
the charge we gave to the state water
management planning group and they met
in uh December and looked at the
different and varying issues
and one of the areas that was identified
is that the water council meets every
five years to review these regional
water plans. the appointments were made
every three years
and so in some areas of the state people
were actively engaged in other areas
they weren't. We required them to have x
number of people on the boards but they
couldn't get a quorum. In other words,
we created something was not efficient
and not effective. And so the state
water planning group met that met in
December and um they came up with um
some suggestions and there's there's of
course the legal language which is in
house resolution 10008
and um they in the resolution it simply
says they're amending a particular code
section of this area. So, what I'd like
to do right now is explain to you what
that code section is actually saying.
But you keep in mind and what I told you
earlier, some of the areas of our state
are not functioning because they can't
get a quorum because it takes too many
people. The other thing that's going on
right now is we've been asleep for a few
years because we've not had tragic
events until Hurricane Helen. And then
we woke up and realized, woo, we we need
to be a little bit more efficient and
and proactive as opposed to um reactive.
And so the we were given this well, it
was put in the form of a resolution. The
amendment includes reduce reduce reduce
the number of governor appointments from
13 to 7. Reduce the number of lieutenant
governor appointments from six to three.
Reduce the number of speaker of the
house appointments from six to three.
Remove the alternate council members.
Increase the length of appointments from
three years to six years. I'll say that
again. Increase the length of
appointments for three years to six
years. Now we're doing it every three
years. And so require each council to
have at least one representative from
each of the water and wastewater demand
forecast sectors, municipal, industrial,
agricultural, energy. Why are they
specifically named? Because they are the
consumers of our natural resources. And
so yes, they need to have a presence
there.
the update. It updates the requirements
from the memorandum of understanding
between EPD and Department of Community
Affairs. Essentially what we're doing
here,
this these amendments do not include
change to the exeicial membership and
I'm an exeicial member, one of the
members on this side. Under the state
border plan, the lieutenant governor and
speaker of the house each appoint a non-
voting exopicial member from the
membership of the state and house
senate. State and house if you're um
and then to go further if and I'm
anticipating what some of the questions
might be, but I need to point out this
is not an exclusive group. this is your
group wherever you live and and yes, you
have a role to play. If you want to be
one of the appointments to the board,
then you need to let the chair know. And
I'm going to give you a website that you
can go to to say, I'm I'm interested in
this. As with most people,
it's not an issue in front of us right
now. But forecasting and moving forward,
things are going to change a little bit.
You can't predict the climate. We can
pass all the laws we want. We can't tell
the climate what to do. But our pattern
is excessive rain. It's also going to
have a reverse pattern of more droughts.
And we need every region of the state of
Georgia to be effective and responsive.
If you're not on the council, but you
want to be involved, let them know. A
lot of the councils have working groups
where they get together and make things
work. And in the end, you need to know
this was a difficult difficult thing for
your colleagues to do through the years
of the late 19 on 2000 2010 and on.
It was a lot of criticism. Your farmers
in particular were were singled out to
um be better stewards of of the use of
the water. So, so we as a state are
leading the state, the United States,
but to stay in that role and to look
after our citizens, we I ask your
favorable consideration of House
Resolution8.
Mr. Speaker, open to questions.
>> Yes, you have a question to your right.
Chairman Dicki is recognized for a
question. Um, does lady yield?
>> Yes.
>> Thank you, Madam Chair, for bringing
this very important legislation and your
work um ensuring Georgia has adequate
water resources. And I just want to
reiterate to this chamber how important
these water councils have been and
continue to be in in allocating and
planning for future growth for our state
with our water, whether it's
agricultural,
industrial, um municipal, whatever uh
how are we using our water? These
councils are um such an uh important
part of the uh going forward. So, thank
you for this legis legislation.
Thank you.
>> Lady, yield for a couple more.
>> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
>> Represent Representative Thomas to your
right is recognized for a question.
>> Do you yield?
>> Yes.
>> Is it not true that we worked together
in this off season and traveled all
across the state studying water issues
and impacts from uh economic
development. And one of the things the
committee found is the work that you've
done even 20 years ago was incredibly uh
had an incredible amount of foresight
and uh that the findings were that
really we're in a great place in the
state of Georgia thanks to you and the
the foresight of the general assembly 20
plus years ago.
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah. And thank you for bringing this
bill. This is a great piece of
legislation.
>> Thank you. If I may interject, thank you
uh
representative for chairing our resource
management committee and and gathering
information as well. Y'all that
committee and you and you've done a
great job of bringing information.
Representative Sanchez is recognized for
a question to your right.
>> Thank you, speaker. Does the general
lady yield?
>> Yes.
>> They just had a quick question. Uh the
terms are changing from three to six
years. So does that mean that they're
all when the current terms expire they
become six years or are they resetting
this year?
>> So that's a good question. The next time
the council meets for these is 2020
28. So what we're doing is laying the
groundwork for from that point forward
to have it work smoothly.
>> Thank you.
>> Representative Ellen Powell to your
right by the doors is recognized for a
question. Chairman Powell. Thank you.
Will lady Will the lady yield? Yes.
>> Is it not true? I don't have a problem
with your resolution, but I want to I
have a point of inquiry to make. I'm
looking down this list and it's got uh
under my house district and the the
Metropolitan North Georgia water
district, but yet we're solidly in the
Savannah River District. And I want to
be sure that that this is just an error
on here and not what was in the plan.
because while I certainly respect my
friends in the North Metro Water
District, don't throw me in the brier
patch with them.
>> Thank you. And I'm sure that is already
being looked at and you will get the
answer you need.
>> But you would feel you would feel
certain it's not true that we would be
in the Savannah River district, not the
>> I can't speak specifically to that. I
can
if you know you're I know I'm in the
middle Chattanooi district and they
showed me a little bit in the Atlanta
area. So um um that would have to be
verified by EPD director and they're not
present here.
I will do this though to help all of you
who might have a question similar to
that. Here is the EPD's website on
water. It's waterplanning.jorg.gov.
waterplanning.jorg.gov.
I know I'm in the middle Chattahuchi
district ab budding Atlanta. So you
might be looking at um actual areas that
are reflecting a basin as opposed to a
region. I think that's what's going on
there.
Lady has one more question.
Representative Holly to your left is
recognized for a question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentle
lady yield?
>> Yes.
>> Um, is it not true that for certainly um
not only for the conservation of water
are these districts are important, but
also just for supporting the local uh
land and water usage plans for the local
counties? because many times um these
waters and lakes actually have a lot of
biodiversity um that is going back to
even the Paleozoic periods. And so it's
good for just to be able to maintain uh
uh good documentation for those
microorganisms that um are are helping
to actually help uh make sure that the
water in the area remains as it is.
>> Thank you. And I suggest you
contact EPD and say you'd be interested
in helping on one of the councils. This
is a living document is what I'm asking
you to do. It is a responsive document.
If we run into a problem or a concern,
it can be revisited every year. So that
is what makes it so good. Sometimes it's
not easy to make our changes. I've had
some been called awful things through
the years, but Georgia, the state of
Georgia, is the national leader because
we have stepped forward. And even with
today, I had no way of anticipating the
questions or the debates, but um we're
doing it y'all and we're leading the
nation. So, thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
lead yield.
>> We have no further questions. The lady
has yielded well. Thank you for your
work in so many areas of natural
resources and conversa conservation and
especially on water. Is any objection to
the previous question being ordered?
Hearing none, the previous question is
ordered. Is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the adoption of
the resolution? Hearing none, the report
of the committee is agreed to. Shall
this resolution now be adopted? All in
favor of the adoption of the resolution
will vote yes. All those opposed will

Have all members now voted?
All members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk,
will you lock the machine? On the

That completes our rules calendar. We'll
move on. We have a number of afternoon
orders.
In fact, we have a whole slew of
afternoon orders.
I'm going to ask the members to do your
best to hold it down to about a minute
to a minute and a half. There's a couple
of you have requested a little bit more
time and you will have a maximum of two
minutes. There's a couple of you there.
So, we'll um we'll get through our
afternoon orders. Um we'll recognize
for the first afternoon order,
Representative Beckals and
Representative Ford. Few
ladies are recognized for an afternoon
order.
Then we'll have Representative Stacy
Evans and Reps will be on deck.
Representative Beckles and
Representative Ford.
>> Thank you, Speaker. Members, today we
pause to honor the life and legacy of
Aapahol Mayor Wayman Smith. I'm proud to
call Mayor
>> Right. Excuse me. Ladies, suspend.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll stand
with me, please.
>> I'm proud to call Mayor Smith my friend
and my supporter. Since he was the mayor
of my hometown, he was the one of the
first endorsements I sought to when I
decided to run for this seat. He and I
have worked together on various projects
in the past for our little town. But I
will mostly remember our work together
post hurricane Helen along with others
in comm in our community during those 10
days where when we were without power
feeding people, supplying ice, water,
tarps, and other resources just to get
them through this difficult time. He was
always present, committed to serving his
community, never seeking notoriety.
Mayor Smith was a true servant leader,
constantly dedicated to serving the
people, all people. I'm forever forever
grateful for his leadership and for his
service to the town of Arapahal. My
heart goes out to our citizens and his
family as his absence will be felt for
years to come.
On behalf of this body, we extend our
deepest condolences to the Smith family,
the entire South Georgia community who
loved and supported Mir Smith. We thank
you for sharing him with us. May God's
favor, comfort, and peace rest upon his
family and all who mourn. Though his
earthly work is complete, his impact
remains. May he rest in eternal peace.
Can we please have a moment of silence?
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
>> We appreciate the mayor's service. I
think that's one of the coolest names of
any town in Georgia, Lapahal. It's
pretty cool.
Great work. Thank you, ladies. And our
condolences to the family.
Representative Evans and Representative
Gains recognized for an afternoon order.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And if members
of the Athens delegation are here and
want to join us, I invite them up.
Ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to
give you an update. Sometimes we don't
hear about the the good things that are
happening because of legislation that we
passed in 2023. This body passed the
Coleman Baker Act, which Representative
Gaines uh spearheaded and several others
in here helped. And that bill created a
cold case unit within the GBI where
families who had um lingering murder
cases that were still open after three
years could ask for those to be reopened
and for law enforcement to take a second
look. And a law school class made of
mine in the year 2001, Tara Baker was
murdered during our first year of law
school. And because of the Coleman Baker
Act, um a suspect was arrested um about
two summers ago and he is standing trial
this week. Jury selection is going on
right now. That trial will probably last
3 to six weeks. Um but that trial could
not happen and this family could not be
looking at u potential closure without
this body's work. And I just wanted to
let y'all know about that update and say
thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
>> Thank you. Representative
Ali.
Representative Ali.
A gentleman through right there, please.
Thank you, Representative. Gentleman's

Thank you so much.

Chairman Jaspers,
Chairman of Transportation,
>> chair. Now, ladies and gentlemen,
members, you need to pay attention to
this probably an issue that will impact
you either this year or in the near
future, Mr. Chairman.
>> Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And it
this will if you look on your desk, we
put the rules to name a road,
intersection, roundabout, part of a
highway, all sorts of things.
that are state highway.
Now, if you look over here over by the
door, you'll see our new policy analyst,
Danny Nichols, way, way bigger.
She wrote it. She helps you with it. You
need to get to know her if you do this.
But I got a couple of things. You know,
Whit Park brought it up the other day
that were new members and might need to
review a few of these things. And thank
you for encouraging us to do that. A
couple of things. Read the rules.
I mean, you know, we'll have to come
back and tell you that no, you can't do
that. And I'm not afraid to tell you no.
But also
check the background of the person that
you might be uh interested in naming a
road, intersection, or something after
cuz we do. we kind of look and you know
there's nothing more embarrassing than
having that happen to you and we'd have
to tell you no. You know you can also
ask myself, Vice Chairman McDonald, you
know, Secretary Mcllum,
Mr. Prince over here to um can help you
with those. We look forward to helping
you and serving you. It's a it's a real
If you haven't done it, you need to name
a road after somebody important in your
community. And I look forward to helping
our new member, Mr. venture uh name a
road intersection after Mandy Ballinger
soon. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Okay, members, check the rules because
that's an important
important opportunity to honor someone
in your district that's made a
difference. Representative Draper

Give the lady in the will your
attention, please. Representative Draper

>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Uh, so by now you all know that
yesterday the Trump DOJ and FBI
conducted a raid on the Folton County
Elections Hub. They took hundreds of
boxes of documents that contain
sensitive information about Georgia
voters and the original ballots from the
2020 elections. Those documents right
now are on trucks. They are being taken
out of the state of Georgia. They are
going to Virginia. Do not talk to me
about chain of custody or ballot
security if you are not up in arms about
this. I don't have very much time up
here, so I'm going to get right to the
point. This is a full-on attack on
democracy. This kind of federal
interference with the state election
function is completely unprecedented.
The Trump administration has been trying
to get this information on Fulton voters
through civil lawsuits. They have been
trying to get this information through
their pitbulls on the SEB and they have
been trying to get this information
through their lackey on the Fulton
County Board of Elections. They kept
losing. So, they are bypassing the civil
justice system uh with this highly
questionable and likely statute of
limitation barred criminal
investigation. Y'all, it is 2026.
It has been more than 5 years since
Trump lost Georgia, a fact that has been
verified time and time again. And let me
speak directly to the voters of Georgia
who need to understand the significance
of this moment. Yesterday's raid on
Fulton County is not about the 2020
election. It was never about the 2020
election. This is all about the 2026
election and beyond. Let me tell you how
this is going to work. Once they start
investigating Fulton County, they will
say they found something suspicious. It
doesn't have to be real. It just needs
to offer a pretextual justification for
what will happen next. And what happens
next is going to depend on the backbone
and integrity of the people in this room
and rooms like this one. Will this body
>> her time? She will need to finish up.
You got about 10 seconds.
>> Will this bad body pass a slate of bills
that makes voting harder? Will we take
over the Fulton County Board of
Elections? Because I think that's what
the Trump administration wants. They
want to take over Fulton County, which
is not just the largest county in
Georgia, it is the home to Atlanta.
Because if they can take over bright
blue Fulton County, they don't have to
put forward good candidates. They don't
have to compete in the

to the other members that need to have
an afternoon order.
>> Thank you very much.
>> We encourage you to do the right thing.
Chairman Anderson is recognized for an
afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I'm
not an attorney. I'm not an officer of
the court.
I'm not accustomed to, nor do I pretend
to practice the theatrics that may be
involved with that. We talk about the
events yesterday that happened in Fulton
County.
And let me say this first. I have faith
in our justice system. I have faith in
the process that we put together and put
in place in this nation and in this
state to make sure that judicial matters
are handled in the proper way. What did
we see yesterday? It's being
characterized as a raid. It's being
sensationalized in the media. It's being
sensationalized here in this room. What
we saw yesterday was the lawful
execution of a lawfully obtained federal
search warrant that was signed by a US
magistrate court judge.
That's part of the process.
I think back to the last week or two and
look at some of the court cases that
have have been resolved or at least to
some extent resolved in the state of
Georgia. There was one resolved last
week where the Department of Justice had
sued Georgia related to some of the
provisions of Senate Bill 202, our
election integrity bill. One of those
was the state's authority and ability to
take over a county election board.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
dismissed that case on constitutional
grounds. The case was brought on
constitutional grounds. Their dismissal
was for other reasons, but they said
that that that provision of our law that
this body voted on that was signed into
law in Georgia was upheld.
Now, I would be remiss if I didn't talk
about another case that just earlier
this week was dismissed and that was
another Department of Justice case suing
the Secretary of State asking for,
excuse me, asking for unredacted voter
files in Georgia. That case was
dismissed not on the grounds but it was
dis dismissed on the venue.
>> Gentleman will suspend. You have about
10 seconds to complete your remarks.
>> I don't really need it. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
>> Good decision.
Representative Gistler,
there you are. I was looking for you
down. It's recognized for an order.
Representative.
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, this is
my first time speaking from the well, so
I want to say very quickly, uh, thank
you to the body for the warm
>> first time. You take as long as you
want, right?
>> Is that right?
>> I'm kidding. No, I'm kidding. Was
reckoning.
>> All right. I I'll make this very quick.
Um, I I'm rising today. I'm asking for
support for what I think should be a
nonpartisan resolution. Uh, although it
may not come out that way. Um, it's
simply asking this body to reaffirm that
um that current Georgia law prohibits
the Secretary of State from sending
private voter data to the Department of
Justice. Uh, that's it. That's what I'm
asking for. Um, I would appreciate any
support from both sides of the aisle.
Uh, come find me if you'd like to learn
more about it. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative. Good job.
Representative Glaze

Represent Glaze.
ladies recognized.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Pro Tim Jones, members of this august
body. I rarely come to stand before you
to talk about something that is so
burdensome on my heart that relates to
the district I live in and the district
I serve.
But last night I watched something that
none of us should ignore.
318 Willers rolled out of the Fulton
County elections headquarters
filled with voter ballots and related
election materials
seized as a part of the FBI criminal
investigation into the 2020 elections.
That image should give every Georgian
pause
regardless of party ideology or who you
voted for. Let us be clear about the
facts. The 2020 election in Georgia was
subjected to multiple recounts. county
officials, the Secretary of State.
Brad Brad Rothberger,
as well as ultimately our Governor Brian
Kemp, certifying these results. This
process was completed. The election was
settled. And yet today, questions have
been asserted, serious ones. Who is safe
is my question from retribution in a
democracy.
Who, if anyone could face criminal
charges? And most importantly, who does
accountability truly look at and who in
this system will hold and build out and
keep the rule of law in America?
Investigations are not convictions.
Due process matters. Presumption of
innocence matters. No one should be
judged in the court of public opinion.
And no one in office or agency or an
individual is above the law. Georgians
deserve transparency, not theater.
Facts, not fear, justice, not vengeance.
I yield the well.
Chairman Prince is recognized for an
afternoon order.
Chairman Prince. Uh thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and good afternoon, colleagues.

and just to reflect uh just how good God
is. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
