the Senate this year. We've had a successful session and hope we can finish
strong on Friday night. I'm here to ask for Senate Bill 291. It's on the first

weeks ago and I just wanted to come back and ask you to consider putting it on
the floor this week in the house. Okay. Don't see any questions. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Senator Cowden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Only bottom of page three SB 255 deals with the

applies those to city and state government. Okay, thank you, sir. Don't see any
questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
four from the top in the first page House Resolution 368, a study, it's no longer a joint
study committee but a half study committee to research and toxicating cannabinoids, both
the Department of Ag, those in public health and those in the industry all agree that
based on the lack of regulation for anything other than Delta 9,
the lack of clarity in policy, both federally and state,
that it would be a good time to come up with a resolution
on where the legislature stands on these substances.
OK, thanks, sir.
Thank you.
OK, we've got a few little housekeeping measures
need to deal with before we set a calendar. On Senate bill 125, we need a motion to withdraw
the previous room substitute, which was LC-550639S. Have a motion and a second to withdraw
That substitute now will recognize we appreciate to make a motion.

Okay, you have a motion in a second.
You want to explain that?
Yes, Mr. Chairman, there's only one one change in line 47474 and essentially what
the language said was that a plumber could not work within five foot of a
building and in a building and we just clarified that a plumber needs to be
able to work within the building as well as outside the building. It was a catch by
one of our members and we've just changed the language to clarify the plumber's
love to do work inside of building as well as five foot within a building.
