TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
And understanding of exactly what was going on in Cobb County, because you know, some
comments were made the way we do things up here and all this.
If this were Columbus and the Muscogee County School District and all the chaos that goes
on there, I'm very familiar with that, or troop county in Lagrange.
I'm very familiar with that.
So I want to thank your staff, Senator Setsworth's staff, and the best admin anybody could have
her name is Google, for giving me the opportunity to research the history of this situation.
Not only was I able to read the judge's order, but I was able to read the original lawsuit
that was filed in Cobb County, and I'm very happy and pleased to see my good friend, Eric
Allen here today, called Representative Allen.
We came into the Georgia General Assembly together,
became good friends, and he and I have the same feelings
about this as far as the politicalization of school boards.
And when I read that first lawsuit,
I was shocked at how many references
to politics was in there, and sadly,
how everybody was identified by the color of their skin
as opposed to their role or whatever they were doing.
And so, but I have a very clear understanding
of what's going on there.
I wanna thank Senator Setsler for his hard work on this
and providing me information.
I know things about certain types of math now
that they will wake me up crying in the middle of the night,
but I do appreciate everybody getting me up to speed
on the history of what's going on there in Cobb County.
And I do feel that by moving this legislation forward,
we are carrying out a responsibility
that is very clear under the law
in the Georgia General Assembly.
Thank you for the worthy discussion there, Mr. Welp.
Said I do also want to thank Senator Estevez
for giving us more information to be disseminated.
I think each of y'all received an email
and some information in your packet on that.
So Senator Estevez, you have a question?
Yes sir, thank you Ms. Kermit, just a quick question about, and Senator Sessler.
Thank you for sending us some more information.
I just had a question about where that information came from.
Yes, this is a higher staff to help me pull this together.
As you know, we use legislators to develop some level of expertise in these things.
But to make sure that we've got the kind of kind of probity
and preparation that it takes to do this consistent
director's work, I've engaged staff
as much later to help me do that.
A couple of things that did, as you can see,
is the demographic layout provided
for a total population, a voting against population,
to compact this ratings, to be able to look at the bench bar 2012 plan, was proposed
under 2022, which was litigated, and then we proposed plan on how for all those criteria
we've exceeded what was, we've addressed demonstrably the concerns of the court, and then
also for poor attention, the ability to keep the districts more similar, and specifically
address what you raised in our committee here today, in specific districts, specific
populations.
As you know, there's many criteria where you look at race and zone in one of them, so
engage staff to do that.
In fact, a redistribute professional will not need to do that.
has the expertise and is the kind of expert that I think we can be proud of and would expect
to address the judge's order and not make big mistakes.
Thank you, Senator.
I think when my colleague asked for the science and asked for us to use resources from within
this building, we do have experts in this building at the legislative and congressional
Reapportionment Office that you would expect this data to come from, it concerns me that
we would be relying on staffer that essentially had spreadsheets where we have no source of
truth that is paid for and hired by the state.
I haven't been here very long, but I do know that in the past, when these maps and the
data are presented, it's presented with the seal and from data using data that comes
from this office.
These are spreadsheets, and had I known that was the standard that we were going to use,
I would have had a staffer create some charts that I could use to argue that otherwise.
Nevertheless, I do think it's important to point out one that the judges didn't make
specific points that I believe are not addressed by this map.
And two, that there is willingness from both parties to work together to have a map
that all of Cobb, regardless of party, regardless of what you look like where you're from,
Cobb County will be proud of, and I hope that despite the resistance to have those conversations,
that those who are open to those conversations continue to have those, and that we come
to a resolution that is good for everyone in Cobb County.
Thank you, Senator S. Mous, just a little bit of a misunderstanding, because this is
is important if at least the chair very briefly.
You're going to be very, very brief.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
To the gentleman's point, these maps were,
that's before you were generated by a reapportionment office.
In fact, changes were made by a reapportionment office
and technical review, making sure
that you had no anonymity issues.
All of those things to produce the final maps
that was, in fact, produced by a reapportionment office,
as you can probably expect, some of the forensic level
of information to comply with every element raised in the court's order is arguably beyond
the scope of our reapportionment office to hit every single question.
So I think we, I think going to the reapportionment office with something that was thoughtful
and prepared would be what our citizens would expect.
Thank you, Senator Satner.
And I think it's, we have a motion in a second.
Thank you, Mr. Jim.
And then we have a motion by our majority whip,
second by Senator Williams.
All in favor, please signify by raising your right hand favor.
You have one, two, three, four in favor, and all opposed,
and one opposed.
The, that concludes the business of our committee today.
The motion was passed, and I've that reflected in our report.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members committee.
Thank you, Senator Sussler.
So, Dan, hope everybody gets out without getting too wet today.
Have a good weekend.
I'm going to fold count and run to get out of this.
