TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. I'm Harold Jones, the Democratic Senate Memorial Leader and the Georgia State Senate.
And today, we are the honor of actually dropping SB 50. Actually, it's not done on purpose, but it is the carrier of this particular bill.
It is its 50-year also within the Georgia General Assembly. So SB 50 will actually help us close insurance gap that exists in the area of health insurance.
Closing this gap means various things.
Number one, it helps reduce infant and maternal death rates.
Secondly, it also makes sure that working parents
and kids have access to care.
It also will increase access to needed mental health services
building safer and stronger communities.
The insurance gap that currently exists
means that people have to use emergency rooms.
Unfortunately, sometimes even jails,
all sorts of stuff got measures
to actually get health insurance.
Those days will now stop.
500,000 Georgians with the passage of this bill will see health insurance coverage.
And the great thing about this particular piece of legislation still also uses our private
sector.
Because what we take places, the actual funds will be able to be used for private insurance
too.
And that would be key.
It allows for flexibility.
It also allows for innovation.
And those are key things.
Second aspect of this particular bill is that it also will allow for a commission, which
will be five Republicans and five Democrats on this particular commission, to where they
they can actually overlook and kind of oversee
how the insurance program is working.
Once again, basically be it to adapt
to the change in insurance industry that may take place,
change in healthcare industry that may take place.
So you have a situation where you have private sectors
to still actively involve that allows innovation.
And at the same time, you're making sure
that this particular legislation will continue
to grow over the years.
And so 500,000 George will have an opportunity now
to have health insurance.
And that is something that is very meaningful
within this state.
This is our number one legislative priority.
You'll remember that last year,
last session, we actually came one vote short
in regulatory industries from moving that out
to getting into the Senate floor.
We believe this bipartisan piece of legislation,
because we actually do have some Republican signage
for this too.
We believe that this bipartisan legislation
can actually get passed.
And we're gonna work hard to make sure
that actually takes place.
Our agenda this year is based on economics,
pure and simple.
We're gonna make sure that we take care
of our people in Georgia.
One of the other issues that we're gonna be looking at,
of course is to increase the minimum wage
that has not done for many years.
We have to realize that almost 20% of our children
still live below the poverty level with Georgia.
We're gonna make sure that we continue
to push public schools.
We know last year there was a plan
actually to increase vouchers.
We wanna make sure that the public schools
are properly funded.
And then lastly, we also wanna push
to make sure that people can afford childcare.
Those are issues that matter to Georgia's.
Those are the issues that this Democratic caucus
is gonna be pushing.
And we cannot be happier today
to actually have a piece of bipartisan legislation
that will impact over 500,000 people.
And also stabilize the insurance industry,
also stabilize healthcare industry in general
for this particular state.
At this point in time, I want this sponsor of the bill
and there's been many persons who also signed on to it
to come speaking as Senator David Lucas.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This is Medicaid expansion, Georgia is a donor state.
You have Miss McCartle, who's the United States Summit, can put Medicaid expansion in
can take it. Then we ought to be able to do it for half a million Georgia's. We have
a plan that's the governor's plan, which I totally disagree with. It has work
requirements as well as the premiums are high. Medicaid experts will give
hospitals, the greatest, the people. And in a new hospital being built, they
will not be dealing with unculturally uncomplicated care. That's in the
emergency room because folks don't have health insurance and therefore see the
emergency room as their primary care physician. It is time that we stand up and
Georgia across Democratic and Republican rights that not only do we need to
be the one of the dollar state but we need to be one state that benefits from
the money that George put in the pool. We tried it, we found hard for it, but we
have to fight a little bit hard. And hopefully that will some of our counterparts
coming across and joining us to help provide health care insurance for
joy. We have to realize one thing. It's about eating others. See, you got folks who do work every day.
Go to work every day. Take care of family. Pay rent. All more. Drive a clock to get to work. When
And when it comes to expendable income, they don't have it.
Medicaid expansion is not about work, it is about health care.
And that's the reason that we have put our efforts behind trying to make sure that I
have for me and Jordan, can receive health care.
The plan to go to the health, you don't see anybody running the junk.
upon the plane. We spent 29 million dollars. We got about
forty two hundred folks inside, but the premiums are high, and
there is a work requirement. It's time that we, as legislators, see
about the people of Georgia.
And also, as our public also have even here, also with us, there are partners in this
course.
We will, I'm sure we get this done for the State of Georgia, and this time we open up
any questions.
I think that's something that the governor have to deal with. We want to get it to that point. That's the key. We want to get it to that point. I think it's we kind of educate the public. The fact we have bipartisan shit. That's number one. The fact that we know that rural hospitals are closing.
hospitals are closing. And that's number two, that's something that's real. Those are things that
have really happened. Real hospitals actually closing. Now we have bipartisan, but to buy in,
we realize that Georgia actually lags behind the national average as far as doctors are concerned,
also lags behind the national average as far as nurses are concerned, because of the fact that
our reimbursement rates really are not there. I think when the facts are there, and as long as we
are pushing the issue openly, and we are welcome by partisanship, we welcome dialogue, but I think
as long as we're pushing this issue in a good fashion,
we can get the governor on board.
I just believe Pathway is right now.
It has too many logistical issues with it
that will not be at work.
But I think that we can work together on this
and I think that's the key thing.
We're open.
We're open to working with the governor on this.
Without a doubt, we're open to doing that.
And I think that's key.
We all want the same thing, but I believe this mechanism
is the best way to get there.
And that's the path I think we should be taking.
When the governor announced his proposal, Pathways proposals, he made this claim that his
pathway has covered 200,000 more than full Medicaid expansion was.
What was your response?
I think what's happening is basically he's conflating what's called the premium tax credits
that comes from the federal government and actually putting those numbers within there.
I think that's what's taking place if you really look at it.
So what happened is the federal government actually prepared the tax credit.
made access to healthcare a little bit easier,
more affordable, and people who went to the marketplace
on their own.
So you have the private market,
the other marketplace there, the ACN marketplace.
You still on your own could actually access that insurance.
And so people who now had that tax credit,
they were able to access that.
But that's actually a federal program
that actually came from the Biden administration
that he actually has taken credit for.
But I think that's exactly what was taken place.
But as far as pathways itself,
concerns, look at the numbers,
that would not be supported.
So we have a card in summers, Billy Hickman, Russ Goodman, and Sam Watson.
Democrats have some power when there's other legislation that Republicans are not unified on and need Democratic votes.
I'm thinking potentially of the tort reform push from Governor Pamp that we're expecting to see later this week.
What is going to engage on court reform perhaps in exchange for some health from Republicans
on this bill?
They're quite frankly the separate issues and I think they should be treated separately
and that's how we want to be approaching this at this particular point in time.
Right now those are two separate issues but when you start talking about health care
and total fund, here's the difference, health care really should be treated as a right.
So we should not be connected to any kind of other kind of deal, health should be treated
as a right.
is just something that you're trying to bargain
and make it a deal out of.
The third pathway being available in the last year
and definitely has the same application
that we did, you get that in the emergency
or is it familiar with the session?
Yes.
It certainly is added in the sense of urgency,
but the urgency really is not on our part.
The urgency is for the $5,000 figure, not covered.
The urgency basically is for Georgia,
because the fact that when you have this kind of instability
within your healthcare system,
that causes instability all around.
So that's really where the urgency is.
So it's not for us.
We want to build paths, but the urgency is people right now
who today can't get the chosen shirt,
can't end themselves in shirt.
That's where the urgency actually exists.
Arthur?
I saw a hand in that hair.
It was great over here.
You talked about, did you feel like the premiums were too high?
I think that we came up with the premiums and the credits
was like, I did your plan for it.
It differs, but what I say, the premiums,
they're not really necessarily talking about
necessarily the premiums on the government's plan.
One of the issues about the government's plan is
you're basically trying to create a job program
and a health insurance program to combine.
That's really the key part about that plan
that becomes difficult.
It's an administrative nightmare is what it is
because that's exactly what you're doing
because you have to go out of all these different poops
to determine whether a person is working or not working.
They have to do different things to show that.
That really becomes a logistical nightmare of it.
The premiums that will exist, of course,
that's now going to still go into a private instrument
going through private insurance, that is something that would still have to be worked out.
But I think the problem with the government is playing more so as the logistics of it,
because you have your employees trying to be basically persons who are looking at jobs,
but at the same time trying to provide health insurance. Those two should be melted together
in that way. Yes, ma'am? About being in the minority a lot of times it's a number of things,
so you just mentioned those senators, but what would your message be to other Republican senators
to come to your side when it comes to its people? You constituents need your help.
That's the bottom line.
You're constituents near and huge your health.
Georgia needs your health,
because many of those Republican senators
represent those rural areas.
This isn't just a rural issue, it's a Georgia issue.
But certainly those who live in those rural areas
that have hospitals that are being closed
don't have access to almost any medical care.
We even heard talking about legal deserts today.
There's also medical deserts.
This is a real issue.
And so your constituents need you.
That's what my message should be to them.
Is there anything in the cheaper that is driving
I think it's the same issue that already exists and that's what that we have people right now wait the emergency room just to get health care. I think that's the issue.
I think so. I think so. I think we have a good chance because we came so close last year and so that helps that gives you the momentum and that's why we didn't want to lose that and if we had a conversation about that she may not push this absolutely not we have to do a
could state need.
I feel like one of the biggest things that has changed my life here is that the speakers
seem to have close to when they're going to last year.
Talk about that.
Well, you know, under the gold dome, a gnome might mean not now, and one of those are
never really closed.
But Republicans see what we see.
They see that we have 11.7% uninsured here in Georgia.
They see that hospitals have closed.
They see that we have maternal care deserts.
They see that rural communities don't have doctors.
They don't have hospitals.
They see that and they feel that this is an economic issue.
And we have a moral obligation to continue to push it because it is what is right for
the citizens of Georgia.
So I always say, no, may not mean no.
Maybe just not now.
Is it possible that no means not while Brian comes with governor?
Well, you know, governors can be persuadable.
And I think it's incumbent upon all of you all to help us tell this story.
This is Georgia's story of this is the greatest failure of Republican leadership is the lack
of providing access to health care to Georgia citizens.
I heard some of our students from both members of both parties about
is in many cases the concern that maybe the biggest change in the federal government
is that I'm familiar with this and I think that if I happen,
I'll see if I get the direction I'll be changing.
Not being up there is hard to tell, but I will say this.
I think that it's so entrenched now quite frankly,
only 10 states have not done this.
And so we have to look at it from that perspective
to make that kind of change
would affect the majority of states now.
So I feel hopeful that that kind of change
actually wouldn't take place.
But let's wait for that.
Let's continue before that's going to be the key thing.
Anyone else want to say anything?
Thank you guys so much for coming out.
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
