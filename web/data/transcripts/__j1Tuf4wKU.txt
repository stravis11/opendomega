Chair recognizes Representative Clark to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
House bill 54, as passed in the House, it allowed PAs to sign home health services.
And this, the Senate included allowing APRNs, which I totally support.
A few reasons one, during COVID, it was allowed for three years by executive order.
And it really expanded health care, how to speed up the home health services,
when those who needed it, and also where the last state to allow it.
So I fully support it.
It's going to really help rule Georgia and just help health care in general.

Chair recognizes Representative Clark to explain the Senate substitute and the House amendment.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
House Bill 233, as we passed, unanimously had to stop in the sitting kids out of state to these reunification camps.
And the House amendment.
Gentlemen, we'll suspend.
Please proceed.
I've attached the language from House Bill 350.
It made it two rules.
Didn't have enough time to get out on crossover.
Has a special place in my heart.
Back in, I think it was 2018.
It helps rescue babies.
Newborn babies, well women are say being sex-traffited
or going through, they fight their lives on danger
and they need to get the baby to safety.
And it expanded it to fire station,
police stations, hospitals, and all that.
Well, what this allows is a baby box
to where they can place the baby in it.
And then the alone will go off.
And the newborn baby is placed in the box
and then the baby is transported to a medical facility.
And after the baby checks out,
the fat comes within six hours
and takes hold the baby also.
The primary alarm has to be checked once a month.
Twice a day, the box has to be physically checked
to make sure the baby is not in the box.
On top of it, they already have the alarm and all that.
And I'll say, you might have seen it was in front page
in the news and Tennessee.
They allow the same thing, and they'd rescue the baby.
But an amazing program, and it would allow the same thing here.
And seven baby just being left, say, on the ground,
you know, at a police station, and the mom goes,
so it just allows the box, the technology's there,
multiple states allow it, and we'd love to have your support.
I'll take any questions on this.
You have a question.
Chair recognizes Representative Cannon for a question.
Thank you, Madam Speaker.
Do you?
Are you?
I want to first thank you for this subject.
It's something very near and dear to my heart,
as well as a labor doula.
But I do have some questions for you after discussing with some national organizations
about the different ways to do this same type of program.
My first question is online 66.
It says provided that the newborn child is no more than 30 days old.
Has you considered making that up to 60 days old, which is typical around the country?
I know, I remember carrying the bill from back when I carried the bill while we had the 30 days.
A lot of times past 30 days has to do with law and kind of child abandonment or something like that.
And I remember it last.
When I carried in 2018, we had that 30 days because this is that time where usually if a woman is in fear for a life, sex trafficking, she has the baby and she needs to get a baby to safety.
And there's something fun when I remember is why we have that 30 days.
But I mean, I'm open if you wanted to keep something down the road and change it to 60 days.
But I mean, I think 30 days is enough time to where the mother has a child, and she can
drop it off at one of these locations.
But thank you for your question.
Thank you, G.
Further Hill?
Oh, you have one more.
Okay.
And so, the way that this is written, there's an opportunity for someone to surrender a
new born at multiple locations, not just at a fire station, but there's other locations.
Some would consider it to be best practice that those surrenders happened at a hospital,
specifically at an ER, which is what most of the national, or most of the states do.
And so there's no need for the ambulance service.
So my question is, why are we including multiple different agencies creating multiple places
of possible liability instead of just keeping it with that hospital?
Whereas here it says medical facility, what's a medical facility versus a hospital?
I'll say, I mean, I passed, and again, I'm gonna pull up my bill, but it expanded to the locations that's being allowed.
And we've had the data, I mean, I've not seen anything negative come from these different places of letting the baby be dropped off there.
More places, and these places have to be a 24-7 facility, and since the bill that I passed years ago.
help rescue babies and all that. So I felt very comfortable with the language in there
and that it's going to protect babies and keep them safe. Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a question.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Well, gentlemen, heo.
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
Isn't it true that sometimes usually at hospitals and at the fire station all the person
when they're leaving the child actually comes in contact
with either the fireman or the nurse or someone.
And many of these mothers do not want to be identified.
And so what the boxes do is give them a chance
to put the baby in a safe place instead
of leaving them in the woods to the elements,
gives them a chance to live and to be safe.
But the mother doesn't have to identify themselves.
Is that not true?
It is definitely true.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes leader of frustration for a question.
Madam Speaker, brought to you, is gentleman yield for you?
Sir, is it not true that this legislation,
which allows for the protection of babies
for them to be put into care in a controlled environment,
as legislation was worked on by representative Cameron,
very hard, was considered here in this house.
And it's just simply part of your bill here at this late stage of session.
Exactly.
Right in line with my bill and just protecting the babies, protecting the mothers.
And yeah, thank you so much.
Thank you for bringing this bill.
Thank you.
With that, I yield the well and ask you a favorable consideration of House Bill 233.
Thank you.
The gentleman is yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the adoption of the House of Mement?
The chair here is none of the House of Mement is adopted.
On the gentleman's motion, the House agreed to the Senate substitute to House bill 253.
All those in favor will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines.
The
head all members voted.
For what purpose does representative Cameron rise?
Pardon me in the choir state your inquiry isn't treatment of speaker that
During the process of this bill a baby was surrendered at a box just over the border for me in Tennessee and
The it was successful in a fire hall and the baby went through
The hospital and into foster care
Successfully the gentleman knows of which he speaks what purpose does representative Clark rise
Is it not true that I had a question for the speaker and if he doesn't mind do it on
parliamentary inquiry, I'm really curious.
I had a town hall and this issue of Ethan's law came up and there were some family law
people that were concerned about this outlawing the ability to have families reunite in any
type of way. And so I just wanted to get clarification on that. Is that not true Madam Speaker?
I'm sure the lady knows of which she speaks and I encourage her to speak with the original author about that.
Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the gentleman's motion, the yeas were 146.
The nays were 15 and the house has agreed to the Senate substitute to house bill 253.
Members, we have a special guest to the come and join us here in the house, Emily asks Mr.
Doorkeeper, would you uh, Mr. Senator, the governor of the great state of Georgia, the
Honorable Brian P. Kemp awaits entrance to the chamber.
Mr. Doorkeeper, please admit, the governor of the great state of Georgia,
Governor Brian P. Kemp, can give him and admit us into this Georgia House of Representatives.
Welcome, Governor Kemp.
.
.
.
.
Members and guests, if you'll, give me your attention please.
we're certainly blessed here in our state to have a first family. Now I want to
recognize, I know you're going to do it again, at least one of them, but I want to
recognize the best third daughter in the state, Amy Porter Camp. Amy Porter, thank
for being here and the first lady for our state blessed us earlier with her
presence in this chamber. First Lady Marty Camp, you're appreciated in so many
different ways by this house and by the people of this state. Thank you for being so
prerative and so many issues that imported the Georgians and thank you for supporting
our governor.
Let's give a wonderful round of applause to that first lady.
A gentleman that certainly needs though introduction in these parts, he's led this state through
thick and thin, and he's done an outstanding job of bringing good, old-fashioned, common
sense back to the job.
He said it's a pretty good predecessor, and I'll say that as well who excise those same
great qualities.
He certainly has done the same.
We've got a little bit of work for you, Governor.
We've been sending you some bills.
We hope you'll keep that pin sharp, and at least sign the bills that came out of the
House. It's my great honor, y'all. I know it is y'all's will to have the governor of
this state in this house chamber, the people's house, a people's governor, the 83rd governor
of the great state of Georgia.
Governor Brian P. Kemp.
Oh, man.
Thank y'all.
Thank y'all so much.
Happy signing, everybody.
Thank you so much.
I was just thinking when the speaker was talking about keeping
the pins, sharpening the pins up,
I was thinking to myself, they're sharp,
or it's just a matter of which color we're going to use.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Speaker Burns, thank you so much for having me.
Speaker, pro-timp Jones, majority leader,
effustration,
and our leader,
leader, Hugley, members of the people's house.
I, like you all, are honored to have our great First Lady,
Marty Kent with us, and Amy Porter.
Thank y'all for welcoming them so much this evening.
We are very thankful that you have yet again delivered
a historic session for the people of our state.
Since you gavled the session in just 81 days ago,
you have secured another one-time tax refund
for Georgia families fighting through the high prices
they've experienced over the last four years.
You passed a second tax cut acceleration,
which will further help hard work in Georgia and job creators
and save them at least another $725 million a year.
I know we are all proud of the work
and the much needed relief for those that have been devastated by Hurricane Helene.
You also supported legislation to strengthen our workforce
and not only to keep us the number one state for business
but also make us the top state for talent.
And together, we have achieved something
no other General Assembly has done in over a generation,
and that has passed meaningful toward reform.
Now, I know you all know that fight was hard
and the debates were fierce,
but it's my belief at the end of the day
we have a common sense, comprehensive piece of legislation
that will keep our state moving in the right direction.
And while tort reform may have been controversial, and some people may have been for it, and others
may have been against it.
One thing we can all agree on is nobody wanted a special session.
I also want to thank you for your work on getting the FY 2026 budget pass.
Chairman Hatchett, thank you for your leadership, and I know it's a lot of hard work this year,
especially.
Included in that budget there's strategic investments that make our state stronger and further develop our infrastructure
Through those investments the state is doing what we can to keep people working in all parts of our state no matter your zip code
And they're doing this while returning taxpayer dollars to where they belong to our people
I appreciate the strong support in the back of the chamber.
Other states are raised in taxes on their citizens just to make ends meet.
Think about California, New York, and Maryland, just to name a few.
not here in Georgia.
Here in the best state for business and opportunity,
we budget conservatively.
And that's why we're able to make historic investments
without increasing debt,
and are able to give Georgians a third tax rebate,
and cut taxes while we're at it.
Thankfully, much like years passed throughout my second term,
the partnership and thoughtful coordination
between the House, the Senate, and my office
benefited the people of our state and put George on a path to continue prosperity and
opportunity. My hope is that we continue that successful streak which will benefit hard
work in Georgia's most of all. And as this seventh session during my time in office
draws to a close, I want to thank you all for your contributions and your hard work.
I'm already the girls and I are grateful for your service to our fellow Georgians.
Thank you all, have a great rest of the night, and God bless you.
Going or keeping in first family all the
of Wilka, many time in the People's house,
then guarantee it.
All right, House, the House will come to order.
House will come to order.
Members, please take your seats.
Are we going to move on to a little bit more business for the people?
Chairman Lohood is recognized for a motion to give the gentleman in the well your attention, please.
Chairman Lohood.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I move to agree to the Senate sub as amended by the Senate of House Bill 513.
Is that the motion?
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House will 513 be tauted back to amend Article 2, Chapter 70 and tauted on 36.
The fish go to Georgia and tainted related service delivery so as to revise provisions related to county share of funding for jointly funded county wide services.
Okay, members, give the member in the will of your attention.
The chairman of the hood is recognized to explain the Senate's substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members.
This is House Bill 513, a sub that the Senate sent back to us, and what they did was just
to add further clarification to help cities and
counties avoid conflict and keep their citizens safe as they negotiate their service delivery strategy.
Mr. Speaker, I ask for favorable consideration and I'll yield the well.
The gentleman had no questions as he yielded the well.

On the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 163, the nays are two, and the House has agreed to the Senate's substitute of House Bill 513.
Mr. Speaker, I move that this house agreed to the Senate sub to House Bill 645.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 645 to be entitled to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7 of Title 31.
I believe this goes to George annotated, relating to regulations of hospitals and related institutions.
Mr. Speaker, we sent House Bill 645 to the Senate a few weeks ago, and they amended it to provide even more alignment with today's CDC guidelines.
And I asked his house to agree, and Mr. Speaker, if there's any questions, no questions, I'll yield the well.
The lady, Representative Park, Kenan's has a question, the lady's.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, do you?
Yes, ma'am.
Out of which part of the CDC does the information and testing related to COVID-19 and
influenza vaccines arise?
Can you explain your question again?
Ask it again?
Yes, there's multiple departments within the CDC.
And so out of which department do this COVID-19 testing
and influence the vaccines arise?
It's the department that gives recommendations
to loan-crum care facilities.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, has no further questions.
He's here to the well.
On the gentleman's motion to the House agree
to the Senate of men, but to House Bill 645.
All those in favor of vote, yes, all those opposed will vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
Have all members voted.
We have all members voted.
If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine on the Germans' motion?
The yeas are 166, the nasa zero, and the house has agreed to the Senate amendment to House
Bill 645.
Mr. Speaker, I'll be asking the House for an agreeable on House Bill T33, that was amended in the Senate.
Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption?
House no. 233 to be entitled.
NAC to amend Article 3, Chapter 3,
Title 50, the Fisher go to George Annotated,
relating to other state symbols.
So to designate Brunswick stew,
is the official state stew.
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to agree with the Senate's House Bill 233.
The gentleman moves that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 233.
The gentleman's recognized to explain the Senate's substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Section 1, this is the original Brunzick's two bill.
It is added ingredients to the Brunzick's two.
In the extra ingredients include, it makes the 4th Friday, November, National Sugarcane
syrup day, or syrup day in Georgia.
Section 2 is the original Brunswick-Stu bill making official states of Georgia.
We have some great Stu downstairs tonight.
I call it the North Georgia Stu, and they're definitely welcome down there and help us
out down in Brunswick.
Section 3 is cornbread, it's designated as official bread of Georgia, and Section 4, who
was added also by the Senate.
Well, basically, it's the four-country concerns
such as China.
And this closes the gap of the third-party seller
with the state agency for goods or services,
included but not limited to contract procurement
or purchase of computers, printers,
and other types of video conference services
in connection with the office environment.
This was approved unanimously by a partisan effort
in the Economic Development Committee in the Senate.
Also proved by partisan effort in the Senate as a body where I think we had one no vote as it is with the standing bill as it's red now.
So again, thank you for your favorite consideration.
Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions about the Brunswick's to House Bill to 33.
Gentlemen, has a couple of questions.
Yes, sir.
We'll excuse me.
Leader Hewgley has recognized for a question.
Give the leader your attention, police.
She has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
Yes, ma'am.
I understand about these ingredients
and the stew you got, but this last thing you put on here
about these beets for goods and services.
Yes, ma'am.
Help me understand how that goes with it.
This is basically same title code.
This also helps close a loophole
where third party vendor possibly could have gotten a contract
from a foreign adversary.
Would you agree it might be the same cold
but a different subject matters?
The way we looked at it in the Senate approached it
and we approached Let's Council,
it seemed to all fit together, ma'am.
June, I'm gonna take another question.
Representative Sanchez.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna ask for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I would like to invoke rule 111 to ask for the
germainness of this amendment.
I don't know how cornbread and it's brought to us to have to do with foreign adversaries.
So have we have a question on the
germane this on the last section
he discussed and I'm the chair is
going to rule us in this for two
reasons. Number one, learned
council, legislative council who
rely on has advised that it is
germane. It's in the right place
because it's in the right code
session so chair is ruling that it
is germane. Gentlemen has new
further questions. Thank you, Mrs.
Mr. Speaker, and I ask for your favorable consideration.
Thank you.
All in the gentleman's motion that the House
agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 233.
All those in favor will vote yes, those opposed.
We'll vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
have all members voted.
All members voted, if so.
If so, Mr. Clerk, where you lock the machine, all the gentleman's motion,
the yeas are a one-thirty, the nays are a fifty-one of the house as agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 233.
Yeah, just right down there, they're making the motion, they do, but they're all in help and they're all in public health.
And then I'll read them in that order and we'll just get them.
That's cool.
We have a whole slew of afternoon orders, I'm going to break them up and recognize a couple
of people to bring an afternoon order now, you have a couple of minutes max for your afternoon
order. Representative Townsend. Are you ready for an afternoon order? Give the
gentleman your attention please. This has an afternoon order. Representative
Townsend's recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you Speaker Burns. I want to
thank a couple young men here. They traveled from Georgia College. Mr. JT. Marsh
and Harrison Edwards for doing a great job.
JT was just elected to office with the National Republicans.
And so we're proud of him, both our college students
have helped out and met him through the Ken Vance.
We're really proud of those young men
believing in the political process
and learning about both sides of the issue.
So again, JT Harrison, thanks for being at the Capitol
and you're the future of Georgia.
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Rees and members of the Gwinnett delegation, Gwinnett delegation, if you'll
come down for it.
Thank you Speaker Burns.
You know what's the spin?
Give them a minute to get down.
Yeah, when that delegation, happy bunch, you got one more coming over here, Representative
Descora, yeah, gentleman's recognized.
Speaker Burns members of the House I have two resolutions from our
Gwinnett delegation. The first is Oligar University of India. They have an
Alumni Association in Atlanta. They're having a picnic tomorrow in Gwinnett
County to wrap up Ramadhan. We have a resolution honoring them. They do
interfaith medical missions along with Mercy University and a lot of good
cultural things around Georgia. So join us in commending Oligar University
the alumni of Atlanta.
And then secondly, we have a resolution
for the Pain Corley House in Duluth.
This is a historic preservation that was done
by five business women, Judy Burrell, Jane Wilson,
Margie Ross, Emma Devers, and Annette Summer Hour.
It's been a wedding venue for years.
It's now under ownership of Jen and Alex Kim.
Andy Kim works with them and they are doing a great job.
There's a florist that is sprung out of that house,
but it is a perfect example of business women
doing historic preservation and doing great business
in Georgia.
So let's commend the Pain Corley House in Gwinnett County
as well.
Woo!
Thank you.
Thank you.
I yield the well.
Thank you.
You got some friends with you, too, don't you?
Representative Derek Jackson and some friends.
Gentlemen, hold on just for a minute.
Let's get some folks up here and kind of clear out for you.
Members, if you're standing in front of the podium there, you need to move.
Y'all want to split up on each side?
Yes.
Representative Jackson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I know earlier we recognized Dr. King,
but we wanted to come up again because we want to give
a moment of silence.
Dr. King was not just one who lived his life long.
He was assassinated.
And so we would like to do a moment of silence,
because Dr. King made it profound.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Dr. King made a profound contribution to the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 to 1968,
advocating for racial equality, justice, and for the right to vote through non-violent
protest.
His leadership in events like the Montgomery bus boycott,
the March on Washington,
helped lead to significant legislative victories,
such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
and the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
which dismantled institutional segregation
and secure voting rights for all,
including African-Americans.
Today, his work continues to serve as a foundation
for defending the rights he fought so hard to secure
in the face of current challenges,
including attacks on voting rights and civil liberties.
And so we want to offer up this moment of silence.
Some of us, myself, and representative,
I'm gonna say Teddy.
Teddy Reese, we are members of the same fraternity
that Dr. King was, and that's Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity incorporated.
So just a moment of silence on our late beloved brother.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Jackson.
Representative Matthew Eck.
I don't think he's on the floor that you need to hold up or can you go ahead and
Do you need to hold up or can you go ahead?
The lady's recognized what she thinks is, there he is.
Give the lady your attention please.
I didn't mind the answer.
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chairman Bonner and I this evening would like to honor somebody from Fayetteville who was
a constituent of mine but a long time resident of Fayetteville.
Well, we're honoring Miss Nancy Nell Spier's Tarlano for other purposes as well.
She was born May 1937.
Her parents Herald and Gertrude Spier's Nancy was born and had to wear glasses as a baby.
So this helped her shape her studious personality.
She graduated from Julian Catholic High School in Dayton, Ohio, and was recognized for her
scholastic abilities, becoming the second female to graduate with a Bachelor of Science
Degree from their prestigious chemistry department.
Whereas, well at the University of Dayton, she was selected by her mentors to be one of
the two students in the cutting edge development research
department with rare earth metals, a groundbreaking process
of which you can imagine back then how important that was.
She met her husband, John, also at Dayton University,
and he earned his Bachelor of Science in Physics
before attending the Ohio State University.
Nancy was one, she was one of the first stay-at-home moms
in 1960.
And she helped form chemical abstract services,
which was an applied chemistry degree,
nomenclature and chemistry.
Whereas she was raising her daughter's Maryland and Sharon,
She contributed to those chemical compounds,
and later her third daughter is our own Karen Pope,
one of our great lobbyists here at the house.
So whereas she later served as a chemistry and math teacher
at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Berk, Virginia,
and she was hardly regarded in participating
in sports activity before retiring with her education.
So, where is, now we resolve at the House of Representatives that the members of this
body honor Miss Nancy Nell Spires-Turlano for her pioneering achievements in science
and education, her unwavering dedication to her family and her enduring legacy of excellence
as well as extended their best wishes to her continued health and happiness.
Thank you, House, we appreciate it.
Thanks, Judge.
The ladies, you're the well.
This lady's a little quiet, so y'all need to quieten down.
The next,
we'll represent Betty Stenson's recognized
for an afternoon order, please.
Give the lady your attention.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House,
I ask that you please rise and with me,
as I honor their beautiful life and legacy
of mother Lula Mae Raleigh, she's on the screen.
Mother Lula Mae Raleigh was 94 years young
when God called her home to glory November 23rd, 2024.
Mother Raleigh was a mother to 12 children
and many, many adopted children
with yours truly being one of them.
She was the true love of my life,
and I will forever cherish the many, many moments
and times that we shared together,
riding with me up and down House District 150.
And she was a songbird of Butler, Georgia, Taylor County.
She would often go to all of the churches
throughout Taylor and several surrounding counties.
And Mr. Speaker, she was famous for her song.
Don't let the devil ride.
Because if you let him ride, he'll want to drive.
And another song that everyone loved to hear her sing was
Just a little prayer is good to say.
Just a little prayer will help you long your way.
Just a little prayer will give you peace of mind.
It's mighty good to say a prayer sometime.
Miss Lula Mae Riley, you're forever bein' our hearts
and our minds and I love you forever.
Just a little prayer is always good to say.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, colleagues,
for joining me and honor the beautiful life
of mother Lula Mae Riley, the songbird of Taylor County.
Thank you.
Great lady.
Two beautiful ladies, members, if you remain standing.
Thank you, Representative Stetson.

members of a public servant in her district.
Give lady your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I wanted to get up this evening and pay tribute
to the Mayor Pro Tem of the city of Idleia, Mr. John Raymond
Turner, who passed away this Wednesday.
Mr. Turner was a faithful public servant for four decades
in Idleia and Tooms County.
And his lost leaves avoid in the community
that will not be easily filled.
I met him when I was the chair of the Tooms County Republican Party,
and he was the chair of the Tooms County Democrat Party,
and we spent hours and hours together at the Elections Office
watching them open absentee ballots.
And immediately I recognized that this was a man
of conviction, quiet strength, and kindness
that I will not forget.
He survived by his sweet wife, Ms. Lilly, their son Keith,
and their extended family.
And I just ask you off, you please join me
in a moment of silence and remember it's
of Mr. Turner.
Thank you, colleagues.
Mr. Speaker.
A good man.
Excuse me.
A good man.
Representative Tranna, you're on the floor.
Here he is.
If y'all remain standing.
Representative Tranna's recognized for remembrance.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Nicodemus, who lived in Dunwoody for over 40 years,

And so we can take a minute for a moment of silence.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Tran.
We're gonna take a break.
Well, she's not here, so we gotta do, okay.
So let's do this.
How about Representative Chaz Cannon?

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We appreciate everyone participating
in the Sportsman's Caucus Raffle.
We raised a record amount of money for the caucus.
I want to announce the results of the drawing.
Unfortunately, the Senate won the first prize,
but our own Rick Jasper's won the second prize.
So thank you to Rick Jasper's.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I appreciate it.
I didn't win, buddy.
Representative Hilton recognized for an announcement.
Excuse me for an afternoon order.
I apologize, my bad.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Some people say on Wednesday I jinxed us,
but tonight I feel confident
because the Braves have an instrumentable 3-0 lead
and the top of the fifth that are on their way
to their first win of the season.
Join me in cheering on the Atlanta Braves
as they bring home the first home win.
Thank you, Miss Speaker.
If they don't win tonight, you're at big trouble.
Is the, yes.
Representative Kendrick here recognize ladies and gentlemen
members of the house. I think you're like this one. We don't end this one on a happy note.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good evening colleagues. If you celebrate a wedding anniversary

married to her sweetheart from Columbus, Georgia. She cut a spending anywhere else, but she
He is spending her anniversary here with us.

I believe Roberts is recognized from all people.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I promise to be very brief.
My aunt is turning 80, and we are celebrating her birthday
tomorrow in Rocky Bay, Georgia.
And my mom turned 78 on Wednesday, and I just
wanted to wish them both a very, very happy birthday.
Thank you.
Members, we have a little procedural situation we'll take care of here.
We have a number of bills that need to be first read and assigned to committee.
What I'm going to ask you to do is allow us to wave those rules as we would normally
do instead of reading each one individually.
I just remember making a motion, I'm going to allow the clerk to read them all and make one motion and assign them to committee.
Does that make sense?
Members, we have a total of 13 bills that will be assigned to committee and we will
suspend the rules as normal, but we'll just read them individually as a group and then assign them.
So Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to a group of bills and then we will assign them to committee individually, starting with the first one.

Members, I know we have a lot of guests in here, but we will conduct the business of this house.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, the Senate amendment is really limited.
It only operates in three specific areas.
The first is that for historic tax credits where participants are already in the queue to
receive them. Originally the bill passed in the house allowed those folks in line for
27, 28 and 29 to be available to come to the front of the line, not replace anyone.
Now it's just limited to 27 and 28, so 2029 is out. The second thing is previously this
applied only to a limited area, 10 mile radius, which would include the city of Atlanta.
That part is also out now, so it would have statewide applicability.
And third, for tax credits utilized for 2027 and 28, first, the certificate of occupancy
must be by July 1st of 26, not the end of the year.
And it would be 90% or 90 cents on the dollar for tax credits utilized in 27 and 85 cents
It's on the dollar for tax credits utilized, wind in line for the 28.

The official go to Georgia and Senator relating to public school property and facility so as to provide for an outdoor learning space flag private program.
This bill I refer to the Committee on Education and Committee recommends that this bill do pass by Rules Committee Substitute.
The representative HONG is recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
SB 148 has several components, I'll go pretty quick.
Section 2 will establish a pilot program for the development and study of outdoor learning spaces on elementary and secondary school property.
Section one was Representative Chas Cannon's bill, HB 451,
which gave authority to local board of education
to provide instructions in hunting safety
for grade six through 12.
That was passed out of the floor.
Section three is Chairman Hawkins, HB 629,
which was passed out of committee.
And that will, that requires at least one functional automated external defibrillator
on site at K through 12 schools.
And then the last section is HB 127 of Representative Brent Cox's bill,
which was passed out of the House floor.
And that will allow teachers from using their sick leave
and it extends it from three to five days
of their sick leave for personal and professional reasons.
I'll take any questions, Mr. Speaker.
There's a couple.
No, there's one.
Then we do have a couple of speakers.
I'm gonna recognize representing Jasmine Clark.
Members, tone it down just a little bit, represent the clerk.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, just a generality yield.
I do.
Thank you for the bill.
I'm just curious, what LC number are you?
It's LC-61-0264-S.

It should be on your desk.
I didn't I don't think some of the other rows check and see if that bill is on
your desk you have it no it's not in here there's some of you over here on my
right have the bill some of them having on the front rows that represent
Holland do you have it back that far this I have it I have LC 33 something in
our folders, I don't have any, because I was trying to follow along and I wasn't seeing it.
I think what happened, the committee's subs are being passed out now.
The uncontested resolutions kind of slowed things down a little bit.
on getting information passed out, so we'll pause as anyone that needs a copy needs to let us know you need a copy.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Couple copies.
There's some copies down front.

Well, suspend just for a moment.
Rep thing, huh, let's kind of get a little bit of order in here.

We continue to have legislations that is very important to some Georgians.
Is everyone now have a copy?
Okay, Rimsley Hall, ladies recognized.
You have no further questions.

I'll take one more question.
You have no further questions.
Oh, my God.

Then I ask for your favorable consideration.
I yield the well.
We do have a couple of speakers.
I'm gonna allow you three to five minutes.
Three sounds really good to me.
We're going to start with a teacher representing McQueen.
This recognized speech of the bill.
Give the lady your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise today in strong support, or this evening,
in strong support of the House Substitute to Senate Bill 148,
a thoughtful and forward-looking piece of legislation
that takes meaningful steps to support student health
in rich classroom experiences
and give educators a little more of the flexibility
and respect they deserve.
This substitute does three important things,
and every one of them moves us closer to a healthier,
more supportive and more effective school environment.
First, this bill creates a pilot program
for outdoor learning.
This is more than a nice idea.
It's backed by research.
Outdoor learning has been shown to improve student focus,
mental health, physical activity,
and engagement, especially for younger learners and students who don't thrive in traditional
settings. In the wake of the pandemic, we learn just how valuable fresh air and flexible
environments can be. This pilot gives Georgia a chance to explore outdoor learning as
a practical, scalable tool, not just a trend. We're not mandating, we're learning, we're
piloting a program, evaluating outcomes and giving districts the ability to innovate
in ways that support both academic achievement and student well-being.
Second, this bill makes a smart change to our AED requirements.
Currently, Georgia Law requires a licensed physician to be part of an automated external
defibrillator AED program.
This substitute removes that requirement, aligning us with best practices in other states.
Why? Because AEDs are designed to be used by lay persons in emergencies. They're accessible,
automated, and intuitive. By removing unnecessary retake, we make it easier for schools,
athletic programs, and community spaces to expand life-saving access without waiting on paperwork
or costly oversight. Third, and I want to speak directly to my fellow educators and school leaders
here. This bill increases from 3 to 5, the number of accumulated sick leave days that teachers
and school staff can take each year for personal or professional reasons, what teachers normally
call personal days. This is small on paper, but it's big and practice. Huge. Our teachers
are juggling more than ever, overcrowded classrooms, emotional strains, second jobs, and family
responsibilities, giving them two additional days to take care of themselves, their families,
or their professional growth is not just about time, it's about trust. It says, we see you,
we value you, we know you need space to be your best. It says we want to retain great teachers,
not just recruit them.
So what do we have here in SB 148?
A pilot that supports students mental and physical health,
a common sense health policy that could save lives,
a practical change that tells teachers their time matters to.
These are smart, modest, bipartisan changes
that collectively make a meaningful difference.
I commend the House Education Committee
for their work on this substitute,
and I urge my colleagues to vote yes
for student well-being, for educator dignity, and for a future of thoughtful innovation in Georgia schools.
Thank you, and I yield the well.
Ladies, yield the well.
Rep. Ramon, three to five, please.
Ladies, recognize.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I rise in support of Senate Bill 148.
There are incredible sections in this bill, but I wanted to focus
particularly on section three, which deals with defibrillators,
which I will not have a prop today.
So I want to talk about why defibrillators in schools
are so important, because this is a life-saving measure.
And I want to just go through some statistics with you all
about what this can actually do.
So it's hard to think about a child having a cardiac emergency.
But the reality of the situation
is that sudden cardiac arrests
actually strike 7,000 children and teenagers every single year.
And while sudden cardiac death among student athletes
has prompted a drive to equip athletic facilities with AEDs,
research has found that sudden cardiac arrest
occurs more often with school-aged non-athletes.
So you would think, oh, it's just athletes,
but in reality, and just put on the field
or with sports or whatever,
But the reality is that it's actually the non-athletic kids.
The other reason this is so important
is because about 70% of students
survive sudden cardiac arrests, which
is more than seven times the overall survival rate
for school-aged children.
And that's specifically because a child's survival rate
is estimated to decrease by 10% every passing minute
until a shock from a defibrillator is applied.
The reality in situation is that time is crucial
during these emergencies.
And when it comes to a child, sometimes waiting for an ambulance,
waiting for the emergency medical personnel to get there,
takes way too long.
Not only that, but we're also talking about the teachers
that work in those buildings, right?
So in addition to saving students' lives,
we're also talking about staff that work there,
admin, teachers, you name it.
The reality is that out of hospital,
sudden cardiac arrests is a leading cause
of death in the United States to the point
that it claims the lives of approximately 356,000 people
per year.
That's awful.
And so today, I mean, I know this is a great bill.
It's a Christmas tree bill.
It's got some requirements in here.
But the reality of this situation
is this actually one of my favorite types of legislation,
because it literally will and can save lives.
And I'm incredibly grateful to the authors
for bringing this forward and making sure
that we are doing all that we can
to keep our kids safe and healthy.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the one.
The lady has yielded the well leader illustration.
Leader illustration is recognized as big to the bill.
I just want to commend the legislators that worked on the language that ultimately is reflected here in SB 148 bills that are providing this comprehensive piece of legislation underscoring our commitment to enhance educational experiences and ensure the well-being of our students.
And I want to thank Representative Cox and many members in the chamber who made contributions to this terrific bill.
Ms. Speaker, I'd ask the body's favorable consideration.
I yield the will.
The gentleman's yield is well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Here he none the previous question is ordered, is there any objection with drawing to withdrawing
the committee's substitute?
Here he none the committee's substitute is withdrawn, is there any objection to adopting
in the substitute offered by the committee on rules.
Hearing none, the Rules Committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee,
which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the committee is agreed to, shall.
This bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill.
We'll vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
All members voted.
All members voted, all members voted.
All members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?
On the past, just sent a bill 148, the yeas, 165, the nasa zero.
The bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority.
Is there for past?
Chairman Powell is recognized for a motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I ask the House agree to the Senate's substitute as amended by the House.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption?
House Bill 651 to be entitled, an act to amend Article 2, Chapter 14 and Title 40 that
to go to Georgia and tentative related speech detection devices, social revised provisions relative to the use of automated traffic enforcement, safety devices, and schools others.
Chairman Powell is recognized to explain this substitute and the House amendment, Chairman Powell.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen, you got before you a couple of documents.
I want you to look at the first document I'd like you to look at is the Senate
stuff to house to house bill 651. You know back several weeks ago we were
trying to share this problem on these school zone cameras that seemed to have
been getting so far out of hand over the last several years. It became quite
Franklin will be very blunt they became a got you to they had ceased being a
public safety to and it was a revenue generator and most people's opinions
for those local jurisdictions we sent a good bill over to the Senate and I
guess I need to tell you a little bit about the process we sent two bills
over. 651, they did a thorough cleanup of this whole actions. Representative Washburn
sent over one that basically banned them. There have been a lot of things that transpired
the public safety committee in the Senate wouldn't hear the bills. It cost, there was
some blood on the floor over there from that. And then these things got amended. Representative
The Washburnsville, they basically did a long time extension to do all of them three years,
which doesn't cure the problem.
They took House Bill 651, and I'm just going to go through the changes that they made,
and then I will go through the changes we put back in.
In section one, they took out the speed indicators.
You may remember that I talked about the flashing signs with those speed indicators like
radar so that people would know how fast it would drive and that would slow them down.
They took that out.
In section 2, well the good thing they left in section 2 was a 10 mile variance that we
now have that that's treated the same way as radar with a 10 mile variance.
In section 3, section 3 they added language that dealt with the violations
and complaints to the Department of Public Safety and GDOT, especially on intentional violations.
In Section 4, this was a hearing process for those governments.
Section 5 was the appeal process.
Section 6 was the opt-out by the officials if they were violating, but also they changed
the time.
If you remember, when this bill left the house, it was two hours in the morning, an hour
before an hour after school took in, an hour before an hour after it let out an afternoon.
And what the Senate did was that they did it from one o'clock, from an hour before until
an hour after, and the local governments could run these all through the day.
If they wanted to opt out of any time, they had to opt out.
Now, we'll get back to that, the changes that we made in the amendment in just a second.
One of the things they did was they dropped the fine, where we had dropped it from the
extra 25, we dropped it to 125, they had dropped the fine, total fine to $75, with a 5%
charge and that would dump suspecting their idea, that was to mail out the notice on these.
So that's a $75 fine and a $3.75 cents, 5% surcharge for sending out the notices.
Where we had taken out the Department of Revenue Lean, they put the lean back in.
Those were a lot of the changes that they made and took it out.
Now what I'm proposing, and I want to thank a few folks, I want to thank the Speaker's
Office for mediating this, quite frankly, the Lieutenant Governor was adamant that they
wanted to be able to run school cameras from before school until afternoon at the behest
that the local officials what they thought was needed.
If you'll look on the first amendment
that starts on line 14,
what we have done is that we have said
that they will put those speed indicators back on these signs.
So what you'll see, we've gone back to their original language
with the flashing signs,
but they'll have those radar indicators
that says how fast you're running.
So that's in there,
they agreed to that tentatively. Then we get into the hours. That starts on
lines 22 to 41. It defines only on the school day. That's not weekends and
that's not any other time. And it's kind of the way this is construed. It's kind
of difficult to read. But what we have done is we have said that the cities will
have to opt in. If they don't pass an ordinance by a resolution of the city
Council to opt into the extended day, then it would be from the two hours in the morning
and the two hours in the afternoon. If they want to carry through those other hours, they've
got to stand up and look at their citizens in passing ordinance to say we want to do this
throughout the day. If you look on lines 42 through 47, this deals with the four lanes
that they had taken out. And that's quite simple that if they're going to run, if it's
going to be allowed to run these devices on a four lane, it has to be where there's a crosswalk.
No more of this stuff like up at Tallula Falls where you got a four lane running out in the
middle of nowhere and they just, you know, there's no crosswalk. So on a four lane, there's got to be
a crosswalk before these things would be eligible. You get on line 48 to 53. This is the notice of
of a citation. They did leave that in. And the citation just says,
failure to pay this, fail this, this final contested liability in
court shall result in the inability to renew your motor vehicle
registration. You go down to the next line. And since they had
put it back into the department of revenue for lean. And what we
have said in here that they'll send out a second notice to
notify the public in bold letters,
failure to pay this final contest liability in court
within 30 days,
show results in the inability
to renew your motor vehicle registration.
Line 67 through 76 is the language we changed
and their version,
they had all the money going to the local police.
They could do that for whatever their purposes.
We have put the language back in that any of that money needs to go to school safety
within that district and to be used for school safety purposes.
Those are the changes.
This is the amendment.
I would tell you that it is not the best thing that we were hoping for, but I will tell
you that when we leave here an hour or two, if we don't pass something that it remains
the same.
It's still just a wide open. Go at it. This is a I think with those flashing speed
indicators I think with the 10 with the 10 mile an hour variance. I think that
with all the proper due diligence of notice I think that this is going to be a
workable solution and then when we come back if things are still not that way
then we'll be able to deal with it again but I continue to tell you that this
This is a path to putting this back as a tool for school safety.
Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to answer any questions, if that wasn't clear enough.
That was pretty clear.
As mud as they say, no, that was good.
You did a nice job of informing the members.
And if they'll get a little bit quiet, there's a couple of questions that the questions they want to ask.
I'll recognize some members for some questions,
but I want you to be able to hear them.
Gentlemen, you need to vote for a question.
Yes, sir.
Ripley Bayes more is recognized for a question
to your left.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Yes, ma'am.
Does the chairman yield?
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
On page 2, line 25.
Are you on the amendment?
Is this AM 390495?
Yes, that's the amendment.
Yes, right.
Line 25.
Should it actually say of 10 miles per hour over the posted,
says, posted the speed limit?
What we have done is that we have synchronized all
this language for the ten mile an hour variance. So if it's opposed to 20
miles and that means 30 miles. Where it says over posted law should it say over
the posted? Ma'am, I didn't write it. That's legislative counsel and they
certainly write different than we do. Okay. It's put an error that needs to be
I don't think it's an air legislative council wrote this language.
I know it was poignant.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, do you owe for another question?
I certainly will.
To your left, Representative Niel?
Do you recognize for a question?
Does it, gentlemen, do you?
Gentlemen, do you?
Yes, ma'am.
9-48, 353, 48.
I know it.
9-48, 353, so one major issue that my citizens had, one, was the issue of the tags,
motor vehicles being the inability to renew your motor vehicle registration.
The second issue we were having is the fact that we have so many erroneous tickets being issued that there is actually no recourse, you can't hear me, okay?
The issue what I'm having is what 49 to 53 been put back in is the fact that it feels like we're going back to creating and sitting in the same problem we were trying to alleviate because by the time you get the ticket, whether it's erroneous or not,
time and hit your vehicle registration.
When you try to call those numbers,
you have no recourse in the courts.
You're still forced to just pay your ticket
and a lot of people in my communities,
they just have to pay all the tickets,
whether they get a recourse or not,
just because they need their car.
So that's what we're trying to fix.
I think they asked you a question.
The gentleman asked that.
Yes, go ahead.
As I understand, this was the language.
It was in the first bill that has been changed in lines,
But it says a failure to pay, this is that first one you're talking about on those lines,
that's the notice that you get when there's been a violation.
This says failure to pay this fine or contest the liability in court shall result in the
inability to renew your motor vehicle rent.
That is the notice that you have received the citation.
Then below that is the next notice that if you have not paid the citation and then before
where it started over to the revenue department,
that's the next site, that's the next notice,
but you'll notice it will don't play.
Right, well, if it's erroneous,
you don't have a right a way to cure it
because you don't get the option
of having the court process
because of the way it's just simply structured.
And I feel like, is it not,
have we bremedied that?
I feel like we have not bremedied that problem.
And this is what was hammered out with these folks when you look at the other language
in there, that this is the notices on that.
I mean, when you had it, and I remember when we brought this bill before, but I brought
this bill before, that people who contested once they called the court if there was something
that was not right like the hours or the speed, then they contested it most of the times
they were dismissed. Okay, thank you.
Okay, members.
We still have some work to do. The other chamber
doesn't have any work to do.
We're working for the people of Georgia. You can go home if you want to.
But I'm going to stay here and ask the members of this chamber to take care of the people's
business.
We were all elected by the people of this state.
to come to this place and take care of issues that sometimes we disagree on and those that
we agree on, but always with what's in those folks' hearts as what's best for Georgians.
And I trust that for each and every member in this body.
Now, if you're on this floor and you're not a member, you need to tone it down because
this house has some work to do.
And hopefully we can agree on the work we have left if we don't, that's what this house
does.
But we're going to move forward.
So members, give the gentleman into well your attention.
If the folks asking questions to understand the proposition before respect they deserve.
The other side can adjourn and go about their business, but this house is going to tend
to the people's business because this is what?
The people's house.
The city of Bennett is recognized for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, with a gentleman of yield.
Yes, ma'am.
I just need clarification.
Thank you for your thorough explanation.
It was kind of challenging to read and listen at the same time.
Isn't that true that this bill started out being about cameras and school zones?
Is that now removed?
And school safety, yes, ma'am.
So the cameras have been removed online 24 where it says using photographically and photographically has been stricken, recorded images.
What other kind of recorded images will there be?
They have not been removed.
They have not been removed.
They have not been removed.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Representative Petrie, Chairman Petrie to your left has recognized for a question.
Thank you Mr. Speaker just Mr. Chairman do you yield yes sir Chairman
I just want to make sure I'm clear obviously this measure is not what we
wanted and have worked for for several years I appreciate the great work you've
done but am I correct in on line 78 so all these funds are only now to be used
for school safety purposes within schools is that correct sir that is correct
thank you Mr. Chairman for all your efforts thank you
Chairman Dickey is recognized for a question.
Does Jim and you like Chairman Petry I appreciate your work and I know it's I'm all for compromised
with our friends across the way but isn't it true that this bill really doesn't solve
our problem with these coozone cameras and I think they're in all of my counties, all
five of my counties and this is one of the number one issues I hear and this bill
just does not change things in my opinion but I appreciate your work on it
I appreciate that Mr. Washington's work on this but I intend to vote against
this amendment I just think it does not do the job it needs to be doing and
thank you though for the way it worked well I thank you and as I said there's a
a lot of things in here that will tell these bad to being a tool instead of the
gatchy tool that's been used and it's all we've got. Now I might this may be a
fitting time to say this and I want to tell the people in this house how proud I am
I want to tell the members of this house how proud I am that you're still sitting in here and I understand that the Senate has already signed a dad.
I want to thank Legg Council, I want to thank Haley and the governor in the Speaker's Office.
I want to thank the Speaker, Chris Riley, and all those folks who intermediated a compromise
with the Senate.
A lot of y'all have heard by opinion over the years about the Senate and how I think so much
that you told us ahead it right when they had a unicameral body of the legislature.
But we're here doing the people's business as the speaker had said.
This was a solution.
It wasn't a perfect solution by any means.
But it moved us forward to take the get you out of public safety only in regard to these
schools.
Now, if this house votes in favor of this, which I certainly hope you will, it'll probably
have no meaning since the Senate's already took off. But I want you to know how proud
I am of everyone in here for standing by to pass something even when there's a hollasuit
across the hall.
General Yeofer, one or two more, I certainly will. A gentleman has spent a lot of time
working on this proposition, recognizing representative Washburn for question.
Give the gentleman your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Baker, there's a chairman here.
I certainly will.
Mr. Chairman, is it not true that you have devoted many hours of time and energy along with
The speaker staff to try to come up with a bill that would rain in and correct many of
the abuses that have occurred with the school's own cameras across the state.
Is that not true?
The gentleman is correct and I thank you for that.
Another question, will you yield for another question?
Certainly will.
Is it not true that this has been a joint effort along with me with another bill to try to
do something to correct these abuses in the state?
certainly has and as I had said earlier, I appreciate you because of the position you've
been in in the Macon-Bibb County area where this has probably been one of the most prevalent
abuses in the world.
So I thank you for your motivation to get involved into this.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, you are for another question.
Be glad to.
Representative Evans to your left.
Representative Stacey Evans, recognize for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield over here?
Yes, ma'am.
Since the Senate has decided to go home
and you just mentioned, since we're amending what they did,
I guess it says.
And I know you've worked on this so hard
as have so many others, and this is a problem.
I mean, is there any interest in at least taking
what they did so that we could have final passage
of something?
No ma'am.
I thought I'd ask.
I do not think that the substitute that they passed
has my good friend from Ford Valley had said that this isn't getting it far enough,
but this gets it far enough to correct a lot of the misuses.
But this did nothing.
This did nothing except make it that much worse.
Understood, I'm just afraid we're going to end up doing nothing too, and I hate it.
But thank you for your work.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I think that everybody knows the posture.
I can tell you that I'd almost say this
as the first time in 30 some of my years
that I tried to pass a bill
when it wasn't anybody to receive it.
So I felt like that's another historic move,
but I do wanna thank every member of this house
for staying in your seats to vote on this
so that when the press asks questions, it wasn't us.
We found a solution, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate the members
vote on this last issue and I'll step aside.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well, members before I go through the remainder of this bill,
here's going to be our posture.
We have privileged, privileged resolutions that import it to the members of this house.
We're going to take them up for a few minutes.
We're going to figure out exactly what we can do, but I think there's some bills that have come across,
I guess they'll continue working to stay up and get them over here to us and we'll be able to take final action on.
So we're going to ask you to stay patient, stay with us as we move through this bill,
And then we'll finish our night up and we'll adjourn to this thing and go sign a die and
come back for next year.
So with that, is there any objection to the adoption of the House Amendment?
Here in the House Amendment is adopted.
On the gentleman's motion that the House agreed to the Senate's substitute to House Bill
6.51 as amended by the House.
All those in favor will vote yes.
Those opposed will vote no.
And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
Should
For what purpose is representing Neil Ross?
The rule 133.
The lady has that right and the record will so reflect.
all members voted. All members voted this so, Mr. Clerk, were you locked the machine?
All in the gentleman's motion, the yeas are 140, the nays are 29 and the house has agreed
to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 651 as amended by the House.
So members, if I can have your attention, let's see if I can convey this information.
We have it on the authority of legislative council.
And anything we pass, the remainder of this evening will be in the Senate for action
on day one of the session in 2026.
My opinion is, we continue to pass legislation that's imported to Georgia's impactful for
to Georgia's and let's do our work and I think that's what we should do. I hope you'll
agree with me. We're going to conclude with some thank yous a little bit but I'll go ahead
let you know this. You know, it appears that the Senate has checked all their
priorities, all of their political priorities and decided to end their
night early to set a finish in their work on behalf of the people that we
represent. Of course, they're free to do as they please, but this chamber puts policy
over politics, and they're still plenty of good, common sense policy left on this house
as a agenda.
And we're going to take it up, and we're going to continue to work for the people of Georgia
just a little bit longer.
I'm going to ask you to stand at ease for about 15 minutes.
Let us make sure we get a few pieces of information back
from the clerk of the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate.
And then we'll move on with the business of this house
for the good of the people of Georgia.
Thank you members.
This house will stand at ease until 10 minutes, until 10.

it's
Are you doing bill?
Is there any objection to adopting the privileged resolutions?
very none, the resolutions are adopted.
Okay, members, we're going to take up some final actions.
All right, we still have some things to do, so let's pay attention.
Representative Mary Margaret Oliver is recognized for a motion.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I move that the House agree to the Senate substitute the committee with a floor amendment.
This has been on your desk for over an hour or two.
It does not have an LC number, but it is marked on your desk 399 slash SCSFA.
And I'm happy very briefly to explain the amendment and the changes that the Senate made.
Lady, we're going to have to clerk and read the caption.
House bill number 399 to be entitled and act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7, Title 44.
Continue, Mr. Clerk.
House bill number 399 to be titled and act to amend Article 1 of Chapter 7, Title 44.
The fish go to George Anantetti relating to landlords and tenants in general.
Representative Oliver has recognized to explain the Senate's substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I rise to agree to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 399.
This is final action by the House.
Does not require any further action by the Senate.
The Senate Committee passed 399, which relates, as you remember, to creating an opportunity for some accountability for the hedge funds and out-of-state investors who are purchasing large groups of single-family homes, particularly around the Atlanta and other cities of Georgia.
They are purchasing 40% of the homes in my district, 65% in Paul and County and it's changing the economy.
This is a bill that's supported by both property owners and tenants and family seeking opportunities to buy a single family home.
As to your favourable consideration, the floor amendment was an opportunity to specifically define the way Georgia real estate brokers are entitled
under the current law to provide property management services with specific family structures.
That was the purpose of the floor amendment that was agreed upon.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I ask for a favorable consideration for final action of House Bill 399.
The lady is here to the well.
Questions?
You don't have any questions.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

important issues.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This house voted overwhelmingly to support House Bill 652.
The Senate made a small change in concert with the Commission of Agriculture.
And then also with our transportation, Chairman Rick Jasper's and myself,
we effectively move the effective date of the EV charging, taxation and inspection from January 1, 2026 to January 1, 2027.
That is simply the substitute that the Senate added on.

benefits for high deductible.
