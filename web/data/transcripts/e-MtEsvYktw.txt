under the protection of house bille 428
every georgean D faces the challenges
the challenge of infertility will have
access to IVF which has made it possible
for thousands of families to realize
their dream of
perood Speaker John Burns TS the passing
of HB 428 a bill that will ensure that
Georgia families have access to IVF and
the opportunity to become proud parents
good evening on day 24 of the Georgia
legislative session welcome to lawmakers
I'm Donna Lowry in Atlanta more on the
long day in the house with votes on a
lot of major bills today including IVF
in a moment also two perspectives on a
hotly debated bill to help Georgia deal
with a shortage in
anesthesiologists and what is the
nation's largest legis of Black Caucus
interested in accomplishing this session
and Beyond two of the leaders join the
show plus the latest on a bill to
terminate the social media accounts of
anyone in Georgia younger than 14 years
old now let's get a rundown of the day
at the capital from correspondant Sarah
Callas Donna an hours long debate over a
familiar issue in the house and unity
over one particular bill for families a
busy day in the house as members took up
nine bills
House Bill 428 a much anticipated bill
that would give Georgians the right to
access IVF treatment for the bill
sponsor the issue is personal a growing
concern became apparent that we were
having there was issues so we started to
try IVF and we did that multiple times
we did the hormone therapy that came
with it we even actually uh we tried uh
adoption at one point and we came along
all the way down to the end of that we
were the last two weeks of adopting and
had the attorney the contracts all that
stuff that goes with it um the process
that went with it and that fell apart
two weeks before we were able able to
adopt so you can say that this
experience for us has been a very
emotional one it's been highs and lows
it's been a very emotional uh experience
throughout this time but I'm here to
tell you today that we did it we did IVF
one other time and it worked and now my
wife is pregnant with a little girl and
we're we're ecstatic about it Franklin's
wife joined him in the chamber to
support the bill HB 428 passed
unanimously the house also voted on
their version of a controversial bill
that would ban transgender girls from
girl Sports require changing rooms and
bathrooms to be separated by sex
assigned at Birth supporters of the bill
said it ensures fairness House Bill 267
is a common sense bill that recognizes
the biological differences between male
and female
men generally have higher cardiovascular
capacity greater bone density and more
muscle
mass these advantages are
undeniable allowing biological males to
compete against biological females
creates significant harm and undermines
the intent and success of Title 9 there
is genetic differences between boys and
girls and that's that's inalienable
there and it is not changeable you
cannot change it no chemical nor home no
hormone no surgery is ever going to
change your genetic makeup
ever there's been a lot of people that
have talked about that I'm not going to
go into detail about it but I also talk
about about Progressive left and in this
conversation we always have about safe
spaces my daughter deserves a safe space
she deserves it but Democrats opposed
the bill and said female athletes face
other pressing issues like sexual
harassment men telling girls and women
that y'all have helpfully diagn the
problem for us and now you're going to
swoop in and fix it with all due respect
girls and wh women don't need men
speaking for us we do that for
ourselves which brings me to this bill
which again has nothing to do with the
issues standing in the way of fairness
for us in sports if it did it would
address real issues not madeup
ones yes these are children
I said children who are the subject of
this
legislation the objective being a law
that would question their
Humanity segregate them from their
classmates and make them the object of
ridicule at the direction of the state
the bill passed 102 to 54 in a Partyline
vote after a heated
debate the Senate voted today on the
second portion of Governor bran Camp's
tort reform bills when 69 was presented
on the floor the bill would put
safeguards around the use of third party
litigation funding or tpf tplf companies
commonly bankroll plaintiffs to take
their case to civil court in exchange
for abortion sometimes a large portion
of any award that may result this is a
consumer protection measure and it also
combats the growing foreign influence in
our own Judiciary this bill in no way is
aimed at removing the ability of
plaintiffs to engage in this type
litigation financing it is purely
ensuring that when plaintiffs many of
which are victims of wrongdoing are not
taken advantage of by Bad actors who
attempt to exploit the tragedy of others
the bill would also prevent foreign
actors who are increasingly behind many
of the tplf businesses from operating in
Georgia one of the things that has
brought this to our attention and but
has made this to be something of a very
critical nature is that it has been
exposed that many of the third-party
litigation financiers are foreign
adversaries to this country communist
China Russia and others and you may
think other than the incredible returns
that some of these investment
Investments produced why would they be
getting involved and the reason is it
gives them a foothold into our civil
justice system that could give them
access to information that they
otherwise wouldn't be able to have think
data think technology think things like
that unlike last week's more contentious
tort Reform Bill sp68 which was passed
along party lines s sp69 passed
unanimously another cemp supported bill
was also brought to the Senate today but
this time it was supported by Georgia
first lady
Marty sp42 would change the laws
surrounding the human trafficking of
minors which can overlap with the
offense of keeping a place of
prostitution this overlapping sometimes
allows traffickers to receive more
lenient sentences because of loopholes
in the law at least two courts in
Georgia have indicated that the conduct
prohibited by Georgia's human
trafficking statute is substantially
similar to the conduct prohibited by the
offense of keeping a place of
prostitution pimping and pandering in
regard to minor victims uh this bill
should clear that up the bill passed
unanimously as
well tomorrow join me under the gold
dome for legislative day 25 we're all
opening you the latest legislative news
in my Capital report Donna thank you
Sarah the Journal of Medicine surgery
and public health says Georgia is facing
a short a shortage of anesthesiologists
that is complicating the ability of
hospitals to meet the demand the number
of those Physicians practicing in
Georgia has increased from 783 in 2000
to
1147 in 2020 when compared to the
changes in the population during the
same years the rate of anesthesia
biology Physicians per 100,000 people
has also increased slightly from 9.6 in
2000 to 10.7 in 2020 because that growth
is not sufficient for demand there's
legislation in the Georgia house to
allow a certified registered anesthesis
or CRNA to order and administer
anesthesia the house regulated
Industries committee had a two-day
hearing on House Bill 251 it is
sponsored by Republican representative
Laura McDonald III of coming and
strongly opposed by physician and
Democratic representative Michelle Al of
John's Creek who is an anesthesiologist
I spoke to each of them earlier today I
had representative Al explain the
difference between a physician anesthesi
anesthesiologist and a
CRNA so a CRNA is a certified registered
nurse anesthetist and as a physician
anesthesiologist I work with many many
crnas as valuable experienced parts of
our anesthesia care team right now what
this bill proposes is to change the
nature of supervisory practice under
which CRNA is currently work okay so
currently in Georgia crnas can
administer anesthesia to patients right
and they can administer anesthesia to
patients even without a physician
anesthesiologist physically present
there right however how Georgia law is
written is that they are working under
the supervision of a physician which
usually in the case of if there is not a
physician anesthesiologist means they're
working under the supervision of a
surgeon or an interventionalist for
example someone doing a colonoscopy a
gastroenterologist that type of thing it
was brought before our committee last
year and and I was very intrigued by
because I am from rural Georgia I grew
up in Commerce Georgia and so after the
meeting I I talked to the the people
that were representing the CNAs and and
I said you know it did not make it
across uh the Finish Line last year but
I was very interested in helping them
this year and uh so they we worked in
during the off season learning more
about what the the role of the
coordination that we wanted between
doctors and crnas and and we pushed
forward got it to commit what this bill
aims to do is to carve out the physician
supervision from that peroperative team
model right this is a dangerous bill in
the following sense physician Le care
teams are the gold standard of patient
safety right so the same way that I
would never propose to write a bill that
carves crnas a very valuable part of our
care team out of having responsibility
for that patient I find it shocking
frankly that anyone would float a bill
that aims to carve physician supervision
out of that care team in terms of the
rural areas give me some statistics what
we're looking at Donna is there are 27
uh rural hospitals in state of Georgia
without an
anesthesiologist there are 80 counties
without an anesthesiologist I grew up in
Commerce Georgia we had a small hospital
as I was growing up uh it died on a vine
it died you know because it just could
not doctors did not want to move to
Commerce we had our local internal type
medicine doctors but to get those
specialist doctors that you know deal
with ob obstetrics or minor surgeries
they just didn't want to move to
Commerce so this this bill would allow
doctors to coordinate surgeons to
coordinate using a CRNA in surgery
getting the using the DEA license of the
doctor or of the hospital all the all
this bill also allowed hospitals to opt
out it the policy the hospital could say
we're not going to use this method of
providing anesthesia but but it but the
bill also gave hospitals in rural
Georgia the opportunity to provide it to
help hospitals be able to survive I've
heard that argument before that it
increases access to care and let me
explain why that doesn't make sense for
anesthesia Services okay
anesthesia is always a paired service
and what that means is that we provide
anesthesia care in service of a second
type of of medical care which usually is
a surgery or an intervention or a
procedure right we don't just do
anesthesia on its own it's always a
paired service right so you could pump
2,000 anesthesia providers into a rural
healthare system but that doesn't
increase access to care unless you also
have that incompetent raise in having
surgeons come and do surgery or
gastroenterologist coming to do
colonoscopies right um so it's it's a a
faulty ARG
that prays on people not fully
understanding the practice model of
anesthesia right um I will note again
that currently under Georgia law crnas
can practice independently of having a
physician anesthesiologist there so that
argument that oh there's not enough
physician anesthesiologists in the rural
areas that's why we need this bill um
doesn't make any sense because at
present if the CRNA want they can
already go to these rural areas and
practice without a physician
anesthesiologist
however what is currently in law is that
when they go to these rural areas they
are practicing under the supervision of
any physician right this bill aims to
carve that supervision out right and I
think it's it's really quite poor form
to write into code right into law that
Physicians should take less
responsibility for their patients that's
not what doctors want and that's just
poor medicine you know I want to get
rule George has got to to come up here
and support us I mean they've got to say
hey we need you we need a build like
this these rural hospitals we had the
Georgia Hospital Association supporting
us and we had pedmont supporting us so
there Grady was supporting us so it was
uh they had an appetite but they too got
to choose whether they were going to use
this program but they supported having
that option and that's what this bill
did it gives the hospital this kind I
want to you you call it the opt out if
they wanted to use crnas to provide this
type of anesthesia and next year what do
you think you'll bring it back I would
like to I want to work with it during
the off seon and and uh I'm I'm still I
still want to help roal Georgia I think
that there is a shortage in healthcare
workers in Georgia across the board
right and we're not just talking about
uh peroperative services like anesthesia
and surgery and interventions right
we're talking about primary care we're
talking about OBGYN Pediatrics we talk
about this all down the line right so
those factors that lead both crnas and
Physicians to not go practice and rural
areas are really outside the scope of
this bill right so if we want to really
get serious about drawing more medical
professionals to served under served
areas in specific we're going to need to
look at the whole Healthcare ecosystem
part of that is um we're talking about
now is the legal environment around the
practice of medicine and part of it is
the fact that Georgia has um one of the
highest uninsured rates in the nation
right and we see that often times
doctors in training or people are
choosing where they want want to
practice choose not to practice in um
these types of States because it's very
difficult to take care of patients who
have a very high uninsurance rate right
it creates a poor PA mix it makes it hos
hard for hospitals to stay open there
are a lot of factors within these
decisions for people to es skew practice
in rural areas that is far outside of
the scope of this bill what do you want
people who are in listening to know more
people who are potential patients well I
want them to know that all anesthesia
providers are very valuable parts of
that patient care team but that is the
essential word that I want people to
focus on that it is a team right and the
gold standard of patient care and
patient safety is the physician Le team
model so that patients can have access
to the full complement of training if
and when a case becomes an emergency
right we don't always know when we're
starting a surgery if a case is going to
be an emergency or urgent case or not
right sometimes cases start out quite
standard and then we get into trouble
and we need that higher level of right I
want every patient to have that
availability of care regardless of what
kind of surgery they're having and
regardless of where they
live now in the end HB 251 never made it
out of committee so it will not make it
to the house floor for a vote but as you
heard representative McDonald is looking
to introduce it again in the future and
I want to thank both representative
McDonald and representative Al for
talking with me today well coming up a

[Music]
H what this is amazing oh I'm excited

this it did really
happen don't let anybody tell you who
you

[Music]
when you look back you're like wow that
was pretty special this is something
that's actually altering the course of
history you're charged with keeping
these stories
alive welcome back to lawmakers I'm
Donna Lowry one way that groups with
similar interest seek to achieve policy
goals in Georgia is through caucuses
tonight we're going to focus on the
priorities of the Georgia legis of Black
Caucus with 75 members it's the largest
state black caucus in the nation and
joining me are two of the officers first
gbc's chair Democratic senator Nikki
Merritt of Grayson her committees
include government oversight Health and
Human Service and urban Affairs and
gbc's vice chair Democratic
representative Doran Carter of lionia
her committees include Agriculture and
consumer affairs education and Small
Business Development welcome to both of
you thanks so much for here you guys
have been busy today you had a press
conference it was
busy yes you had a press conference so
let let's start with that you had a
press conference today to talk about
your priorities talk talk about what
those those priorities are well first
thank you Donna for having us on and uh
the Georgia legislative Black Caucus has
really committed to our community and so
our top priorities are Health housing
education wealth Public Safety and
Justice Reform and so we laid out the
chair woman laid out the agenda today
doing a press conference highlighting
legislation and priorities in these
particular areas that we think are part
important and crucial to our community
yeah talk a little bit about why why
those areas in particular um in almost
every poll that I've seen and just
hearing from our communities that was
the feedback we're do we're we're
hearing housing is almost number one uh
Health Care came in at number two uh and
just things about our economy in general
came in but we wanted to really focus on
those two top issues as well as we do
have one of our priorities about
Building Wealth in the back in the black
community and that can help with some of
the the economic um um problems that
we're seeing yeah I know you had your
heritage Gayla last week was a pretty
pretty big
deal so talk a little bit about so you
talked about tort reform there and and
maternal mortality too right yes at the
of the Gaya this it was really amazing
uh we held it at the uh Aquarium
and uh we had an opportunity to bring
our members our community leaders our
supporters together uh as an opportunity
to celebrate and we as we talk about our
heritage and really uh talk about what
we're doing for our future and so yes
tort reform is a part of an issue that
we uh hope that we'll be able to address
and make an impact on our community as
it relates to uh our insurance policies
because right now uh we're having a lot
of chatter on how the insurance
companies and attorneys are going to
benefit but we're not having a lot of
conversations around how it's going to
support our uh constituents because as
you know in Georgia we are really seeing
really high uh insurance rates and the
people need relief so as we continue to
debate and work through this language we
hope at the end of the day it really
helps our constituents a lot of it is
translating it to the people who are
your constituents right make sure making
sure they understand understand a lot of
what goes on at the capital it's kind of
tough to to wrap your mind around right
right or even those of us who are there
every day absolutely in tour reform no
one un understands that term so I just
told people just remember this is a big
handout it's a big handout to
corporations and at the end of the day
we should be putting um more we should
be asking more of insurance companies
because insurance companies are setting
these rates so I need consumers to
really understand I know I hear I'm
hearing from my constituents like hey
vote for the tor perform I'm like no
wait a minute here this is really a lot
more to this than you think and at the
end of the day it is my job to have more
consumer protection policies and make
sure I'm protecting my communities yeah
and I know you want to hear from them I
want to get to some other bills that you
guys have in individually and together
but one bill that you have that's gained
a lot of momentum is limiting social
media for anyone under 14 years old HB
165 corre HB 165 we're calling the
Banning on the the miners on social
media Bill and it is getting a lot of
traction and yes it would ban all
together if you're under 14 to be on
social media if you're 14 and 15 you can
be on it with parental consent but what
this bill also does is holds social
media companies accountable and creates
an accountability system and makes the
social media companies liable if they
have those miners on without parental
consent wow and so I know that a lot of
parents are probably interested in this
yeah and what I'm what and my real
reason behind it is what we're seeing
that social media the uh social media
companies have built this model to where
it's very addictive so we're we're
creating addiction number one but it's
also impacting their mental health their
creativity their sense of play and at a
very young age you know that's that's a
critical age at 14 I think kids need to
be outside playing and reading books I
know 14 woo I don't even think I want to
go back through those that to that age
you have a bill um that has a personal U
feeling for you I mean this on a
personal note it deals with the heart
heart it's House Bill 459 the heart
health for all act and so tell us about
it and and why it's so personal for you
well the purpose of this legislation is
because we want uh more education and
more information in disadvantaged
communities more minority communities
because we know that the number one
cause of death in women and black women
in particular is heart disease so
Studies have shown that the more that we
know about the dis disease the more that
we can change our Behavior so if we can
have uh our uh Public Health
administrators in the communities
working with our schools providing uh
data and information that will help uh
black and brown our members of our
society really understand what the
disease is and how we can change our
Behavior whether it's um exercise or
drinking water or food especially is
really what we eat and just
understanding how different foods affect
our bodies so we're hoping if we can
move this piece of legislation and we
get more information to the community
and more information earlier and it
trickles down into the homes that we can
begin to save more lives and talk less
about how how many people have passed
away and yes it it has affected me and
this is why it's so important
um my grandmother um actually passed
away in a had a massive Heart Attack One
Friday evening and then my mother died
in her sleep from heart complications
and uh even though um we had this
history in our family I never thought it
would be
me yeah we all yeah we all think that
and um interestingly enough uh March of
2015 I actually had an attack on my
heart and um the doctors were like kind
of surprised because my cholesterol
wasn't necessarily high and heart uh
blood pressure was a little elevated but
it wasn't what you would have expected
and so um from that I started learning
more and more and then I share with you
uh that since being elected I've
actually had a stroke and so um I've
learned then having that that there's
something in our lipo protein that uh
the doctors are are beginning to
understand that that's a indicator of
you could be preexposed to to heart
disease so there are studies that I
participate in and so with knowing all
of this I do everything that I can to
educate our community so since I've been
elected I've held the um uh heart
healthy lunch at the capital in the
community every year on that first
Friday in February and every year we've
done it someone said thank you because
they were having some issues but they
may not have gone to the doctor had they
not been exposed to that information
you're making a difference it's just a
it's a changing the way people look at
things it is it is we we'll we'll keep
keep up with your bill and that so we're
going to switch to you you have some AI
um bills that you're interested in and
it has to do with surveillance correct
so uh AI is new is you know I I I know
we're hearing you know is everyone's
using it but there also some could be
some problems with AI so AI is being
used in two ways and I can condense it
in the two bills that I'm talking about
one is wage surveillance so Ai and data
is being used to pull like your
demographics and where you live and
charge you uh different prices for
different services for instance ride
share depending on where you live or who
that driver is the driver can beit the
AI is saying as using uh his data to
pull the driver that would take the
lowest fair but also charging the
consumer a very high price and that
price can change too according to where
you live demographics so that's one way
the other way AI is being used is by
company and government agencies to
discriminate so we a AI is is not
sophisticated enough to know the nuances
of like human behavior so uh using AI in
a way to determine things like Health
Care to determine things like jobs to
make um decisions about disability
companies are using the AI data and
they're pulling it and AI is determining
that and what this bill does is holds
those companies liable because for our
constitution you cannot discriminate
based on race color sex religion or any
disability so so companies need to be
held accountable we can't sue AI but we
can sue those companies and AI only
knows what the programmers are telling
it so if we have a bunch of information
out there on the internet that is biased
and we know we have a very bias and we
have some
discriminatory um things in our society
AI is pulling that information so you're
actually allowing AI to make decisions
based on bad data wow so a lot of scary
things is scary
on another level but I appreciate you
both um doing what you're doing down at
the capital to try to get that to go you
know to to educate people about it and
to uh try to protect us in some kind of
way thank you both for coming in today
appreciate that and that does it for
lawmakers tonight and we're off until
Monday but tune in to Sarah Callas for
lawmakers she has a capital report at
the end of PBS NewsHour right before 700
p.m. tomorrow night in the meantime have
a good night my mini is
here bye have a good
night you can
