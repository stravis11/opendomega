after which we will pledge allegiance
to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning,
we're very grateful for you being here.
Thank you very much.
We'll be introduced by the gentleman
from the 46th House District,
Cameron Scott Hilton, Chairman Hilton.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
A lot more legroom back here.
I like what you've done with the place.
Good morning, colleagues.
God is good.
All the time.
I'm so glad to see so many smiling faces in this house chamber.
I pray that you and your communities
made it through the recent weather unscathed.
It is my true joy to introduce Father Charles Bird,
a true life-long native of Georgia.
Father Bird hails from the Columbus area,
where his father served at Fort Benning,
His father later moved into education
and helped lead desegregation efforts out of Newton, Georgia.
A true family man, Georgian father bird has one brother,
two sisters, seven nieces and nephews across Georgia.
His career initially brought him to Louisville, Kentucky,
working in advertising.
There he converted to the Catholic faith
and began serving in his local choir.
The Lord called father bird to pursue his faith further,
leaving him to complete pre-theology and Pennsylvania
and earn both his bachelors and license and sacred theology
in Rome.
In Rome, he enjoyed the distinct honor
being ordained as a deacon at St. Peter's Basilica
by the future Pope, Pope Benedict.
In 2001, Archbishop Donahue ordained
Bird as a priest.
Today, Father Bird is pastor of Mary R. Queen
in peace-tree corners.
A brief note about the church itself.
In 2019, Mary R. Queen completed a historic renovation
bringing several items from St. Gerard Church,
a shuttered church in Buffalo, New York
that was built in 1911.
The result is a gorgeous historical structure
right in the middle of Gwyneth County
where many of our friends attend today.
I would highly recommend you visit
this impressive historical structure.
With that, it is my distinct honor
to recognize my good friend, Father Bird.
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, in this assembly, it's my honor to be here.
Again, my name is Father Bird, I'm a Catholic priest in the Archdiocese.
I've been a pastor for 13 years at the North Georgia Mountains.
And now I'm in Gwyneth County and they're just a wonderful group of people.
I'd like to tell you a brief story today and I hope that you'll find it interesting.
I want to tell you a story about a beatification of five Georgians,
who the Catholic Church is about to recognize on their steps towards eventually being declared we pray.
Saints, this is a big deal.
They were venerable Franciscans, four priests, one laborer,
all from Spain, and their names are Pedro de Corpa,
Blas Rodriguez, Miguel de Anón, Antonio de Badajos,
and Francisco de Verascola, who is being toyed around
with considered as the patron, future patron saint of soccer.
Anyway, good, interesting.
These fellows were 16th century missionaries
in what is today the southern coast of Georgia,
and they were martyrs.
They were not the first missionaries
to be martyred in what is today Georgia,
but their cause has been pushed for decades
to make its way through the long bureaucratic process
that has involved historical analysis,
evaluation of their lives for virtue, details,
and nature about their lives and death,
and even potential miracles that may be attributed to them.
These Georgia martyrs were first recognized
as venerable serfants of God,
but soon this autumn they will be designated
as blessed in Savannah.
And that's one step close to being named to Saint.
The process is hardly over,
but this last step is called canonization in the Catholic Church.
And that means their names will be included
in an ancient role of saints that go all the way back
to Peter and Paul.
Big deal, really.
The Native Georgians that these five missionaries served, or a lost tribe called the Wale, their
mission churches are likely the oldest places of worship in Georgia, and it's very likely
that these Franciscans introduced peaches to what is today the peach state.
As the story goes, there were some among the Wale who rebelled against the Christian notion
of monogamy, and for this a group of young men had about slaying the five men over the
course of many days, and in five missions starting on the Feast of the Exaltation of
the Cross, which is September the 14th, 1597.
In the end, their rebellion failed, and the Wally Cheap asked for more French-esque
missionaries to come and replace their mortars. The Indigenous Wally lived for
generations in those now lost missions and they are a people lost to history but
not to God. The reason for these mortadons is described as Odium Fidei in Latin
hatred of the faith. But these men were anything but hateful. They were
learned, courageous, bold zealous. They lived among a new and strange people
without knowing the language. They had no army of conquistadors to force
conversions. They had only the convictions of their faith to inspire our first
Christian and Georgians. 429 years ago, largely forgotten today, but about to be recognized
by the church in Rome. The second century church historian Tertullian
is credited for quoting, writing the quote, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the
church and he was likely referencing our Lord's words, Amen, Amen, unless a grain of
wheat falls upon the ground and dies. It remains but a grain of wheat, but if it dies, it produces
much fruit. What a proud past of sanctity. Georgia martyrs represent, and that begs the
question, what will be our future? What seeds are re-nurturing? How are we cultivating
our culture. When we die, will we leave the world a better place. Friends, whatever our
future is, you are a part of it. We're counting on you and we're praying for you. Georgia
is a beautiful state with a rich history and such great potential. And I hope that you
will get to know your Georgia mortars, blessed Pedro de Corba and companions. Now I would
ask you to stand for the benediction.
Great God of power and might who order all things according to your eternal will and
to call all people to know and praise you.
Hear our prayer for those who serve in this August assembly.
Guide them in your wisdom, may they be steadfast in your justice, and may they legislate and
govern always in moderation.
May they be honorable stewards of the authority and responsibility in which they have been
entrusted.
May they never lose sight that all are meant to be governed by your laws and seek always
your mercy.
We thank you, Lord, for our state and for our people.
Make us worthy of our rich heritage.
It was always in your providential care and bless this assembly, Lord, and their deliberations
on this day and the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
And now we'll make our pledge.
Or keepers you may unlock the doors open the doors follow bird. Thank you for that
for that history lesson, but also most important lesson
in our heritage and how we should act.
Thank you so much.
Thanks for being here.
Members, you may greet Father Bird in the south any room.
your gratitude for him being here and his message at the
Votion.
Awesome.

We'll be moving on to morning orders, you have no committee reports today.
We have several morning orders that all of them are imported.
We'll take the privilege of starting this off with a morning order from myself.
So we, on your desk, you have some information from the Georgia Forestry Commission that
I think you'll find beneficial and helpful.
That agency provides a great service to Georgians.
You don't have to listen to me,
but I'm gonna tell you about the Georgia Forest Commission
and how important they are.
And I hope you will,
when you have an opportunity to thank those folks
who put their life on the line so many different times
when there are situations that impact all Georgians,
especially when it comes to fire protection.
But certainly they do a great job.
Director Johnny Sabo and his team are really special folks who get out there and work to prevent
forest fires and protect homeowners all across Georgia in the urban setting and in the suburban
setting and certainly in the rural setting. So we want to thank all of those folks and thank
Director Sabo and certainly some information to be helpful to you as well. The other thing
on your desk is a small token of appreciation from Dale Burns and John Burns for all the hard work
and time you guys spent away from home. I hope that garment bag will serve you well. It certainly
demonstrates whom we are and where we come from that we will you can display proudly when you
when you travel. So we'll let you know that the Monty Gilbert, spearhead of that project. I
But I could take credit for coming up with the department bag, but I won't.
Stay all did that.
She has much better taste than I do.
So I really like mine, and I'm going to use it soon if she doesn't kick me out.
But we'll see how that works out.
But they came from Monty Galbreath.
He's the owner of the DNA Technical Fabrics, a family business based in Columbus, Georgia.
So we appreciate Georgia being in charge of that.
And that fabric is also a plain retarded, so there's a very special bag and all, and
let's see.
All the fabric was donated to this body by the DNA technical fabricators and some other
folks, so we're very grateful for that, and so hopefully you'll put it to good use.
With that, we'll move on to additional morning orders, and I'm going to recognize Chairman
Dickie.
If you give the gentleman the will, your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Raker and colleagues.
I want to recognize the very distinct group from my district up in the balcony.
Would you all sign?
This is Tomiston, Ups and County Leadership Institute, young leaders from there, and here,
and I kept on learning a little bit about what goes on here, and they were with Madison
Rootinger from the Chamber and Troy Cheney, a Mayor Protein with Thomas, a great group.
Welcome to the two to the people's house, thank y'all.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We appreciate y'all being here, hopefully if anything the members can do to accommodate
you today. You have a great representative there, so don't be afraid to reach out to any
of us for any information you may need.

House. We are glad to have you here. Also, thank you so much for your
contribution to Gwinnett County, to the economy of Gwinnett County, to our small

Okay members, if you'll give the lady and the well and the group and the well your attention
or an important morning order, if the lady will suspend just for a moment.
Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
81 years ago, today, Allied soldiers liberated Auschwitz,
where over 1 million souls, most of them Jews, were murdered.
Across Nazi-occupied Europe, 6 million Jewish men, women and children,
were systematically targeted and annihilated.
Along with millions of others, the regime deemed unworthy of life.
Today we honor those who perished, we honor the survivors who carry the weight of memory,
and we honor the liberators who were born witness to horrors no human being should ever see.
The Holocaust stands as humanity's starkest warning about what happens when hate goes unchecked,
when bigotry is normalized, when discrimination is codified, when we fail to see ourselves and others as humans.
humans. As anti-semitism rises again across the globe and here at home, the lessons of
the Holocaust have never been more urgent. We must be vigilant, we must have hold human
dignity, and we must stand together. Again, anti-semitism, racism, and all forms of hatred
that seek to dehumanize and divide us. This is our solemn responsibility of citizens,
as Georgians and as human beings.
We remember so that never again means never again.
With us today are Sally Levine, the Executive Director
and Fran Putney, the Communication Director
of the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust.
We also have Karen Eisenberg-Jones,
Executive Director of the Georgia Solidarity Network,
and former Attorney General Sam Olens.
Let's welcome them all to the people's house.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Representative Panich and members.
We all know that a story seldom told us soon forgotten.
We must not forget, so tell the story, honor to have you here.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, a gentleman that was a state representative from Harris County from 1968 to 1988 passed away.
some of you in here will remember this name Randy Phillips and 85 years old. I had to say if you
wanted to point out somebody that knew how to do constituents work, Randy was the guy. He was a
great guy and I just wanted to pass that along to you like I say I know some of you probably know him
I have served with him but I just want to send his family our condolences and if you'll be
about him. Also, and this is bad, I hate to do too, but this Saturday night we had a tragedy in
Harris County, our baseball coach, 44 years old, Tony Demetri was killed in an ATV accident,
and he was with his best friend, so I don't know any details but other than we really need to pray
for his family, and I'd ask that you pray for the high school baseball team. He'd been
there a couple of years and gotten those young men in line and they had one, two, 23-game
seasons, and just a tragic loss, and we ask that God be with their family, take care
of them, and just say an extra prayer for them. So if you would, just a moment of silence
for these two.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you for representing Smith and members.
Y'all may be seated.
I'm going to ask the remaining members that will have afternoon orders.
If you can hold it to about a minute and a half,
I'll do the math for you. That's 90 seconds.
a minute and a half, if you will, and we're going to...
Representative McQueen is recognized for an afternoon
or the representative of Queen, that Queen.
How about Representative Barry?
No, no, no.
No, we have, I'm out of order.
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, today I'm honored to stand to remember Roberta
Revolt Bar, who was called home to be with Lord on January the 9th.
Roberta was my wife's aunt, but above all she was a mother and she was a teacher.
Roberta was born in November 15th, 1950 in Long Island, New York.
She moved down to Georgia in the late 60s when her parents retired on the Jackal Island.
She went to pursue her passion for teaching.
She got a degree at a Middle Georgia University in Millageville, excuse me, George College
in Millageville, where she earned a bachelor's in education.
She later got her master's degree from education at the University of Georgia.
Roberta made her family's home in Warner Robbins, Georgia with her husband, Bruce, and they
raised their daughter, Jenna.
Roberta had deep faith in God and served in the orchard
in the Valley Church and went on multiple mission trips
in the Americas.
Roberta served her community for over 30 years
in the Houston County school systems
where she became an administrator.
And then after she retired, she went back into the classroom
and taught for another 19 years.
So overall, it's a career in education
in Middle Georgia that span 50 years,
which is amazing to think how many children
she influenced during that time.
So let's remember her husband, Bruce,
and her daughter, Janna,
and have a quick moment of silence for Roberta.
Amen, thank you very much.
So we had one to come off, so let me give you the order.
I want to recognize Representative Anderson, then Barry Denali, that's the next three.
Representative Anderson, for up to a minute and a half.
Mr. Gentlemen, your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, yesterday morning, many of us in Northeast Georgia woke up to over an inch of ice and
sleep on our cars and our yards on the roads and on the trees. At one time I
know there were over 250,000 Georgia power customers affected and I just spoke
a few moments ago with CEO Brian Ferguson of Habersham EMC and out of their 40,000
total customers of which I am one over 30,000 without power at some point over
this past weekend, so this winter storm fern was extremely significant in our area.
We'd like to thank Governor Brian Kemp, President Donald J. Trump for their leadership and
emergency declaration they had.
We'd like to thank Georgia Power, all the EMCs and utility partners in Georgia.
There was a force of over 10,000 people who converged on Georgia from different corners
of the state and different states in the Union to help restore power and clear roads throughout
Georgia. We want to thank the Georgia Department of Transportation and their cooperation
with our local governments. We want to thank the Georgia Forestry Commission, GEMA,
law enforcement, first responders, and we ask for your continued prayers for those that
are still affected, still without power, and hopefully that restoration will be completed
and done soon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you. Those folks do great work and we certainly did have some impactful weather.
Representative Barry is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Barry.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, this morning I had an article placed in all your desks and I hope you had
the chance to get it.
Gentlemen, we'll continue now.
I hope you had the chance to read the article I
had placed your desk this morning,
because we got an inflection point.
In fact, we are far past an inflection point.
We are nearing the place of no return.
I want you to have a classroom, rows of desk, empty desk,
not because kids are sick, not because parents don't care,
but because families are terrified.
In Atlanta, across Georgia, and across this nation,
Students are staying home because ICE rates and local cooperation with federal immigration
enforcement have launched their campaign of terror and fear in weep to a daily condition
of life. The unfortunate reality must face that this legislature has chosen to empower
this fear. The article points out clearly that this body doubled down on policies that
blur the line between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. Knowing full
well that when you do that, families stop trusting our schools and our public institutions.
And at the top of it all sits the president who has allowed ICE to continue operating
as a rogue agency that terrorizes communities instead of protecting them.
I don't care the talking points about law and order, there is no order in a classroom
where half the students are missing.
There is no law that is worth enforcing if the price of the child's education.
We cannot talk about parental rights while supporting policies that rip parents away.
in the workforce readiness
while sabotaging the education
of an entire duration of students.
And I must say, to anyone floundering in the polls
for U.S. Senate who invites ICE into Atlanta,
it's not demonstrating leadership.
They are demonstrating a willingness
to sacrifice children's safety for political theater
and endorsement that is never gonna come.
So, we know that what we do at least of these,
we do also under him.
He tells us to walk in the stranger,
he tells us to walk in the stranger,
to protect children and to act not out of fear,
but out of love.
So I invite you to consider joining the hospital for 70,
which affirms that hospitals, hospitals,
and churches are places of refuge, not fear.
So thank you all, education should not thrive
or survive under terror, and neither should I.
Thank you all so much.
Thank you, Mrs. Speaker.
We're representing Ali to recognize for a afternoon.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, I want to continue a tradition by my predecessor and introduce
a child that is up for adoption today.
On the screen is 13-year-old named Elizabeth.
Elizabeth enjoys learning math, watching gymnastics and doing arts and crafts.
If you or anyone in community is looking to adopt, please consider Elizabeth to become
part of your family on it's my turn now dot dhs dot Georgia dot gov.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Representative Oli.
We appreciate you doing that.

tradition.

Representative Paris,
Representative Paris,
recognized for an afternoon order.
Are you alone, you have friends?
The lady's recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
So, a couple of weeks ago, I got a little sick and had to take a minute to say this, let me introduce it.
She's back, we're glad you're back with us.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
Hard me for interrupting.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I just wanted to say thank you for your prayers.
I could feel them.
I knew that you all were thinking about me.
It was a little bit of a crazy little thing with my heart,
but the doctors said they think I'm OK.
So if I act out, that's what we're going to charge it to, right?
But I want to especially thank the GHDC for the flowers that they sent me to the Republican
caucus.
I did not get flowers from you all.
You owe me.
Mrs. Speaker, thank you.
Everyone, all of the phone calls, all of the text, all of the prayers, I really appreciate
it.
I was so, so, so heartfelt.
Thank you.

Representative, you have a big heart and a caring heart,
and we know your heart's fine.
But thank you for your service and appreciate you.
We're glad you're back.
Chairman Irwin recognized for an afternoon order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues on your desk,
you're gonna see a book here from the Georgia Partnership
for Excellence in Education and for decades,
they put out the top 10 issues about education.
I want to point out if you look at table of contents, one of the issues, literacy, something
we're going to spend a lot of time talking about in this chamber as well as we're going
to put an effort to make a difference for our children.
I just want you to imagine that if you could not read this book that I put on your desk
today, how your life would be different.
But please pay a little attention to this book and the contents inside here.
Education Committee on Thursday at our meeting. Get ready. We're going to have these presented and we're going to talk more about them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thanks for the books and we appreciate your work and look forward to your work paying great dividends for Georgians. Thank you.
Chairman Crowe.
Chairman Clint Crowe is recognized for
or an after-nord from down in Butch County?
Yes, sir.
Right.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning, colleagues.
And welcome back to everyone, glad that everyone made it through the weekend weather,
relatively unscathed.
I want to come up here and talk to you just for a minute and give a bit of a different
perspective.
I heard my colleague a few moments ago talking about fear and terror and children not being
in the classroom because of that.
There are some things that I would like to say that get misconstrued, especially in the
press over the last several weeks.
Obviously, we have seen that there has been loss of life.
That is tragic.
None of us want that, and it is always tragic when someone loses their life.
However, to come up here or to go anywhere and speak publicly, especially in a position
like we're in, where we make laws and then ask people to go out and enforce them and
to vilify and mischaracterize those individuals.
We ask to go do that job as Nazis, as terrorists,
and as Gestapo is not only wrong, it's dangerous.
And so what I would like to say is that each one of these
individuals that has put their life on the line every day
to go out and protect us and enforce the laws that we
have put in place, and our elected leaders have put
into place, are doing that at risk to themselves, sometimes
risk to their own families. We should respect them for that. We should honor them for that.
We should eradicate the ones that do it wrong. And we will do that. But that is the vast, vast,
minority. And we don't need to lump all of them together and pain everybody with a broad brush.
And the hyperbolic rhetoric that we hear about what they're doing and what kind of people they are
is leading to dangerous situations that are leading to negative outcomes if people get hurt.
So I will continue to pray for all of our officers, local, state, and federal, and I ask you to do the same and honor the sacrifice that they make.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will.
Thank you, sir, that concludes the announcements.
Excuse me, concludes the afternoon orders for the day.
