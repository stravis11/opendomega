TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you all for being here today.
We gather at a crucial time for our democracy,
and time when the integrity of our electoral process
is under serious threat.
Recently, I filed a formal complaint against three members
of the Georgia State election board, Janice Johnston,
Janelle King, and Rick Tafaris, who have violated
the very principles they swore to uphold.
These violations are not just legal technicalities.
They strike at the heart of a democracy
in the trust Georgians place in our election system.
These individuals have taken deliberate actions
that interfere with free and fair elections in our state.
They voted for rule that allows local election officials
to delay or even refuse to certify election results
and action that could plunge Georgia into electoral chaos.
This is not just unethical.
It is illegal.
Their actions undermine the will of the people,
and we cannot stand idly by while they subvert
the democratic process.
These MAGA extremists are attempting
to legalize voter suppression, and we cannot go back.
Moreover, these board members have been caught illegally
coordinating with the Georgia Republican Party
to advance their partisan agenda.
This was done in secret, in violation of the Open Meetings Act, further eroding public
trust in our electoral system.
They have shown a blatant disregard for the law and their continued presence on the board
places our state, in legal and financial jeopardy.
The state election board does not exist to help Republicans win elections or to enrich
its members.
Today I stand before you to demand that Governor Camp take immediate action.
We need a formal investigation into these claims.
It's the least he can do and is obligated to do per our state code.
And then the facts will show that we need to remove these corrupt board members.
The people of Georgia deserve leaders who respect the law, uphold the precious and sacred
right to vote and protect our democracy. Not individuals who conspire behind closed
doors to disenfranchise voters. So today you will hear from my house colleagues, community
and faith leaders from across the state. And as we move forward in this fight, I'm honored
to introduce a champion of democracy, my congresswoman, congresswoman Lucy McBath, her
dedication and leadership inspires all and is my privilege to welcome her. Thank
you.
Well good morning and thank you senator islam parks for your kind words and for your
initiative. I am so grateful for your leadership and all of the leaders that
stand with me here, but your leadership in the State Senate, and I always continue to
stand up and fight with you in Washington, as I know you were doing right here in the
State of Georgia. And I know, leader Butler could not be here with us today, but I just
want to say thank you to her for her tireless advocate advocacy in the Georgia State Senate.
Our state is undoubtedly stronger and more resilient because of Senator Butler's leadership.
And I'm so thankful that I've been able to see her work up close and to learn from her
directly.
I'd also like to thank Representative Park, Representative Draper, and everyone who
is joining us here today.
These are phenomenal leaders in the state of Georgia that are standing up and leading
on behalf of our communities.
The fight for equal rights is personal to me.
Growing up, my father led the Illinois branch of the NAACP.
I saw up close every single day as he and my mother sacrificed day after day after day
to ensure that we were treated equally under the law.
My parents believed in their shared stake
holdership over America, that though they had not
been born with the same rights and the same privileges
as other Americans, they owed their diligence
and wits to ensure that no American's voice
would be left out or left behind in the decision-making process.
And my parents weren't alone.
Countless Americans marched.
They fought.
And they perished to uphold the principles of this nation.
Thanks to all of their efforts, each succeeding generation
has pushed the front line forward.
Make no mistake.
What is unfolding in Georgia is nothing less
than a concerted effort to subvert democracy
and move us backwards.
In the last decade, Georgia has seen folks
like Raphael Warnock, John Ossoff, and Stacey Abrams
work to lay the groundwork and change our state.
Georgia made history by sending a Democrat to the White House and not one but two Democratic
Senators to Capitol Hill.
The people of Georgia spoke out.
We spoke out against hate, against divisive rhetoric.
We stood together to say unequivocally, we deserve better.
In direct response, we witnessed something much more sinister.
We saw numerous efforts to silence our voices, to silence us at the ballot box.
Republicans passed restrictions on ballot access throughout our entire state, making it
harder to vote, especially in communities of color.
And in 2022, Donald Trump blatantly attempted to reverse the results of our election, something
we are used to seeing in dictatorships throughout the world, but not here at home, not here
in Georgia.
federally we've introduced the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to codify
election protections into law but those seeking to tear our democracy down have
worked to stop it at every step of the way. Now here at home here in Georgia the
Georgia State Elections Board is becoming an equal co-conspirator in this
effort to suppress our votes. With passing this new rule, they are creating
barriers to counting votes and certifying the elections. So Donald Trump can
once again attempt to throw our country into chaos. We are here today to say we
are better than this. One of the most basic responsibilities of our government is
to ensure the process of free and fair elections.
As Americans, we must defend and protect our democracy to ensure the voices of the people
are heard, not some voices, but all voices.
Today I am joining my esteemed colleagues in calling for Governor Kim to hold members
of the State Elections Board accountable.
stand up for the rule of law and to ensure that our democratic process is protected.
He must not allow our state elections board to be taken over by Donald Trump, because
if we fail to protect our state democracy, our sacred democracy, we will risk falling
into chaos.
Thank you my name is Wayne Kindle I'm an attorney here in the state of Georgia I have the honor and
the privilege of coming before you this morning to bring attention to what we consider to be a
graven justice perpetrated on the voters in the state of Georgia about three members of the
state election board, Janice Johnston, Janelle King, and Rick Jafaris. I have also the privilege
of standing before you and these elected leaders, community leaders and religious leaders
to bring attention to what we consider to be several ethics violations about these three
particular members who have demonstrated a concerted effort and a desire to be hell-bent
on subverting the election laws of the state of Georgia through these rules and regulations
that they have recently passed after election officials have asked them to stop and halt
what they have considered to be a concerted effort to inject confusion and chaos into the
election machinery of the state of Georgia.
First we have a violation of the Open Meetings Act whereby these three members initiated
a meeting on July 12th to institute several rules and regulation changes that were given
to them by the Republican Party of Georgia, which had never been sent through the process,
the original and a proper process, which is called for by the Open Meetings Act, which
involves notice of the proposed changes that involved posting of these changes on the
website and involved sending out notices to all the constituents, including the public,
And other members of the state board of elections, they failed to uphold the laws.
The state ethics law requires that all members of board's commissions and authorities should
uphold the laws of the state of Georgia.
And when members of the state election board taken upon themselves to totally ignore the
Advice of Council, the State Law Department,
which advised them that the meeting that they held
on July the 12th was an illegal meeting,
then these particular individuals have shown a disdain
and a desire to violate the law
that they should be called upon to resign their positions.
And if they don't resign their positions,
then the governor has an absolute duty
under the State Ethics Act to act
to remove these particular individuals from office.
Three persons, Kathy Willard,
Randall Mangum, who's a candidate for District 55,
Senate District Head and State of Georgia,
and Senator Nabila Islam Park,
has called on the governor
to remove these particular individuals
for violations of state law.
The Governor should for with act
to remove these rogue members of his party
from the election board here in the state of Georgia.
We call upon him to do so,
and we call upon him to do so forth with.
The law requires him to hold a hearing
and what has been the practice in the past
is that he would refer those complaints
over to the state office of administrative hearings
for them to appoint an administrative law judge
and for that law judge to hold a hearing
to inquire into the facts and evidence to make a determination as to whether a recommendation
should be made to the governor to remove these particular individuals from office.
We think that with all of the media attention that has been brought to bear the facts that
have been put for the emails that have been uncovered, which indicate that these individuals
are more or less pursuing an agenda of partisan political motives that they should be removed
from office and should be removed from office fourth with.
So we call attention to those complaints.
We ask the governor to fourth with go forward and hold a hearing, send this matter over
to the office of administrative hearings for an administrative law judge to be appointed
and for these particular three complaints to be heard,
and to be heard before the November elections,
so that these particular individuals can stop the chaos
and the confusion that they are engendering
into the election machinery of the state of Georgia.
Thank you.
All right, all right, all right.
All right.
Good morning, my name is Sam Park, and I serve
as WIP of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus.
As y'all may know, three pro-Trump anti-democracy members
of Georgia State Election Board are overstepping their authority
by changing our election rules.
After Trump praises them, they pass new rules that can enable Trump
and his allies to obstruct certification of Georgia's 2024 election results.
One new rule gives partisan, county election officials more power
and allows them to delay or block certification
of election results if they disagree with the outcome.
This directly conflicts with Georgia law,
which states that local election officials
shall perform their duties, making their responsibilities
mandatory, not discretionary.
House Democrats have urged Speaker John Burns
to remove Trump-aligned Genelle King from the election board.
Time is running out, and we've received no response.
So now we are escalating our concerns
by calling on Governor Kemp to investigate
election board members, Jeffries, Johnston, and King
for potential conflicts of interest, ethical issues,
and unlawful actions that raise serious concerns
about the integrity of Georgia's election administration.
Georgia Law grants Governor Kemp the authority
to investigate and remove election board members
if they violated the law.
Even though Governor Kemp supports Trump for president,
he should agree Trump should win Georgian's votes
fair and square.
Again, even though Governor Kemp supports Trump
for president, he should agree Trump should win
Georgian's votes fair and square.
In the face of this threat to the fair
and lawful administration of Georgia elections,
Governor Kemp must investigate these members
and set an administrative hearing as soon as possible.
As we know, democracy dies in darkness,
so thank you to members of the press
for highlighting this ongoing attack against our right
to have our vote counted.
To my fellow Georgians concerned about the brazen attempts
to undermine election administration,
the best way to counter these undemocratic,
on American efforts, is to turn out and vote in numbers
that leave no room for doubt.
Now is a time to organize, volunteer,
and most importantly, vote.
We are 70 days away from election day.
Talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors,
especially those who don't usually vote.
In the words of John Lewis,
the vote is the most powerful, non-violent change agent
we have in a democratic society.
We have the power to protect our democracy,
one vote at a time, and we must use it.
With that, I will turn it over to Representative Saira Draper.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Saira Draper, and I'm a state representative
for House District 90 in Atlanta.
The Georgia State Election Board no longer
works in service to Georgians or in furtherance
of fair and free elections.
This state election board has been taken over
by far right, MAGA extremists.
The new majority is made of Trump loyalists,
people willing to ignore the Constitution, fairness,
and facts, if that means getting Donald Trump back in power.
Their strategy is clear.
They will continue to make 11-hour changes.
And when something goes wrong, no matter how minor,
they will point to the errors as justification
for questioning any election results they do not like.
And simultaneously, state election board
is loudly signaling to their MAGA allies at the county level.
They should delay or refuse to certify election results
a move that will inflame passions, that will so distrust,
and that could even foment violence,
just as Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election
led to an insurrection at the Capitol.
I want to be very clear about what this all boils down to.
You've got three hyperpartisan, unelected individuals,
executing a plan to nullify the votes of millions
of Georgians if Kamala Harris wins our state.
We are talking about a level of mass disenfranchisement
that demands immediate action and condemnation
from Georgia's leaders, and yet so far we have been met with silence.
Here's what I want to say directly to Republican leadership in this state.
You got us into this mess.
Now you need to have the courage to get us out.
We would not be in this precarious position with a MAGA election deniers in control of
the State Election Board had Republicans not totally
capitulated to the far right.
And what do I mean by that?
Republicans passed legislation to kick the Secretary of State
off of the State Election Board.
The governor signed that bill into law.
The Speaker of the House folded under pressure
not to reappoint his former appointee to the State
election board, someone who respected the rule of law,
and he replaced that member with the far rights pick,
giving Mag of the majority.
And Republicans have largely remained silent
as the SEB passes illegal rules,
as members attend Trump rallies,
and as they disclose that they have pecuniary interests
that can only be realized if Trump wins the presidency.
Governor Kemp, you and your party talk a lot about election integrity.
Well, Georgians know that the highest form of election integrity is allowing election
results to reflect the will of the voters no matter what that is.
The time to take a stand is now.
Good morning.
My name is Reverend Dr. David Alexander from the Spiritual Living Center of Atlanta and
on Monday when I opened social media feed and read my State Senator, the Bill of Islam
Parks's letter to Governor Kim.
I knew that we had not just a civil rights issue, a legal issue, but also a moral issue
before us.
And so we crafted a letter, sent it out to clergy across the state, and I'm proud to be
standing here today with clergy from across the city and the state behind me on the steps
representing 97 signatures that have already been added to the letter and the list is growing.
Our letter that we are delivering to the governor today says this.
Dear Governor Kim, we, the undersigned clergy from across the great state of Georgia, write
to you out of a deep sense of moral urgency regarding the actions of these members of
the Senate election board.
Specifically we were requesting the immediate investigation into the actions of the aforementioned
members for violation of their statutory code of ethics applicable to state employees,
as well as their intentional disregard of the Open Meetings Act.
As outlined in the letter your office received from Senator Nebula Islam Parks on August 19th,
These violations warrant immediate investigation and corrective action in order to protect
the integrity of public trust in our elections.
Our concerns extend beyond mere legal violations.
We believe these actions strike at the very heart of the democratic process and the sanctity
of the voice of the people of Georgia.
As clergy, we are tasked with nurturing the spiritual well-being of our congregations,
And part of this duty involves standing up for justice, integrity, and the protection
of every person's God-given right to be heard.
I'm Reverend Misha Sanders, Community Minister and Chaplain in the Unitarian Universalist
Tradition, part two of this letter drafted by my colleagues.
In the ancient Hebrew creation story, the word coal is used for voice, the very essence
of divine communication. That same word in modern Hebrew translates to vote. It is no coincidence.
We believe that for people created in God's image, which includes all of us, our voice
is our vote. When actions are taken to suppress, manipulate, or undermine that voice, it is
is an affront not only to our democracy but also to our shared moral values and the inherent
spiritual dignity of all citizens.
The behavior of the previously named members of the State Elections Board undermines the
trust the people of Georgia have placed in their leaders to administer elections fairly
and openly.
Our violations of transparency and ethical conduct see to threaten and hinder the true expression
of the will of the people and put at grave risk the very integrity of our electoral system.
Good morning.
I'm Bishop Sanya, E. Williams of the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, South Region,
and also RIM Fellowship UCC here in Atlanta.
We are well aware, as you are Governor Kemp, of the high stakes of this election and the
high tensions in our communities.
The nation's eyes will focus squarely on the great state of Georgia in November, and
we cannot afford even the smallest implication of bias or unjust handling of our citizens'
most sacred right.
We ask you, Governor Kim, as a leader with the responsibility to uphold the principles of
fairness and justice to act in defense of our state's democratic values.
We request the immediate removal of these individuals from the SEB in accordance with the law
and in alignment with the moral and imperative to ensure that every Georgian's voice and
their vote and our election integrity is protected.
In the spirit of justice and the pursuit of righteousness, we trust you that you will
consider this request with the seriousness it demands.
And, serially, Georgia Clergy.
This concludes our press conference, and we are also open to any questions that the
media may have.
The governor of the office has released a statement during this press conference saying he does not know how to get forward in the past, related to the state election board to best make it a review.
We've seen a river of hatred during the office, and we've been in.
Do y'all believe in that he does have the authority?
First aid code, he absolutely has the authority to convene a hearing.
And there's also precedent on former cases, as well.
Thank you very much.
I'm Spokane, the Chief of the Render,
and the Governor of Finland,
and the Governor, and the Renator offices
on this matter, and the Governor of Canada,
and the official letters that house that was absent.
Absolutely.
So with respect to the house side,
we sent out the letter last week on August 19th,
Speaker Burns office.
We have not received any reply yet.
What's the time line for every deadline
the government would have made an decision if that was a winery.
OCGA 4510-4 sets forth the procedure that the governor must follow.
He must send a request over to the Office of Administrative Hearings.
That office will then appoint an administrative law judge.
However, there is no time frame within the statute.
This procedure has been adhered to in numerous other cases prior to this case.
It's clear that Governor has the mandatory requirement to send it over to the Office
of Administrative Hearings for the appointment of a Administrative Law just.
The hearing cannot be held before 30 days notice to the persons who are charged.
Can you give an example of the precedent you're talking about?
Yet as a case out of Spalding County involving Oscar Stokes,
I know about that case because I'm from Spalding County.
I read that case.
That case occurred several years ago.
I can't tell you the exact date without looking at the case.
But that case involved a very same procedure.
Oscar Stokes was a member of the school board.
He was charged with certain ethical violations.
The matter went to the governor's office,
the governor appointed an administrative law judge
through the Office of Administrative Hearings,
and that matter was held,
recommendation was made to the governor.
How much of the issue that you're raising today
is related to the law and laws that the Republican
legislature passed over the last couple of sessions
that sort of encourage the kind of voter suppression
every suppression that you're describing versus merely asking the governor to do what you call the right thing.
Well, look, after Trump lost the state in 2020, we saw Republicans in the state legislature pass law after law taking bipartisan local election boards and making the majority Republican.
We had never done that before, and now with these new rules, it has set up an unfair advantage
for the Republican Party if they choose to do so to delay or deny certification of county
election results.
And so this has just been a slow process, a death by a thousand cuts, and we are standing
here today to object to that and demanding that the governor take action and remove these
corrupt election board members.
That's a good question. These changes that have recently been made were made after persons
who are candidates for office qualified to become candidates for office. That's a good
The good question is as to whether or not these changes can even apply to those persons
after they have basically set forth their course of action to around for office and then
the rules of the game are changed after they became candidates to that particular office.
That question is a good question and I have to be answered by a court probably that would
be an injunction file that will seek to keep these rules from going into effect at the
last minute.
In fact, the Attorney General, excuse me, the Secretary of State has indicated that these
rule changes are misguided, they're being implemented by individuals who are unelected bureaucrats
who have no election experience and who refuse to accept the advice of people who do.
So there's a good question as to whether or not these rule changes, some of which violates
that existing state law should ever be considered in the first place.
So that's some questions there.
That's a good question.
We'll have to answer that through the courts.
So look, I mean I think what we're calling for is a lowering of the temperature right now
to call out these extremists who want to go beyond the law
and bring them back within the confines of the law.
And what's going to happen is if we don't do that now
before temperatures are even more heightened,
we're going to get to election night,
and one side's going to be very upset,
and one side is going to be very, very happy.
And we're going to have even more divide
in between the two factions that are in Georgia.
That will get evil worse.
That will be exacerbated if we get
into these election certification delays, right?
If we start calling into question the result of the election,
We saw that plainly in 2020.
It will exacerbate divides that already exist.
So we need the governor and Republican leadership
to step up to be the adults in the room,
to call out these extremists and tell them
what they are doing is wrong.
And if they want their candidate to win,
then he has to win fair and square.
That's what we need.
All right, well, thank you so much.
That's it for questions.
We appreciate you being here.
