Well, good afternoon. Happy Monday. What a beautiful day, huh? Full of promise and just it's a
great day. Great day to be in Georgia. We will begin our day with a scripture reading in prayer
by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this
morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 117th House District, representative Houston
Games, Representative Games.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I'm honored to introduce my friend and a great Athenian Reverend Abraham Mosley
a Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.
Reverend Mosley just celebrated his 45th pastoral anniversary at Mount Pleasant.
First name pastor of his church in 1974.
Moses began preaching in August of 1968, giving his first sermon at Israel Baptist Church
after being called to ministry upon the death of Martin Luther King Jr. While preaching
and teaching the Word of God, Reverend Moses has grown the church's congregation significantly
over the last 45 years, built a larger sanctuary and renovated the church's facilities and
amenities. Today, we're also honored to have several members of the church here with
this the congregation up in the gallery.
We're honored to have you and several deacons of the church
with us this afternoon as well.
Thank you all for being here.
I'll never forget the first time I visit Reverend
Mosley's church.
The occasion was his 40th pastoral anniversary,
and I was working for Athens Mayor Nancy Denson,
who were also honored to have here with us today.
She just celebrated her 80th birthday last week,
so we're honored to have Mayor Denson with us as well.
But the service began around 10 a.m. and I was running a little late myself, so I decided
to hold off on food and coffee until after the service.
Well, I'll never forget about four hours later that I was very hungry, and so I learned
to make sure I eat before church.
And yesterday I saw Reverend Mosley at our good friend Reverend Robert Finch's installation
services at Phillips Grove Church, and I reiterated to Reverend Mosley five minutes, five minutes
today.
So, but after Super Bowl Sunday, we look forward to your words of wisdom and getting this
house back up and moving.
Please join me in welcoming Reverend Abraham Mosley.
Good afternoon.
To the Honourable House Speaker, Speaker Austin, House Majority Leader Burns, House Minority
leader, Trunel, and all members of this distinguished legislative bodies, and
representative Houston Gaines extended the imitation to offer words of
encouragement or inspiration. I didn't know whether to thank God or ask him why
me. I didn't know whether to rejoice or sink my head in the locks of my
my shoulder. One thing I didn't know, and one thing that I was sure of, that I needed
to pray. For the rare and unused opportunity to address this honorable and renowned body,
I am very grateful.
Lawmakers have an awesome responsibility.
Laws that are enacted do not only affect the present affairs
of the state of Georgia, but they also
have binding implication for the future as well.
Therefore, in our state house, we need more
statesman and few politician. Statesman makes decision with the next generation in mind,
while politician makes decision with the next election in mind. Thus, the statesman makes
This decision based on character while the politician usually makes the decision based
on convenience.
First Caribbean 13, Paul talks about love.
Love is the greatest thing in the world and the highest virtue one can possess.
Indeed love is the prevailing theme in the Bible.
love embrace both God's grace and God's mercy and his manifests are revealed in
unseffish, lawyer and benevolent concern for the well-being of others. And the
New Testament idea, love is the fulfilment of the Old Testament law. Jesus stated
that the greatest commandment is the love of our neighbors. As we love our
says, Jesus further declared that his disciple would be known by the love they have for
others. In essence, love is displayed and what we do for others. This ethical dimension
of love is expressed as gestures. An Old Testament gesture, you see, they will benefit
how justly and equally the resources of the earth are
distributed, advantage of social life or shared, and
opportunity for educational, vocational and economic
attainment are available, and liberty for participation
in the fullness of life are open to all.
The chapter in love follows Paul teaching on spiritual
give. Paul caution us that our various gift, talent, skills,
and ability to mean live unless the motive of our service is
live. I, as a minister of the gospel, you as an elected official,
have the Austin, Austin challenging and responsibility to help
usher in the beloved community by using our position of power
prestige and privilege to execute justice by correcting existing matters of
abuse, condemning oppression, legislating laws that meets the needs of all the
people, rich and poor, city and rule, laws that ensure adequate ways to
safe environment and an aquatic standard of living for all. Love says, I won't
for you. The same good are best that I won't for myself. Paul said love is the
most excellent way. Let us pray.
Eternal God, we acknowledge that you are the creator of the universe, that you
because you sustain all that was created,
for the privilege to call upon your name and prayer,
for the blessing to be admitted
and to your divine and holy present,
for hearing us as we pray orderly and silently, we thank you.
We pray that you will continue to bless the leaders
of Iowa State government,
that they will work together with a cooperative spirit,
Bless them with health, a body, mind, and soul.
Bless them with courage and the willingness
to make the decision that are needed to make Georgia
a great state.
A state that the citizens will continue to be proud on,
that heaven will continue to be pleased with
and smile favorably up on.
Bless the leadership and the membership
of this government body.
And bless all who contribute to the proper function
of government and all who are the recipient of the benefit of the government.
We pray, O Lord, through us, reach the hungry and the homeless, through us, consider those
in prison, through us, have compassion for the sick and the bereaved, through us, clean
up our neighborhood, for your goodness and kindness, to us, we pledge to renew our love
for you, and to pledge to continue to exercise our faith in you.
It is in your precious name.
We pray, amen.
Congratulations to the Father of the United States of America.
And we're going to be covered for which it stands.
One will make you come and God will deliver you.
And we will deliver you in fact to the Father.
Doorkeepers will unlock the doors.

Good morning, colleagues of the House.
Today I rise on behalf of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus
with just a moment in Black history.
Black history month was started as a Black history week
by none other than Carter G. Woodson in 1875
to recognize the attributes and contributions
of African-Americans and people of the Black diaspora.
Today I stand to remember the original 33,
who were the first 33 African-Americans
of the Georgia General Assembly.
They were elected to office in 1868 during reconstruction.
They were among the first African-American state legislators
in the United States,
24 of the members were ministers.
The members were expelled in September 1868.
The legislators petitioned the federal government
and state courts.
Today I stand to remember the 33 legislators who
sat in the seats where you said today.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Representative Larickia for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today we'd like to welcome and recognize the members of the Okifinoki Risa from down
in my neck of the woods, both the superintendents and the executive director up in the gallon
if you please stand.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for what you do back home.
Thank you, Ms. Picker.
Chair recognizes representative Stovall for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
I come to express my concerns with a decrease in the access for 19th and 10th graders with
the dual enrollment student who are dual enrollment students.
For some, the rules may need to change to ensure fairness.
Then let's focus on that part.
If the concerns are limited to funding
for the future of the program, let's look at other cost savings.
The benefit of the program, outweighs the expected outcome.
One cost saving needs to change the funding allotment
so that online and on-site would not be the same amount.
Why is there a difference in the cost for a student
who takes a dual enrollment at the school versus online?
Only 19th and 10th graders can also do online with dual enrollment.
The second saving is to revise the double payout
to the school systems with dual enrollment students.
It's my understanding that the FTE for each student
and then allotment is split between the school systems
and the colleges.
While the school system's being funded twice
and how much additional savings could be made,
what programs would be in place at the schools
for those students who are not never gonna be eligible
for dual enrollment since there be eliminated
from the dual enrollment program.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
.
recognizes Representative Mathy Ack for a morning order.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and great afternoon.

Chair recognizes for a morning order,
Chairman Hogan and Chairman Austin.

Chief wide receiver,

wide receiver, Tyree Hill, who graduated from
Coffee County High School. All played a prominent role
in last night's game, and we're proud that their Georgia grown.

of growing the grass used at the Super Bowl last night.
Tiff Way 419, also it's known, was developed
as a science program for within the University of Georgia
and six of the seven years Mark Pollock
and Richard Witt to find folks at Pro Tiff
in a lapahole where I'm from.
And also it was grown.
This is the representative's territory here.
and I just phased in a little bit,
but I'd like to heard say something too.
It was grown in Enigma,
and the former Senator Bobby Rowan called
the representative today to let her know
that it was grown in Enigma.
And I'm proud to be from the community of a Lapa Hall
and support this business that plays an integral role
in the biggest game of sports.
Thank you very much.
And thank you.
And if you get a chance through the Wall Street Journal,
