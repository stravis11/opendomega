I came in humming this morning an old song that probably a few of you remember. Who will stop the rain? I hear some of your laughing. You remember that song, don't you? We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 176 House District Representative James Berchett. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Public colleagues, it is my distinct honor to be able to introduce to you my pastor. I can't tell you how much this man means to me. He's the man that married my wife and I. So he's put me in a better position already with that. And he is a true servant to our community. Before I introduce him, I want to recognize two of his three daughters. Would you please stand with me? Please welcome them to the House, Donna Rowe, Candy Thrift, and his son-in-law Buddy Thrift. Brother Clayton Davis, like I said, is my pastor. He's been preaching the word longer than I have been alive. He's been preaching and we just found out 46 years. I can't say enough about this gentleman. He is when he's not in the pulpit, he is out in the community. He's delivering the word to nursing homes and children and anybody that will listen. He has a way of breaking it down for people like me to where it really touches your heart. So without further ado, my pastor, Brother Clayton Davis. Thank you James. Would like to say to all of you, making short and sweet son of a once-minute hitch you below the knees and all that, but I didn't come up setting nobody. But it's the fact I'm here for the testimony of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. John the revelator said on the aisle of Pat, my sight was what he was there for. You know we think about churches, different nominations and everything, but it's really all about God Almighty and His Son, Jesus and the Holy Ghost. You can't have one of them without the other. There's no way to get to heaven, but one way and that's through Jesus Christ. He's the gate, He's the door and you'll never make it any other way. Let me encourage y'all, y'all ladies and gentlemen, y'all all representing a county somewhere more than one. Do the very best you can, but do not the late your family and your church and your God. Because that's more important than a lot of other things in life. God provides everything that we need today, tomorrow and forevermore. And anytime you think the burdens get heavy and you can't hardly bear them, just stop and think about where Christ went for you and I. One between the heaven and earth, that's to be in born and it's very important to remember born of a virgin Mary preached, he's own gospel home between the heaven and earth. The Bible says, the wrong souls are coming and precious the sword, then to his side, for with came blood and water on us to cleanse ever sin. This ever been or ever will be committed under the canopy of heaven. What a wonderful Savior. Let me encourage if you don't know him, you need to get acquainted with him because there is a heaven again and a hell of shun. That's we go in one way or the other. You can't be like the man's bird dog jumped up on the fence and he's seen the quail over there and he just hung on the fence. He had to finally fall on in there with him. If you a bird hunter, you know what I'm talking about when they point a good dog, he means business. And you and I serve in the Lord, we need to be business all the way. And I'm not talking about playing church. Ever church has got people at play church. That's somebody that's not men's save. That's somebody that's kind of hypocritein along. Oh, when it got none here. Huh? Boy, me or amen? But we love you, like the let you know that we appreciate our daughters and son and love coming and being with us. And you know, I think about Antlon and I listen, I y'all love Antlon and thank God you do because I'm not going to take it from you. But I got a flanking. God made heaven and earth and man made Antlon. Let us pray. If you like to, you can pray with us. Our Father, which are in heaven, hello be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespass as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not in the temptation but deliver from evil for lies the kingdom, the power and the glory and forever and amen and amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the flag of the United States of America. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

I want to recognize a lady named Rebecca Ray, who is in a gower. Please stand up, Rebecca, with her family and her principal. She is a fourth grade teacher at Elbow County Elementary School. She is a member of the 2020 class of extraordinary educators in the United States. There's only 31 in the whole country, and we have one in Elbow County. There's teachers and then there's teachers who go beyond the school building, looking after the students and taking an interest in making a difference in their personal lives. Rebecca is one of those teachers, and I just want all of y'all to know that we do it right in Elbow County and rule Georgia. So congratulations, Rebecca. Chair recognizes Representative Beesmore for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, colleagues and friends. I want to share with you a black woman in history who happens to be my grandmother. Her name was Frazel Booker, and she originated from South Carolina, and then she moved to New York. She stood for injustice, and when she saw where we lived that the Woolwerfs would not allow blacks to sit at the counter to be served, she stood outside protesting. I can see the picture right now today, and it made a change, and it made a change in my life. And I want you to know also that she looked good doing it. And I think that's where I get it from. But yes, she was a pioneer in that era and in that location. And I thank my grandmother so much. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Williamson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Here's the House. I've here rise today to recognize Walton Youth Advocacy. Walton Youth Advocacy does a great job mentoring young people at risk in Walton County. They're here today, unfortunately, and they're not in the gallery. They don't get a photo with the governor. But if you could join me and give them round of applause for Walton Youth Advocacy. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Marin for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, Buenos días. I want to recognize today in command Mr. Raúl Thomas. And I want to thank Mr. Raúl Thomas as an owner and founder of Marieta's new theater in the square. He founded in 2015. He acquired a building and he's a thriving nonprofit, arts organization in Cup County. I know Raúl because we have worked together for many years, especially on the recovery of the island of Puerto Rico in 2017 to get some. In fact, we did like 12 containers full of knee waters and things for the hurricane and also now for the earthquake. Raúl is in the gallery with us today. I'd like for members to rise up and acknowledge a great leader in the community and the Latino community, Mr. Raúl Thomas. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, it's a big honor for me to serve on the Governor's new committee to fight our virus and what is happening in our state in regard to the spread of this new epidemic that's hitting our country. And one of the things that's highly recommended is that everybody get a flu shot. Now, the flu shot will not keep you from getting this new type of virus. But what it will do is protect you and your family from getting a bad case of the flu and ending up taking a hospital bed that we may need. And we'll be giving flu shots for members of the House and the Senate between one and three this afternoon in the medical aid station. They do ask that you bring your insurance card with you. Hopefully you are carrying it. If you're not, go down and talk to them. But please, if you have not had a flu shot, it is still flu season. It lowers your immunity. So please take advantage of the fact that you can get a flu shot here in the capital one to three in the medical aid station. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Cantrell for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senator Colleagues and members of the gallery, I'd like to do two things. Just more than like to issue a reminder and ask for a favor. I want to remind you that this weekend is the great weekend when we get to spring forward in our time. So suddenly morning, when all of you, which I know all of you will, get up early to go to church and you felt like you slept an hour less than usual, you did. And I'm going to give you an opportunity, hopefully, next week, over the next couple of weeks to lock the clock and bring it into this silly changing of the clock back and forth twice a year, which Rex Havick on our health or education creates all kinds of problems for society. Also, when I secondly announced that Jane and I found out that we are grandparents, expecting our first child in July. Thank you. And the color of this suit may or may not indicate the gender of that child. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Turner for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize an issue that is near and dear to my heart. When I first got here, autism policy in Georgia, was it really a cool thing? And today is autism awareness day at the Capitol. And we are joined by some very special guests, some self advocates. If you are here for autism awareness day, would you please rise so we can thank you for your work? Thank you all for being here. We really appreciate it. Your voice is so important because while we have made great progress on autism policy in Georgia, there is still so much work to do. And we're so glad that you're here today and welcome to the Capitol on autism awareness day. Chair recognizes representative Gamble for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I stayed up late yesterday, making y'all cookies. You got one on your desk. Today is Boys and Girls Club day here at the State Capitol, where we will recognize our youth of the year. Now many of you have a Boys and Girls Club in your community and you know the great work that it does. Many of our pages that are serving today are members of our local clubs. So y'all please take it opportunity to encourage them and appreciate the great work that our clubs do throughout the state. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Gertler for the final 20 seconds. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I like all of you have received receiving thousands of emails, phone calls and text messages urging for the passage of constitutional carry. We finally have a governor now willing to sign constitutional carry into law. It is a responsibility of this legislative body to make law and to do the will of the people. After all, this is the people's house. All Biden citizens deserve better. We come to a point that society has expired. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Complete some morning orders. Chair recognizes representative Hugley to introduce the doctor of the day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure this morning to introduce our doctor of the day. She's Dr. Komisha Harvison.

He was the director. I was actually in the play 30 years ago. We weren't nearly as successful as they are. My current work with them for 30 years. I appreciate all of his hard work. I want to turn it over to Dr. Kim Waters. She's taken over the program. She's turned into something really special and very proud of all of her leadership. Thank you. Thank you, Representative Barton. Bright Star is a story about redemption and hope. The students said that they thought that the quote we should say this morning is the one that we adopted from this text. Truth walks beside us like a shadow. One day it merges with us until it does. We are never truly whole. Thank you again for recognizing us today. Thank you. I want to read the caption to House Resolution 1194. House Resolution 1194 by Rufz.

It is very special for me today to get to introduce my friend, Judge George Krieger. He is one of my constituents and it's very special to get to share this with everybody in this room. He was a member of this body in the 1970s for eight years, I believe from 71 to 79, right? 69 to 77 and he used to sit right over there next to the door of the anti-room. He has been on the bench since 1979 and of note established one of the first accountability drug courts in the state of Georgia and Kyle Kionne and has been a model that many others have replicated and over 600 graduates from that drug court, 600 lives changed and saved. It is such an honor to get to present Judge Krieger to this body today and Judge Krieger if you'd like to say a word. Well thank you Mr. Speaker. It's really an honor to be back in the House after 40 years. I want to thank the members of the General Assembly in particular the House of Representatives for the support you give to the accountability courts and it's through your work and support of our courts that we're able to save these lives. There's nothing like being at a graduation and a parent comes up to you and say, with this program you have saved my child's life and that really makes you feel that you accomplish something. The accountability courts are one of the best things the court system has ever done and it's just my... Okay we're going now to start some business. Chair recognizes the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman England for a motion. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

House Bill 1054 by our Representative Cooper, the 43rd and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 12 of Title 31 of the fiscal to Georgia and attend a relating to control of hazardous conditions, preventable diseases, and mental biologic disorders as well as refer to the Committee on Health and Human Services. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. The Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I bring to you today the substitute to House Bill 1054. Every newborn that's born in the hospital across Georgia is very quickly within 24 hours screened for a number of metabolic disorders that if are not diagnosed can cause lifelong disabilities to the child or even death. These are disorders that we have that are rare but that we have finally developed ways to treat them to lessen either cure them or lessen the destruction they do to these children's bodies. Each year the federal government has a committee that reviews new and proposed illnesses to be added to this list of the ones that they recommend that each day cover. In our state we have a really lag time and getting those up for consideration. This bill reorganizes that. Shortens the length of time it will take gives a one year period for a committee that is already established to review what is being proposed by the federal government and then to make a recommendation to us about which one should be funded and included into our list. This is a critical need medical science is moving us forward at a very very rapid pace and we certainly want to alleviate any newborns child of being permanently disabled or even die when it all possible. If there's no questions Mr. Speaker I will yield a well and ask for a favorable vote on the substitute to House Bill 1054. You have a question if you care to yield. I will yield for a question Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Larricia to your right for a question. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Does the gentleman let you? I will. Thank you so much for your work on this. Is it not true that I brought a young person to your committee a couple of years ago that had a very life threatening disease that was not detected soon enough and they were fortunate to rush that child up here and got the help the medical help that they needed and now that child is healthy and thriving and that they depend on people like you to work on this legislation to make sure they're cared for. It's true you did and that child could have been permanently disabled or even died and I'm glad to see how well she has developed. Thank you so much. Thank you for bringing her to our attention and thank you to the members I hope we will have a positive vote on this legislation. Thank you Mr. Speaker I yield a well. We have no further questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute the chair here is none? The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 1054 will vote aye those opposed the vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1054 the eyes are 161 the nays or zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 859. House Bill 859 by Representative Perkle of the 150 fifth. We taut on an act to amend code section 48. The 73.1 of the fiscal to Georgia and Tate are relating the detentic of windows or wind shields. So it's to provide for a maximum monetary penalty. This bill then refer to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee.

The substitute. Chair recognizes a representative percol to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Speaker. Fellow members, I bring for your consideration House Bill 859, some have referred to this bill as the window tinting bill. And in genders, a pretty good bit of support and interest. Those two words window tint second only around this place to maybe go dogs. I still didn't get your attention. Here we go. Let me assure you this bill has nothing to do with the amount of light that we as a state allowed to be refracted, reflected or transmitted through a window or windshield. Something changes regarding the window tinting that we're allowed. This provides consistency in a violation for state penalty. Currently, if I get pulled over for seatbelt violation, anywhere in this great state from Ashburn to Alpharetta, I have one penalty. There is one charge, not so, with the window tinting. I called 12 different municipalities and I received 12 different penalties for violation of state code 40-8-73.1. Colleague told me that he wants new of a community that charged almost $1,000 for a window tinted violation. This bill is this ridden merely establishes a consistent state maximum penalty, $50 for the first violation, $75 for the second and subsequent. Last week I asked the speaker to allow me to recommit this bill to rules because some thought the fee was too low at $25. While I preferred $25, I did provide a compromise. Now it's $50 and $75 for subsequent. Now I've got members that think it's too high. Perhaps I have hit that Goldilocks mark, not too hot, not too cold, and perhaps just right. Mr. Speaker, this is the bill. Do you yield for questions? Yes sir, I will. The chair recognizes Chairman Parsons to your left for a question. Oh, thank you, Speaker, it's Jim and Neil. Yes sir. So the gentleman in the well, I'm still a little confused about how this works though. As opposed to a seat belt violation, when you have the citation for that, then you know that you have to wear your seat belt and then head to pay your fine, $15, I think it is, and you know that you can be fine again if you don't have your seat belt on. With this, if you're, if you're, get a citation for this particular offense and you drive on down the road, you're still in violation of the law. I don't understand how you can just get a whatever monetary citation that is and continue to continue to be a violation law. Is that not correct? That is true. That is true. This bill does nothing to address that the way it is currently. It's just now currently there are some punitive fines that are associated. So we see this often. We can see this often in communities surrounding, say, Air Force bases, Army bases where we have military men and women that come in from Florida and Arizona where quite frankly it's, it's pretty hot there. And they have their windows tinted. They are not citizens in the community where they can vote for the mayor or for the city council, but they will, they will set up shop and ill-write ticket after ticket for these, for these people. This just puts a state consistent maximum penalty for a state law. Does gentleman yield again? Yes, sir, I will. Is this not true though that when this legislation or when these, this was eventually originally putting code about the windows being dark in a way. Isn't that a law enforcement issue? That law enforcement can actually go up to a vehicle and not tell what the person behind the window is doing whether the brand is doing a firearm or not. That is true and that's one of the reasons for the window tinting law and I did not change anything that relates to how dark the windows can be. Consistency and a penalty for a state violation. Okay, just if I may just one more time, make sure I'm clear about this. So a person could get a citation for it who literally has a window darkened where law enforcement couldn't see what they're doing or whether not they have a firearm but they can continue to drive their car or vehicle, whichever it is until they get another citation and then they just have to pay the fine again. Yes, sir, that is the way it currently is in law and this particular bill does nothing to address that concern. Thank you, appreciate it. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the will because of the time of the day. Thank you. Gentlemen has yielded the will. Is on the previous question is ordered what purpose does Chairman Powell rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, I did want to ask a question of the author. And is it not also true that while I applaud his diligence in trying to put uniformity and let penalties reflect the offense on this, somewhere along the line, this got changed from the time it left the committee until the time it appeared on the floor. Is that not true? Yes, the gentleman so states. Further inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the biggest angst that I have to this is that somewhere these supplemental charges, they're on top of the penalty that we call supplements or whatever that may be called, that they've been added which would almost not quite double, but it would put another 50% of the cost on these fines of practice that for too long has been used and we need to look at. If the gentleman so states, what purpose is representative, all Williams rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that this levels the playing field and takes away some of the egregious fines that we're seeing, especially on state lines? I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute to chair here's none, the committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute or adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here's none, the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill or vote aye, those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 859. The eyes are 139, the nays are 26, this bill. Having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 847. House Bill 847, the Court of the 174th and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 23, the official to Georgia and Tate of Relating and Hemf Farming, so to provide definitions provided for penalties. This bill ever referred to the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I'll bring before you House Bill 847, LC441462S. Basically this bill, we're doing five things with this bill. The first thing we're doing is cleaning up some language from last year, adding some stuff that the USDA didn't have their rules and regs out to late in the year last year. So this gets us an alignment with their requirements. That's the first thing we do. The second thing we clarify that the college and universities can do on farm research and contract with third parties. This clears up, clarifies that. Third thing we're doing, we're adding language to allow greenhouse growers to sell plants to other growers and also we're allowing growers to sell to other processors that might be located in another state as long as they have an approved plan with USDA. The fourth thing we did, we increased the fee for the process of starting the second year. And this is to help make the program self sustainable. And then the fifth thing we're doing, we're codifying the transportation requirements that they have to have when they're transporting in the state. And this is that request of the industry. They wanted that. They wanted something that they can have some certainty to what they need to have. It's the same and the same as it is in the Eccles County. So that was asked by the industry. So basically that's what the bill does and I would stand for any questions. Any new yield for questions? I do. Chair recognizes representative Wilson to your right for a question. Well the gentleman yield. I do. Is it not true that I filed a minority report on this bill? The gentleman knows what he speaks. Is it the gentleman further yield? I do. Is it not also true that the substitute address the concerns that I have and therefore I'll be supporting this bill? I believe that to be true. Thank you. Do you further yield? I'll take one more respect. Chair recognizes representative Turner to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well the gentleman yield. I do. Is it true that I'm very grateful for the hard work and dedication you put in to making sure that we have a legal safe access to production for hemp in this state and that the vast majority of the changes that you've made in the rules committee have addressed all of those concerns that I had mentioned in committee. I believe that to be true. Thank you for this bill, sir. Thank you. I'll yield the whale and I ask for your favour consideration. There is, as there any objection to the previous question being ordered, the chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. There is a minority report. He waves. What purposes chairman McCall rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary. State jury inquiry. Is it not true that we have dealt with this for the last two years in chairman call but has done an excellent job dealing with this and that it is now crunch time that we need to pass this to give the farmers and Georgia the opportunity to grow a new crop if they chose to do that. We are not making decisions for them but we are giving them the opportunity to maybe grow another crop that they can make a profit on and we all need to vote for this bill. Get it to the Senate where they can hurry up and do something and give the farmers in this state another opportunity. Thanks, sir. I try not to express an opinion to a parliamentary inquiry but that was well put. What purpose is representative Bentley rise? Parliamentary inquiry. I couldn't hear. I'm sorry. Parliamentary. State jury inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that I, a rule of Georgia legislator, represent the Fort Valley State University and a member of the agriculture committee supports House Bill 847? I am sure that the lady absolutely knows what she's saying. Okay, is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute to chair here's none the committee substitute is withdrawn? Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here's none the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 847 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 847. The eyes are 159 the nays are seven. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The chair recognizes chairman England for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this House insists on its position on House Bill 792 and that a committee of conference be appointed. That's the Supplemental Appropriations Act. And England has moved that this House insists on its position on the House Disagreement to the Senate's substitute to House Bill 792 and that a committee of conference be appointed to clerk or read the caption.

Any single county water or sewer authority is already exempt from sales tax decisions. There are many county authorities as well. No opposition to the bill. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer a question. You have a question if you care to yield. I'll yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Benton to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chairman Neal. I do. Is it not true that this bill will benefit the Bear Creek Reservoir based on counties of Jackson, Barrow, Clark and O'Connor. That's correct and really important bill for our region. Appreciate the question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, as you yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none.

This is our annual conveyance proposal and the resolution authorizes the state of Georgia acting through its state properties commission to convey or lease certain state-owned properties as we have. And these include Fulton County, Glen County, Gordon County, Muscogee, Paulden, Paulden, Raven and Terrell County. In the rules committee we had to do a little addition to Muscogee and Terrell County and these were just some errors that we wanted to take care of. So Mr. Speaker, that's the resolution, the substitute to House Resolution 1167. If there are no questions, I yield the well. There are no questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to Chair Hearson on? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute?

This resolution having been referred to the committee on state properties that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Dunahue to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you our annual easements that we do every year for Georgia Power EMCs, Pike Electric, our gas companies. These easement rights take the opportunity for these power companies through freezing rain, power outages to come on properties that we can throw and they pay a small fee. The ones that will be in this year's Barrel County, Cowhoon and Daltree County, Chatham County, Cherokee County, Clayton County, Cobb, Cobb, Chris County, Chris County, Douglas County, McIntosh County, McIntosh, Muscogee, Polling and Poke Richmond and that pretty much are the easements that we have granted for this year. Any questions? The yield. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Frazier to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Chairman, I have a question in reference to Richmond County. Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that four out of five of the Augusta Richmond County delegation members oppose this easement that has been placed in for the Hell House in Augusta Richmond County because of the concerns of the residents and their property value? Yes, ma'am. That is a true statement. However, this is an easement that goes on a 20 acre piece of property that is an old convent. With this, this is allow the technical college there the opportunity to not go through the neighborhood but through this easement only. The others that represented it was basically to build a facility for first responders, thus people that have gone through trauma that basically are your firemen, your policemen people of that sort. For the question? Yes, ma'am. Is it not true that the Augusta Richmond County has a planning and zoning board with 10 members that is truly close to the city?

capable of making that decision for Richmond County. If the true lady says so. And one further question, Mr. Chairman. Is it not true that the citizens that live adjacent to this area is not, is, is opposing this because they are concerned not only for the property value, but because of the fact that we are now letting the Georgia general assembly decide on what we're going to do with our local municipalities. It will. With that, I understand your question, but it still comes down to, they will still have the choice. We're just passing our legislation as we always do. And it will come down still to the decision of the people there. Thank you. Do you, your yield for further questions? I'll, I'll take another one. Chair recognizes chairman Newton to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker with the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. Does it this easement is on the opposite side of the property is the neighborhood that was concerned about the traffic? So won't this easement by being on the complete opposite side of this 20 acres give the local zoning board the option to come in from that to close the access from the neighborhood and therefore protect this neighborhood from any increased traffic, even if it was for a good cause, it'll protect them from the increased traffic that might have come through their neighborhood for any other use. But by being on the opposite side of 20 acres that gives still the local zoning board gets the final say. So it doesn't usurp that, but it gives them an option with the state's support. The gentleman knows as he speaks. Well, thank you for this legislation. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen is yielded the well. We have other members that wish to be heard on the measure. The chair recognizes the minority leader of the house, leader, tremble to speak to the bill or the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, I'm just going to talk about process. I don't have an easement in house resolution 1094. But what I do have as a member of this body is a stake in the way that we go about our business, just like each and every one of us in this chamber. And this should be a very straightforward bill every time. Where if there's a state property issue that there's a state property and someone needs an easement through it, it shouldn't be a controversial decision. We are not a local zoning board. We do not congregate here to make land use decisions. And we come here to make the decisions for the state of Georgia and to represent our districts. So the first test that I think we all have when we look at legislation or that we all should have when we look at legislation is how does this impact my district? And if someone tried to put an easement in my district through a state property that I was opposed to, I very much hope that my colleagues in this body would say time out. This is representative tramels district. And I'm going to defer to representative tramel when it comes to the situation in his district with respect to the easement. That's just a very straightforward notion of fairness. No one would like if someone else came from outside their county and outside their district and tried to do something that they were opposed to. And forced this body to take a vote on it and preempt that member. And that's what Article 15 in House Resolution 1094 does with respect to the easement and Richmond County. There are other members who can speak to the issue about the project in Richmond County. And I'm not here to do that. But I am here to tell you that when we do this, today it's Richmond County. Tomorrow it might be Columbia County. Might be Mayor Weather County. Might be troop County. So I'm going to make a motion because we've got time. This is just a 25. There's no hurry on it. We got time to get it right. Let's get it right. Let's send it back to rules. Let's amend it either to take it out or to say that it's contingent on approval of the local governing authorities decision. That's all we have to do. Because there's no, there's no hurry or urgency. If they do that, the local government makes these approvals for this project. They can always come back and ask for this easement. So I think the members for their time and the tension and I would urge the members to think about what we're doing. Let's get it right. Let's get it right because we have time. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Chair recognizes representative Howard to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would second that motion from our leader if he were to make that motion. And I will tell you here to Mr. Speaker and to my colleagues. Obviously, you know that I'm here to oppose House Resolution 1094. Not in his full content, but in that section that involves Richmond County. And as you heard the chairman read off the list, he mentioned every one of those as power lines are some sort of utility line that's going through an access road by the state that the state properties has given. This particular piece of property has nothing to do with a power line or gas line. It's for a private health company to put an operation in the middle of a neighborhood that is opposing it and every last one of the elected officials in that that represents that district is opposed to it. So what we're doing here in my opinion that we have a governing body, our governing body here inserting itself into the local zoning matters before the before the local zoning and public and planning commission along with the commissioner and the commissioners and the mayor have the opportunity to go through the process. Of what a zoning board is established for and what a local governing body is established for. This body is inserting itself into the local bodies, local decisions of this of Richmond County. And it's real obvious. I mean, I don't have to sit here and give you a long speech to for you to see this. Every last one of those names counties that our chairman listed was utilities and gas lines. And this is not a utility or a gas line that's running through the state property that they need. So I would urge you to take a look and check your hearts. I mean, I'll tell you what I have one of the best seats in this house sitting back there in that corner. Every last one of these members in this body, you pass by me every day and we speak and we get along and we do think we conjugate and we we feel each other. We check on each other. But here we are asking someone or about to allow someone from a neighboring county to come into another county and in Richmond County and tell us what's good for our county. And we take offense to that. That's disturbing. And we urge you to not allow that to happen. Now, I would hope that this does not go down party lines because this is not a party issue. This is a local home rule issue. And I urge you appeal to your hearts and to your conscious to do what's right and not allow this measure to go through. So I'm sending it back to rules to be corrected and allow these other utility lines and fault lines that need to be dealt with. Let them go through as we do every year. We don't have these private companies coming in trying to insert themselves into the governmental business of this state and allow the local planning and zoning commission and the state and the local county commissioners and the mayor decide what is best for their city. So again, I appeal to you and ask you to vote no on this bill and allow it to take its course and the local jurisdiction. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Chair recognizes Voss chairman Dunahue for the chairman's time on House Resolution 1094. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to give the opportunity for chairman Fleming to take the rest of my time, please. Gentlemen has that right to chair recognizes chairman Fleming for the balance of the chairman's time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you Vice Chairman for allowing me to speak to this issue. I admire the two representatives that were in the well previous to me representative Howard because he's a friend we just disagree on this. I admire representative Tramble because he's clever. But I'm going to try to explain to you what I think is really going on here because I don't think it was how it was characterized. I wouldn't sure exactly how I was going to explain this to you, but representative Howard gave me an idea in his remarks he asked you to check your heart. So I'm going to ask you to check your heart and explain to you what's going on here. Ladies and gentlemen, you before in this house have unanimously voted to help our first responders. You have voted to help firemen. You have voted to help policemen and that is pretty much what you're about to vote on here in a second. And I'm going to ask you to vote to help firemen and I'm going to ask you to vote to help policemen and I'm going to explain to you how you can do that. As I understand that there is no location in the nation that helps the recovery process of firemen and policemen that have been through a traumatic event. If you're a police officer and you come upon a murder scene and you see two or three people who have been killed and blood everywhere, it has an effect on you. If you are a fireman and you have to pull a family out of a burning house and what happens to be a small baby, it has an effect on you, particularly when they die in your arms, which happens to EMTs sometimes. That is the purpose of this facility in Augusta and it will be as we know the first in the nation to help those kind of people recover when they are suffering from these problems. I heard one of these policemen talk. He had to pull his gun one time and use it and he took alive but he saved several others. He could not deal with what happened and he had nightmares and he finally turned to the bottle. He became an alcoholic because he had nowhere to go for proper treatment and he is now sober and on the straight and narrow but he testified how useful these locations are. I'm going to ask you to check your heart in a minute and vote to allow this bill to move forward because you will make that center possible in the Augusta area. Here is the other thing I want to explain to you. I believe you have been given the impression this morning that you are going to make the decision on whether or not this treatment center will be in Augusta. You are not. The final say so will be with the Augusta Richmond County Board of Commissioners. The local government will make the decision in the zoning decision that will be voted on in a couple of three months from now as to whether or not this facility will be there. Here is what you are doing. All you are doing is allowing one of the objections that has been brought forward to be resolved. Now I believe unfortunately some of the opponents of this don't want you to resolve that objection and here is what it is. Right now the access to this 20 acre lot which was a former covenant, a nunnery, is through a neighborhood. If you vote yes for this easement you will allow a different entrance that will not affect the neighborhood they will close that office the plan. And the ingress and the egress to this very valuable facility will be across the campus of Augusta Tech University and they have agreed to this that's why it's in this bill. We regularly give easements across state property when there is a good reason to do so. And although I do not live in Athens Georgia if there was something in this bill to give it easement across the property of the University of Georgia and it was for good easement I would vote for it. Although I do not live in West Georgia if I had something that was an easement across Columbus University I would vote for it. Or any other technical school or university in this state because we the state legislature have to by law make those decisions to allow things to go forward. So all you are doing is allowing for an opportunity to get rid of one objection in the Augusta Richmond County Commission will make the final decision on this. Ladies and gentlemen helping our firefighters our first responders and our policemen when they need it the most is worth you voting yes on this because once again you're not going to be the final arbiter. The gist of Richmond County Commission will have local control and they will make this decision. And I fear the problem is some people are worried they may vote yes to allow this to go forward and they're hoping they can sabotage that by getting you to vote no now. Support this facility support this bill because it not only makes sense for those first responders it makes sense for us to help them when we can and this is one of those opportunities. Thank you miss speaker I yield well you have questions if you care to yield I will yield chair recognizes chairman Martin do you're right for a question. Gentlemen you yes sir isn't it true that if we fail to pass this we are in fact taking options from the Richmond zoning authority off the table you are correct in your statement we actually we will be making it impossible for them to resolve one of the request that it has been given to us to allow the facility to go forward. Further yield for one more please yes sir so in fact if we fail to pass this we are in fact injecting our self into the zoning matter are we not the gentleman is exactly correct we would be taking a stance and I use the word sabotage we would be throwing a big monkey wrench into the process and helping the people trying to stop this unfortunately thank you. Do you further you yes or I'll you chair recognizes representative Vernon Jones to your left for a question with the gentleman you please absolutely is not true that I would know a little bit about local government I heard you served one time somewhere maybe two times. Yes sir the gentleman does understand local government agree isn't it true that the 20 acres that all the 20 acre lot that your reference is private property. The 20 acre lot is best my knowledge could be held by a nonprofit but I think one could describe this private property yes because it's not government property is not not true at this point I do not believe it is no sir. Is it further true that the easement if it's given will allow that private property to be developed. No sir it would not allow that property property to be developed the private property in the zoning will be a recovery center for first responders not anything else so that's part of the zoning. Is it not true that if it is on what you just said is on as that the local commission can reason that property to a different zoning that would require or will allow private development not only can they do that but you know that you could have done that when you were CEO of the cab county if you got the vote a local government can rezone anything they want to to any kind of zoning they want generally speaking that is every district we have around this state isn't it further true with just a further yield absolutely isn't further true though if the community from that area did not want that zoning to go through. That that elected official will realize that they didn't treat a cool they treat a bobcat and they will back off. You are absolutely correct the final decision once again on this issue of rezoning which has to happen for this center of treatment to go forward is going to be made by the Augusta Richmond County government even if you vote yes today you're not making the final decision on this that will be a local control issue and I appreciate the gentleman helping me in pointing that out. Miss speaker I believe that I have answered all the questions that are necessary this time I think you understand the issue I will yield the well and ask you to support us on this bill. Gentlemen has yielded the well what purpose does the minority leader of the house rise make a motion state your motion I move the house resolution 1094 be recommitted to the House rules committee. Gentlemen has moved that house resolution 1094 be recommitted to rules is their objection there is objection all those in favor of the motion to recommit to rules will vote I those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion to recommit to the rules committee the eyes are 70 the these are 98 the motion has failed the previous question had been ordered is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute to chair here's none the committee substitute is withdrawn is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules the chair here's none the rules committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favourable. which was favourable to the adoption of the resolution the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this resolution now be adopted all those in favor of the adoption of House resolution 1094 will vote I those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. what purpose does representative Vernon Jones rise state your inquiry isn't true Mr. Speaker that I was not trying to help the distinguished gentleman from the judiciary committee but I was trying to help the distinguished gentleman from Richmond County and isn't and isn't first of true Mr. Speaker that we always talk about local control and here we are getting involved and that's a conservative approach to a tape. I know the gentleman to be a very strong doctor in their conservative so have all those in favour of the bill or voting I those opposed are voting no have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the motion or on the adoption of House resolution 1094 the eyes are 97 the nasa 71 this resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is there for adopted. what purpose does the minority leader of the house rise. Mr. Speaker I rise to serve notice under rule 143 of an intent to move for reconsideration of the appropriate time gentleman has that right and I think the appropriate time would be tomorrow or the next legislative date. Okay clerk will read the caption to House bill 885 House bill 885 I represent a peach tree in 166 slumming 121st and others to be in total an act to amend code section 42 5 36th the fiscal Georgia annotated relating to confidentiality of information supplied by inmates penalties for breach. Classified nature department investigation reports and confidentiality of certain identifying information this bill and refer the committee on judiciary non civil that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. There are recognizes chairman P. Trey to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker we're on ladies and gentlemen of the House that bring to you today House House bill 885 this bill very simply. Allows that our DA's as the chief law enforcement officers in our communities access to disciplinary records of inmates in our correctional system before they are paroled in order for our DA's to file if they so choose a written complaint which is there right. Most of you that I have spoke to have been surprised to learn that this is not currently available to our DA's and so let me explain. Currently this information is available only if declassified by the commissioner of the Department of Corrections because this information is considered a state secret. What this bill does very simply is for the purposes of our DA's it removes this information as a state secret for our DA's only and only in certain circumscribed crimes and so you will see here that this bill relates to only serious violent felonies which are in code they're basically the seven deadly sins. And dangerous sexual offenses are a list of 19 crimes that are against a person less than 18 years of age so serious violent felonies and individuals convicted of crimes against children dangerous sexual offenses against children. If the DA in your community wants the complete record of that inmate how they behaved in prison before that inmate is released back into the community their sentence truncated and cut short by the board of partners and parole this information will always be forever more available to our DA's into them alone. I want to emphasize a couple of things when emphasize that our parole board of five men and women parole about 9400 inmates a year most of those are violent because our prisons are increasingly filled with violent criminals because of the great job we've done of keeping non violent criminals out of the system. And so it seems to me that we all would want our DA's to be back up if you will looking at this information to be able to at least make a petition or an objection if they so choose. The final piece of this bill I want you to notice this information is only available to our DA's and we've actually got a misdemeanor offense if it's shared it is not available to the public they cannot share it and in order to get everyone's support on the committee. We actually made them guilty of a misdemeanor if they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker that is I think and hope a pretty thorough description of the bill but I'm glad to take any questions if there are any. You do not appear to have any questions. I'm sorry you do have a question. Are you? Do you yield? I do. Chair recognizes Chairman Powell to your right for a question. Well, the gentleman yield. Yes, sir. I understand what you're wanting to do and I have some concern a little bit of concern to this because a lot of this is private information that could put some of these inmate's former inmates has been thrown out positive by releasing confidential information and some of that confidential information I'm concerned about is say a inmate has been thrown out of the house.

given evidence to DOC officials about gang violence, something that is running absolute rampant in the correctional system today. And if they have to go through all of this to turn us over to DA, could not the DA possibly misuse this information, per se to say former N-Mate, we see that you have outed out gang members. So we won't you to start outing out folks and put some back in the same criminal situation. Do you not have any concerns with that, sir? No, sir. I don't have any of those concerns because we met with the Board of Partins and Pearls and Department of Corrections. All of this information will be redacted to the degree necessary to make sure that we protect the issues that you've raised. And again, this information must remain confidential. Get your question is what if the DA refuses to honor that. But the information when it comes from Department of Corrections, and by the way, I want to emphasize something, summaries are already going to DAs when they ask for it. And all of this is only upon request. But the Department of Corrections will redact that record to the degree necessary to protect any witnesses, informants or anything of that nature. Thank you. You have one more question if you care to yield? Yes, sir. I'll yield, Mr. Speaker. To recognize this Chairman Warkhizer to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And with Jim and you. Now you. I think the past chairman of the Public Safety kind of beat me to it. But I guess my question that was maybe part of your answer. So are you unequivocally stating that Department of Corrections and Department of Department of Pardoning Pearls is in favor of this bill? I can tell you that Partins and Pearls in favor of this bill, prosecuting attorneys' accounts as in favor of this bill. And the Department of Corrections did not object to this bill. It's the best way I would describe it. Okay, I appreciate you. I appreciate your work. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee substitute? The chair here is none. The Committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 885 or VOTI? Those opposed to VOTE know in the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 885, the eyes are 108. The nays are 57. This bill having received the records of constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 855. House Bill 855, our resident of Weed Hour, the 119th and others to be entitled to an act to amend Part 3 of Article 6 of Chapter 2, Title 20 of fiscal adjoge, anti-regulating educational programs, so as to direct the State Board of Education to determine eligibility criteria for foster care students. This bill ever furthered the Committee on Education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Weed Hour to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, today I bring you House Bill 855. The best analogy of this bill that I can give is that of the Lyndon tree. You see with the Lyndon tree, there's so much more underground than there is above. The tree has an extensive root system, the health of which is paramount to its far-reaching effects. But should this root system be exposed and not nurtured properly? The Lyndon tree will die. This is a fitting example of the uprooting of a child and being placed into the foster care system. And if that child is not properly replanted and nurtured, they will not continue to grow or flourish. Uprooting trees may vary in the tools that are needed to be replanted, but all of them will require tools. Which brings me to the focus of this bill. This bill instructs the Board of Education to immediately assess foster care students, to determine if the student meets the criteria to receive special education and other services such as IEPs. It also directs the Board of Education to develop a protocol for these assessments as foster care students often test differently than other students after going through the traumatic experience of being removed from the home where their roots were once planted. Nothing in this bill changes the criteria for a student to qualify for these services. It just places immediacy on the Board of Education to ensure these students get the support they will inevitably need. Their roots may be damaged with the right tools. There can be healing and continued growth. I ask for your favorable consideration of this measure. And if successfully passed, we may never know and fully understand the ripple effect from a child who receives the tools needed for continued growth through a very difficult time and goes on to recognize their full potential. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield for questions if there are any. Excellent presentation, by the way. You do have a couple of questions if you care to yield. I'll take one or two. Chair recognizes representative Prince to your left for a question. As gentleman you I do. Is it not true that yourself do not have foster children? Yeah, the gentleman is correct. So it is also true that this would be some form of doing for not for myself but for others. The gentleman is correct. As I've learned through the masterful work of Sartovosaurus, we should not exist for ourselves but for others. Do you further yield? I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes representative Oliver to your left for a question. Mr. gentleman, yield. I do. Thank you, sir, for bringing this bill. Isn't it true, sir, that perhaps our biggest failure for foster care children is the failure to provide them with an adequate education. That is I believe the federal law entitles them, entitles them to an individual educational plan and we are not in full compliance with that entitlement those children deserve. I would also agree with that. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield the well. Gentlemen has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 855 will vote aye those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 855. The eyes are 166. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 576. House Bill 576 by the representative of Williams, the 145th and others to be entitled to enact to amend Title 15 in fiscal to Georgia and to interrelate into courts. So as to provide for the distribution priority of partial payments and fines, bond forfeatures and costs. This bill haven't referred to the committee on judiciary non-civil that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Rick Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, come before you with House Bill 576. This changes where the only constitutional amendment passed charity is moved from number 13 up to number 5. This charity very rarely receives any money at all and it's very, this is something that everybody was on board with, the peace officer, the sheriff's retirement doesn't affect any of that. It just moves this bill up. I'll take any questions, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. I'll yield the oil. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
