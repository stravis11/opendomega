Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
I bring you House Bill 291, the Community Health Care Worker Certification Act.
This is a very vital bill for us.
It's going to help our underserved and rural areas.
This is basically to create a pathway to certification for community health workers.
It's going to be overseen by the Department of Public Health.
These will be workers coming from your own local communities.
They'll be following the orders that doctors have.
The clinics and doctors can have follow-up with their patients.
It's going to be very beneficial for maternal care and even our mental health.
I think childcare and the elder will also see a great benefit from these.
I've had many, many people that want this.
Right now, there's a very loose organization
of how they're being trained.
We have various hospitals that are doing the training
in-house, and we need to have a consistent needing
to know exactly how everybody's trained the same way,
and that's what this bill will do.
Are there any questions?
Lady has no questions.
Thank you.
I appreciate your favorable consideration.
Ladies yielded the well.

Here in none the previous question is ordered.

Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill?

Will vote no, and Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine?
I have all members voted, all members voted, all members voted, all members voted,
All members is voted, if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine?
On the passes of House Bill 291, the yeas are 169, the nays are four, this bill hasn't received their requisite constitutional majority.
Therefore, passed.
Mr. Clerk, would you read the caption to House Bill 87, 87?
House Bill 87, my representative Clark,
the 100th and others to be entitled,
and act to amend, title 33,
the fish code of Georgia and annotated,
relating the insurance, those to require health benefit,
policy coverage for medically necessary,
orthotic devices and prosthetic devices
and their materials and components.
This will happen for the committee on health,
committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Representative Clark has recognized to present House Bill 87.
The gentleman's recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
First, I stand before you today to ask for your support of House Bill 87, a bill that
would change lives for Georgians with limb loss or limb difference.
This bill isn't about growing government, it's about helping people.
It makes sure folks get the medical devices they need to live full, independent lives.
Right now state regulated insurance plans deny coverage for basic needs and that's just not right.
Showering, using the bathroom, playing, exercising, these aren't extras.
every day things we all do.
But for many, insurance rules make them out of reach.
Think back to January 28th when we met some amazing people.
Elliott, my six-year-old buddy, lost his legs a baby.
His parents don't want special treatment.
They just want him to have a normal childhood.
To play with his twin brother Hudson,
his older brother Sebastian, to one day live on his own.
Jared Wallace and Athens Paralympian, go dogs.
He has shown us that physical challenges don't have to hold you back.
But still, his insurance won't cover a shower leg.
Something so basic.
Brad O'Malley, a small business owner from Tucker,
he needs special orthotics to keep working,
to provide for his family, but insurance won't help.
This bill fixes that because the right medical equipment isn't a luxury, it's a need.
We all know staying active keeps you healthy.
When a doctor says someone needs a second prosthetic
or orthotic, it's not extra is preventing
bigger problems down the road.
Even the Georgia Association of Health Plans
agrees these devices are needed not optional.
At the heart of this bill, it's people.
It's about helping families, letting kids be kids,
and making sure folks take care of themselves.
Let's be real, this could happen to any of us.
None of us are safe from an accident
an illness or a condition that might require these devices.
If that day comes, would you want your spouse, your child,
or your loved ones to be told they can't have
what they need to just shower or walk?
That's what we're deciding today.
Will we let insurance companies keep saying no
to basic needs or will we do what's right for everyone?
I urge you to vote yes on our house bill 87
because today we can make a real difference,
not just for Elliot, Jared, and Brad,
but for every Georgia who deserves to live a full life.
With that, I'll take any questions, and we'd love you
to support of House Bill 87.
Representative Scofield, to your right out front,
is recommend for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does gentleman yields?
Yes, ma'am, do.
Is it not true that we both are excited at the work
that we've done with advocates such as so everybody can move
and how it's changed our lives?
Yes, ma'am, it's changed both our lives,
and it's left a huge impact on me.
I can't wait to vote yes on this bill.
Thank you.
Chairman has no further questions.

church on Sunday unless the ox is in the ditch and so when chairman lever it and other legislators
and I found ourselves meeting with the cities on a Sunday morning I knew this issue was
of grave importance.
So we engaged with members of the trial bar, House Judiciary Committee spent a long time
on this.
This bill is the product of a lot of study, it honors the civil justice system, the right
to try out by jury, but it allows cities to budget for liability, to purchase insurance,
to self-insure, and it solves a threatening problem to cities by setting a sovereign immunity
amount just like the state of Georgia has in Title 50 and the cities code in Title 36.

House Bill 677 by Representative Dempsey, the 13th and others to be entitled.
Now to amend chapter one of Title 31 of the physical to Georgia and
Senator Lee, and General Prussens for health, so to provide for certain placement procedures for children upon discharge from a hospital or psychiatric or residential treatment facility in certain circumstances.
This bill I refer to the committee on health, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
The lady from Rome representative, Dempsey is recognized to present the bill, representing Katie Dempsey.
Ladies recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
HB 677 seeks to create a process to address the growing problem
in Georgia and around the country
where children with mental health issues
languish in hospitals.
Sometimes for months, and at times even over a year,
after they have been medically discharged.
Acute or long-term mental health hospitals at that point,
too often parents and guardians and custodians
are abandoning these children for a plethora of reasons.
These are some of our hardest children.
When we talk about hotel, when we talk about children
that are hard to find placements,
this is who we're talking about parents
at the end of their rope.
And they just don't know what to do.
So they are in the hospital.
They've had their three to five days of crisis care
and there's nowhere to send them.
So this bill will pull together a quick strike team
of decision makers to help these children
find appropriate placement and services.
The team will consist of the treating psychiatrist,
the hospital's medical director,
appropriate state agencies, a care coordinator,
and any insurer responsible managing the care of the patient.
But also one of the most important things it will do
is collect data on the number of kids that languish
in our mental health facilities
and the number of days until they are appropriately placed.
This will help us and it will be provided
on an annual basis to the House and Senate budget chairs.
Mr. Speaker, that is the bill.
If there are any questions, I'll be glad to take them.
Lady has no questions.
Thank you.

House Bill 635, by Representative Wiedauer, to be entitled to amend chapter 41 and
Title 43.
The official go to Georgia and to relay the residential, commercial, general contractors
So it's revised provisions relating to the State Licensing Board for residential and commercial general contractors.
This bill I've heard the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends this bill do pass.
This chairman is a little bit about contracting, so we don't let him speak to House Bill 635.
Chairman Weed, how are you recognized?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This is one of a handful of bills we're doing this year to streamline licensure and get people to work in Georgia quicker
with less cumbersome regulations.
This is sort of the residential,
the licensing board for residential
and commercial general contractors.
Fairly straight and simple.
I ask for your favorable consideration.
The gentleman has no questions.
Thank you.
The gentleman's yielded the well.

This bill having to see the rec was a constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 567-567?
5, 6, 7 by Representative Dempsey, the 13th being titled an act to amend Article 2, Chapter 11 and Title 43.
The official go to Georgia and it's ended relating licenses for the practice of dentistry, so it's to authorize and regulate tele dentistry by licensed dentists in this state.
This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Health, that committee recommends a disbilled do pass by Committee Substitute.
Representative Katie Dempsey is recognized to present House Bill 567.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members.
HB 567 will authorize and regulate the practice of teledinistry in Georgia by Georgia licensed
oral health care team members through the Georgia Board of Dentistry to ensure that patient
safety remains the priority while maintaining a continuous standard of care and sustaining
the Georgia licensed dentist as the leader of the health care team.
It allows patients without a dental home to establish care with a provider.
It addresses the huge concern we have of a lack of dentists in certain parts of our state.
It also authorizes hygienists to perform specific functions under general supervision
For a real-time diagnosis, now there is no doubt that dentistry is a tactile practice.
So this does not allow for someone to go through teledentistry and do a lot in your mouth,
but it does begin the practice, the oversight, and the view to help decisions be made about
someone's oral care that might prevent an ambulance ride if they are in a nursing home,
if they are in assisted living, that can be very hard too.
So this is a good way to help increase the number of healthy mouths in our state.
If there are any questions, Mr. Speaker, I'll be glad to take them.
If not, I will yield the well.
The lady did an excellent job.
She has no questions.

On the passage of House Bill 567, the A's are 174, the NA's are two.
This bill, Henry C, the requisite, constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 582?
582.
House Bill 582 by Representative Gunner, the A to be entitled to amend title 1617 and
24 of the fiscal to Georgia and tentative relating to crimes and offenses, criminal procedure and evidence respectively.
So it's to provide for defendants to support a justification defense by offering evidence of family violence,
dating violence for child abuse committed by the alleged victim.
This bill haven't further the committee on Judiciary, non-civil that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Representative Stan Gunther has recognized to present the bill, Mr. Chairman, you're recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
House Bill 582 helps victims of domestic violence who have committed a crime present evidence of their abuse as a justification for the crime which is before trial, in mitigation, which is after trial before sentencing.
those who are serving as senators who have a history of being a victim of domestic violence.
For justification, the defendant shall offer relevant evidence that the abuser subjected
the defendant to the acts of family violence, dating violence, or child abuse, which is
like a self-defense that can result in the dismissal of the case.
For mitigation, the defendant may present evidence that he or she were subjected to acts of
for family violence, dating violence or child abuse,
and that such acts were a significant contributing factor
to the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.
The bill sets out the evidence that is admissible,
and defendants that are serving a crime,
serving a sentence, may petition the court
requesting to be rescinded as set out for mitigation.
There is a presumption in favor of granting a hearing
unless the court determines otherwise.
The hearing must be scheduled not more than 90 days
from the date of the filing of the petition
and the state shall be given notice
and an opportunity to respond.
There's a portion of this that
crime survivors regularly report
needing a diverse set of tools to address and repair harm.
Enabling victim-centered programs
will respond to this need while helping survivors heal.
And evidentiary privilege will allow acknowledgment of wrongdoing from the defendant, open dialogue
and accountability, all of which are core to victim-centered programs.
Now I think some of you have been receiving contacts from your district attorney objecting
to this.
At the committee there was a district attorney that did object to a portion of this bill,
the committee voted the bill out unanimously with no change.
So the way I look at this, and it's the third section of the bill where they're serving
time for a crime they've committed.
This bill will not give them a free card to get out of jail.
This is just a way to get it reduced.
their objection is the preparation and stuff they have to do for that. I understand that and I've
offered and I don't know if they know it but I've offered to make any changes to it when it gets to
the Senate. I understand the politics of this but I really do not like the last minute objection.
I can understand it on a sunny day but on crossover I don't. If you have any questions I'm happy to
answer. Gentleman has a question representing Santos to your right about halfway back.
So gentlemen yield. As a survivor I would like to thank you for bringing this bill. I wanted to ask you is
it not true that this bill ensures that the legal system better acknowledges and experiences
that domestic violence survivors and provides them with more avenues for justice and healing.
Thank you. Well said
Gentlemen has no further questions. I yield the well. Thank you the gentleman has yielded the well

Represent the Houston gains is recognized to present the bill House bill 57
Thank you, mr. Speaker
House bill 57 that follows up a similar legislation that we passed last year in the house didn't quite get over the finish line in the Senate
To try to get some enforcement on vaping in our in our state
right now we have seen the vape market being flooded by illegal Chinese
disposable vape products that are really all over the shelves in our state
and across the country. The reality is the FDA is trying to put in some
restrictions but it's failed to do its part in terms of enforcement.
You know last couple years the number top couple selling vape products in
America including Elf bar which is one example. I think it was the number one
selling product last year. It's actually an illegal Chinese manufactured vape
and yet it's on shelves across the state.
We really have no idea what's in these products,
nobody's monitoring them, and actually,
in some of the testing that I've seen,
they're mislabeled in terms of how much nicotine's in them,
what all is in the product,
and retailers don't even know currently
under the current landscape,
whether what they're selling is legal or not,
and so instead what's happening is products
coming straight from China and onto shelves.
This bill will help address that issue
by creating a state level registry of what products are legal
to be sold in the United States, including the products
that the FDA has given full authorization to as well as products
that were submitted in a timely fashion that are pending.
But again, this will make sure that those products
that the FDA has denied authorization
or that were not submitted in a timely fashion
would not be illegal, would not be eligible to be sold.
They're currently not legal.
Anyway, this bill doesn't change what is legal
and what is not legal, what it does do though,
is provide an enforcement mechanism.
Other states have done similar,
and my hope is this bill will help us get a handle
on this issue and stop these Chinese illicit products
from targeting our children,
which is what they're designed to do.
In fact, I had someone drop off a vape just a moment ago
that had a video game on the outside of the vape,
and it's clearly targeted towards kids.
I think kids, I think it was called some berry flavor.
But these are products are clearly aimed towards our children and they're not legal and so my hope is this bill helps us get
Older that miss speaker. I'm happy to answer a question if there is one gentleman has a question to your right in the back
Representative Carpenter just recognize for a question. Does the gentleman you I do so could you talk me through the enforcement piece because I I mean
I'm with you. This is a this is an epidemic for our youth. I see it around you know
I employ a lot of youth employees
and every one of them vape and they're vaping this stuff and who knows what's going to happen to them.
So talk through the enforcement for me please.
Sure. So this would be through the Department of Revenue, the Department of Revenue,
which already visits these facilities regularly for enforcement, but there would be a state level registry
that manufacturers would opt into and be $1,000 to put a product on the registry and then the Department of Revenue
when they're visiting coming in stores or baked shops,
again, that list would now be public whereas right now
there's literally not a list of what is a legal product
and what is not.
And so the Department of Revenue will be able to enforce that.
There are pretty strict penalties
for having these illegal products on your shelves.
Thank you so much.
And I look forward to following this legislation.
I would hope that we could get our local law enforcement
involved in this too, because I can't thank
of an issue this more important for the families of Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you, and I will tell you law enforcement has said repeatedly in this conversation how much of a challenge this is and certainly in our schools
This is a major issue for our kids miss speaker
Representing hugely the minority leader has a question right in front of you all take her question. I appreciate it

Speaker doesn't gentlemen. Yeah, I do just wanted to
Say isn't it true that we went all across the state and the number
for principals telling us what this is doing to our children at schools was astounding.
And it is further true that we don't know what's in these products and we need to get
a handle on them for the protection of our children.
That's right.
I want to thank the leader and Representative Allen Powell, Gary Richardson.
I know Dale Washburn served on that study committee where we did go across the state and
hear the importance of this issue and thank you.

House Bill 586 by Representative Williamson of the 112th, to be entitled an act to amend Article 3, Chapter 6, in Title 48.
The official go to Georgia Annotated, relating intangible recording taxos to revise the note for which such taxes impose.
This bill I am sure the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends that this bill do pass.
The gentleman from Monroe is recognized to present the bill representing Bruce Williamson.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good evening, colleagues.
I bring for you tonight House Bill 586, which simply extends the current exemption on intangibles recording taxes from three years to seven years.
Currently in order to avoid these taxes, borrows are simply getting 35 month loans at the banker suggestions and then renewing after the end of three years.
This is the standard workaround to avoid the tax.
This bill would allow borrowers to fix their rate
for a longer term,
thereby having interest rates certainty
and lower monthly payments.
It has zero state fiscal impact
and very limited local tax impact.
Comes without objection from any interested party
and specifically I've met with both ACCG and GMA
and they're all neutral on the bill.
Happy to answer any questions asked
if you're favourable consideration or yield the well.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Another licensure regulatory cutback here for this time for the State Board of Registration
use motor vehicle dealers and use motor vehicle park dealers.
I will ask for your favorable consideration.
Do you have a question to feel you, young Chairman Parsons, to your left?
Thank you.
Thanks, gentlemen.
I recognize your question.
Jim and you.
I do.
I'm reading through the bill.
It's a 19-page bill and once you get into the list of mistaken and once you get in
hard of it, there's a lot of language has been deleted, a lot of language has
been added, and it appears from just what I've seen is basically setting up a
new rearranging the way that used car lots can be licensed. Is that correct or
are they licensed new? That's correct. This is really kind of taking it from a
licensure to registration and just streamlining the process.
Well, I mean, one question from me, does it change, is my understanding or memory, according
to my member anyway, is not true that an individual can only sell so many cars from their own
yard or their own themselves, a month or a year, whatever, is that not true under
law?
I would believe that the gentleman knows which he speaks, but what the question is, does
Just change that it does not and if I may one more and that is does this with these changes does it decrease the amount of
State employees at all does it change that at all as far as the number of people employed by the state? No sir does not okay. Thank you
