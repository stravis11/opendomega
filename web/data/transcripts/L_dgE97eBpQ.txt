TRANSCRIPT
----------
Thank you.
Body to the first meeting of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, and I'd like to call the meeting to order and
And Senator Jackson, if you wouldn't mind saying
invocation force, please, your own mic number 10.
Let us pray.
Holy God, we come this day giving thanks
for the opportunity to gather to make decisions
about this our great state.
We pray for all who live, work, and play.
We pray especially for our health care workers,
and for all who help keep us safe and healthy.
And on this day, especially we pray for those who are living
with dementia or Alzheimer's and for all who care for them.
May they know peace, enjoy and love.
I'm in.
Thank you, Senator Jackson.
So let me just give us a little bit of housekeeping here.
The first order of business is gonna be a bill
that was in rules and was sent back
and because it did not get to the finish line.
And it's a very straightforward bill
and it was not held up for any particular reason
other than time, but as we were reminded last year
and reminded again this year, it is a two year session.
So that bill will sent back to us.
As you can see in your folders,
it's not a complicated bill, changing some dates,
but I'm not going to, let me, I'm not here to present the bill,
but we're representative to Silcox is.
So if you would, if you would like to come down here,
or the podium, whichever one you would like,
we'll let you present the bill and we'll have questions
and then we'll, then we're going to take a vote.
The floor is yours.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I bring to you all today House Bill 571
and House Bill 571 is a DHS department bill.
And it basically says that the Georgia Alzheimer's
and related dementia's state planning
and advisory council, which is also known as guard,
should include, first of all, the chairperson
of the House Committee on Public Health
since the name of that committee has changed
in the Georgia House representatives.
And second, that the Georgia Alzheimer's and related
dementia's state plan should be amended every four instead of every three years as it
was previously starting January 1st, 2027.
And starting January 1st, 2025, and every four years, the advisory council should submit
a midpoint report that is every two years detailing that latest data showing the impact of
dementia and progress toward goals in the state plan.
So essentially this bill changes the reporting requirements for a two-year report or update
and I think this is critical because as we know thousands of people, more and more people
are dying of Alzheimer's so I think to have this be more timely every other year is stepping
the right direction and we'll help our department to stay better on top of the subject so
would appreciate your consideration.
I'd like to thank everybody for being here.
We certainly have a quorum, a quorum plus.
Don't everybody get up and leave, but I appreciate that, Chairman.
Do you have any questions from the committee?
Senator?
I'll just wait for a comment.
Thank you for bringing the legislation.
It's more than timely, certainly, as you understood, representative.
And the original study committee originated on the Senate side to move us into this
posture that we're in today of having a plan, because each state had to initiate it,
and we were with that one for some time, and under the leadership of this committee,
we worked to get that plan advanced.
It took a study committee, it took this and the other, as things do around here, but it's
been a night and day change for the state of Georgia and we've had great professional staffing
I would say on the staff side of this. So I applaud the legislation and you said it's
changing from three year plan to redo the plan every four years.
To redo the total plan but every two years they'll have a midpoint report that will be
due and again that will I think that keep everybody more timely and on top of the issue
instead of every four years.
Thanks for filling us in.
I kind of missed that two-year thing.
Yeah, excellent applause.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I would make a motion when the chairman is ready for.
I'll hold that reserve it and listen to any other questions.
Any questions is pretty straightforward.
Senator Kirkpatrick.
Just one question.
Can you show me where the two-year interim report is in here?
Let's see.
It's near the end.
It's probably on page four, isn't it?
It is.
Right.
I agree.
It is one of the seven because that starts as a 2025, the data.
So it will be on every two years.
So in two years, we'll have a major report, and then we'll get the statistics and analysis
two years later, and then a major report and then two years later.
Is that right?
Is that right?
All right.
All right.
It is confusing.
The major report will be everything.
So we have two lawyers that agree with that, and another lawyer is presenting it, and
I think we're perfect.
Okay.
What would the doctors do without that?
I guess.
Okay.
All right.
So any other questions, motion from Senator Orang, move to pass, second Chairman Brass,
all those in favor say aye, all those opposed, like sign, the motion passes and unanimously.
Any other business?
If not, who's carrying that for you?
That's right.
That's not right.
That's right. She doesn't have enough bills to carry already. She needs more, so we appreciate
that. If there's no further business meeting as adjourned. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You
