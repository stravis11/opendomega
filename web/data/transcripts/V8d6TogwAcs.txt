Will the official go to Georgia, annotated, relating to meetings,
open to the public, limitation on action to contest agency action,

and telecommunication conferences.
This bill, I refer to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass.
Thank you Mr. Clerk, Chair recognizes that Chairman the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman
Blackman, to present the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, fellow members.
Bring before you House Bill 269, which would allow our workforce development boards to
meet via teleconference, it's permissive and particularly helpful to our rural
boards. I would especially want to thank the co-sponsors, representative Douglas
and for applying his studies regarding space and time to this piece of
legislation. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are
any. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't have any and looks like the members don't have
as well. So you don't have any questions. Well thank you. I take that we had a last
second. Representative Barnes from the 86th has a question to your left. Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I yield. Does the gentleman yield? Sorry. I yield. Is it not
true that this will allow more access for patients with the teleconference
I believe you know what you speak thank you mr. Speaker I asked for the
body's favorable consideration yield the well the gentleman has yielded the
well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered chair
here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to a
green to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of
the bill. The Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
have all members voted for what purpose does
represent the main arise.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry.
Stature inquiry. Is it not true that last year we transferred about
about $60 million or so from the Labor Department
to the technical college system of Georgia
for the purpose of the Workforce Opportunity and Innovation Act.
And this bill in particular will continue
to help those local colleges with this.
I know the General Lady knows of what she speaks.
Thank you for the question or the inquiry.
All members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of the bill, the yeas are 153, the nays are zero, the bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to SB 291?
HB, sorry, you know, this is a house in it, sorry about that.
I have to tell you what my mind is, sometimes.
HB 291, Mr. Clerk, thank you.
House Bill 291, by the way, Representative Skoggins,
the 14th and others to be entitled an act to amend,
title 29 of the Fisher go to George Antietta,
related to Guardian and Ward,
so as to add to the list of providers who were authorized to participate
in the process is for appointment of a guardian for an adult.
This bill then referred to the Committee on Juvenile Justice.
The Committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
That should prove to our friends over across the way
that I hold them in such high regard that I would grace them with calling
a house bill with an SB in front of it.
So I promise you I won't do that again.
Chair recognizes Representative Skoggins to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
That SB could also stand for Skoggins' bill, too.
I wasn't fast enough to think about that.
If I had been covered in the ground, I would have.
Thank you, Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, I bring to you House Bill 291 LC 49 1196.
This has been brought on behalf of the Probate Judges Council of the State of Georgia.
This is a bill that simply expands the list of people who can basically evaluate someone
that's in need of a guardianship.
Currently only physicians and psychologists can do this.
This expands the list of people who are able to do those evaluations.
The judges were getting backlogged with problems having to find someone to do the evaluation
and I think this will help solve that problem.
And I'm open for questions if we have any questions.
You have no questions.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you.
Yes, vote on this bill.
Thank you.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute?
The Chair, here's none.
The Committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of the bill?
Chair, here's none.
Report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All in favor of the passage of the bill, we'll vote yes.
All those opposed will vote no,
and the clerk will unlock the machine.
Thank you.
have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the
machine. On the passage of the bill, the Yays, or 165, the
NAZero, the bill having received the requisite Constitution
majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, you'll read the
caption to HB 301, HB 301.
House Bill 301 by reps in a riddle of the six, the others to
be entitled an act to amend title 40, the fish go to George
We're relating to motor vehicles, the traffic so as to revise the amount of civil monetary penalty
Provilations have been properly passing the school bus and speeding in a school zone
Miss Bill ever referred to
The committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute
Represent Jason Ridley is recognized to present the bill
Thank you, Mr. Baker, for not confusing me with my other person who's got my last thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think this bill, I think we've all had complaints about the
school cameras and the fines that we've been getting and what House Bill 301 does is
two things really simple.
And we had some bad actors out there that were, they were, the fine was $25, the fee that
most of the fee that you could charge was $25, but what they were doing, after you got
to fine a few weeks later, you were getting a bill in the mail for fees, but they were
multiple fees and they were all under $25.
So what we've done on the first section is we've made that say, well I'm sorry, I'm getting
ahead of myself, it's not on the first section, it's on the back page of the bill.
We've inserted a total of $25 and no additional fines or fees penalties or charges shall be authorized.
The second thing that it does, because of those bad actors, we needed to put some teeth in this bill.
So what it does now is if you go outside of that, you're going to be issued a $1,000 fine.
And that would go to the commissioner of the public safety.
I know kids are number one priority here and these things do work.
have seen the down tick in the speeding and you can see all these whenever they got the
fines and the tickets that they issue they go down as people get used to them be there
but so we had to but we just had some issues. The second thing that this bill does is these
fines were outside the 35% of the law enforcement agencies budget. If y'all remember a few years
ago when it's been a lot of years ago we had issues it was called policing for profit
where these little counties were basically doing
their whole budget off of fines.
So now what happened, the General Assembly came in,
they said you can only have 35% of those tickets,
traffic fines of your budget.
So this was not under that, it is under it now.
ACCG, GMA, and the Police Chiefs Association
all was in the meeting whenever we'd done this,
they all agreed to it, and that's what the bill does.
I'll take any questions if anybody has any.
The gentleman has a couple of questions.
Does he yield?
I'll yield Mr. Speaker.
Representative Jasmine Clark to your left has a question.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
So does this bill do anything to address when those fines can be, I guess, when a person can get a ticket for,
I get speeding through a school zone,
particularly outside of school hours.
This ticket, I've been doing this ticket.
This bill does not.
I think Chairman Jay Collins has got one
that's going to address that issue
about when you can run it, when you can't run it.
But this right here, all that's doing is saying
this $25 fee and it does go under the 35% cap.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, further you?
Hi, Dave.
Chairman Collins has a question for you,
straight from you.
Does my friend yield?
I do, to Mr. Chairman, go ahead.
Is it not true that this bill does nothing to address
if these civil monetary penalties are not paid?
This bill does nothing to address that issue
that we're having for our used car dealers
and people who are trading cars.
And these penalties are on titles.
This bill does nothing to clean you that up, is that correct?
No, sir, I think the one you got
we're working on getting that fixed.
You yield for another question?
I do.
Do you feel, as I do, representative, that these school
camera machines that are helping slow some of these people
down on these school zones, that that's a good piece
of legislation because we want to protect our young people
during a vulnerable time in the mornings when people are dropping
kids off and picking kids up in the afternoon.
Do you agree with that?
I do, I'm pretty sorry, with that.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, do you have for a couple more?
Yes, sir.
Chairman David Knight, to your right, has a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, this gentleman here.
I do.
Appreciate the gentleman bringing the bill, isn't it true?
And is it true we spoke about the problems
that are going on within this issue?
Isn't it further true that made note and you and I discussed
that the fines are actually getting sent to the companies
and then remitted back to the local law enforcement.
Yes sir, and to kind of elaborate on that a little bit
what we learned in this is,
is somebody's supposed to be checking off these
as your local police department.
Whenever a fine comes in, they're supposed to check it off.
But it does, so when it takes the picture,
it goes to the camera company in Utah or wherever it's at.
They submit it back.
The local police department's supposed to be checking off
to make sure that that is a viable violation,
but we have found out that some people have not been,
it's just been coming straight through.
And the other thing is, the current law says 30 days
from the time of the infraction,
what may be two or three weeks before you get
the actual ticket in the mail.
Well, I wanna thank the gentleman for working on this
and if he needs further help such as an amendment,
maybe looking for an alternative way
to safely handle these school zones,
I'd be happy to step up
and help the gentleman.
I appreciate your frame.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
To your left, Representative Wee is married Francis Williams has a question of your yield.
Does the gentleman yield?
I do.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you so much for bringing Section 1, especially.
My question is about Section 2.
How does the add-on, the changing and the add-on, adding on a fine's effect, super speeder
bills?
like two separate isn't there one locally and then another one that's issued
separately? That I don't know I'll be honest with you I don't know how that will
affect with the superspader. I'm not sure if the superspader goes under that 35
percent or if it's outside of that 35 percent and I mean I'm not going to
stand up here and act like I do but I don't but I do know this and I'd like to
give this example to Louis Falls, Georgia. There's article in the paper the other day where
their entire city budget is 419,000. The police department's entire annual budget is 126,000.
Since September of 22, they've made $697,000 in fines. That's when everybody started running
the problem. They're on schedule to make $1.6 million this year, off of these. And that's
when you start getting in that situation,
is it really for safety, or is it really for money?
And I think our number one priority safety.
Representative, you have one more.
This one's important.
Yes, sir.
This is Representative Franklin.
US 301 runs through the heart of his district.
So I figured he had a question since there was something
about 301.
It's a different Franklin.
Yes, sir.
Are you able to be a friend?
No, true.
This is the best bill I've heard all day.
and I'm very thankful for you bringing it.
I would 100% agree with this is the best bill
you've heard all day.
Thank you, sir.
You have one final question to gentlemen with you.
All right, Mr. Baker, I'll yield for one more.
This is not my first time by the way.
Well, yeah, I heard that too, but anyway.
Now, this next question should have been handled,
but I'll allow it.
Representing Maynard, since she sits one person away
you have a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? The $1,000 fine, where does that
go to? We're going to put a serious stop. This is a serious issue. What we're having is counties,
they'll get the fine for $100 on the actual infraction. A few weeks later, they'll get a
another bill in the mail that's not a fine. It's just the fees and it's as much or more than
in the fine is with these little fees the current law already said $25 but we have some
violators out there so we want to make some serious draw some serious attention to it.
So that's where we came up with the $1,000 fine.
Does the gentleman further yield?
I do.
So once the law enforcement agency is fine for the $1,000, where do they send that $1,000
to?
To the public safety commissioner.
And is there a but do you further yield?
I do.
a specific place within the public safety commissioner where they're going to use the thousand dollars?
That I'm not sure about. I guess maybe next year we'll revisit see how many fines we got
and see where we need to direct that to but I'm sure we'll probably look at something.
Thank you. Thank you.
Gentlemen, I have no further questions. You're a great job.
In the words of force gun, I thought I got to say about that.
Thank you. I yielded well.
But the gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

The committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?

All opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
Have all members voted?

If so, the clerk will lock the machine.
On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 163, the nays 0, the bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
Members of you will join me in welcoming an old friend of my families.
Our families have known each other for 100 years or more probably.
Superior Court Judge Curry Mingledorf from the Piedmont Circuit.
We've recently become acquainted with one another, but the Mingledorf family came from
down in Effingham County quite a while back, and we've gotten to know each other a little
bit today and looking forward to getting to know him better.
And if you, House members, if you'll welcome Judge Curry Mingledor.
Thank y'all, I appreciate that.
The chair, the clerk will read the caption to HB309, HB309.
House Bill 309, by the way, Senator Cooper, the 45th and others to be entitled to amend
an article one in chapter seven to title 31,
with the official go to George Anatetti
relating to regulation of hospitals
and related institutions.
So as revised provisions relating
the financial stability requirements for applicants
and licensees of personal care homes
and assisted living communities.
This bill I'm referring to committee on human relations
and aging, that committee recommends
that this bill do pass.
Chair, ladies, Sharon Cooper is recognized to present House Bill 309.
Chair, Lady Cooper.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring to you House Bill 309.
About three years ago when we had a big scandal across our state on how people were being treated in assisted lending facilities and nursing homes and large personal care homes.
personal care homes. We rewrote the laws for them, strengthening their staffing ratios,
and putting in rules to make sure that the people who owned these and started up at new
startups were financially sound. On that area, on the financial soundness, we had asked
CPAs to do some things like certifying that they were financially stable for two years.
CPAs don't do that and so they've worked with the department to come up with this
change which allows them to still, this is a requirement that if you're a new
company and you have and you're going to start assisted living or one of these
facilities that you have to you know with CPA if you're choosing it has to
submit forms and the backup information that shows that you are financially
sound and that it's likely to be a viable institution. And they do this because
we had some of them close just on a moment's notice and we were left with our
department trying to find homes for 25 or 35 seniors who thought that they
had found there forever home only to see that the company was going bankrupt.
that's the bill. It just corrects this and meets what the CPAs wanted us to do
as far as how it would, what we would call it and it's now a financial
stability avidated, a financial stability avidated. Mr. Speaker, if there's no
questions I'll yield the well. You have no questions. Chair ladies, yielded the
well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair
Here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?

Mr. Clerk of your read the caption to house bill 414
House bill 414
Overups in the black men and the 146 on others to be entitled and act to amend chapter 1
of Title 37 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating to government and regulation of mental
health.
So it's to provide for a grant program within the Department of Behavior Health and developmental
disabilities to provide behavioral health services to military service members and veterans.
This bill then refer to the Committee on Health.
That committee recommends a disbilled due pass by committee substitute.
I'll find you there for a minute, Chairman.
Chairman Blackman has recognized to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, fellow members.
Once again, here to bring you a bill,
HP414, which is designed to establish
a underneath the Department of Behavioral Health
and Developmental Disabilities,
a grant fund that would match private dollars
invested to serve our military service members
veterans and their families that's here in Georgia subject to appropriation is
consistent with our commitment I think to improving mental health and to our
veterans and once again want to really put put a big thank you out to our
co-sponsors I notice one of them is missing here but representative Al Williams
representative Mary Margaret Oliver and Chairman Hatchett along with some
others. Miss Speaker that's the bill I'd be happy to try to answer any
Any questions if there are any?
have a couple of questions. Yes sir. First let me address an issue with
Representative Jackson. I think you've had a machine issue. So we'll address
that issue and I think maybe you had a question on the last bill. Can I have
chair lady Cooper come speak with you and see if she can answer that
question. Thank you. That'd be the appropriate way to handle this. Thank you
Mr. Chairman, to your right, representing Maynard has a question of your yield.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield?
Yes.
For the priority status within 50 miles of a military base, since there are so many veteran
nonprofit associations, especially in my district in the inner city, how does the grant fund
process work is it saying that it's going to give priority to those within the 50
miles and if those funds are then depleted, they're gone. I'm just trying to
understand. The department is designed to set up the rules and regulations as
to how to implement this particular program. We just put a few little
few little stipulations out there as to what we like to see happen. So I think
that would be part of their package, Representative Mayer. I hope that answers
your question. I'll talk to you later. Thank you. Thank you.
I will, sir.
Let's see, we have a new member with a question.

518.
House Bill 518 by President Cameron in the first and others to be entitled an act to amend Title 34 of the fiscal to George annotated relating to labor and industrial relations, so it's changed certain provisions relating to employment security.
Mr. Bill, I refer to the Committee on Industry and Labor that Committee recommends a dispelled do pass by Committee Substitute.
Representing Mike Cameron is recognized to present the bill.
Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker and thank you colleagues.
I bring a bill today on behalf of the Georgia Department of Labor regarding administrative assessments.
In 1987, the legislature passed a bill creating administrative assessment for employers in the state of Georgia.
This small amount of wages, percentage of wages, goes towards the administrative cost of the Department of Labor.
of Labor. It's been renewed numerous times over the years. Unfortunately in 2022 it was not renewed
and it's sunset and reverted back to a rate that was for 1987 based on the tables from the Department
of Labor. This bill will put it back at the rate that it was last year which is 2.64%. The second
Second part of the bill is Article 6, creates a percentage assessment of 0.06% that will
be assessed to new employers who haven't built up the experience with the Department of
Labor.
Mr. Pickard, that's the bill.
I don't want to answer any questions.
The gentleman you owe for a question?
Yes, sir.
A yield.
from the 108th representing Jasmine Clark to your left has a question.
Thank you Mr. Piger does it gentlemen you. Yes ma'am. So can you clarify you said
new employers will have 0.06% fee on top of the 2.64%? That's correct because
they don't have an experience built up with the Department of Labor. The rates
are based on it's almost like an insurance rate. The near you are the higher
your rate is it's like build up experience with the department the rate will be
calculated a lower rate. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. When do you
stop becoming new? So how long will these newer businesses be required to pay
the extra 0.06 percent? That hadn't been specified. Thank you. You're welcome.
Gentlemen, you have one more question. Yes, sir. Chairman Casey Carpenter has a
question to you right in the room. Does the gentleman yield to my friend from
from Dalton, yes.
Yeah, is it not true that that typically happens
after three years, after three years,
the rate changes after the review process?
That's pretty much correct.
Unless the employer has a giant number of claims
against her unemployment with the state,
they would drop.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, ask no further questions.
Now, yield the well.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And that's for your favor of consideration.
There is another speaker on the bill, which who wishes to be heard.
Representative Holly is recognized to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you members for being able to hear me on this bill.
Fortunately, I can say that while it was heard in the industry labor committee,
Many times we actually have a very good job of actually being able to bring questions
on these matters to the forefront.
Unfortunately for that day, my high blood pressure was a little elevated, so thanks to your
prayers, I was able to come back, but I could not actually pose these questions and in committee
so I would like to address them here.
And it's coming from a very different position than you might actually hear.
This is really not something that we're seeing of, you know, Republicans and Democrats fighting
it out.
No.
This is merely a measure, I think, that we should look into particularly because we know
that we've already seen a pandemic.
We know that in order for us to have Georgia in a stable position, we need to be able to
build back our accounts for our unemployment and insurance trust fund.
right now because the rates that are particularly,
if you're looking section one in the Alliance 37 to 41,
we're seeing that the contribution rates for employees
is actually, it's becoming suppressed.
We know that, and I think probably all of us
can agree in this chamber, that we know that the Federal Reserve,
it's not above them to actually, in order to address
address the inflation, we know that they are willing to put the economy into another
recession.
And so therefore, we need to be able to make sure that we are showing up the investments
into our unemployment insurance trust fund, but we have to do that in a way that does
not have it so that only a minority of those employers are showing up those funds.
We need to make it so that it is broad across the board.
If you'll notice, just follow with me, if you will.
I know some of this is a little granular.
If you look for instance, for our section one,
we look for line 17, where you get part A,
and compare that for line 32, that 2.64,
the variance from that 2.7% to 2.64%.
The part is, is that really, you're looking at this on overall Georgia's employers for
the most part, are paying at 1.23% into that trust fund.
And so, you know, we want to make sure that it actually is more balanced.
And when you're only 12% of the UI benefit payouts are attributed to employers who lay off
workers, who then enroll in unemployment insurance, they're assessed when determining
Georgia's employees level of trust fund solvency responsibility, and that's compared to a nationwide average of around 45 percent
So we again want to be on par because we know that should Georgia
Find ourselves in a situation where we're now having to pay money out for unemployment insurance
We don't want to have our state
Have those funds
is dwindled down to where now we're having to rely on other states to borrow money from
other states and to borrow it at a higher interest rate.
We want to make sure that if we can be able to have it so that employers of themselves,
new employers coming in, that that 2.64 percent, that we can actually match that up.
So that 2.7 percent is ground leads one that employers are paying into.
And we know that it's going to be able to help to be able to shore up those resources
should we get into a situation where we're having a recession, okay?
So I know a lot of this sometimes you're looking saying, well you know what, isn't that just
at the federal level?
What are we doing this for?
Can't we rely on the U.S. government to bail us out?
But we already know that it's always better if we can be, I know it's probably going
to be a surprise for you to hear.
A Democrat say this is probably best if we be conservative
with our assets, making sure that our unemployment
insurance trust fund actually has the money available.
How will this help individuals in each of your districts?
Very easily.
You all forget my uncle Al, he didn't aid too much and he's too many jokes right now.
But here's, okay, all jokes aside really, this is not a funny measure.
Gentlemen, gentlemen suspend just for a moment, respect the gentleman in the well, continue.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We all want to make sure that for those workers who have to find those job opportunities,
that they're able to do so because, not because they're reliant their whole life on this
little bit of money for the unemployment insurance trust fund.
We want to make sure that they're able to just get their resumes, be able to get, you
know, suits, get job training, get what's necessary to allow for Georgia to continue to remain
competitive for those jobs that are coming here.
And we know that that money is actually through the unemployment trust fund.
So we just want to make sure that while enough attention to detail has been explained for
that 0.06% that is going to be drawn out for the administrative assessment fee by the
commit that will come to the commissioner, we want to make sure that our reserves are
stored up for those workers should they find themselves jobless so that we can remain
the number one state in the country for doing business.
We have to take care of Georgia workers and by making sure that that amount is actually
one that our employers are able to pay into that it's fair across the board, we won't
be relying on other states to help us pony up funds when we need them.
And that is all I have, but I appreciate, I would, I would only suggest that you vote
no on this bill.
So when it comes back to committee, we have an opportunity to actually have an amount
that's going to be fair and equitable for all Georgia businesses.
And for that, I will yield the well.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
The gentleman has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
Chair, here's none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?
Chair, here's none.
The committee's substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was
favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair has done the report of the committee is
agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote
Yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine.
What purpose does chairman work highs arise?
Parliamentary inquiry.
Stature inquiry.
Actually, this was a question for the author just left
because I'm a little confused if the reason he's trying
to get this body to vote against this bill
because the rate is not enough, it sounds counterintuitive
to get this body to vote for a bill down,
which would give us a zero rate
and zero times anything is zero,
so that any time a member of this body can drop a bill
for a different rate,
the voting against this bill would be
to do the exact opposite of what the speaker just requested.
That's true.
They didn't help me, but if the gentleman's so states,
I get it.
For what purpose does representative Mayna rise?
Thank you, Speaker.
Is it not true?
Is this a parliamentary inquiry?
Parliamentary inquiry, please.
Statue inquiry.
Is it not true that I was going to ask Representative
Holley a question, but he yielded the will.
And is it not further true that I was going to ask?
And his mind, if we change the 600th of a percentage point, would it be in his eyes that he would
rather the employers, the business community, to have a higher percentage rate to contribute
to this fund?
Is that not true?
I'm sure the lady believes that it would be true.
She says states, we're going to take a couple more and then we're going to finish
this one up. Representative Wilkerson, let's see for what purpose is
representing Wilkerson rise. Parliament inquiry. Stature inquiry. Is it not true
that if we do not pass this bill then the rate would go back up to 2.7 versus
falling down to 2.64? Therefore as a result of the pandemic and the run on
unemployment that we may want to go back to 2.7 to help short that
reserve and I believe that is what the author is looking for or the the gentleman
that was speaking in the wells looking for. I'm sure the gentleman has
expertise in this area and he's correcting what he says states last one let's
see he did present his ideas but we'll give him one more shot what purpose is
representative Holly rise.
Follow me in, Chris, sir.
Stay tuned, Quarry.
Is it not true for one that this is a very convoluted measure.
And so we appreciate people at least trying to stay at paying attention.
That number two, I appreciate the requests for my colleague to try to attempt
to at least put a question towards me.
And that three, and finally, Mr. Speaker that all this we're asking
for is that if this bill goes back to committee,
that at least you can be discussed for a fair rate,
not a rate of zero.
Because again, we want to make sure
that if it are possible, businesses can be able to pay in for it.
We all believe that Georgia is the number one state
for the country for doing business.
But we just want to make sure that for those jobs
that come to our state, our workers who are maybe jobless,
may be able to use those funds because they're available,
because they're there that will allow for them
to be able to get the training and the resources necessary
to get into the jobs of the future.
And that is also.
I'm sure the gentleman believes in his inquiry
and it was in there someplace.
Is there any of them?
Excuse me, he got me mixed up.
Now.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, let's see, Mr. Clerk.
We've got all the members have voted, I think.
I believe we have, have you members all of you voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill. The yeas are 105, the nays 64. This bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We have one remaining
bill on today's calendar and in House bill 212 will be postponed to the next legislative
day.
Well, we're ready for afternoon orders, Representative Holley kind of talked me in a circle there.
But we got to the end.
We'll move on to afternoon orders.
