----------
Good afternoon. It is good to be with you each and every one of y'all like to
thank and welcome all my Senate colleagues and members here today. This is to
talk about the majority caucuses agenda for this upcoming legislative session.
I think it's if it's not clear already what what some of our top priorities
are going to be we will we will crystallize it for you here today so but
But obviously, one of the things that we're going to lead on this legislation session,
something that we started last year, and I know we got Chair Lady Kille Kirkpatrick here
today.
And that is on the children and family front.
That's something we've taken a lot of pride in, is leading on our foster care system,
our defect system, as well as making it access to adopting children more affordable and
more efficient to you the truth. So I'm proud to know that
Senator Kirkpatrick is going to be leading on that. Public safety is a big issue.
Obviously we we led with a number of things whether it's on bail bonds issues
or making it a repeat of tough wrong crime making it for repeat offenders
and things of that nature. We're going to continue our work in public safety.
We're proud to give our state troopers the largest pay increase that
in the history of the state and with the help of this body as well as obviously the governor's office
and the house we were able to accomplish that and we're going to do more on that front.
Obviously school choice is still going to be a priority something that we were able to pass
last year out of the Senate for the first time was a school choice measure which would I think
and power our parents and students and give them the ability to have more options for their
children. We think it's a common sense approach to things and we're looking forward to when
the House takes that up. This legislation session, I will tell you right now, oh and no
tort reform. We're going to take the lead on tort reform and try to get some measures
done for our business community and that's something that I'm proud to work with the
group behind us here. Also had a very good, had a very good working relationship with
our majority leader Steve Geuch as well as a President Pro Tem, John Kennedy. I've
got a long history with these two gentlemen working in the Senate myself and we can continue
to work together, and I think have a very, very good coalition here.
I will happy to take any questions afterwards, but I want to kick it over to the pro-tem
of the Senate, Senator John Kennedy.
Kennedy?
Thank you.
All right.
Well, good afternoon, thank you for being here, and thanks for covering what will be our
presentation of our priorities for the majority caucus.
I'm going to first thank the Lieutenant Governor Jones for his remarks and all of the
state Republican colleagues that are working to deliver real results for the people of
Georgia.
I also want to thank Governor Kim for his steady hand and visionary leadership for our
state.
For those following along at home, I want to point out that the legislative priorities
for our caucus come from the members that you see behind me, the Republican elected
senators from around the state.
Through the interim, our caucus members have worked overtime.
We've been listening to folks back home.
We've been working with our constituents from across the state to determine what the
very priorities will be that you're going to hear about today.
From Dalton to Savannah, from Bainbridge to Raven Gap, our priorities reflect the issues
that Georgians are focused on.
Our members are committed to delivering on good, common-sense policies for Georgia families.
In 2023, Senate Republicans launched an ambitious agenda to tackle what matters to Georgians,
kitchen table issues with an aim to keep Georgia on track to be the best state to live, work,
and raise a family.
Senate Republicans have focused this last session and will continue to focus on expanding
economic opportunities and innovation, cultivating an educated workforce which is so critical
for the continued success of our state.
and also increasing the safety of our communities
and ensuring the well-being of the most vulnerable
that live among us as our neighbors.
For the past two years,
under the leadership of Chairman Blake Tillery
and Chairman Chuck Huffsteller,
Senate Republicans have delivered over $2 billion
in income tax and property rebates
for hard-working Georgians.
Building on that success,
we're committed to accelerating the reduction
of the state income tax in 2024.
Because unlike some politicians in Washington,
Senate Republicans believe that the unused tax dollars
that make their way to the Capitol
really belong to the pockets of Georgians
not overfunded government programs.
In addition to Chairman Billy Hickman's undeniable passion
to improve literacy rates for our children
across the state,
Senate Republicans believe it is time to put parents
in control of their children's education
and pass the Georgia Promise Scholarship Act
to expand educational opportunities for all of our students.
We believe that student success
should not be limited by the zip code
in which the child lives,
and students should not be trapped
in an underperforming school.
I wanna thank Chairman Greg Dolezal
for sponsoring this legislation.
And I wanna thank Governor Camp and Lieutenant Governor
Jones for your commitment to getting school choice done
this year in the 2024 session.
With $24 billion in economic development in 2023 alone,
Senate Republicans are committed to building a robust workforce
and cutting red tape to ensure that our businesses stay open
and Georgians are able to stay on the job.
Spear headed by Chairman Larry Walker,
Senate Republicans are working towards streamlining
employment pathways for veterans and military spouses
and recruiting much needed medical personnel for our state
as staff, the health care needs that we have across Georgia.
In addition to growing our workforce, it is past time to provide relief from frivolous
lawsuits that clog our courts, delay justice for everyday Georgians who need access to those
court houses, and stifle the business community.
I want to thank Governor Camp and, again, Lieutenant Governor Jones for their willingness
to support new tort reform initiatives this session.
Although our economy continues to boom, there is no denying that rising crime continues
to be on the minds of citizens every corner across this great state that we love so much.
We believe that safe communities are in our prosperous communities and that our law enforcement
officers are the real life superheroes.
Center Republicans will always support our men and women in uniform and those first responders
and we will continue to crack down on games,
violent criminals, and hold rogue prosecutors accountable.
That's why we must pass bail bond reform
to keep violent criminals and repeat offenders off the street.
I want to thank Quip, Randy Robertson,
and our Public Safety Committee Chairman John Albers,
both behind me for leading the charge
on creating a safer Georgia for all of us.
Before I hand it off to my good friend,
the majority leader, Steve Gooch, to reveal exactly what our caucus priorities are for 2024.
I want to thank each and every member of this caucus for your tireless efforts to improve
our state.
If your senator is behind me right now, I want you to know that they are focused on delivering
results for you at home.
This team, under the leadership of our Pro Tem Office and Majority Leaders Office and
our Lieutenant Governor who has worked so hard to work with our Senate and is making great
strides and the efforts that we need for a better Georgia know that our brightest days
are ahead of us.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our majority leader for him to share more
details on our caucus priorities.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Pro Tem Kennedy.
Thank you, Governor Jones.
I stand before you representing the men and women behind me
to discuss further the details and follow up
from last year's huge success we had
in the General Assembly and primarily in the Senate.
Big ideas can come at an instant,
but big wins take preparation, study, hard work,
persistence and time to accomplish.
So here we are in 2024.
The second year of our two-year session,
and we're looking for a big finish.
We've had several momentous efforts
that in one form or another began a year ago,
and Senate Republicans are determined to finish the drill.
Before we get down to the unfinished business,
I want to highlight a few senators
that helped us get off to a great start last year.
First, Senator Billy Hickman began a comprehensive
Senate led effort to improve literacy in our state.
Our aspirational goal of bringing our literacy rates
in line with rising graduation rates
are becoming a reality.
This kind of ambitious undertaking doesn't happen overnight
and requires a multifaceted approach.
So Senator Hickman has a few more tools
he wants to add to the toolbox,
including expanding access to pre-K.
As these new ideas take shape over the coming weeks, Senator Hickman has our
unwavering support. Thank you for your leadership, Senator Hickman.
Similarly, Senator Kate Kirkpatrick has spearheaded the Senate's efforts to
strengthen our foster care system. As chair of the newly formed children and
families committee and with the full backing of Lieutenant Governor Jones,
Senator Kirkpatrick ushered several bills to improve conditions for foster
chair foster children and parents last year. Senator Kirkpatrick hosted a study
committee over the summer looking to build on our initial success that will
produce several new initiatives this session including increasing
permanency within the foster care program and retaining case workers at
defects. Thank you Senator Kirkpatrick and thank you Lieutenant Governor Jones
loans for all that you do for our state's most vulnerable children.
Additionally, last year was marked by a monumental tax relief effort, a billion dollars for state
income taxpayers, a billion more dollars for property owners, multiple suspensions of the
gas tax throughout the year while hardworking Georgians were filling the crush of
of Biden inflation, all at the time when Washington, D.C. was racking up massive debts, high
gas prices, and unaffordable mortgage rates. We did not get into the strong fiscal position
to deliver historic tax relief without strong leadership, leadership from Governor
Kim, leadership from Governor Jones, and leadership from our speaker, John Burns. And within
In our caucus, steady strong leadership from Senate Finance Chair Chuck Huffstettler and
Senate Appropriations Chair Blake Tillery were there the whole step of the way.
This year we will be accelerating the largest income tax cut in our state's history.
But our caucus wants to do more, even more, for the taxpayers, specifically homeowners.
And Hustettler Senate Bill 349 will provide a floating homestead exemption statewide to exempt
property tax increases over 3%.
With homeowners being squeezed by increasing assessments and high interest rates, Senate
Bill 394 is a Republican-led priority.
Tax policy is one of the main drivers of our state's overall economic prosperity.
Lower taxes are welcomed by residents and by businesses like.
Another important contributor to our overall economic environment is our litigation climate.
The Senate has tested the waters on civil justice reform in recent years.
Numerous senators that stand behind me, such as Senators Kennedy, Senators Calzert,
Sean Still, Jason Antivatarte, myself and many others have spent the last four years
traveling this state, gathering data and facts on the needs for civil justice reforms in
our state.
Now with the Lieutenant Governor's help, we will pass legislation limiting direct action
lawsuits in Georgia.
This legislation will lead to more access for personal and commercial insurance coverage
for all of Georgia's.
In addition to his important budget duties, Chairman Tillery, you heard me, Chairman Blake
Tillery is going to help us get a meaningful tort reform bill across the finish line in
this year's session.
Senator Greg Dolezal has also been working on a premises liability bill, which I believe
should receive strong consideration by the Senate this session.
But I know Senator Dolezal is going to be busy finishing the drill on another piece of
important legislation called the Education Bill, primarily dealing with parental choice.
Senator Dolezal, Senate Bill 233, the Georgia Promise Scholarship Act, will provide school
choice for students trapped in underperforming public schools. This bill is a thoughtful
piece of compromise that came through our Senate last year. It received unanimous support
from our caucus before stalling in the House late in last year's session. We believe
that the House has come to grips with this piece of legislation and they will be moving
it forward in the coming days and weeks ahead. Senator Dolezal will not stop. Governor
will not stop, our caucus will not stop until we deliver a historic opportunity for a better education for students by giving engaged parents school choice.
Today, we have talked about better education opportunities for the citizens of this state.
That's because Georgia has an abundance of economic opportunity for those who are prepared to seize on it.
Opportunity is also the reason why we had three separate study committees looking at ways
to improve our workforce readiness.
Senator John Albers sent Senate study committee on expanding Georgia's workforce.
Senator Bo Hatches, study committee on rural health care personnel recruitment and Senator
Larry Walker's study committee on occupational licensing are three examples of the work
that we have done preparing for this year's session.
While several of the key recommendations from the committees will result in legislation
this session, one stood out as a top priority for our caucus this year.
With Senator Walker's help, we will develop a military medics and corpsman's program
similar to the Virginia model, where we can offer career and credentialing pathways for
veterans and military spouses seeking employment and Georgia's health care system.
This effort supports veterans, it expands our health care workforce, and contains elements
in line with Lieutenant Governor Jones' red tape rollback that he announced previously.
This initiative with many other senators behind us are going to implement these priorities
as we go forward in the coming weeks.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention one of the most overlooked components to
economic development, and that is safe communities.
by Senator John Albers, our Public Safety Chairman, and our majority whip, Randy Robertson.
Senate Republicans had an impactful year for Public Safety in 2023, cracking down on
gangs, repeat offenders, and violent felons in our state.
That said, we have one legislative priority remaining from last year.
That's Senator Robertson, Senate Bill 63, also known as the bail bond reform legislation
to eliminate no cash bail for violent offenders
in our state.
Will Robertson got it all the way
to a conference committee in last year's session.
And I know he is ready to go to work
and he's ready to finish the drill
and to bring that conference committee report
to the floor of the Senate in the house.
In doing so, we will close the revolving door
that lets violent criminals back out on our streets
way too easily in Georgia.
In summary, the Senate will be laser focused on big ideas,
boosting literacy, improving foster care,
expanding our workforce, and big wins,
massive tax relief, school choice, and safer streets
in our state.
Every one of these accomplishments in their own right
are generational opportunities to make life better
for the people we serve.
Big ideas, big wins, and a big finish to this 2023-2024
convening of the Georgia General Assembly.
These are very important issues Senate Republicans
will deliver for everyday Georgians in 2024's session.
And that's why Senate Republicans are committed
to finishing the drill.
Thank you for attending today's press conference.
I'm happy to take a few questions at this time.
on the floor, you know, if, uh, once they're presented, uh, brought to us by, uh, members,
But if there's one thing I heard from the business community as well, I know these senators
can speak to this.
One thing we heard from the business community more than anything else was the climate
in which we're in right now, as far as the tort climate that we're in right now and
the need they need to see something subsequently from the general assembly.
I think what the governor's doing is great in gathering a lot of information and leading
on that from gathering it from the business, from the insurance companies and things of
that nature.
But there's some things out there that we already know that could be done that we presented
in years past and we just didn't have the horsepower to get it done.
Yes, ma'am?
We made the move as a Senate body last year to say that we want access to health care
to be a priority and that was the whole reason why we wanted to reform CON.
That's something that we have led on.
We passed it out of the Senate last year.
It is in the hands of the House right now.
I've heard rumors, nothing concrete.
I've heard rumors that the house is going to come with a proposal of some sort, so we're
open to see what that proposal is, but our stance has been in order to improve access
to health care, you're going to have to reform this certificate of need and that's what we're
doing.
Now, let me let me let me clarify that our what we said is we wanted to have a grant program that would enable locals to determine how to
beef up the security and safety of their of their school respected school districts and that's what exactly what we have we have a grant
program. Also the governor now is also put in a hundred million dollars to go
towards school safety, but our whole initiative is about improving school safety
and allowing the locals to determine the best use for that money when they apply
for that grant. But thank you though. Well y'all easy crowd. Thank y'all for
We're having us here today, and one last question.
I think mental health is obviously going to be
a part of the conversation, this legislative session,
and parts of 520, or of things that our committee,
our chairman, Watson, brought, discussed last year
last year and their parts of it that that we really like on the
Senate side. There's other parts that we thought needed a little work and we're
going to continue to work on those things and and and we also wanted to get a
good feel as far as the price tag that went with the mental health from last
year. Also get some feedback on just two years ago we put in I think 60
million dollars to that agency for mental health since well and see what kind
of benefits we've gotten from that. So like I said it is a two-year process and
And we're going to take the two years that we have here and vet that mental health bill,
but it's definitely a priority for us to do something on mental health.
So thank you all very much.
Appreciate it.
