TRANSCRIPT
----------
All right. Good afternoon. We'll go ahead and call to order the subcommittee on
economic development preparation subcommittee to order. We are awaiting
several other members coming from the caucus meetings, but we'll go ahead and
get started. So we've got a tight afternoon and a lot of meetings piling up this
afternoon, but we're going to start with we're in a prayer from brother Mac Jackson.
Amen.
Amen.
Father, in the name of Jesus, as we come before you, we ask for your wisdom, your guidance,
as we do the business of this great state of Georgia.
We thank you for the privilege, Lord, of being here today in Jesus' name, amen.
Thank you, sir, amen.
All right.
We're going to start with Commissioner of Agriculture, Tyler Harper, if you'll come on with
Commissioner.
I'm right here.
You already there.
Yes, sir.
I know I don't have my stool so you couldn't have saw me I apologize again it's
still in the middle you move quick commissioner there
I'll turn it over you commission thank you for being here today yes sir thank
you mr. Chairman appreciate the members of the committee and appreciate your
our work together as we do the work of the people of our great state especially
when it comes to our state's number one industry which is agriculture and the
working with you to ensure that we have the resources to do the job that our
team does every single day. So I'm just going to dive right on into this really
quick and just go over a few things. As always some of this we went over
during the Joint Appropriations Committee meeting but number one industry but a
lot goes on with agriculture and there's a lot of indirect industries that are
tied to what we do every single day and what our agency does to ensure that
that industry successful, as I always say, if the agency that oversees the number one industry
isn't doesn't have the resources to do the job it does, it's hard to ensure the number
one industry successful every single day. So that's what our team works to do. And we do that
with 22 different divisions over 70 different licenses that we issued 88,000 license entities
throughout the state. We have about 80-20 split on our funding, as y'all know, and there
are a number of agencies and entities that are administratively attached to the department,
as y'all know that that funding passes through us to those, and you'll hear from some of them
later today. Y'all heard me talk about the rural center at the joint meeting, but everything
is going well here. They are completely integrated under the Department of Agriculture now. They are
utilizing facilities in our tifton location. We also have the LAJ office in
North Georgia and we are hitting the ground running with that and look
forward to the work that we're going to be able to do through that. In relation
to the block grant honestly unfortunately there's really no update since we
spoke last week. The only update I can really give you is everything is in USDA's
hands. We're waiting on them and matter of fact the last two meetings we had
scheduled with them. We're canceled by them. So we're still waiting on them to get back
with us on finalizing our block grant so we can get those dollars out to our farm families.
But on our side, when it comes to the Department of Agriculture, we're ready to go. We got
the website up and running farmrecovery.com. We have the applications ready to go live.
We're just waiting on that final thumbs up from USDA and ready to go to work to get
that $531 million out the door.
So we talked about the Farmland Conservation Fund the other day
as well.
We actually have a follow-up meeting
on the application tomorrow afternoon to finalize that
so we can get those applications out the door
to start protecting Farmland in our great state.
And we look forward to doing that.
As a follow-up to what we talked about the other day
As many of you know, we have a second confirmed case
of high path even influenza.
Since we met last in Walker County also,
another broader reader operation of Broler Farm.
And so that is the second confirmed case
in our state in the last less than two weeks.
Our team is currently deployed up there
and have been since that first outbreak in Walker County
and been working overtime to get that done.
That said, the winter storm, winter storm firm,
obviously halted some of those operations.
We pulled our team out for safety purposes,
but they were redeployed early this morning
to continue working on getting that addressed.
We have it, as I said the other day,
it's completely contained.
We're just finalizing C&D on the site
and hope to be wrapping that up very soon there
in Walker County.
In relation to the winter storm really quick,
I just wanna say specifically that this storm
was the first time where we had a multi-agency partnership.
I wanna publicly thank Director Johnny Sabo
as well as Commissioner Walter Raven.
Our three agencies worked in conjunction with each other.
Had a multi-agency unified command
based out of the Georgia Forestry Commission office
and making during the entire winter storm event.
And our three agencies partnered together
to address the issues that Georgians were facing
during the storm and helping ensure
that that was taken care of.
And I think this is a perfect example
of how our entities work together
to ensure that we're doing the job
that Georgians ask us to do
and protecting Georgians when they need it,
especially in tough times like this.
And so it was an awesome example of how
our agencies work together
under the unification of the State Operation Center
and GEMA and the work that they do.
And at the Department of Agriculture,
we're proud to play a part in that
ESF 11 lead through the State Operation Center and our work that we do through emergency
management.
And part of the reason is we've talked about the focus we have had at the agency on
focusing on our efforts to build out our emergency management capability to respond to those
issues and events that affect our farm families and consumers of this state, high path even
influenza, be an example.
The yellow-legged hornet, be an another example.
The cotton jasset, the spider lantern fly, a winter storm, a hurricane, a tornado,
And so we continue to focus our efforts to ensure that we're addressing those issues.
I meant to mention this the other day when we hit on the yellow legged hornet really quick,
every one of those dots that you see on that screen and there's a lot of them are traps.
Those are traps that we have deployed as an agency to ensure that we're monitoring where
that hornet is and ensuring that we're catching it.
As you can see, we have on the west side there is a line of traps and that basically is
that border to ensure that nothing is moving out of that Savannah region as we
continue to work through that. Our HIP program, as I discussed the other day, we
have over the last year we have really ramped up our efforts. You know, October
24 is when the law went into effect and we have really been working to
address this issue. We have done over 1100 inspections over 1200 violations.
The most significant violation that we find as I mentioned the other day is no
COAs, but we also find issues related to warning labels and food and candy
resemblance among other things. Every one of those dots on the right side that
you see, and if you zoomed in there would be more dots that will populate
obviously, but that is a licensed entity through the Department of Agriculture
to sell product in our state. And those are the entities that our inspectors
are going in every day to address the issues related to this program.
Obviously thanks to your help we've been able to get some of that funding about a little
over a million dollars is what we get for our hemp program.
This past year it brought in a little over two million dollars to the state.
We get about half of that around the program.
We have five inspectors, those five inspectors, civilian inspectors are the ones that did
though over 1,100 inspections.
We have two license coordinators that work to address the licensing side to ensure that
that we're bringing in that money.
And we have, as I mentioned the other day,
we have of the almost 1200 inspections,
81 of those were transferred to law enforcement
for criminal investigation.
27 of those 81 were related to issues related
to under 21 sales.
And in some of those cases,
we have actually either executed search warrants
or taken proper action and taken people to jail
if they deserved it.
So depending upon the outcome of that particular case.
In relation to the farmer's markets,
you have or should have or will have.
I know we offered copies of these,
the Georgia Agricultural Trust Fund report.
If you walk through that report,
I'm not going to walk through it.
I'm just going to talk about it real briefly
and say this, that report will give you insight
into what's going on in our farmer's markets.
The work that we're doing is an agency to invest in those in addition to the funding
that you allow us to have allowed us to operate with and thanks to the help of the governor.
The last couple of years to invest specifically in infrastructure here in Atlanta.
But our team done a really good job of putting this report together and I just encourage
you to look through that report and give you some insights specifically into our farmers
markets and the work that we're doing there to ensure that we're maintaining them.
But that said, obviously with the funding that we get including the funding that we get
through the trust fund, it's not enough to keep up with the ongoing maintenance issues
that we have at our farmers markets across the state.
But the funding that you have given us, we have invested wisely and we'll continue to
do that to ensure that those markets are accessible to our producers.
into the specific budget line items in the governor's budget and I appreciate the governor
and their work with us and OPB and others and their staff and obviously in the work that
we've done with them and laying out the issues that we have as an agency and them funding
those needs.
They have included funding for new software for our food safety division.
They've included a little over a million dollars related to some funding issues that we
have brought up to them related to obviously retention of the positions, but also to offset
some of those costs that we have incurred, re-alignment for colas that we have asked for
to help address the issue where we were not made whole on those in prior years.
And then the one-time salary supplement that the governor is funding for all agencies
in that $2,000 fund.
And additionally, in the administration budget, the governor included our asks for the
$450,000 for laptop replacement agency-wide, as well as our cost of living adjustments
and then the $2,000 in additional funding.
And in relation to marketing and promotion, as y'all know last year, you included $200,000
for a Georgia Grown program for specifically to push and highlight Georgia Grown Wood.
This has been a remarkable partnership again between us and the Georgia Forestry Commission
and Director Sabo and his team as well as others that have collaborated together to promote
Georgia Grown Wood products and the governor has increased this from 200 to 660.
We're proud of that increase and think this is an awesome opportunity to highlight one
of our proud commodities here in our state, which is our forestry industry, where the
number one forestry state in the nation.
And I think this is a perfect time for us to promote this specifically to help us bring
in new businesses, a new opportunity for our forestry industry as the number one forestry
state in the nation.
And so we appreciate that and support that ad.
in other adjustments for COLA's, the $2,000 increase and then same thing for the center
for rural prosperity and innovation or the rural center, the $2,000 one-time ad.
That said, Mr. Chairman, in relation to what our asks are, we appreciate everything from
the governor and their help with OPB but this lays out our asks number two and
three we'll talk about in FY27 that was the governor included some funding
for both of those and in FY27 so we'll forego discussing those but
obviously we'll have deeper conversation about that when we get to the big
budget but in relation to the little budget we have some ongoing and one time
need some of this was funded in the governor's budget and we are significantly appreciative of it.
But we wanted to bring forward the other one time and continuing asks that we have because
of reduction in funding that we have seen as we discussed in the joint appropriations committee
meeting the other day. The shortfalls in the colas and also our software needs that we have
as an agency. You know every so often we have to upgrade that software or we have to renew
that software and those things cost money to do so and we don't have any ongoing funding
to provide to do that with and so our ask is to receive that funding for those particular
programs and those are laid out on that sheet that each of you should have that one
pager as well as here on the slideshow related to the different divisions that need that
additional funding and the reasons for the cola and the deficit that we have seen in our,
especially in our meat inspection program but also in food safety and meat
inspection as well in the federal shortfall as well as the federal cut that we
received in those particular programs. In relation to our department as I said
earlier we have over 88,000 licensed entities now that is a 33% increase since
I walked in the door and we've only increased our employment by about 12% in
in that same time period.
This is a, so if you do in the math,
that's about a 15% increase in workload
on our employees agency-wide.
This is just a snapshot.
As I said, we have over 22 different divisions.
When you add in our programs,
it gets to over 50 different programs
that we as an agency oversee.
This is just a snapshot of four of those
and kind of the issues that we see there
with vacancies and the federal cuts
and other things that have impacted us as an agency,
specifically in food safety and meat inspections.
Those were actually cuts that were happened
in the last year of the Biden administration
that hit us to the tune of almost a million dollars.
But when you look at that, our fuel team, 41 folks,
it takes the 41 folks to check about 117,000 pumps.
We have almost 200,000 in the state
and they're adding new ones every day among other things.
And as I mentioned the other day in our meet inspection program,
due to lack of staffing, we've had to, unfortunately,
decline the ability to open up new establishments
in our state because of that.
That said, Mr. Chairman, you asked specifically
about turnover rate in our last meeting.
And so as an agency, when you look at our consumer protection
division alone, it's about right after I walked in the door
really after the first six months.
this is starting in FY 24, our turnover rate in FY 24 was 22% for our consumer protection
division, 21% as an agency.
FY 25, thanks to y'all's help and the work that we've done together and increasing salaries
and that investment that y'all have made.
We went from that to a 13% turnover rate to FY 26.
now at a little over 11% turnover rate agency wide, 12% in consumer protection, but even
with that, Mr. Chairman, we still have issues because we're still having to decline licenses
for entities.
We still lose meat inspectors to federal agencies.
It takes us 18 months to train a meat inspector.
We lose food safety inspectors to other state agencies.
So it is a continual battle that we have as an agency, but definitely something that
we have with your help.
We have helped slow the bleed, so to speak, and we appreciate y'all's help in helping
us do that.
But our continued work together can help us ensure that we have the resources we need to
do the job that we do every single day.
And so that is the ask for the Department of Agriculture for Amended Fiscal Year 26,
Mr. Chairman, if there are, I do have one thing to add,
but from one of our attached agencies,
I can pause on that or go right into that
if you would like me to.
Well, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
It is really quick.
As you can imagine, with the ongoing HPA outbreak,
Dr. Zavala and our team at the Georgia poultry lab
are working overtime, and due to the winter storm,
they have been completely inundated
with a lot of samples.
And so she was not able to be here today
and asked if I would mention their ask,
which is the 293,000 for a lab information management system.
That was the, I believe that was what was included.
The range that was quoted for them was 300 to 500,000.
And obviously, if you have any other specific questions
for that, I'm sure Dr. Zavala would be more than happy
to answer those.
but I told her that we would mention that
since she was not able to be here to present that in person.
So, with that, Mr. Chairman,
I'd be happy to answer any questions that y'all may have
and discuss any issues, concerns,
or anything related to our specific ask for AFY26.
Thank you, Commissioner.
And thank you for the great work the department does.
We understand that obviously you cover the largest industry
state of Georgia very important and on a work has to be done and more work is to be done.
Two questions for you, somewhat similarly related, on the federal shortfall, 1.1 million,
do we have any idea of what USDA's anticipation is and actually reimbursing the state for that?
So I will say this, the Trump administration has been working to increase the reimbursement
back to the states or increase the funding to the states specifically for some of those
programs like meat inspection.
However, we haven't got any specifics on that as of yet, and we're waiting to get that
information.
But regardless, those specific shortfalls have definitely been something that we as an
agency that's been made it difficult for us to operate and it cuts into our state funding
and other areas that we would be able to utilize those funds to continue to bring on additional
employees and things such as that.
The other thing that I'll mention, Mr. Chairman, that we've talked about before as well is
the last couple of years.
We appreciate the pay raise, but as you know, the state, our meeting inspectors are 50-50,
our EPA-funded employees are 75-25 or 80-20 food safety is in that 75-25 or 80-20 range
depending upon the position.
So we only get 50% of the funds, put it, put in our budget to fund those pay raises for
those employees.
Well, as you can imagine, as a state agency, I'm not going to give an employee that's
standing side by side with another employee, a different pay raise.
We're going to treat them the same, and so that eats into our budget significantly.
We continually ask the federal government for that increase in our reimbursement rate
to ensure that we can cover that pay raise,
but unfortunately, in my three years,
we have yet to get that reimbursement.
We ask every year.
We constantly have that communication with USDA,
but we've yet to get that funding.
And so every year, we're still shorted any of those dollars
to cover those additional pay raises
that we're currently covering, or trying to cover,
within our own budget, which creates budgetary issues
from us as an agency-wide in being strategic
and how we address the issues that we face every single day,
especially when it comes to hiring more staff
and ensuring that we're able to meet the mission
that we've been asked to do.
Thank you for that.
Any questions from members of the committee?
Mr. Jackson.
Thank you, Commissioner, for the great work that you do
for this great state of Georgia.
You mentioned the Center for Rule Innovation and Prosperity being under AG now and Dean Green
and I chaired the Rule Development Council and we worked closely with Dr. Bridges and
on Scott Blunt.
I didn't hear what was in the budget this year for the Rule Innovation Center.
So the budget for the Center for Rule Prosperity and Innovation was last year, the legislature
included a little over $2 million in our budget.
That is a continuation in our budget this year.
It's a little over $2 million.
It's included for the rural center budget
that the rural center will utilize to operate.
And the new executive director is Charlie Fivash.
He's hit the ground running.
And the remainder of the staff has stayed the same.
But obviously to you, to y'all, to the co-chairman,
anything that we as an agent seeker do
or director Fivash can do,
We want to be a resource and please lean on him
as you have the rural center in years past.
But the funding for the rural center
is a continuation from last year.
With the exception of the $2,000 supplement
for the state employees.
Thank you.
Representative Giljard.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, you know, I didn't attend the Wildhawk supper,
but you've got a big plate of food here, Commissioner.
Thank you for your service and your great leadership.
When you were going over the repairs for the farmer's market,
it was near and dear to my heart as a freshman.
When we came up with the legislation for the farmers,
oversight committee, the House and the Senate came back
and we had someone do a study about the farmer's market.
Your hands are full because you're trying to renovate,
outdated and antiquated property.
I just want to make a recommendation
that moving forward in the future, we give you what you need either to take those farmers
markets to the next level or to do something different.
If something is not working, then we've got to try something else.
But to keep having you have to bandage those outdated, antiquated buildings, we've got
to do something different.
So I want to thank you for your leadership and I just hope that we can move forward to
this issue in that manner.
Thank you, Representative Gillard.
I appreciate that, and I would agree with those comments.
Thank you, Representative Guillard.
Commissioner, we talked just briefly about it,
and you mentioned in your comments
the number of facilities that you have not
been able to issue a license for because the lack of an inspector
to inspect.
Can you talk a little bit more about that
in which where we need to go, likely in the 27 budget,
to make sure that we are covering all areas
of agriculture that need covering.
So I will speak to that kind of in two ways, Mr. Chairman.
One, there are some entities and licensed entities
that we as an agency are currently taking
a real serious look at.
And seeing is there a way that we can bring in
and utilize technology to help us do the job
that we're asked to do every single day
to be more efficient, more effective,
and be able to still execute the mission that we've been asked to do.
That said, there are certain jobs, though,
that you cannot do that with.
It requires a person, it requires an individual,
and in most cases, it requires a person
with a specific level of knowledge and understanding
of that particular subject area to do that job.
Obviously, meat inspection is a perfect example of that.
That takes a physical individual.
For us as an agency, it gets into ensuring
that we're able to work to recruit and hire the best
when it comes to that, and even at some cases to retain,
as we'll talk about in FY27, you know, every year,
we've talked about needing vehicles.
Well, for my employees, that is their office.
And whenever they have a vehicle that has 200,000 miles
on it, among other things and has other maintenance issues,
that becomes a morale problem for staff.
So it's a little, I think in the long term,
Mr. Chairman, it's ensuring that we have the funding
and the resources to hire the right people
when it comes to salaries,
ensure that we have the resources to equip them appropriately every single day when they
go out and do their job and at the same time when it comes to those stresses we have
when it comes to federal funding. If we could have a serious conversation about look at
the end of the day, if we can get reimbursed from the feds, if we could be covered until
we get that reimbursement back from the feds, that would help us have more flexibility as
an agency to ensure that we're able to hire the best, retain the best, and at the same
time equip the best to do the job that we ask them to do every single day.
Thank you, Commissioner, and I look forward to continuing that conversation as we get into
the 27th budget.
So thank you for the great work that you and your team do.
Any other questions from members of the committee?
One last thing, Mr. Chairman, the third sheet you have is Hurricane Helene.
I'm going to mention this a second ago.
It is a list.
It is a map of the counties that are eligible to apply for that block grant.
And as I said earlier, farmrecovery.com is where you can find out more information about
what all is covered under the block grant.
But thank you, Mr. Chairman, appreciate this committee and look forward to our continued
work together.
And just on that note, Commissioner, that map very much mirrors USDA's federal declaration
map.
That is correct.
Yes, sir.
Those are the counties that were declared by the federal government as to be the counties
that were under the disaster, yes sir.
That is a reflection of the same maps that were used for other coverages for other disaster
programs.
Thank you Commissioner.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
We're going to deviate from the agenda just for a moment.
Georgia Humanities, Ms. Mary, if you'll come on forward.
I know you had a special guest with you
that we were, that was here earlier.
First lady of this house, Ms. Dale Barnes,
and she stepped out for a moment,
but wanted to acknowledge that and turn it over to you.
Thank you so much, Chairman Meeks
and members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Economic Development.
Thank you so much for your time.
My name is Mary Warren,
and I serve as president of Georgia Humanities.
I'm very grateful to OPB and Governor Brian Kemp
for his budget recommendation supporting Georgia Humanities
America 250 programming.
Georgia Humanities is now in its 55th year of service
to the people of Georgia.
For more than half a century,
our mission has been to bring history, culture,
civic learning, and civil dialogue directly to communities
and their citizens across the state.
We have a statewide mission,
and particularly those that do not always have access
to large cultural institutions.
Throughout that history, we have been careful stewards of public funds, consistently leveraging
state investment through matching funds, partnerships, and private support to ensure
every dollar goes as far as possible for Georgians.
And in this past year, as we lost federal funding, we really stepped up our fundraising.
In year over year, we brought in 10 times the funding through philanthropy.
As our nation approaches America's 250th anniversary,
Georgia Humanities is uniquely positioned to help ensure
this moment is not only commemorated,
but meaningfully experienced, especially in rural
and small communities.
We're agile, fiscally disciplined,
and experienced, and creatively deploying partnerships.
We had over 200 partnerships and 300 volunteers
in the last year, allowing us to move resources
efficiently into communities so they can host their own
America 250 celebrations, grounded in local history and local voices.
So some of the things that the appropriations would fund should we receive them specifically
for America 250.
First, community-based America 250 grants.
We are deeply grateful for the state's long-term investment in Georgia Humanities grant programs,
which have proven to be one of the most effective ways to strengthen local capacity.
For a time, every dollar, every state dollar invested through a grants program has been
matched three to four times depending on the year locally, multiplying the impact of
public funds while empowering communities to take ownership of their own programming.
Second, the Georgia Circuit, and I'm very excited that this is a legacy program for America
250.
I remember 1976, and I was very excited to take part of that in many of the tiny little
historical societies that exist across Georgia and across the nation were founded in 1976
and Georgia Humanities wants a legacy program similar to that that will go beyond America
250. So the Georgia Circuit is a new statewide America 250 program that brings Georgia-centric
public programs on the American Revolution and on our state's history, culture, and civic
spirit over the last 250 years directly into communities across Georgia, connecting residents
with industry program, which brings professionally curated, traveling museum exhibits to small
and rural communities, which might not otherwise have access to this level of cultural programming.
Our upcoming exhibition, Voices and Votes Democracy in America, offers a historical exploration
of America's great experiment with democracy, beginning with a revolutionary era, and tracing
how democratic ideas and institutions have developed and endured since 1776.
While we're proud to bring high quality, nationally developed exhibits to rural Georgia,
we're even prouder of the capacity building that surrounds them.
We support local scholars, encourage constructive civic dialogue, and help communities tell their
own democratic stories, so they are stronger long after the exhibit departs.
This is not simply cultural programming, it is community development and civic infrastructure.
We also integrate America 250 into our year-long educational work through National History
Day Georgia, and we're a model across the country for this program that is across all
of the states. It reaches in our state about 15,000 Georgia students annually and something
like 1,000 to 1,500 teachers annually so we teach the teachers. This year's theme, revolution,
reaction, reform and history invites students to engage America 250 not as a single moment
but as an ongoing civic experiment that continues to shape their lives today. So America 250
is a once in a generation opportunity.
And although we anticipate we're going to get our federal funding restored at some level,
we don't know how much and we're pretty sure it won't be on time to support these events.
With the governor's recommended investment, Georgia can ensure a statewide, locally grounded,
and fiscally responsible approach to commemoration, one that reaches every corner of Georgia
and leaves a lasting legacy of civic learning and community engagement.
Georgia Humanity stands ready to deliver this work with the same care, accountability, and statewide reach that has defined our service for more than five decades.
Thank you so much for your time. I respectfully request your support of the governor's recommendation, and I would be happy to answer any questions.
Thank you, Mary, for being here today. And again, your guest that was with you, Miss Dale Burns, was in attendance to support Miss Mary in the comments that she was making. Any questions from members of the committee?
Seeing none, thank you very much for being here today, appreciate it.
Mr. Steven Schimp, Georgia Ag Expo Authority.
And ladies and gentlemen, if any of you are staying on the back wall,
would like to come and have a seat, please do so.
Thank you for being here today.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
members of the committee. We're happy to be here. I have with me Lori Dowd or CFO. We'll
go through a short presentation if you have any questions afterwards. We'd love to
hang around and answer them. Great to report you today. The Georgia National Fairgrounds
and Agro Center is operating at full speed. We weren't affected by the storms. Thank goodness,
where we're at full throttle.
Our calendar is very busy in book.
And I want to start off just sharing a little bit
of the points of our mission, what we do.
Basically, we would build this board agriculture
to get young people involved in agriculture,
to boost the state's economy, and to host the state fair.
And as we go through this presentation,
I think we're checking all those marks.
Good news.
The Georgia National Fair, 2000 and the 36th was 612,000 visitors
came to see us of most importance.
47,756 corn dogs were sold during the Georgia National Fair.
There were, we had a lot of people there.
It was a great event.
inside the gates during the Georgia National Fair,
1.5 million in sales tax was generated.
Again, that doesn't include fuel means to get there
and he's spending that went on outside of our gates.
So, very, very successful fair.
Active projects that we currently have,
our facility is 36 years old,
so we've been heavily involved
with lighting upgrades, entry doors, HVAC, anything that you can expect from a facility
that's 36 years old and is heavily used.
Several new projects coming on and we're just about through with the GAE-21 MRR money.
We've held on to that money for a long time, trouble getting vendors, and also price increases.
So we've been dealing with that as we move forward, sometimes putting some of our operations
money into that to get those deals done, but our staff is doing a very good job in getting
the whole facility upgraded.
Brand new coming in February of 2027 is that we'll be the new small species barn and arena.
We had probably 2,000 pigs this past two weekends ago at the Georgia National Fairgrounds.
They were piled on top of each other.
This new barn in arena will give a chance to spread out and hopefully have a much more
enjoyable experience at a livestock show for the exhibitors and visitors as well.
So we're looking forward to that.
FY 2026, we received $1.15 million, Reeves Arena, Heritage Hall for upgrades to boilers
and HVAC.
We've got those under contract and they're underway.
FY 26, I want to thank you all for the $900,000 appropriation that's given to us.
Of course, you know, it offsets that $2.6 million cost to host all the youth events, youth
agriculture events, and equine events in the state of Georgia.
This year's ask currently what was put into the governor's budget is another $2.5, approximately
$2.5 million for HVAC replacements, again, 36 year old units that were taken out until
what we're doing. The 2.5 made it into the governor's budget. We're very grateful working
with OPB. There were additional, we were asked to put this in priority. We do have some
paving and ceiling issues that we'd like to deal with as well as equipment and some
upgrades to some other buildings. But this list puts everything in priority. Our impact,
our economic impact throughout the years,
about $133 million.
That's goods and services that are sold
in the state of Georgia because of our operation.
We're very proud of that.
We didn't just come up with that number.
That's the Call of Institution.
They came in and did that study for us.
All right, the fun thing,
and I wish the humanities lady was still here.
America 250.
We're gonna celebrate it in a big way.
We've got two specific events that we've pulled out.
First of all, the Georgia National Fair.
I already think that we are the most patriotic
fair in the country.
We're gonna go above and beyond.
We do have the Smithsonian's Museum
on Main Street Voices and Votes.
It will be there all 11 days of the Georgia National Fair.
We're looking forward to that.
We're partnering with the Department of Agriculture
This year's theme will be Georgia Grown, America 250.
Everything we coordinated with Robin's Air Force Base for a C-130 flyover last year to kick off America 250.
The government shut down right before that happened, so we were out of luck, but we're looking forward to a big year.
It's kind of a new show that we're doing to celebrate America 250.
Currently we have the, what we call the Georgia National,
Georgia National Antique Ag Show,
which demonstrates the last,
well probably the first 50 to 100 years of agriculture.
For America 250, we're building this show
as mules to microchips,
the partnering with the Department of Agriculture,
the UGA, University of Georgia,
and the Grand Farm that is currently across the street
from the fairgrounds,
And the mission is to demonstrate
a mule plowing next to an autonomous tractor
that can plow twice as much.
So we're doing everything we can
to keep this event free to the public.
We'd like, we see it as an educational opportunity
to demonstrate just how far agriculture
in the American farmer have come in the last 250 years.
With that, Mr. Chairman,
It includes my presentation available for any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Any questions from members of the committee?
Dean Green.
Thank you.
Thank you for the ideas surrounding the 250th anniversary.
But keep in mind, Georgia was one of the 13 signers there.
And Georgia needs to be emphasized.
Every time you do that, 250th.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
I appreciate you being here today and all the work that the Expo Authority does in promoting
agriculture and youth leadership with our students coming in.
Thanks for what you do.
Mr. Mitch, out of the way, do you order solar and water conservation commission?
welcome sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee I
appreciate the the invite and opportunity to give some updates on Georgia
solar water and quickly go over what's in our small budget for this year.
Start on the updates in our conservation department these are our five
regional offices across the state that work closely with the 40 local
solar and water conservation districts across the state.
This fiscal year, we started doing something new with them
due to staffing and workload.
Usually, the overviews where we work
with the local municipalities about their erosion
and septic control department has been done
with that EMS department.
We've spread that out to them, and I'm happy to report.
They hit the ground running and have conducted
20 of those so far this fiscal year,
along with conducting 50, almost 60 outreach events
that are mainly focused on ag agriculture,
conservation efforts, and work with the youth.
So they, we get Neil Madeleine early age,
and they start to understand the importance
of conservation and the state's natural resources.
We've kicked off local issue and authority.
These are your local municipalities,
focused training events.
we hold one big erosion day in Athens every year
where we have over 300 people,
but we also thought that we might be better served
as far as educational purposes.
If we get these personnel that are at the local level
that are in charge to carry out state rules and regulations,
if we can get them in a room of 10, 15, maybe 20 people
at the max, they're more up to ask questions
and understand what we're trying to push cross
as a state agency, make sure they're understanding that.
Started the first one of those a couple of weeks ago
and have about half a dozen more on the books
throughout the summer, look forward to those.
These staff members are also managing
a little over $2.5 million to assist private landowners
with conservation efforts on their property.
One of the unique ones that we have going on,
and I think I might have touched on this last time
I had the opportunity to get in front of the committee
is a Farrahog effort where we are using different types
of fencing, defense out ag, ag fills to see if that we can add
that to another tool, to the tool box for these ag producers
with their Farrahog issues.
So far, we have worked with 22 ag producers in Southwest Georgia
have installed almost 250,000 feet of fence.
So look forward to see the results we have
as planning season is coming up quickly in those areas
and we'll hopefully see some positive results on that.
Watershed dams.
Last year, Mr. Chairman, the committee saw the need
to, for the first time ever,
have us some maintenance funds for these dams as a line item.
That was $150,000.
At that time, I was reporting.
I thought we could hit maybe 60 to 65 dams with that money.
Happy to report that we found a way to work
with our federal partners at USDA to expand that.
We've increased that through their funding by $200,000
and increased the amount of dams that we were able to
affect by about 20.
So appreciate your effort on that committee
and look forward to continuing that.
One last thing I'd like to mention in that area is
we have four dams that are in the planning and design phase.
That's the last steps before we get to construction.
One of those is in Cherokee County,
the other three are in Forsyth County.
We're not ready yet to have a dollar amount
for a bond request on those projects,
but this time next year we feel that we will be.
just want to bring that up to the committee's attention.
And lastly, our Erosion and Central Control Department.
As you know, we run the certification program
where individuals in that industry
have to have certain certifications,
dependent on the work that they're doing.
We're at a little over 12, almost 13,000 certifications
issued this year, which is about our average.
And for the plan reviews last fiscal year,
we reviewed over 4,200 plans this year so far,
we reviewed 2,000, which puts us,
I think we're targeted about 4,000
by the end of the fiscal year.
Last time I had the opportunity to be in front of the committee,
I believe the question was asked about the amount of plans
that are an acre or less.
So I ran some of those numbers and 10% of those
are less than one acre.
So we don't have a lot of plans that are less than one acre,
But what I found was interesting when I increased that search
to up to 10 acres, 75% of our plans are 10 acres or less.
And moving forward, the next time I'm
from this committee, I'll have it broken down
by three to five acres as well.
So we can kind of see that.
This is more of a big budget FY27 topic,
but I wanted to go ahead and just throw it out there
as it's a big need for the agency.
You just heard me talk about the plan reviews.
I haven't asked for currently a little over $100,000.
This would provide an additional reviewer
and raises for current positions.
The reason for the addition is we're understaffed
for the volume of plans.
The raises would hopefully help address
the over 140% turnover rate we've seen
in that department in the last three years.
And those employees are leaving us
with about an 18-month average tenure.
It takes six to nine months to have somebody
fully trained to review these plans.
So basically, we're getting nine months
out of an employee before they're moving on.
To touch on our small budget edition,
we can be found on page 16 of your tracking document,
13.8.1.
And in there, you'll find the $2,000 supplement
our staff that we are very appreciated up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
That's all I have to be happy to take any questions.
Thank you for those comments.
And again, just wanna reiterate what you had already mentioned
in terms of your turnover rate,
obviously 142% and the significant work
that you guys do with reviewing these plans
and the need to try to work on that.
So as we move forward with the 27 budget,
look forward to working with you to try to address
that need in some way.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You know, there's a lot of the good work
that many agencies in here do.
George has been a desirable place to come move to,
to live work in place.
We just want to make sure we can do our part
to keep it that way.
We thank you for that.
Any questions from members of the committee?
Seeing none, thank you for being here today.
All right.
The Public Service Commission, Mr. Reese McAllister.
Come on down.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Good to see you again.
I can't believe it's been two months since we did this,
but time flies by.
So I want to thank you for allowing us input in the budget process today on behalf of the entire public service commission staff.
We want to thank you for what you put in our budget for FY26 to help with retention for many of our employees.
And we'd like to thank you and the governor as well for the one time salary supplements that have been proposed as well.
So as you know, the PSC has a complex mission of energy regulation.
Finding and retaining skilled staff is an ongoing challenge and your work with our budget
goes a long way in helping us fulfill our role for the citizens of Georgia.
As we shared back in November, Georgia, like many states, has seen an unprecedented
load growth on the power grid.
As recently as 2022 in our previous RRP, Georgia powers predicting load growth of 400
new megawatts, only 400 megawatts over seven years, but the most recent predictions show
low growth in a range of 10,000 megawatts. To put that in perspective, Georgia Power currently
deploys about 22,000 megawatts statewide today, and Georgia Power is effectively seeing
a 45 percent growth increase from that number. So this new low growth, it brings challenges
and opportunities. In December, to meet that need, the PSC approved a generational investment
in our energy infrastructure. We approved this in a way that will protect existing rate
payers from the needs of new large load customers, specifically data centers, the word that
is very popular today here on the hill and in the media. So in our hearing room has become
ground zero, it seems like for the data center issue. But I like to state clearly, the
PSE does not approve or certify data centers. It has no say in the approval of site selection
for data centers, nor does it monitor data center construction. The PSE's mission is to
to ensure that Georgia Power can meet the needs of its customer base and prevent calls
shifting from one customer to another.
This mission is critical to the economic development of the state and our decision in December
falls directly in line with this mission.
I have with me today our utility director thank goodness Mr. Bond, Tom Bond's here so
if you have any questions regarding low growth or our efforts to prevent calls shifting
Mr. Bond will handle those questions thankfully not me.
As far as the amended FY 26 budget, the PSE requests help for the construction monitoring
process for this new Georgia power and low growth infrastructure.
The annual state appropriation for the PSE is relatively small compared to other state
agencies, but the decisions of the commission impact the entire state.
And the governor's proposed AFY 2026 budget, the PSE would receive about 13.3 million in
state funds.
Because we're a small agency, even small changes in the energy sector can place large burdens
on our staff.
And as we said previously, it's a 45% increase in just the energy load, alone in this massive
increase in energy load, caused by data centers is going out of significant workload for
the PSC.
Specifically the PSC must monitor new construction as Georgia powers infrastructure expands.
Right now we have three new units that are under construction at Plant Yates in Newton.
We also have expansion at three other plants that will begin this year as well with five
additional units to help generate the needed energy low growth.
The PSC is charged with ensuring that Georgia Power spends money prudently when constructing
this new infrastructure, ensuring prudent spending on construction directly corresponds
to lower rates charged by Georgia Power for their rate payers.
The PSC is already short-handed on staff for construction monitoring.
We have one person.
but that's pretty short staff.
And on construction monitoring and qualified construction
monitors can take time to train.
To meet the workload, we plan to promote from within
our own staff and begin cross-training immediately
because of the need.
We then plan to backfill the existing positions
that we've opened up for this purpose.
To adequately monitor Georgia powers upcoming
construction projects, the PSC needs one engineer
At a salary of 85,000, 144,500 after it's been
true to up for fringe benefits.
And a new financial analyst at a salary of 75,000
or 127,500 after true up for fringe benefits.
For a total of 272,000 to fully fund both positions.
As we met with OPB last October, and as we met with you
in November, we mentioned that we might have a request
coming.
We didn't know at that time we were in hearings,
and those hearings have been concluded.
So this is why this need exists.
As construction moves forward on other projects,
the PSC is likely to ask for more construction monetaries,
but those are monetaries,
but those additional ask and wait,
at least until another budget cycle.
And our conclusion is always the Public Service Commission
and PSC staff work hard to remain good stewards
of the people's money.
We welcome any questions or comments
on funds that have been appropriated
on our request for future funding
on PSC construction monitoring
and also on infrastructure expansion.
So any questions?
Thank you for that presentation of a couple of things.
Can you update us on the pipeline inspectors that we've put in the budget over the last
couple of years and how that's working?
Yes, sir.
We've been able to fill all those positions as we've stated prior, it's hard to find
qualified people.
Many times when we get them trained, the industry comes and takes advantage of our training
that we've invested in harsam away.
So right now of all the positions you've approved their field and we're examining right now the possibility of needing more but our most recent audit from the feds got us a much better score.
So we're very satisfied there and still working to improve that program.
Great work there. Are you in a position to talk about whether or not the current salary for those positions is enough to retain those positions rather than getting them hired trained and losing them to somebody else?
I think Mr. Bond would agree we've set up we've put in place a structure based on training because every time they they get a level of training
We increased their salary which has helped with retention for those individuals. We were always open to increasing that but for right now
I think Mr. Bond is the utility director would be satisfied with that with that salary structure. Okay. Thank you, sir
and then on the requests for the
amended 26 budget the additional
engineer and financial analyst. What do you have an estimate of the equipment
cost for those two positions or anything they may need?
They wouldn't need equipment other than computers. We already have a car that
they can use to go to the sites that would require going to the construction sites
that's fairly regularly and it's three different plants so we have a fourth when it's already under construction so it does require a bit of driving but we're not asking for a vehicle because we already have one that's available for them to use.
Okay, thank you. Any questions from members of the committee?
Alrighty. Thank you, sir. Appreciate y'all being here today.
Thank you very much.
You're our best to the chairman.
We're ready, Mr. John, Department of Economic Development.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for being here today.
Thank you.
So, name is John Moffitt with the Department of Economic Development and we are the sales
and marketing team for the state of Georgia and all our previous speakers have talked
about all the successes Georgia's had and we couldn't do without all their help and
all the partnerships that we have with our other agencies.
We have World Congress Center here.
We have community affairs and we work very closely with all of them.
Just a couple highlights of last year just to give you some of the successes that we had
last year, tourism, $82 billion in total economic impact, which is a tremendous amount, 174
million people in total visitation, trade, 53 billion in exports. So that's, we broke
the 53 billion, 50 billion mark for four years in a row. That's a record. Global commerce,
26 billion in investment. You notice these numbers are all in billions, which is incredible,
over 23,000 jobs in the private sector.
Centres of innovation, 441 companies serve.
Now those you don't know about the centers of innovation,
they work mostly with small businesses
who are looking to take their business to the next level.
So they are connecting point from a small business
to the research universities around the state
like Georgia Tech and others like that.
And so we help those small businesses
be able to make those connections
with those research facilities,
to be able to make that transition to the next step for them
in their business operation,
with this manufacturing on a line or something like that
or something with plastics and things of that nature.
The film department,
245 productions last year,
including 13 feature films and 42 independent films.
I know Mr. Wilson, the commissioner, good friend of mine,
talked about Stranger Things and it was incredible
because they spent 804 days filming in Georgia last year,
hired over 3,700 Georgians and $298 million in crew payments.
So all that money is going to Georgians.
The arts, which is another great example
of how we help small businesses, $5 million in grants
last year to the arts.
And they go out there and they hit all areas of the state.
They're not just in the metro area.
the arts is out there helping out small businesses throughout the state.
When we look at our 26 amended budget, one of the items in there in the Department of
Administration is $3 million.
That money is going to be used for, as you can see, tourism promoting tourism, update
agency marketing, and enhanced recruiting efforts.
As far as the tourism piece goes, we're working hand-in-hand with World Congress Center this
year.
We have a little event called the FIFA World Cup, and we're trying to capitalize on that.
Not only as the visitors are here, but also when they leave to remember Georgia.
So on that, we're using a lot of those funds for that.
We're also using some of those funds for web enhancements.
The web enhancements we need to transition over are going to help with search engine optimization,
advancements in analytics and things like that.
So we can keep track of things, we can do research
and see what people are really looking for
and what the advancements need to be.
We're also looking for, as we stated in that,
agency marketing materials,
we're gonna be doing a ad in the Atlanta magazine,
they ask us we do an ad for the world's cup,
we're gonna do that.
And the nice thing about that is that's a momentum piece.
So people are gonna hold on to those things.
And so when I look at that,
they're gonna see Georgia all the time.
They're gonna see R.A.D. and that.
hope that leads to a return visitation.
We're also looking for paid media, group travel, things
like that.
We go out to trade shows.
That's how we promote Georgia.
We're not only promoting Georgia domestically,
but we're in and nationally.
And I know the numbers are, they say, we're in 12 countries
and this and that.
We're probably in a little bit more,
but what we have is we have 12 contracts,
but some of the contracts include a couple of countries.
An example of that would be Chile, Argentina, and Peru.
those one contract, Columbia and Mexico,
that's one contract.
So we're all around the globe promoting Georgia
and we've had these relationships with these people
for years and it just shows how well we're doing
because they want to stay on with us.
So that $3 million, the other question was
it is best use in admin and we feel
that it's the best use in administration in that bucket
because the marketing team is going to be using
a lot of that spend and they're pretty much
housed in the admin program, those positions,
and they're gonna be spending that money.
And so I know a question was,
would it be better suited in tourism?
Actually, the best location is admin,
that's why we requested that in administration.
Outside of that, we're very grateful for the $2,000
that people are getting.
People don't realize, some people may think
that's a small amount, it's not a small amount.
That helps tremendously with morale
and people are very excited about that.
We talk about, you know, the economy and things like that,
health, payroll may have not been keeping up with inflation and things like that, so little
things like that make a tremendous difference and a people are very excited about that.
There is one item in here that I'd like to mention.
I did mention it with Bailey on the $2,000 for the arts.
It's in the wrong program, so we would like to have that move from special projects.
group for special projects for transparency purposes was moved to a new program to just
show the grants that we have for arts.
So that includes a $976,000 we have for state money for grants plus the money we get from
NEA.
So if you look at that on my sheet here I think it's 23.4 special projects we would like
that 15,000 to move up to 23.3 because that's where the payroll is being paid for those
people in that division, Georgia Council for the Arts. After that, the final items here
are in tourism and our friends over at the humanities have spoke about $110,000 and we are
working with them, close hand in hand along with the Historical Society on the 250 celebration
this year. We're working on that. We want to make sure that what we're going to look
to do is we're going to have our website updates where all the communities they can reach
out to us and let us know what they're doing for that special day.
This way, anyone can look at our website and go, hey, what's going on in this location?
What's going on in that location and they can give us that information.
The other piece in here is the World Congress Center and Kevin and his team will be talking
about that $10 million.
If you see that, there you see it's for the Super Bowl.
So that's another item that if there's any discussion on that or questions they could probably without a doubt handled questions a lot better than I can.
That's pretty much for our amended budget for FY26.
Again, I want to thank you all for all the help you do for us because economic development is a team sport and it starts at the top.
And all our agencies, the governor, the House, the Senate, you all know the importance of it.
You help us as best you can in giving us the tools, the right business environment here in Georgia,
the weather doesn't hurt, even though it was a little crazy the last few days.
But it wasn't that bad where I came from in New Jersey, it was a lot worse, so we should be very thankful.
Well, that's sir, in the committee, that's our report. Glad to answer any questions.
Thank you, sir, for that presentation.
Back to 23, 1.2 on the 3 million.
Do you anticipate that being one third, tourism, one third,
agency marketing, one third, recruiting efforts?
How do you anticipate, they said it would be spent
in all three buckets, but how do you anticipate
that 3 million being divvied up?
We expect the trade one and a half to kill me
and going towards the tourism and marketing
with the world cup and things like that.
Then we expect about 500,000 comparable to that.
four, five to 700,000 for the website upgrades.
And that website upgrades keep in mind is all interchangeable.
That's going to help with 250.
It's going to help with the world cup and things like that.
Plus going forward from that.
Then remaining money we're hoping is going to work with
or outside marketing materials for other agencies,
for other divisions within our agency,
and upgrades on that.
All right, your questions?
Dengreen.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We appreciate that very much.
Going back to the tourism thing,
how much does the state of Georgia take in
for every $5 that we take into?
I'd have to look at that.
That's pretty hard to think of stabs.
I know years ago, the department said,
for every dollar spent, you get a $7.62 return.
I don't know if that's the case.
I don't know, we'd have to, I mean, great question,
but to get answers to that, it costs a lot of money
to do that research.
And so we can dig into that and see if we can come up
with a number, but I don't honestly have an answer
for that right now on every dollar that we spend,
what the return is on, marketing dollars is your question.
Yes.
We can look into that.
I'm sure we have some ballpark.
I just don't have it on hand right now, sir.
Further question?
The State of Georgia does the amount of money that we give for marketing is very low.
I would like to see if there's a way and I believe that $5 is goes to the Department of
through the transportation as we said it up years ago.
And I think it's beyond the $100,000 threshold.
I would like for us to look at some way of looking at that money to be divided up into
our tourism and marketing.
I mean, as the sales are marketing on for the state, we've gone through the recession
of 0809, we had cuts in 11 and 12 and 21 are marketing dollars from 08 to now is 55%
less. We were at 18 million, we're down to 8 million now. So that gives you an idea where
we're at.
Yes, it's time that we really took a strong look at that. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dean Green. Mr. Giljard.
I'm related about the upcoming American 250 of the anniversary.
Is that going to be grant privy to the different municipalities on those funds?
Well, we don't have any grant funds for that, so we're working with Humanities and Historical
Society.
Humanities got an additional 110,000 in our budget for amended 26.
That's a pass through from us to them.
I don't know about any granting what they're doing on that.
I mean, I don't know what kind of funding
if they've received anything like that.
Now, if arts community are doing certain special things,
or art grants could help with those types of issues.
In my second question, if you further yield,
always it's an attribute for tourism.
So that is number two in feature film.
Are there any plans you were talking about marketing
with all this going on in the film industry
to kind of do a reboot to retain other folks,
to come back to Georgia, is there any effort
with our marketing dollars on that?
Yeah, we're always trying to market.
I mean, the nice thing about when we had the Film Act,
a lot of these agencies and businesses that grew,
they grew organically.
They don't get the 30% discount.
And so most other states now have copied what Georgia.
I mean, Georgia made a bold move back in 2007 and 2008
when people getting rid of those programs.
Georgia said, we're going to institute this new film tax credit.
And it was tremendous.
I mean, we were talking, you know, at one point, you know,
maybe, you know, $250 million to like over $2.3 billion.
We are having some issues with the teamsters now.
And that's driving a lot of things with the film industry.
And, you know, when prices like that raise,
it's hard to come in here,
and they can go somewhere cheaper.
So we're trying to work through some of those issues
right now, I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Can't come to a committee meeting with us talking
about how we're going to involve the rest of the state
when it comes to the soccer games coming up.
I know that the commissioner mentioned the efforts
there in the full committee joint hearings.
But for the sake of the members who might not have been here,
can you update us on where we are with the thought process
of bringing community leaders from around our state
to Atlanta to interact with world leaders
who are here during those games?
Well, like I said, the website, we're going to work on that.
We're working with the Georgia World Congress Center.
And I think they can speak that there's
an activation center there.
So what we're trying to do is create
like an atmosphere at the World Congress Center
where people can come have set up about their communities,
what their communities have to offer,
talking about watch parties and things like that,
communities do to see these things,
and all these things are going to be on our website,
how to go about it, what they need to do,
and things like that, and any resources that they need,
or who to contact for that.
Will there be an effort to communicate to those
who are attending the business leaders,
that that is set up there for that specific purpose?
So, we'll be looking at the business leaders that are looking to come, and the business
leaders that we are currently invested in, and all business leaders for that matter.
I mean, this is an opportunity, I think Kevin will say.
I think we have this audience for like 37 days, and so we want to make sure that on those
off days that they have a whole Georgia to go look at, and so that's what we're hoping
to do with these monies in our website is to really branch out and talk about that with
the help from the World Congress Center and help many communities that they want but
also to really make that an event where everyone can participate in and enjoy it.
Well, thank you for those efforts.
We just want to make sure that we don't miss the opportunity for rural Georgia to have
an opportunity to come up and visit with those who will be here and possibly recruit businesses
to their districts.
And we want to make sure that it's returned as it's right, you know, we want them here, but we want to say hey come back
Thank you. Thank you for that
Any other questions the other questions. So thank you appreciate you be here today. Appreciate it
Mr. Shane Hicks from G. Dord environmental finance
Thank you for being here today
Mr. Hicks, thank you for being with us today.
Thank you for having us, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
I appreciate the opportunity to present on the amended budget.
And the name is Shane Hicks.
I'm the Director of Public Affairs and IT for the George Environmental Finance Authority.
authority, and I'm joined by Jamie Hardin. He is our director of financial services.
Want to mention, we have had a change in leadership over the past few months in November. Governor
Kemp nominated an appointed up trade minute to be our executive director. Unfortunately,
Tray had a funeral to attend for a close relative and could not be in person today. So, wanted
to pass that along. The George Environmental Finance Authority since 1986, this is our
Fortieth year has financed more than six billion in infrastructure projects for water and wastewater stormwater
All over the state of Georgia and we also manage several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs
With federal funding we also monitor the state fuels tanks to make sure they are staying up to date all of their compliance issues
And as mentioned earlier we are the lead for ESF 12 emergency support function 12 with GMA and Homeland Security
on energy and fuel. So our staff were busy this weekend monitoring our power
outages and fuel supply to make sure there are any urgent resource requests we
will get those power and fuel services restored. The amended budget is
pretty straightforward for Gefa would refer you to line 16.8. We have a
a $35 million appropriation recommended by the governor to support natural gas infrastructure.
Last year, the legislature passed Senate Bill 13, and the governor signed it into law,
giving us the authority to finance natural gas infrastructure throughout the state.
We have a lot of local gas systems that I think as many of us realize are running into capacity issues with their natural gas infrastructure.
And this is vital to support economic development
in the role parts of our state.
And so we're really excited about this program.
It is a natural fit to support what we've been doing
for the last 40 years on water and wastewater.
And so we really appreciate it
of the governor's recommendation
and the legislature's support.
Hopefully as we go through the session
for this 35 million in finance.
With that, I'm happy to take any questions.
Thank you for being here today and for the update.
On the 35 million, do you have adequate staff in place
to handle this new program or will additional staffing be needed
in order to get this up and running?
We are discussing the possibility of one additional staffer
in our Energy Resources Division to help manage this program.
And with that, I presume that you're currently working on
the guidelines that you will use to set forth
competitive process for the 35 million the governor has added in the budget.
Yes, that is correct. We're working on the framework. He'll have something by this summer
on how the program will work to provide the low interest financing.
And then from there we'll move forward to taking applications and hopefully awarding some
projects. Well, thank you. Thank you for that update. Any questions?
That's it. Thanks for being here. We appreciate it. And thanks to the employees who worked
during the storm to make sure that the ordinance needs were addressed.
Thank you. I'll pass that on. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Department of Community Affairs, Commissioner Nunn.
Good afternoon. Appreciate the opportunity to be with you. Mr. Chairman, members of
committee. I'll be brief as we know you're running long and leading and I'll
just kind of dive in on the tracking sheet. Christopher Nunn, Department of
Community Affairs, great to be with you all. Certainly appreciate support. I won't
go into the into depth just thanking you for the the $2,000 but I echo what
you've heard from from everyone else. That really does go a long way and it
tells our employees that they are important and that they are valued and the
The great work that they do is really second to none.
On 166.2 in your tracking sheet, I will highlight a $50 million ad for a one-time funds for
the State Housing Trust Fund to address homelessness through matching funds for local governments
and nonprofit organizations.
I don't think that you have to look very far, no matter where you are in the state, to
appreciate that there's been a that there is an increase in homelessness. I
mentioned at the at the joint budget hearing this is a very complicated
issue. In fact I shared I've shared with you all over in the past years that
there was a GAO study a couple of years ago 2020 actually it was 2020 data
that highlighted that for every hundred dollar increase in rent an average
rent and a community, there is a corresponding 9% increase in homelessness.
We know that this is a challenge, that housing is a challenge for many of our 11.2 million
Georgia's. We also know that while $50 million is a lot of money, when you look across
the state, that's not an enormous amount of money to address the housing needs across
the state and so the intent with these funds is to target unsheltered homelessness.
Those folks who are on the street and there were a couple of questions that I did make
note of in the joint hearing because it is true that trying to address people and their
needs before they become homeless is an important challenge.
We also, we know that because we have ministered along with a handful of local governments $1.3 billion
in one-time federal funds over an 18-month period two years ago for that purpose.
These $50 million will be used to provide flexible grants to local governments and nonprofits
who come with solutions that are locally driven.
So we believe that the solution to address unsheltered homelessness in Atlanta looks different
perhaps than the solution to address unsheltered homelessness in Savannah certainly looks different
than the solution to address unsheltered homelessness in Tifton or Statesboro.
We expect that these funds will simply enable the state to work alongside local communities
that are working with their local partners
to address their local needs.
So, address on sheltered homeless.
The second piece that we anticipate is
that these funds will be leveraged.
So $50 million would be leveraged by local skin in the game.
That can come from local community commitment.
It can come through philanthropic commitment.
And to clarify a question that came up,
and I think it came up from a senator in the joint hearing,
I am not the fundraiser.
We're not looking to go out and fundraise to expand this.
We simply in a competitive grant application process
will look for all of those grants to bring money to the table
and we would be looking to participate
alongside those local funds to develop sustainable solutions,
whether those are, whether that's providing capital,
whether that's providing for services,
wraparound services as a part of an overall strategy.
So we will absolutely look to leverage these
with matching grants from local communities.
And then the third piece and I'll tell you that
this was modeled in part off of what we have seen
and talked about with some of our,
with some of our sister states.
I know they were a handful of us that went out to Texas
and met with some folks out there.
And they've put some flexible grant funds,
made them available to communities.
We don't want to put a lot of requirements
because we want to allow the local governments
to drive the innovative solutions,
but we do need some data.
And so we also expect there to be a reporting element
that is required out of this.
That's really the, the plan, the cursory plan at this point,
but again, we're asking your support for that $50 million ad.
Mr. Hicks reported on 16, 8, 1, and Gefa.
I will tell you, Tray Bend is off to a great start
and he's doing a great job,
and we've talked a little bit about their plans
to roll out that new program,
and of course we will support them
any way we are able in that regard.
It's at 169.1.
This is actually a reduction,
although it is reflected in forestry and in the ag budget
as an addition, so we're simply moving
the recommending that these funds be moved.
Last year, you included $25 million in the budget
to address Hurricane disaster response.
And we appreciated the opportunity
to stand up a new program to address Hurricane disaster relief.
We actually did that in conjunction
with some federal disaster funding as well.
We rolled out a program that was eligible
or that was open to applicants from local communities
as well as nonprofits.
I know that we've talked about the fact that we needed to get blue tarps off of roofs.
And I got an update from our federal funded program.
We have had two date, as of yesterday, 5,681 pre-applications from every eligible county
for those disaster funds.
And of those pre-applications, 1,576 are in process with a full application.
that they've been qualified and we are assessing the home for home repair, roof repair of things
of that nature. With these funds that you appropriated, the 25 million, we have made 17
grants through two grant rounds, totaling $13.8 million thereabouts to communities really
all across that affected area from Valdosta to Augusta and much rural area in between.
These funds have been, I think, really critical to address non-Thema and non-insurance related
or covered needs in communities that really needed to address some catastrophic issues,
culvert repairs, building repairs that weren't insured and weren't going to be able to
wait for federal disaster funds down the road.
So we've made those grants.
The recommendation here is to move the remaining funds of that $25 million to address timber-related
disaster needs that is, I think, in keeping with the legislative intent of those funds.
And then at 169.2, we have a recommendation of $15 million to continue the rural site
development program.
I think I reported the other day to date we have made 11 infrastructure grants across
the state.
If you think about the history of one Georgia over 25 years, we've invested about $800
million in communities all across the state.
throughout both of your districts and really I think it's about 140 counties that have
been touched by one Georgia. Many of those smaller industrial parks that locals have marketed
for years have been consumed over the last five years as we've had unexpected or unprecedented
economic success. And so this is really a program of how do we rebuild some of that capacity
And we've made 11 grants.
We've also extended 11 like planning scholarship grants
for 50 to $150,000 to help communities
with some of the engineering and the design
and the environmental studies that are necessary
to pursue the Department of Economic Development's grad
certification.
As those communities achieve grad certification,
We anticipate a continued pipeline and demand for the infrastructure grants.
And so that's the recommendation here is to continue that program with the $15 million.
That's really the only, that's all we've got in the amended budget,
but I'm happy to entertain questions if there are any.
But thank you, Commissioner, for being here and that update.
And I do know that the role site development funds I've been
important to many communities across our state. Any questions from members of the committee?
All right, thanks so much for being here. Thanks so much.
Director Sabo, come on up.
Georgia Forester, commission.
I'm pretty sure he's probably in the lot of Philly, isn't he?
No, I don't know, I don't know how to do a lot of it.
I don't know either.
All right good afternoon yeah for the start thank you for being here
I appreciate that and I feel like I got to say for the record I won't say which past speaker
But somebody made the comment they filmed stranger things for eight hundred and four days last year and that pretty much sums up the
Force industry and forestry community. That's that that was a very good representation
Always let remind everybody of our mission vision and core values and and that really reflects in and who we are and especially the
integrity, respect, equality, using fax to drive our decisions and being responsible for
our own success.
To me, that's something I think a little bit rare in government, especially those that
that very last one, and I really feel like our folks just embody that.
Quick highlight on some recovery efforts, and so this ties back to last year, we were
able to purchase 29 additional tractors with the 10.9 and total that we received, or sorry,
are the 12 million, the 1.1 that we had in our budget and the 10.9 in the amended budget.
Five tractors have been received, the other four, I mean, when I say they're weeks away,
they are literally weeks away.
The fuel mitigation program, that was the cost share program for landowners to help clean
up, you know, almost, almost 2,500 applications.
So we did a second sign up because we reached out to every single applicant that we had
to find out where they were if there was help that they needed and one thing we were
able to do through that program or through those calls were link loggers who might have
been misplaced from the loss of industry to help them with landowners who had funds to
clean up. So that helped bridge the gap but we did have roughly $16 million in land
interchange they were going to use a federal EFRP fund so that's why we did the second
sign up way more than enough applicants now to utilize the fund so I maintain that
a lot of the and a lot of those landers did indicate that they are waiting on the block
grant funding to have money in hand to help a clean up to begin that program.
Also we had three million of those funds separated out to help with the fire lines, force
roads, over 3700 miles of roads and that's just a fire lines and roads and that's just
in the impact area.
That's not statewide that we utilize those funds for over 11,000 equipment hours and we'll
keep doing free fire lines and breaks until we run out of funds and just really
been an outstanding program and really important to our employees and their
safety and we'll get to that later on. Some key performance indicators that I
did not go over in a joint session that I wanted to highlight. The first one so
far this this fiscal year over 2100 wildfires for 11,000 acres. When you
drill down to it that's a 5.1 acre average for wildfire so even with the
increased fuel loading the increased fires we're still maintaining our five to
six acre fire average and really just want to thank our personnel there and
once again that ties back into you know that this committee and the help that
you've given us with the right equipment you know the funding to put those
lines in and you know be proactive and not just wait. Forest management our
our southern pine beetle spots are greatly down.
That was a big concern with the hurricane.
What type of pine beetle activity will we have?
So those numbers are down 75% from where they were last year.
So really just good news from a forest health perspective there.
The other thing that we did, no one of the highlight was we
added four additional foresters to the field.
So some of our leadership came together through retirements
and they took four positions which it does decrease
promotional opportunity for people, leadership willingly took on more and we were able to put four additional foresters into the impact area to help with the caseloads and workloads and that that so far has just been an outstanding support or outstanding effort.
5.6% turnover last year that includes retirements without retirements we're looking at 3.6% turnover for the agency so could not be proud of our our agency our leadership and to me I think that just speaks to the culture of where we are and the work has been done.
you know, by the members to help give us the funding and have the salaries where they should be.
We also dedicated our building to John Mixon this past year.
That was past last year in the resolution, so Mr. Mixon was a former state forester
and just really a pioneer in many ways in our industry.
So that was an outstanding opportunity that we had.
Diving off into our AFY budget, AFY 26 budget.
As everybody said, the employee supplemental to $2,000 that goes a long ways.
I don't think I have to speak to anybody, you know, just the cost of living,
and what that is, and how impactful that can be.
So this just helps morale, helps folks that may have been putting things on credit cards
for too long, and just kind of get their feet back underneath them.
So just a huge win and something we fully support within the agency.
107,000 and operational funds for the new helicopter.
That is our picture of our new helicopter, so we will get that later on this.
We will bring it to Georgia later this week, it is in Virginia right now, doing a few
little minor touches on it, so we don't want to take ownership until it is 100% how we
want it, but obviously it flies, so that's a good start.
but that 107,000 will be, that's the last quarter funds
of what we'll see for our FY27 budget.
And that was in conversation with OPP,
just funds we knew we would need since it was an addition
to fleet when we talk about fuel maintenance,
everything else.
I'm gonna skip the 10.9 to Georgia Forestry Innovation
initiative, because I will touch that on the next slide.
148,000 in pasture grant funding for Talbot County.
That's just our traditional pasture funding.
and there's a 60,000, it's internal, but staying with us,
but going from management to our forest protection.
So just wanted to mention that since it's on your sheet.
The last one that's on here,
it's not part of the timber task force
is a 12 million for tractor replacement.
Last year was 10.9, but in total it was 1.1
because we had 1.1 worth of equipment funds.
This year the ask is at 1.1 and FY27
will be shifted to operational funds
to help with the increase in fire.
So to get our 12 million total that we were able to obtain last year, it's in this year's
amended budget.
And happy to have more discussion later on if you would like.
Gover forestry task force, I'll start with the mass timber building.
So that is actually a picture of a mass timber facility just outside of Chattanooga.
That's the only one we've been able to find that may kind of resemble the inside of a
a county unit and that's what we're looking at something similar within Morgan County
and that's what the 2.6 is for.
It would be the state's first, as far as the state agency, first mass timber facility.
You know, there's some nuances to it that we want to figure out.
Projection costs, to be honest, do look like they're roughly 10% more than your average cost,
but we're trying to work with builders and architects who have utilized mass timber before.
what you'll find in an architect or builder has not used it they're kind of they shy away from it and they'll price it
Like they're building a traditional building, but there's a lot of cost gain from when you do when you do start receiving it on site and start building
Really good example is a story here for pot city market
When they were when they were building the mass-tumber facility adjacent to it
There were six workers putting the thing together in the building behind it had you know 50 plus but in the same size building
so
We know there's efficiency to find and that's our ass is let the Georgia Forestry Commission
kind of be the guinea pigs for the state find those efficiencies and how do we start utilizing
more mass timber. Commission or Harper touched on the Georgia grown wood that is that is in the
Department of Ag budget as where it should be great partnership between us, Department of Ag
and Forest Industry partners and once again this project specifically but really all the projects
George is behind in the loss of industry and that's a good thing for many reasons.
We recently lost industry, but our other state, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas,
they lost industry years ago. So we're at the back of the line, so to say.
And so how do we attract more industry? How do we get to the front of the line?
And that's a big piece of this.
You know, Georgia being the number one state to do business helps, our ports, our rail system,
that's factored in there, but how do we help tell our story and this Georgia Grown Wood
project is a huge part of it.
The increased funds for the Georgia Forestry Innovation Initiative with Georgia Tech,
that is, you may have heard the term like the rewood group out of Georgia Tech, they have
been doing the research for years now, so these are not funds to do research specifically.
These are funds to take those research and go scale up and partner with industry through
through their transfer technology program
and work with our companies within the state.
And how do you take those wood products to the residuals?
They use small diameter woods,
even the less desirable species.
And that's the market we lost, right?
That's the small diameter market,
some market we lost.
So how do they take those species
and turn them into things like pharmaceutical coatings,
carbon black for tires,
just a wide array of different things.
One thing that I read a full statement during the joint appropriations, I don't want to read it now,
but I do want to make sure I get these numbers right.
So the projection for the two-year economic impact could add up to 2 billion to Georgia's DDP,
and it full matured it could grow up to 80 billion.
I already started to have conversations with the technical college and how do we start ramping up programs,
and we start looking at chemical manufacturing and different things that we typically haven't had
tied to a forced industry so that we have the work force to see this out all the way
to the end.
So really excited about this.
There's no other states that are doing anything like this that I've seen I'm aware of.
And we're really just blessed to have somebody like a Georgia Tech in this state that have
those knowledge skills and abilities.
Lot fire outlook.
The governor mentioned during his presentation over 4,000 wildfires last year, over 26,000
acres.
6,000 acres sounds like a lot, but when we think about how the amount of
forced at acres we have in this state, that is less than a tenth of a
percent of our forced at acres that actually burned. So once again, just want to
think our team for the work that they've done, outstanding job. One thing that's
actually happening today, it was happening this afternoon, our Oki-Fenoki
swamp down in that southeast corner is historically low. And so there's a meeting
happening right now with really our team leads ICs, my deputies down there, and just
having a conversation and getting ready for it now.
We'd rather prepare and it starts raining and hopefully nothing is needed, but it's
looking like it could be a really active spring in the swamp.
So it's leadership from Florida, Georgia, the swamp, some federal teams, and really a message
being delivered from the Georgia Forestry Commission is the private forest industry and private
forced landowners have had enough over the last several years between
Helene, loss of mills and everything else and so we're going to have good
safe but aggressive firefighting tactics and we're not looking for massive
burnouts and things in the past that may have been past practices. We're gonna
we're gonna be really aggressive so well I'm eager to talk to my
dependency how that message goes over. I mentioned it's been busy so this was
last week. It's kind of like a tell of two weeks, right? These are some fires we've had
at night just very aggressive heavy fuel loading in the impact area for a while. Montgomery
County, Tattoo County, that area was really hot. We've had a limit authorizations and try
to get ahead, especially since we've had most of our crews in the north end of the state
working. The rainfall helped, but we did not have enough rainfall to where this threat
has gone. So this is something we really expect to pick back up in the upcoming weeks, especially
with the amount of wind that we've had.
And then Commissioner Harper mentioned the partnership
that we had for Winnerstorm Furn.
And I just, I love this picture because you have DNR, GFC,
and Department of Ag, some law enforcement officers,
all in one.
This is about five chainsaw crews with law enforcement
support while they're working.
And so this was pre-stormed or smiling.
So they hadn't been running the chainsaw
in single-digit weather yet.
But to me, this is how state government should function.
For us to work together, not duplicate efforts
and really do good for the citizens.
Latest update is we've cleared 25 counties by we.
I mean, all of these agencies.
25 counties assessed over 2,500 miles of road.
Clear 207 miles of road with full of debris.
We're currently in three counties,
and the hardest three hit counties.
Habersham, White, and Raven.
And out of lunch, we still would Raven dumped about,
or not sorry, not Raven,
Habershan gave us about 60 requests of county roads
that need to be cleared.
So probably another day, day and a half worth of clearing,
and then we will wrap that one up
and get everybody home and rest in.
With that, I'd like to say thank you
and also mention our tagline there at the bottom
the Fighting Fire, Protecting Force, serving Georgia.
And that's something as we started to gal
and talk to people and help tell our story, what do we do?
I will say somebody mentioned that we should change
our name, and that's absolutely not.
That's not happening, but our communications group came up
with about six or seven different taglines,
and we sent out to all of our employees,
and overwhelmingly, this was their favorite.
They thought this represented them and who they are
and what they do, and so just couldn't be more proud of them,
and I think that is a very accurate description
of the Georgia Forestry Commission.
So, happy to take any questions.
Well, thank you, Director, and thank you
for the great work that your team has done
across our state and working to assist Georgians
in time of need.
We know that this isn't the first time Georgia Forestry
has responded to an incident we know it won't be the last,
but do appreciate the great work that they do,
day in and day out protecting citizens of our state.
and look forward to the additional conversation
as we move forward with the transfer of funds
over to move research to the next level to assist
an industry that has, as you mentioned,
it's had enough.
Yes, sir.
That from mill closures to the impacts of jobs
in nearly 3,500 direct and indirect jobs
that have been impacted by the closure of mills,
the impact on landowners.
And not just those, but also the contractors that work
with those meals.
I mean, it's a ripple effect across all our communities,
across Georgia from Savannah, International Paper,
to Cedar Springs on the West Side of State.
So it's very important we continue to work with you
and your team and the industry to move the industry forward
during this difficult time.
As you've said many times over,
we need that next-herty moment.
Yes, sir.
And it's common, so we look forward to working with you
on that and just for our gratification of members of the committee we do have the governor's
task force report that was also on the desk of the members this morning that was task
force that was convened after the announcement of the closure of international paper and
other meals to give us a deeper dive so thank you for the great work that you've done.
We know it has not been an easy couple of months but thank you for the work that you continue
to do as we move the state forward.
Yes sir.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Duval, Georgia War Congress Center.
Well, good afternoon Chairman Meeks. Thank you and the committee for your time today. Thank you Bailey for getting us all set up here
We'll be working from the tracking sheet page 10 on the tracking sheet for the World Congress Center 50 dot 1 dot 41 and also understand
There may be something under economic development that we want to cover, but thanks so much again for allowing us to be here today
want to start off by
hopefully
Okay, you always have to carry it back up, so hold on there and stand by.
Bailey, is it okay if I, I mean, take this out.
Okay, let's try that again, Chairman, excuse me about that.
Recently just released our FY, last fall FY25 economic impact.
Clearly, the events we host on our campus,
it's well known that they generate economic impacts,
sport jobs, and help at least this fiscal year,
$1.9 billion in economic impact.
One of the things we've been working on
that I think is important to illustrate a little bit further
and maybe take a closer look at as a heat map
before we spend some of our dollars
in GWCCA managed facilities across the state of Georgia.
And so we've worked with collecting some of our partners
that we work with and where we spend our money
across the state of Georgia.
So what you see before you is just kind of a version one.
We're continuing to work on several versions of this
of where we have economic impact.
And important for me, and important for everybody
in the state of Georgia, and I was 101 out of 159 counties
we have impact and there's been money in.
Whether that's buying goods or personnel
or people living there in those counties.
And so that equates to about $290 million.
Certainly always pleased and want to say thank you.
It's to the governor and the legislature
for the support that we receive on all the capital requests
that we have in the past.
Reflective on the screen before you is obviously
the transportation terminal and pedestrian mall,
but also the end result of the signal by Hilton Atlanta.
We just finished our second year of operation,
believe it or not, I can believe.
Remember talking about it, going to be open,
we've finished our second year of operation
has done really well, but we had an investment
of the World Congress and over half a billion dollars
for that facility.
Other projects we completed that were putting in action today,
is inclusive of the BC exhibit hall.
And so, certainly excited about that.
IPP is in the house right now,
international production and processing expo
or poultry is some of us used to call it,
but they've relabeled and also have the meat industry with them.
But they're 600,000 square feet going strong right now,
open this morning and 30,000 folks are in town for that show.
Clearly the orange deck helps us take care of all the folks
we have there, so we're appreciative of that funding too.
funding and progress right now. Any time you have to replace over a million square feet
of roofing, it does take some time. I'm happy to report that we're about 70 percent of
the way there, and on our final building of roof replacement, Esquiter Modernization,
we're replacing 35 Esquaters within the facility, and that takes time too. And please
report we're 66 percent complete, and continue on that journey, and you can see the estimated
time we believe will be done there. I think I reported back to you some of the money
we received for HVAC that were replacing some of our rooftop units on top of the
congress center. Sometimes those require helicopter to put on top of the congress
center. So that's what you see in the photo there. You kind of wrap it up and
put it all together here and really look at it. The congress center were big
believers in reinvesting in the facilities too. We know we can't reinvest
everything we have but anything that we make extra we try to reinvest in and
that's what this slide shows you that since 2002 we've reinvested
174 million dollars within the Congress Center to try to help match some of the funding that we receive from the state
Well the big question I think is FIFA FIFA World Cup is coming and I took note of your your comments earlier
And so just as a reminder I think the sports council or Metro Chambers that represented in the room
So we are part of the host committee along with the ACVB the Metro Chamber of Sports Council
Mercedes-Benz stay in the city of Atlanta all of us are part of the host committee that put on these great events
obviously the state of Georgia is very involved with these events too and we're
super excited about having that this year. I think you know eight matches and
that's what's going to happen inside the bins but also we are going to host a
fan festival in Centennial Epic Park and so the fan festival I mean the atmosphere
around FIFA I think John said it was about 37 days but we are going to extend
that on our campus in several locations so first is Centennial Epic Park right
now we're designated for 21 days of being open around matches now some of them
will be our match days that we're open the day before or day after and then some of the
key matches that you'll see. So in Centennial Olympic Park you'll have music, food and
you'll also be able to watch matches that are going to happen in and around the tournament
as it's here. Additionally, I think what's kind of unique is 30 years to the almost
of date after we hosted the world gathering for the Olympic Games will host FIFA World Cup
in Centennial Olympic Park again. So it's pretty neat, big piece there, opened all Georgians,
So it's free event, so we're excited about that.
We're also excited for our visitors that will be becoming.
So if anybody wants to cross the state to come,
we'd be happy to host them during the FIFA fan fest
in Centennial Epic Park.
I think also what was mentioned is we've conceptualized
and we're beginning to activate against to lay out,
you know, the World Congress Center's big stage
at the end of the day and we have a lot of space available.
And so really working with the Department
economic development, Department of Agriculture, DNR, et cetera, we're trying to get a coalition
around that we can basically focus and show off Georgia inside the Congress Center during
FIFA World Cup.
And again, I think that's important for us to do not only on Match Day, but then the
other days that surround the experience here.
Because obviously we want to drive and show everybody that we're the number one state to
do business at the end of the day.
I mentioned to you the big hitter in the middle there, the IPP show, certainly excited
about them. Sports may be the headline on top, but we have a lot of a lot of
book, a lot of business on the books for now and into the future. And those are
some of the significant trade shows that we host and some of the other
sporting events that we host at the World Congress Center. We have exactly
one request that the the governor was we appreciate putting in the
amended fiscal year budget. And that is electrical system replacement. Now
electrical system is one of those things you know when you're not when it's
not working, but it may not be the thing you see out front, but if the lights aren't
working or you have trouble with the 600,000 square feet of exhibit space, exhibits we
have right now and electrical, then it's not working, but really for us, it's about
improved reliability, safety, efficiency, and infrastructure.
And at the end of the day, your support of our request for $12 million in the amended
fiscal year budget is really going to help support and improve, would authorize the
commencement of the project for us at the end of the day.
It encompassed developing a comprehensive design
and really pushed us off on the procurement of equipment
for a phase one approach.
You know, we were born in multiple phases,
five to be exact.
So we won't be able to tackle it all with $12 million
but this will certainly get us started
and give us a roadmap to get there.
Just some of that fun stuff that you don't see
behind the walls of equipment, it's aging out.
We'll also look at transformers, lighting controls,
bus duct that support our activities on the exhibit hall where we wire up all
those great shows that come to the George in the city of Atlanta and also look
at our emergency power. So last but not least thank you we appreciate it. I think
with the Metro Chamber in the room just a press that we've also I think under on
page six of Department of Economic Development's information there's funding
one time funding non-recurring funding set aside for super well. I think that's
It's pretty consistent with what you've done for other large events we have, FIFA World Cup most notable thus far.
Obviously that would be important funds that the host committee and the World Congress Center as a state entity would keep,
would shepherd through the process if that indeed is something that's going to continue to be funded.
It helps cover public safety, infrastructure, and the like, and I'll, you know, check with my colleague from the Chamber of Nick and see if there's anything else we want to talk about that.
that but that's definitely in the budget process so I'll stop right there and
help answer any questions and last but not least Mr. Chairman I forgot to
recognize the most important people and that's Lindsey Strickland our vice
president of government affairs Janet Finelinson our chief financial officer
and actually I have two of my colleagues from Savannah here Kelvin Moore is our
senior vice president and general manager and helps us manage the Savannah
Comanche Center and then Al Ruhas is our vice president and assistant general
I'm going to help Belle you ask that she did that, I won't have to do that for you.
On the 10 million, can you talk about a little bit more of what that, would that be more
security calls or would it be split?
Yeah, I think it's important to remember, we're already in the planning cycle.
So we're moving down the planning cycle right now, obviously it's super bold this year.
Our hyper focus is on FIFA and execution against that, but you know two years out is really
the planning cycle.
people out to see the Super Bowl. You look at the new nuances of it. You're
planning against public safety needs, infrastructure needs, etc. What we're
going to do, we're going to do something in St. Helibock Park, etc. And so I
think this gives kind of certainty to that approach as we move forward and the
good news is just a one-time request. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you for
being here today and thank you for all that you're doing to promote Georgia.
Thank you appreciate it. Thank you and Mr. Kevin Moore
Good afternoon Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here today, thank you for having me,
and then there was one.
My name is Kelvin Moore, I'm the Senior Vice President for the Georgia World Congress
and Authority and General Manager for the Savannah Community Center, and it's Kevin
to introduce my colleague with me, Mr. Albra Haas, our Vice President and Assistant
General Manager, let's see here, there we go.
So today I'm going to have the privilege of giving you a lot of good news that's happening
down in Savannah and review one of the items we have in the governor's amended budget.
So first, 2025 is the 25th anniversary of the Savannah Convention Center.
It's been a very consequential and impactful year for the Convention Center.
First, we were able to complete the expansion of the Savannah Convention Center at $276 million
project, which we are very thankful for the governor and the entire legislature for
your support on that.
That project allowed us to double the capacity of the Convention Center from 330,000 square
feet to 660,000 square feet.
What that does is allow us to raise and rank as far as square footage and it improves
self-competitive positioning with cities like Nashville and Tampa and Austin and Richmond.
It allows us to really step up and wait class and generate more economic impact for the
city and for the state.
We have been rocking the Rollins since the day we opened the doors there.
We started off with a 1970s showdown, Valley of All Tournament with 14,000 young girls
and their families, and we have not stopped since then.
The other big news coming out of Savannah is the development of a new headquarters hotel.
It is a signature by Hilton Property, 444 rooms by the 33-month construction time that
is planned for opening in summer of 2028.
What those two projects do for the Savannah Communications Center for the Destination, it
really completes the overall package.
Again, it improves our competitive positioning with all of our compset, and most importantly,
that allows us to generate more economic impact
and more impact for those in the region there.
So how's it going?
The chart on the screen now will show you
all of the event activity have on the books
through fiscal 31.
And what this shows is that we have 320 events
on the books through fiscal 31.
And 215 of those events are utilizing expansion space.
What does that mean?
That means for not the expanded convention center,
we might not have been able to get the majority
of those 2015 events.
So the expansion is paying off the state investment
and that expansion is paying off.
And as you can see, the outer years,
you have fewer events, the events book many years in advance.
So we expect the impact to be significant.
I'm gonna report on you right now for FY25,
but our FY26 is even better.
So we're very, we're feeling very, very good
about where we are from, from a book in case.
By the numbers for fiscal 25, we had 162 events,
400 event days, over 200,000 attendees,
the statistics that most proud about is a 96.1 customer
satisfaction rating because you can have the best
breaking mortars and all of that in a property,
but if your people aren't treated well
and if they're not treating our guests well,
they won't come back.
So we're very proud of that.
But impactful, the Cometan Center supports roughly 28,000 jobs
in the Savannah region that are related
to the event and hospitality.
And FY25, the economic impact from Cometan Center events
was $13 million for the county
and just under $121 million for the state of Georgia.
We are here to seek the committee's approval
For one item we have in the governor's admitted budget.
A couple of things I just want to make sure that I stress is the Savannah Community Center
is a state-owned facility.
It is on state-owned land.
It is governed by a state-enabled authority and managed by a state-enabled authority.
So this is a state project managed for benefit of the state.
Savannah Community Center Authority is self-sustaining, has never come to the state for any
operating support the $276 million for the expansion with a pretty big
nickel plus a thank you again for that. But we're pretty proud of how we've
managed to do things down in Savannah. The next slide we'll show you what we've
done as far as capital self-funding over the 25 years of the Convention
Center and into this current fiscal year is about $41 million in capital
projects that have been funded by the Savannah Georgia Convention Center
with its own funding mechanisms. You will see that the most recent years that
the number has increased.
Why?
Because the existing part of the building is 25 years old.
And as you've seen with our friends at the
Georgia Royal Congress Center Authority,
when those stairs and escalators and HVAC units
25 years old, those expenses begin to increase.
The project that we have before you today is in,
I believe it's in the tracking sheet on page 10,
50.1.32, and there's a $5 million request
and the governor's, I mean, the budget for river walk repairs.
This project broadly speaking, it enables
to serve, to connect the entire campus,
to make the center, including the hotel
that's under construction.
It improves the walkability and the connectivity,
completes the campus.
And again, it's all part of that,
improving our competitive positioning.
It is a two-phase project, the first phase,
which we are just about complete list is the reinforced
and the bulkhead structural integrity,
all of the work underground there.
And phase two, which we hope to initiate soon
is to complete the utility infrastructure underground
and then come above ground to begin the beautification
pavers in lighting and landscaping through that nature.
This slide that's up now kind of shows you the area
in red, where the work has been going on in the area that we helped to complete.
The next photo kind of shows you before when it began that work, which we are well under
way, and the next photo kind of gives you a sense of where we were just two days ago.
So the teams there have been working very, very hard to get that done, but Riverwall completion,
again, it's very important to be overall packaged to the Savannah Community Center and to
the competitiveness of the destination overall.
And again, we are seeking your support
for the $5 million projects in the government's
immediate budget for this project.
Happy to answer any questions.
Thank you for that update.
Just an economic question, I guess,
when you were talking about the number of events
that have been booked, 25 and 26, and then 27
that falls off pretty significantly.
Of course, there was a nice jump in 26
and falls off of in 27.
Do you anticipate more being booked for 27?
I don't know, not big in the business.
How far out in advance for some of these books?
Yeah, so the way that the sales process works in Savannah
and not dissimilar to the Atlanta, a smaller scale,
we partner with business of Atlanta,
our destination marketing organization.
They handle all of the event sales 18 months
out our sales team handles the event sale 18 months and it is not
untypical for you to see the out years where the numbers are smaller as you
get into those years and closer to those years they rise up. I would suggest to
you that coming in FY26 we had roughly 60% of where we ended up on the books. A
lot of that is our team going out in the year for the year hunting and killing
the events that we...
Okay well thank you for the great work you are doing and thank you for being
here today. Thank you very much. All right ladies and gentlemen with that no
question from members of the committee. We will stand adjourned. Thank you for
your attendance today.
