please stand for the pledge of the United States.

which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Now to the Georgia flag, I pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag, which it stands,
wisdom, justice, moderation, and courage.
Thank you, good morning, it is my honor today to introduce Pastor Anthony Booker, a gifted
preacher and pastor and teacher who has had his call in since childhood, as there are
stories about him preaching to his childhood neighbors and friends and baptizing them
in a friend's pool.
He finally took that childhood passion to the pulpit, given his first sermon in 1992
and becoming ordained in 1994.
His first church was New Hope Baptist Church in Harlem, Georgia, where he preached from
1997 to 2020, and 2020 became the pastor of Broadway Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia.
Pastor Booker has numerous accolades, including the State Coordinator for the State Baptist
Youth Convention Executive Board.
He's also a member, he's also a presiding president of the Augusta Baptist Ministers Conference.
His most recent success or greatest success is that he also is a family man, having married
a bond booker in 1998 and he also is the parent of two children.
It is my pleasure today to introduce a good friend and a great preacher, Pastor Anthony
Booker.
I just want to share with you, late one evening, a young intern stayed behind in his office building, long after everyone else had gone home, the lights were dim, the halls were quiet in the work on his desk filled invisible.
visible. He paused and looked around and whispered, does any of this even matter?
Just then an older gentleman passing, pushing a cart, passed by his son, every
light that stays on after hours and his buildings because somebody believes
tomorrow is worth preparing for, because you're working for someone and
something greater. The intern never forgot that moment.
what he thought was small, someone understood that it was just shaping the future.
He came in the next morning different, no new titles, no new pay, but a new sense of purpose.
He realized he wasn't just feeling space. He was serving something greater than himself.
And that's the question for each one of us this morning. Not simply what do we do,
but who are we really doing it for? The Pazapal, his writing and Colossians chapter three,
verse 23 and 24 says whatever you do work at with all your heart as working for
the Lord not for human masters since you know that you will receive inheritance
from the Lord as your reward is Lord Christ you are serving Paul speaks to
believers living on the pressure and limitations he reminds them that dignity
is not derived from titles but from purpose how a Thurman once said the work of
of the spirit is to make life whole.
These verses call us to come together
to bring our faith, our character, our conduct, our ability,
and our giftings together.
Paul suggests to us that every role becomes sacred
when Christ is at the center of which you and I serve.
This text is Taylor to teach us this morning,
three truths, number one,
the measure of our work is the heart behind the work.
Paul says, whatever you do, work at it with all of your heart.
Beloved God is not impressed with his ability.
He has moved by our sincere heritage.
In fact, the scripture says, the Lord looks at our heart.
Divided hearts produce shallow impact.
But whole hearts create trustworthy leaders.
The second thing that takes shows us
is the true audience of our work is higher than human approval.
Paul says it's working for the Lord, not for human masters.
When God becomes our audience,
we are freed from the addiction of Paul's
on the proper right of saying warns us
on that the fear of the people becomes a snare.
If a proven becomes our aim,
moral and spiritual compromise becomes our habit.
Beloved when God is our audience,
conscience becomes non-negotiable.
because eternal perspective is guarded by our moral courage.
The possible says that you and I must obey God rather than man.
So the first thing this takes shows us is the measure of our work is literally how hard
is fixated on what you and I do.
The second thing here, the true audience of our work is under, it's higher than human
improvement.
But then third and final, we notice in this thing, this takes shows us that the labor of
of our work is seeded with eternal meaning.
The possible say as you will receive
an inheritance from the Lord as your reward.
God honors faithfulness beyond visible results.
I'm glad to do not, Texas do not work,
be rearing where dwell doing,
but in due season you will reap what you have shown.
Paul says it is the Lord Christ
that each of us are serving.
So you and I serve beyond titles.
You and I serve beyond just this season
that what you and I do will last a lifetime.
And God will reward us, not just about what we do,
but in the heart and the spirit that you and I do it in.
May we bow, may we pray.
I God, our Father, the gift of every good and perfect gift.
We come before you with hearts full of gratitude
for the opportunity to serve the people of this great state.
God, we thank you for these diverse voices,
gifts, and abilities gathered here today,
and God for the privilege of leading with integrity
and wisdom.
Father Grant, each of each senator,
clarity of mind, strength of conviction,
and humility of heart.
God, the deliberations, guide them each and every day.
Father, remind us that true leadership
is marked by service and made their work honor
the trust placed within them by those who selected them.
Lord, in the moments of disagreement,
grant patience and understanding
and moments of challenge, grant courage and perseverance,
bless their families, protect their health
and let their peace and let your peace
and your grace reign within this chamber.
God, we ask you, nine Jesus name,
that you, your glory, may rest upon this place
And Father, all that they do this day and beyond,
may bring your name glory,
and may the Father, the people of the state of Georgia,
bless them now in a special way, in Jesus name.
Amen.

Thank you so much for that introduction.
I'm Shrikant Iyer, as she said, I'm the chief medical and quality officer from Children's
Healthcare, Atlanta, and in that role, I'm responsible for the quality and the safety for
all the children that we serve.
I am thrilled to be joined by a group of folks from Children's, our facility dogs, and
their handlers.

If you ever wonder what the therapeutic effect is, just meet them.
It's really, really a special thing.

Are there any unanimous consents?
Does, I'm sorry, Senator from the lies for a purpose to you, rise.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I ask for unanimous consent to excuse the senator from the second for business outside the gap.
Without objection, Senator from the second is excused.
It is now time for the points of personal privilege any senator will wish to share whatever
wisdom they have today, bringing out senator from the 30th.
Thank you Mr. President.
If I can have y'all attention real quick, I've got some news I just want to share with you.
Several of us in this body may have served with a state representative Bill Humbery back
in the day when he was in the state house.
Bill has been sick for a little while now and I just got a text a little while ago from
his wife Bill passed a little bit earlier this morning and for those of you that didn't
know Bill, I'll say a few words about him because I got the chance to know him in Douglas
When he was elected to fish when I was a police officer and we got to become good friends and then when I got elected, I had part of Douglas County and Bill had part of Douglas County.
So we got to become even better friends.
If you didn't know, there wasn't a better person than Bill Henry.
He would do anything in the world for you.
He would help you.
Didn't mayor Ross out of the out, but he was just a genuine white person.
So I just want to let everyone know that, and if you would, if you'd join me in a moment of silence, I appreciate it.
Please stand and send it as a question of a moment of silence.
Thank you all and they got blesses family and him.
Thank you.
Thank you Senator.
Bill was a good, good man.
He will be missed.
I thought some prayers were with his family.
Break it down to Senator from the 39th.
Good morning again, colleagues.
I just want to take a quick moment to acknowledge something that's really special happening
here at the Capitol today as part of keeping Georgia while day.
For the second year, Representative Marvin Lim and I partnered with the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources to launch the 2026 Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites art contest.
This initiative invites high school students from across our state to capture the natural
beauty, rich history, and wonder of Georgia State Parks and historic sites through visual
arts, paintings that reflect how young people see and experience the outdoors.
This year we received 238 submissions, double last year's total.
And today our top three winners, along with those who placed in the top 10, are here with
their families as we prepare to showcase their work in the South Atrium beginning at
one o'clock.
These young artists are incredible.
It was very, very difficult to do the judging to determine our winners.
They stood out not only for their talent, but for their ability to remind us why Georgia's
parks and historic sites matter.
And I really encourage you, please, to take a moment this afternoon to walk through the
South atrium.
You will want to see these paintings.
Again, these works remind us why Georgia's parks and historic sites are worth preserving
and why investing in young people is always the right choice.
to all the students who participated.
Thank you for sharing your gifts
and to the winners, congratulations,
and to our partners at the Department of Natural Resources.
Thank you for celebrating the powerful intersection
of art and nature.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
So I want to remind everyone that, you know,
obviously today is the state of the state
and we'll be lining up at 10.45, gathering up back there
it back there in the back to go over to the House Chambers, but I would like to remind
the senators who were part of the governor's escort, escort into the chamber is you do in
the governor's office at 1030, so probably head on down there, you get a chance.
But before I go into any more points of personal privilege, I want to thank the senator from
the 8th. Senator from the 8th, I want to thank the Balaus Estate University for sending
us a helmet that was signed by everybody. Very kind of the group right there. Tell those
young men and tell the coach down there, I really do appreciate it. You know, actually
Senator, actually based on the reception we got last year in the house, you might want
this helmet for today. I don't know. But we appreciate that.
Senator from the 43rd.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Good morning, colleagues.
Do you know what today is?
Do you know what today is?
Well, it's our founders day, and I rise to acknowledge and joyfully celebrate the 118 years of magnificent service by our beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated.
We first graced the world as we were founded on the campus of Howard University, January 15,
1908.
Through the brilliant courage and unwavering vision of our extraordinary founders, establishing
a legacy of service and empowerment to black women, evolving from a social club to an international
organization intentionally focused on educational,
empowerment, health, and community betterment.
Their legacy of sisterhood, scholarship, and supreme service
to all mankind illuminates our path as we honor the vision
and foundation laid on January 15, 1908.
The extraordinary impact of our beloved Alpha Capital
Alpha Sorority Incorporated continues
to make communities near and far a resounding message
of a resounding yes that our 118th anniversary
stands as a soaring summit to our timeless charge
to be supreme in service to all mankind.
Again, happy founders day to the first
and finest forever phenomenal women
of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority incorporated.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you, Senator.
We recognize the senator from the 55th.
Reporting personal privilege.
I speak of none other than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and I want to Paul simply
to say that he has done a service to this nation, to the state, and to this world, because
I dare say I would not be standing here but for his sacrifice, but for him giving of
his life, and we would not have a better nation but for what he has stood and done.
And finally, I want to just share a couple of his quotes that stand on the north side
of the capital, north, on the north part of the, if you go to Washington, D.C., there's
several of its quotes that stand on the wall. And I guess I won't be saying that today.
But I would just say that let freedom ring not only, and it has so much meaning to me.
But when you say let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia, it has so much meaning
because I was told by my great aunt that people that looked like me lived up on the mountain
with Indians and that we were displaced from on top of Stone Mountain and we were displaced
from Stone Mountain and told that we should never be caught after dark in Stone Mountain.
And if you're from Georgia as I am, then you know that there was a rumor that if you
called in that place after dark, and if you looked like me, you would disappear.
And they moved my families and some other families to a place called Ellen.
They named it after Aunt Ellen, an older black female, and they called it place Ellen Wood.
And I'm so honored that letting Freedom Ring from Stone Mountain Georgia means so much
because as a kid growing up in Griffin, Georgia,
I was told not to be called in the dark in Stone Mountain.
I now live in Stone Mountain.
And I represent Stone Mountain
that there is no fear of me being in Stone Mountain anymore.
So when you hear Dr. King saying,
let freedom ring even from Stone Mountain, Georgia,
it has special meaning because there
were people that looked like me that were told never
to be called in Stone Mountain.
So I'm so honored to be serving with you
and letting you know, let freedom ring all over this nation,
even from Stone Mountain Georgia.
I love you, God bless you.
Thank you, Senator Rick and I, Senator from 7.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I rise today to talk about Georgia's healthcare crisis.
By midnight tonight, the last Georgian who can enroll in the marketplace will have made
their choice.
But let us tell the truth about what that choice really is.
For hundreds of thousands of Georgians, it is not which plan do you like best, it is not
do you prefer this deductible or that deductible, it is one brutal question.
Do you go with, do you go with health insurance or do you go without it?
And the answer is being forced on families by sticker shock.
Early numbers from December show enrollment and Georgia access is down more than 190,000
people compared to last year.
We're hearing premiums in Georgia rising at an average of 200%.
One analyst are warning that almost half a million Georgians who are on the exchange won't be able to afford health care.
That is a statewide emergency, which is why I, with my colleagues, have co-sponsored Senate Bill 379.
The Georgia Health Insurance Affordability and Consumer Protection Act.
This bill uses state subsidies to cover the increased costs caused by expiring ACA premium subsidies,
keeping premiums affordable for Georgians.
politicians will shrug and treat this like a problem that will fix itself, but they
are insulated from the consequences.
They are not the ones staring at a premium they cannot pay, skipping checkups, rashing
prescriptions, or praying nothing goes wrong this month.
But what happens outside this chamber is real.
This is not just affect one household budget, it hits our whole system.
It means more people delaying care until it becomes an emergency.
It means more uncompensated care.
It means more pressure on hospitals, clinics, and local health departments.
It means rural communities getting squeezed even harder.
And it means the rest of us pay too.
Because when the uninsured rate rises, the cost does not disappear.
It gets shifted, premiums rise, hospital stretch, scars, resources.
And Georgia is sitting on a massive surplus.
And there are leaders who will pretend we cannot afford to help Georgians.
Keep their health insurance.
That is not fiscal responsibility.
It is a dereliction of our duty to look after Georgians.
And tonight, when families are doing the math at their kitchen table, politics is still
getting the way of basic common sense.
And here is a part we cannot dodge.
If we do nothing, people will get sicker.
Preventable problems will become emergencies.
Some families will bury people who should still be here.
By midnight tonight, Georgians will be locked out of affordable coverage unless they had
the luck to have money sitting around or the luck to have a job that covers it or the
luck to never get sick.
But luck is not health policy and indifference is not leadership.
We are not helpless.
Our hands are not tied behind our backs.
We can act.
We can lead.
And we can do what is right.
Thank you and I yield a well.
We're going to have Senator from 35th.
Senator from 35th.
from 35th. Some eyes played a joke on our new senator.
We're going to have a center from the 19th.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Center from 35th, good to have you here with us. Light was on.
No one was home. As you know, next week's budget week,
Just a reminder, we'll start our budget hearings on Tuesday.
You're all welcome to attend, even if you're not on the Appropriations Committee.
We'll start at 10 a.m.
And of course, you know the governor will be one of the first ones to speak.
Typically, we've been a little bit shorter on Thursdays.
I would anticipate that Thursday's meeting will run a little bit longer this year.
So for planning purposes, if you're going to hang with us the whole time, you might not want to plan to make lunch plans on Thursday yet.
If there's any questions, feel free to grab me later on and thank you again for your participation in what's the only
constitutionally obligation, a constitutional obligation that we do have to fulfill.
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well.
Zaniel, Senator Wishraaz, on point of personal privilege.
