TRANSCRIPT
----------
I'm State Senator Harold Jones, the second current whip for the Georgia Senate Democratic
Caucus.
In a few minutes, as you know, we will begin a special session focused primarily on redraw
and Georgia state legislative congressional maps.
As you know, this is the second legislative session we have for redistricting in as many
years.
The reason we gather here again today at additional taxpayer expense is because within
In General Assembly Met in 2021, Republicans passed legislative and congressional maps that
discriminated against minority voters.
In that special session, Democrats pleaded with Republicans to acknowledge that all the
growth in Georgia's population over the preceding decade have been driven by residents of color
and have the new maps reflect that reality.
Unfortunately, those pleas were ignored, and here we are.
proposals of fair maps that complied with the Voting Rights Act were rejected. Instead in 2021,
Republicans passed maps that sought to cement political power for the coming decade
at the expense of minority voters. These are not my worries, but the words that actually come from
a federal court opinion in an exhaustive comprehensive 516-page order which states that the legislative
congressional maps passed in 2021 violated section two of the Voting Rights Act. It diluted the
power of African American voters by not providing them with an equal opportunity to elect their candidates
of choice. Specifically, the court identified Senate districts 10, 16, 17, 25, 28, 30, 34, 35, 43,
and 44, as areas in which the enacted plan violated the Voting Rights Act. To remedy this
violation the court ordered the state to an act in a map that has two additional
majority black districts in South Mesro-Atlantic.
Unfortunately the Republican proposal for the Senate fails to do that and fails to comply
with the Voting Rights Act, fails to comply with the judge's order, and continues to dilute
the power of African-American voters.
However, the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus has proposed a map that complies with the
course order can pause with the voting rights act.
Now I will turn it over for Senate Minority Leader Gloria
Butler to continue to talk about efforts from this point
forward.
Good morning, everyone.
Thank you, Senator, for so many words.
As we did in 2021, yesterday, Senate Democrats
released a proposed Senate map that complies with the Voting Rights Act.
But more importantly, it complies with the Court's order, given the General Assembly,
a second opportunity to do the right thing.
This is the map that should be adopted for Georgia's Senate District.
It does exactly what the order demands by drawing two additional majority black districts
in the area where the court found violations
of the Voting Rights Act.
Specifically, the 16th and 17th districts
in the Democratic proposal are new majority black districts.
As my colleagues, Senator Jones stated,
the courts order identifies an area
covered in 10 Pacific Senate districts
where black voters do not have an equal opportunity
to elect the candidate of choice.
Therefore, that's where the Democratic proposal starts and ends.
All the proposed changes in the Democratic proposal
are to those districts and only those districts.
It's within the area where the Court
found Voting Rights Act, violations that the new majority black, 16th, and 17th districts
exist.
The Democratic Proposal Friends almost 150,000 black residents that currently live in non-majority
black districts in the affected areas into majority black districts.
As to the remaining 46 districts in the current Senate map, they remain exactly the same
in the Democratic proposal. In short, Democrats did what the Court ordered within the confines of the Court's order.
Unfortunately, the majority's proposal fails to do so.
The majority's proposal is a share game that continues to dilute the voting power of Black voters.
to start in order to try and obscure what it is doing,
the majorities propose a reassign the district numbers
of multiple existed incumbents.
But at the end of the day, they can't have the continued dilution
of black voting power in the plan.
In the Pacific area where the court found Voting Rights Act violations,
The majority's proposal moves almost as many black residents out of existing majority black districts as it moves into majority black districts.
I need to say that again because quite frankly it's shocking.
The majority's proposal moves almost as many black residents out of existing majority black districts
in an affected area as it moves into majority black districts.
Essentially, the new proposal does nothing.
Nothing to improve the voting power of black voters
in the areas in which the court found
Voting Rights Act violations.
To mask this failure, the Republican proposal
consolidates black voters in the core
of Metro Atlanta for the Court not find any existing voting rights at violations.
But this does not comply with the Court's order.
Rather, it ignores the Court's finding on the dilution of black voting power.
It's for these reasons that we encourage the General Assembly to stafffully consider
and adopt the Democratic proposal that fully complies with the courts order.
Thank you so much for being here this morning.
If you have a few questions, we'll be happy to entertain you.
The leader Butler, I would like to hear from two of the affected families of St.
I didn't hear you, hear you, hear everything you say.
How possible would you hear from it,
to the center, to the fact that by the drawing,
is that the center, is that the center?
Is that, should that be for this whole?
Yeah, I think so.
There actually are 15 districts extensively redrawn
under this proposed Republican plan.
The court order specified 10 districts
as being problematic and violative
of the Voting Rights Act.
So there are many, many more Georgians shifted around
unnecessarily under the Republican proposal,
which, as noted by the leader, directly violates
the Voting Rights Act and the court's order
by engaging in a shell game, moving some voters
and numbers around, but not at all providing any additional,
or very, very few additional block voters
with the meaningful opportunity to elect the candidate
of their choice.
Do we hear about how specifically we were different from what we were doing?
And how they do a thing on the other side?
Changes were made in certain areas to attempt to make it seem as though additional block
voters were being provided an opportunity to like the candidate of their choice.
Those, however, are outside the affected area where voter dilution and discrimination
was found.
They're simply in a totally different part of Metro-Atlanta, and therefore they do not
remedy, the Voting Rights Act violation that the court found. Therefore, they continue to
violate the Voting Rights Act and they also violate Judge Jones' order.
Good morning, I'm such and Bargis Council for the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus.
It plainly violates the court's order.
The court specifically identified those two districts as part of the vote dilution area.
I won't speculate as to why the majority chose not to do that, but it is in plain violation
of the court's order.
Later, what do you want to come to do?
What do you want to come to do a role
at least during this special session?
My role?
Yeah.
Can you just advocate for, is it?
I am going to present our plan in committee.
I don't know how far it would get,
but if it comes out in committee,
then I would present it on floor.
That's my role.
Do you think if your plan does not advance out of committee,
that it will be an important part of argument
and important path of possession as ever?
You know what?
I'm hoping that the judge is watching us and looking at our plan
and knowing that it is the best plan.
I would be over the moon if the judge could recommend
the Senate Democratic Caucus Plan.
