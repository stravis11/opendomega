Good to see y'all on this beautiful Friday morning. First day of the weekend, right? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 89th House District representing Becky Evans, representative Evans. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I'm so glad today to introduce the pastor of my church, North Decatur Presbyterian Church, where I've been a member for 37 years, Reverend David Lewicki. And I'm so glad to welcome his daughter, Margaret, who's an eighth grader at Beacon Hill Middle School, and Decatur. I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know. So David has served North Decatur Presbyterian Church as a pastor since 2010. David became a pastor after working as a nonprofit professional. He co-founded and ran urban solutions, a youth and community development organization in New Haven, Connecticut from 98 to 2001, where he was awarded the Echoing Green Fellowship for social entrepreneurs. He earned degrees from Yale University and Union Theological Seminary in New York. And yet as MDiv there, David is a commissioner and Decatur for the Decatur Housing Authority. And he serves on the Public Policy Advocacy Organization, Presbyterians for Better Georgia, who were just here earlier this week advocating. And he's often found on the sidelines as a volunteer Decatur Rec basketball or soccer coach. He's married to the Reverend Beth Waltonath, and their parents of three children, 16, 14, and seven. And on a personal note, I just want to say, David's been my pastor for the past 14 years. And I love worshiping at North Decatur. I love listening to his sermons. They uplift me, inspire me, and challenge me in my faith. And they encourage and strengthen me to go out and help work to create God's beloved community here in Decatur, Georgia. I want to thank him for his prayers and counsel, both on personal family matters. And on difficult political decisions I've had to make. So Reverend Lewicki, I praise God for you, and I want to welcome you today. And thank you for being here with us. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good morning. I don't know if you all pay attention to polls, but Gallup publishes every couple of years a poll about the favorability of certain professions and clergy are down to 35% were plummeting. It's depressing when people don't respect what you do. I was looking for a convention of telemarketers that I might be able to talk to you. And then Becky called and said, would you like to come and talk to the house? I won't tell you what Gallup says about politicians. I'll just tell you that I'm with Kindred Spirits today. In all seriousness, I have a huge amount of respect for every one of you in what you do. I've met a number of you through the years through my work with Presbyterians for a better Georgia. Mostly I know about you because of my relationship with Becky. I have been her pastor for 12 years every Sunday. She is a church with David. They are part of the heart and soul of our faith community. I don't know anyone who brings as much energy and intelligence and imagination and love to their work as Becky Evans. And I know that you all, if you all even brought a fraction of the gifts that she has to your work that the people of Georgia are in good hands, you are an amazing group of people, and it's an honor to be with you today. I want to talk just briefly this morning about our shared project, which is democracy. Democracy is not just a political system. It is a theological proposition. We had ancestors, all of us did, who lived under kings, and they hated it, right? When kings were incompetent or abusive or corrupt, which they almost always were, there was no way to get rid of them. Some of us have ancestors who gave their lives to get rid of kings. Even God never cared much for kings. Read first Samuel 8 if you want to know God's true feeling about monarchies. Our ancestors replaced kings with democracy. Extraordinary revolutions took place all across the world. To declare that the only legitimate power is that which lies in the hands of regular people. It's not just a political theory, it's good theology. Genesis 1 says that every human being is an image bearer of the divine. People have power because God put it there when God put God's image on each one of us. Christians believe that this mysterious and beautiful, holy spirit works in every human being. That spirit is democratic by nature. She doesn't reveal herself to the people with the best credentials or the right family connections. And sometimes the spirit will choose only one of us to reveal something to. Our ancestors knew that there had to be a system of governance, a polity that listens for the voice of God in every single person. Our ancestors tried to build a democracy, but they didn't have the courage. During reconstruction people who looked like me, threatened and beat or jailed or killed a third of our state's black legislators. Women couldn't vote in this state until 1922. Our ancestors decided against their own faith that only people with pink skin and a Y chromosome could be trusted with power. And they were wrong. We know that now. Every great social movement in this country has moved us closer to the brilliant and true theological idea that power lies in the people. Every person must have a hand in shaping our common life through participation in the democratic process. Only then. Only then will we see what the will of God really looks like. We don't know yet. Not yet. But it goes even deeper. This theology of democracy. In 1791 we adopted this thing called a Bill of Rights. It says in effect that there are things that God ensures you that no policy disagreement between us can ever erase. You always get to vote. You always get to speak your mind. You always get to organize. You always get to protest the government. And in the long arc of history, as the majority moves from one party to the other and back again, those rights will always be assured. The Bill of Rights is literally the way we do what Jesus commanded, which is love our enemies in public. Democracy is how we say to one another. God has put something good and holy in you. And I can never take it away. And surely you see the same thing in me. May I invite you to rise that we might pray together. Let's take a deep breath with each other. Oh God, you respond to many names. But wherever we see you, you look like love. May your great love rest on every member of this house today. May your great love rest on every member of every staff. May your great love rest on the women and men whose quiet work behind the scenes allows the sacred work of democracy to carry on. May your great love rest on every person in this state from Valdosta to Dalton from Columbus to Savannah. Oh God, love especially those who struggle and suffer this day. Love those who are barely holding on. And love especially those who find themselves in prison this day either emotional or actual. And God give us today and every day eyes to see each other as you see us. Beautiful reflections of your divine image. Each of us given gifts for the common good. And may we have courage. May we have courage to fulfill the promises of democracy. In your many names in one love we pray together saying, Amen. Will you join me in the Pledge of Allegiance? Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice are all. Thank you. Thank you so much for that message. David, thank you for that message. And Margaret. Margaret has a social studies test this afternoon. So we're going to wish she aces it. What do y'all think? Have to be in this place. Margaret, good luck. Door keeping you may unlock the doors. Members, you may join David in the South any room. And greet him for a photo if you will. Thank you.

Members, our doctor of the day today, we're going to make an exception and hear a few words from him. He is actually president of the medical association and so it makes it even more special that he would take his time to join us. If you will, Dr. Wilmner. Thank you and I want to stay away from this thing because this thing could hurt somebody. Just wanted to thank you as president of the medical association. I started as an ordally. I'm now the president. I've gone to the whole gamut and I've seen what you've done.

Thanks to all of our friends who are here this morning. It's always special when you come to the People's House. Representative Alexander, Anelo Witts, and Representative Huggley recognize. And friends, thank you, Mrs. Speaker. March 8th is celebrated. The lady will suspend just for a minute. You have more friends than you thought. Give them a chance to get down if you will. Here comes one more. Two more. Actually, Mrs. Speaker, if all the women can stand in those that can come down, we appreciate it. Thank you, Mrs. Speaker. March 8th is celebrated as International Women's Day. International Women's Day is a global celebration that honors the remarkable achievements, struggles, and contributions of women across all circles of life. It is a special day dedicated to recognizing and appreciating the invaluable role women play in shaping our society, bringing down barriers and driving positive change. Also, we are celebrating 100 years of women in this house. International Women's Day serves as a powerful reminder that women have been at the forefront of countless movements and challenging traditional gender norms. On this day, people around the world come together to celebrate the progress made towards gender equality while also acknowledging the ongoing challenges and obstacles that women still face. The campaign theme for this year is Inspire Inclusion. Happy International Women's Day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Awesome. Happy International Women's Day. Thank you, ladies. We appreciate it. And to all our guests celebrating International Women's Day, that's awesome. Representative Owl Williams. Is this a resolution for another ladies' day? No, they've done a good job, Mrs. Speaker. Thank you. This is just to give you a quick heads up. This is a little bill that affects everybody. It didn't make it this year and hasn't made it yet, but maybe next year, it's called Peer to Peer. 64% of Georgians transfer money on these platforms. And all this bill asks because the big problem is millions is being lost because of a mistake with the send button. This is asking for 30 minutes for cooling off time so the person may have an opportunity to change their mind. It adds no cost to the banks, cost to nobody, nothing. It just helps you, friend of mine, sends some money, and she calls the person and says, you know, that's not for you as a mistake. And his response was I'm going to consider this my blessing. I won't tell you the blessing she gave him. But think about this bill. There's not a district in Georgia that does not have citizens that disinfects. This is consumer protection. Just give 30 minutes, cooling off so the person might be able to say, I really didn't mean to make that transaction. I'm going to be looking forward to next year. But if you pick me up and carry me, we might take it across the finish line this year. Thank you, I think. Good job, Representative. Representative Kelly. Representative Trey Kelly is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House. I asked my privilege today to welcome the skills USA students from Cedar Town Middle School. We're honored to have them here in the gallery with us. We know many of us are familiar with skills USA and it teaches you great skills in the classroom, but it also sets them up for success in life. Specifically, I want to recognize three of the students who won a gold medal last week in their competition for community service project they did in Polk County, cleaning up streams all across our community. That's Ellen Frazier, Ellen Arp and Piper Cain. So I hope y'all help me join in welcoming them. And also I want to recognize another student who has a tie to the house, which is Lacon Thornton, her granddad, butch is one of my dear family friends and does a great job keeping us all safe. I mean, if you know butch, so we y'all all rise and let us recognize and order y'all here in the house. So thank y'all. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll yield the will. Welcome. Great group there, Representative Kelly. Hope you take them all to lunch. Good to have y'all. Majority Leader, F Strations, recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we have some very special college students here with us. The Georgia Association of College Republicans is having their day at the capitol, previously served as chairman of that final organization. College students, if you'd please rise so we can give you a hand. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good to have y'all. It's always important when our college students, our future leaders right there appreciate y'all being here. Reps they've done in Carter is recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And good morning, colleagues. We have a special group of ladies here with us today in honoring international women's day, international women's business day.

Thank you for being here. I love your flags and I love your dresses. Y'all look great. Thanks for being with us and celebrating. Reps. They train as recognized for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to thank the students, the third graders from Talley Upper Elementary School for coming to the people's house. They've just left but thank you for coming here and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Tell them we were pleased and excited there here, if you will, representing. Representative Gaba Corrie is recognized for a morning order. I thank you like it in the well, don't you? Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm not recognizing the janitor today, Mr. Dewey, represented Dewey McLean. But Mr. Speaker, I wanted to recognize a very special friend of mine, somebody who has helped me out every time I hit the campaign trail. She happens to be here this morning and I would like Mr. Dewey George to stand and be recognized. Thank you. Representative Danny Mathis. Representative Mathis, recognize for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If we look over here on this side of the chamber, I am honored to recognize the 2023 Black and County High School 1-18 state champions. For a second year after competing with the Mary Poppins Jr. at the Georgia High School Association of Region A Division 1-1 Act competition this past November. The 1-18 consists of 57 members of the cast and the crews, as well as their directors, Miss Kelly, Greer, Vicki Speck and Spencer Maddox. And we have our principal for a Black and County High School, Dr. Brad Knox. I would like for y'all to have one to house to give them a big round of applause if y'all are staying, please. Thank you. This is a wonderful group of people. We're so proud you're here today. And if when you exit there, I'd like to come down and get some pictures with some of y'all. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That completes our morning orders. Members, if you'll come to the floor, members of the house, if you'll please come to the floor. Members of the house, if you'll please come to the floor and take your seats. If you need to have conversations at this point in time, I want to ask you to take them to the any room. We all know that this house is a great big old family. This time goes along, decisions are made. Sometimes decisions are made that members of our family side is time to take a different route for lots of different and numerous reasons that are all important to that individual, to the people they represent, but I would say most important to their immediate family. And that's where it should be. We're decision makers. And I respect decisions that members of this house makes every day as we vote on different priorities for the people of Georgia. But I also know as many of you know, several of our members will not be returning, bittersweet time as we reflect on their service to the people of this state and certainly to their districts. So this morning, we're going to hear from a couple of our members that have made the decision not to return to this house in 2025. I'm going to recognize them to come to the well and make some comments. And we're going to bring that. We want to begin that process today with a friend, someone who I respect. He's been known in some spaces as big poppy. And that's probably the name he probably appreciates and relishes more than he other I'd say. Representative Greg Kennedy has recognized for his comments. Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is my farewell address ish. It's kind of a sort of farewell address. I intend to have a little fun with this. So this morning, I present to you my seven takeaways, my seven takeaways from my experience at the house. These are seven things that will linger on and live on in my heart and mind. Well beyond my last gamble here at Sunny Day in a few weeks. Number seven. One to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God. No comma. One nation under God. No comma. Every morning we pledge allegiance to the flag of our country and 179 of us say it this way. One nation under God as we have been programmed to say. We insert the comma, we insert the pause, but there's one among us. He stays true to the original text. He does not waver. He is unflinching. He fights the good fight with conviction. He stands alone. He stands his ground. And he is committed to the grammatically correct pledge of allegiance. And I'll never be able to say the pledge of allegiance again without our Williams voice banging in my head. One nation under God. No comma. I'm taking you with me. Number six is the apparent bionic right arm of Speaker John Burns. The strength in his right arm is astonishing. My God this man snaps gabbles like their twigs, like their toothpicks. The question is how much taxpayer money are we spending on gabbles these days? I mean it's at once impressive but also a little unsettling. How is he that strong? This man is 72 years old. How is he possibly this strong? I just can't make sense of it. John Burns, son of Krypton, I'm not sure. It's inexplicable. Number five is the personal revelation that Georgia is largely rural. Georgia is mostly rural. I did not know that. I grew up in Gwyneth County, the Metro Atlanta area. My lived experience with Georgia is that it's suburban and urban. But then I became a member of the General Assembly and met all the representatives and senators from the other parts of Georgia. And it just dawned on me that there are more of you than there are of us. There's a lot of folks representing rural Georgia as evidenced by all the pickup trucks in the parking deck. My goodness, I drive in every morning and there are rows and rows lines as far as the I can see. F-150s, Silverados, Rams, Tacomas. Show of hands if you own a pickup truck. Let me see your hand. Ladies and gentlemen, the Monster Jam Caucus. Number four, all the sayings and colloquialisms that we say inside this Capitol building that makes sense in here, but are never set outside. You just hear these things over and over while we're in session. Colloquialism, sayings like this, is this the hill you're going to die on? Or I got to keep my powder dry. After my personal favorite, the juice is just not worth the squeeze. Another one that I find annoying because we use it over and over at Nazim. It's just you know when it's coming. This legislation is a solution looking for a problem, right? And then there's one little phrase. It's almost a grunt. I didn't make sense of it for a few weeks, but it's just two letters, one syllable, but it's just this little noise sound word called ag. Ag. I kept hearing people say ag. I was like, why is everybody clearing their throat around? I heard about ag bills and the ag committee and the ag building. It took me about three weeks to figure out what shall we say. Ag is short for ag agriculture. Ag agriculture. I guess four syllables is just too high of a bar to clear. I got to reduce this down, simplify ag. Number three is what I call cornbread gate. Cornbread gate. It's HB 1048. The gentleman from Dalton is trying to deep fake us. This AI generated disinformation trying to bamboozle Georgians and us into believing that the state official bread should be cornbread. I call fake news. Everybody knows better? Biscuit is the superior bread. I know this because I did my own polling this week. It was evidence-based. It was scientific. I sent most of the contacts in my phone, one simple text, one question. If you had to pick between cornbread and biscuit, which would be your preferred? The numbers do not lie. This is the way they came back. 2% were undecided. They couldn't pick. 32% said cornbread. I was walking 66%. It was a landslide victory. They said biscuit was their preferred bread. The numbers do not lie. I also did my own personal taste test over last weekend. I had a meal with cornbread. And it was good. It's tasty. I have no beef with cornbread. It was worth eating. But then I had a plate of biscuits and gravy. A very different experience. Goose bumps. The hair on my arm was raised. The Holy Spirit was all over. Then came down and glory filled my soul. I was taking the bites of biscuits and just thinking, won't he do it? Won he do it? The spirit of Sophia came on me. That's how I know day is a God. Day is a God. Yeah, so I'm calling on Governor Kim. That 1048 reaches his desk. Vitoit, Georgians deserve better. This is the hill I will die on. Number two, I'm taking a risk here rolling the dice. You may not think this is as funny as I do. Does everybody know who Ron Burgundy is? Ron Burgundy is a welfare character in the movie Anchorman. And so Ron Burgundy is a local news anchor at a San Diego news station. And before he goes through his life newscast, he always does this warm up. And it's kind of funny. Tongue twister. It's a mouthful. Just a warm up his voice and get the juices flowing. His lips lose so he can say the broadcast with proper addiction. But he says things like the human torch was denied a bank loan. The human torch was denied a bank loan. And he says the arsonist had oddly shaped feet. The arsonist had oddly shaped feet. Well, in the spirit of Ron Burgundy, there's some things we say in this chamber that I think are nice warm ups that we can use over and over. You do some public speaking. You can use some of these phrases. These are things that we do say things we could say, like this. I was recognized by the speaker for a parliamentary inquiry. The legislation was recommitted to the Committee of Intergovernmental Coordination. I went to the well to speak against prosecutorial oversight and mandatory minimums. And then one more. This bill was sponsored by Terry Aniluets Martin Montahan, Faruk Mughal, Mary Margaret Oliver, and Chairman Chokus. Chairman Chokus. Number one. Number one. Most memorable. It will stay with me forever. What it has to do is where I'm seated here in the chamber. Second row. One desk in. That's where I've sat for six years. And what's going to be memorable about it is this cast of characters. My roommates, my seat mates. But especially the two that flanked me. The two that flanked me. On one side is Emery Dunahue of Gillesville, Georgia Hall County. And then on the other side is represented a park cannon. From the A. Fulton County, T.I. says Atlanta is Wakanda. So I got Gillesville and Wakanda. So I want you to catch the gravity of that.

Emerge Nanahoo, part canon. Part canon in Emerge Nanahoo, one of these things is not likely other. Emerge Nanahoo is appropriately to my right. And part canon is appropriately to my left. And I am in the middle. It's very serendipitous. But every morning they're going back and forth. One in one ear, the other in the other ear, and it's just this ping pong session, this banter, these under the breath, comments, the crosstalk, it's just like this all morning long. Just the cultural and political whiplash, I feel very, very, very, it's amazing. It's been very entertained. But the reality is, I love them both, and on a more serious note, I love all of you. I love all of you. I have a deep respect for this body, for this chamber. I have a deep respect for this building. Every time I drive past it, I get a flutter in my heart. I bring people down here all the time to tour it, because I just love sharing this building. And it's been one of the greater honors of my life to serve my community, serve my district, serve Gwyneth County, and to serve with you all. And I've done it now for six years, not for the coveted eight years. Now for the coveted eight, that's six. I got six in. But when the degrees just redistricting happened, and the new maps, a special session, and it was finally decided upon by the federal courts, I was the way it happened. I was kind of surprised and also a little bit disappointed. No, don't cry for me. I'm over. I'm a big boy. I've went through all five stages of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, check, and then I finally got to acceptance. But I'm there. And my faith has helped me get to this place of acceptance, because things that surprise us, nothing surprises God. He sees the end from the beginning, and I have a belief that there's a higher power out there or pastrating my life, ordering my steps, directing my path. And so, you know, I'm there. I believe God opens and closes doors, and He also works all things out for our good. So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, thank you. I love you all. Listen, when my mom passed a few years ago, just the comments and the calls and the hugs, it was very meaningful to me. You touched my heart. So, thank you. God bless you all. God bless this country. God bless the great state of Georgia. Big poppy out. Thank you. Representative Kenner, I want to make an observation about your comments. One of them is, I was wondering where from time to time, how you came up with some of those comments you made from your seat. Now I get it with who was on your left and who was on your right. But I also want to apologize to you for putting you in that position. I'll be a little bit more reasonable in the future with some of these placements on seat selections. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your care, for your family, your grandchildren, and Godspeed to you and everything in front of you. I do believe there is a path that's laid out by the Good Lord and there's no doubt about that. We'll have another, well I don't know about this one. Marie Ewen John David, Joe, come down front if you will. I recognize a gentleman who's been around this spot for the last 20 years. I know that because I arrived the same time he did. I've grown to know him, respect him and love him and his family Marie and that John David night right there in front of me. What a handsome young man. We're going to miss all of our folks who are taking that next step forward. We know that Chairman David night has represented his people with distinction, with integrity, with passion. No doubt about that. Great ingenuity from time to time. And when all of those things it takes to make a good slash great representative. As a friend I can't tell you how much that we will miss seeing you on a day-to-day basis and good conversations we've had. I say all that to Preface, Mr. Chairman, you're recognized to speak to the members of your family. I didn't realize how hard this would be. But you know there's a season for all things. And at the end of this term I will serve 20 years in the Georgia House of Representatives. And after much prayer and discussion with my wife Marie, I've decided it will be my last term. You know like a long Georgia fall season, often it takes a frigid Arctic blast to remind you that the next season is upon us. And for me that was the passing of my dear friend Richard Smith. You know we've lost some great people. Chairman John Meadows, Chairman Jerry Powell, Speaker David Rostin. But as I was speaking with my friend Terry England, somehow this one was different and it hurt a little more. You know as we all celebrated Richard Smith's service in life, it led me to reflect on my family and why I decided to serve 20 years ago and why it's time for the next season in my life. Karen, we went to the funeral together. Most of us did. Most of you remember the pastor. He had one comment and it sort of set with me. He said you know what Richard Smith was so good at what he did. He said he was rooted in family. And Richard was rooted in family because he was first rooted in God and he knew what family meant. Richard was a great leader and I think probably one of the best examples of how we're supposed to prioritize God and our family. God bless me with a wonderful family and after 20 years it's time to focus on what is best for my family. This body, it is part of my family. Y'all would not understand some of you do but I won't tell everybody that doesn't. It's been inexplicably part of the beginning of my family, the beginning of three and I. I'll tell you the story. In 2003 right after announcing my candidacy for this office I met Marie. Two or three weeks later I told her I'm a mayor. I didn't run her off so I knew I was okay. So we won in November of 04. I asked her to marry me a week after the election. And she said she wanted an August wedding you know the next year and I said no we can't wait that long. I talked her into April 23rd and of course you know that was only weeks after you know the end of our first session. She's an event planner, wedding coordinator. She was getting sort of stressed and Governor Sonny Perdue tried to ease some of that stress. She said don't worry Marie we'll just pause session. I'll marry you to on the floor and y'all can get back to business. You know I appreciate the help but I'm not sure it relieved the stress. Luckily we got out of session and we were able to you know in time for our wedding weekend and everything went well. But you know most of all your family and a lot of you here are family. When John David walked in this morning Bruce Williamson looked at John David and he said he said buddy I've been praying for you since you know before you even got here because there's a story. Marie and I had about an eight year journey in trying to have John David, Indymetrosis, surgeries, pulmonary embolisms, IUIs, miscarriages, failed IVF and it was quite a struggle. And a lot of you were here and you prayed for us and you helped get us through that time. And to my friend John Burns and they were our roommates and I'm not sure we would have gotten through this voucher. But there's a good story. When all had failed and we had prayed and got it ease with the fact that we're going to be good aunts and uncles, good lord, blessed us. And true story I've told some. I got up that Saturday morning and I went fishing with some friends and Marie text me a picture and it said pregnant. Well guys we had a pre-op for his direct meal Tuesday and we called the OBGYN on Monday and we'll see you tomorrow but we're pregnant. And that's how John David got here. But it's family and y'all are family. And we got to remember what families for workers when we act and the best interest of family as God would have us to. We're going to act in the best interest of the people of Georgia and I hope I've done that. Long before I got up here I had a Bible verse that is at my core and I hope has guided me. It's first period 315, 315 through 16 but in your hearts, Rebeur Christ is Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give a reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. Keeping a clear conscience so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed. You know that's guided us and I think it's important. Any time we're the most heated debates that we have or based on things that Paul was going back and debating and speaking with the Corinthians. A lot of the same issues that underlie the debates that we have here on the floor. But it also speaks to when we're doing policy I think we also need to be sure of what we're doing. Because when we get policy right don't worry about politics. People win. People win. And the people of Georgia win when we're studied and when we're sure of what we're doing. We're educated on our decisions and we make sure we're doing it for them. But I think the last part of the verse it also talks to where I think politics have gotten in the world today. And that is do our debating with civility and respect. Mr. Speaker. You've done an awesome job and I'm a speaker's before us. But this house has a history of civility and we can disagree on issues. But if we do it with gentleness and respect, you know what? Maybe or maybe not. We may never agree but you know something, you're good behavior and doing it in a civil manner. May call somebody to come around to your point or see your point of view. People are tired across this nation of bad politics and people being mean to each other. Be civil. That's what we've had this year. Love, not hate. We've had sermons up there. I mean throughout this thing. And it doesn't mean we have to like each other or like each other's position. But we've got to have a love of humanity and what we do and a love of each other. You know we can work on events. I see people out here that love. High school, Smiths are frying. We don't agree on issues all the time. But I guarantee you we agree on a lot and we work together. Tell you the no-oats we served on the Georgia Japanese Caucus. And we don't agree on issues but I tell you what I appreciate your friendship and I appreciate what you've done and how civilly we have worked together for calls. Mac, you are indeed a great man of God and your civility and your tone has been awesome. Misha, I have so much enjoyed to get to know you. The courage of your convictions and your sweetness, your sweet heart has been great. And it is meant a lot to me. Guys, if we treat each other with civility, we'll all be better for words. And the people of Georgia will be better for it. There are so many people. Well, one other thing, institutional knowledge. If I pass it along, this is what's meant most to me and it's advice, take your leave it. Institutional knowledge is not a bad thing. And also for young new representatives. You know, I came up here and this is a funny story. And it speaks to, I think a lot of people first got to know Richard and they found out that he was not the gruff person. He was actually the teddy bear and a gentle person who would help you. But I remember my first session, butch, Mickey Chanel, Richard Royal, Laurie Parham. And I went to a budget hearing and I was so scared. And I looked at these guys and I thought they, oh my God, they're so mean, they're so quiet. And you know something? And the end, I end up sitting for two years and I watched these guys. And I soon learned that when they got up to speak, people not only heard them, they listened to them. And there are actions, there are actions meant things. And when they stood up to speak, you listened because you knew that they had studied and they were coming forth for a good proposition. And to my friend Richard, who remembers Richard or served with Richard? Oh, he was so gruff on the outside, but he was just a teddy bear on the inside. Institutional knowledge and he would help you do anything I love him. There are so many people I want to thank. First, I want to thank the people of District 134, Spalding, Lamar, Monroe counties. And in my previous districts, then also included the people of butts and Henry. You've honored me with your support and your trust. And I'm forever grateful. I hope that I've lived up to that support and trust. I've given it my best. In over the years I've served under three governors, Governor Surnick Badoo, Governor Nathan Deel, and Brian Kemp. Each of them have faced unique circumstances. And each, I believe, have faithfully led our state through difficult times. But I especially want to thank Governor Brian Kemp. The COVID pandemic was unprecedented. And if you think about it, there wasn't a playbook. There wasn't a precedent. There was no historical reference to go back to to say, this is how we got through this. Governor Kemp, you wrote the playbook as you went and you did it in a way that not only led this state through the pandemic, but you did it in a way in which we came out on the other side. I believe stronger and better for it. You're in wavering leadership in tough times. And sometimes facing a lot of criticism, I just want to say thank you. And I would not have wanted to be in that position and having to make those decisions. But he did, and he did with courage and conviction, and we're all better off for it. Speaker Burns, John, can I call you? You know, John will never let me live it down. You know we were roommates. So when we first got elected, Deel and John and Maria and I were roommates. You know, we had up until the time we got pregnant with John David. We were up there and never let me live this down. But we, again, pregnant with John David in that session came in. He was born February 1 of 13. And I spent one night that session at the apartment. And he said that was probably the most expensive night that I've ever spent. But you know something, Speaker Burns has led in this house for 20 years as a chairman of the community, as the majority leader, and now as a speaker. Speaker Rolston, setting, passing, left huge shoes to be filled. Speaker Burns, John, I would say that you've not only filled those big shoes you've outgrown them. His leadership and the civility that he brings to this house makes us more unified and more effective so that we can go do the right thing for the people of Georgia. You can't ask for anything better in a leader than what we have in Speaker John Burns. You know, I said it after I got back from, you know, taking a week off at the John David's birth, and I think the house and all of my members for the prayers, the support. But I made a comment. It was that year and it was about, you know, we're going through ethics and we were getting a bad rap. You know something? We're a part-time legislature. We're made up of moms and dads, of brothers and sisters, of grandparents, of aunts and uncles and neighbors, of people you see at the grocery store, people you see at church, and all among your communities. We are citizen legislators, but first and foremost, we're just family and ordinary citizens. And we come up here and I think we do an awesome, awesome job because we are civil. And as long as we stay that way and remember that we're citizen legislators, remember family, again, we're going to do what's right for people. There are a lot of people that make this work and it's all the way from the clerk's office and the dedicated staff that keeps us running, especially as we get towards the end of session and things get chaotic. It legislative council to our administrative admins, to the law enforcement officers that keep us safe and to the doorkeepers that greet us every day. They are the folks that make us look good. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention and thank the best house budget office and research team I'd say in the nation. Especially the ladies that helped me in my preparation role of the years. God bless them. They've had the patience of Job and have kept me straight. They are indeed the best and they do so much for us. Chairman Hatchett, thank you for what you've done. No. Hey, they are good, but thank you for what you've done. You've done an awesome job in filling that role as chairman of appropriations. You know, I want to thank my family, the night family, the Harvey family, as we got going through this. Again, it all began with running our marriage. And without them, I don't know if I would have made it that first year, but they've been great. But most of all, I got to thank my wife, my soulmate, my best friend.

It's our, with deep thought, we just want to recognize a Herbert Campbell citizen of St. Simon's Island. World War II vet recently passed away to age of 98. Yes, Army veteran, award three bronze stars. Her being her papa as people knew him was active in the community. He was funny, he was social. I got to meet him as a 98th birthday party for the first time. He was a good man, loved everyone, well, loved by all, long time employee of the Sea Island company. He learned engineering, he was an engineer in the engineering field in World War II, and transferred his knowledge and went to private life doing that. We will miss him, and we just want to say prayers and thoughts for his family and police. Let's have a moment of silence. Thank you. Thank you, Representative.

Representative Carl Gileart is recognized now for the afternoon order. Representative Gileart. And friends. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is very rare that we realize history and a pinnacle point in the lives of Georgia and America. And so my brothers and sisters, I'm going to ask if you would focus your attention on the screen. Let me just say this as I'm feeling it. We live in a complex world, racism, hatred, jealousy. I think people in the world fall in one of those classes, hatred. jealousy. Anything more. And if we could read ourselves of those evils and learn to get to talk, teach us, sit down at the table and discuss our problems and work it out. And read ourselves of those. If we could do that, I think this would be a much better world. On yesterday morning, the butterfly took her wings. The passing of the last matriarch of the King family. And if you think about from Dr. Christine Ferris just a couple of months ago, Dexter King just a few weeks to months ago. And now the matriarch, the sister in law of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the wife of Reverend AD King. The speaker might remember this. And I know that I'm bringing it to his attention. And 15 years ago, when I was the president of the Georgia Coastal SCLC, where all the counties I was asked to come to Savagna, Georgia. And Miss Naomi King wanted to come with me. The speaker at the time is representative John Burns. I remember seeing his name on the resolution that recognized her in Scriven County. But more importantly to my family, she has watched my children grow up. And her her kindred spirit has planted a mighty seed in me. And I remember her telling me, she says, Representative Gilyard, I don't worry about anything. She said to me, she said, I want you to sit down. I want to tell you a story about ML. And she began to tell me stories that were not in my history books. That planted a seed. And if you wonder why I walk in the spirit of the coalition of Dr. King, you'll see the coalition represented today. Because that's what Naomi King was about. Her foundation, recognizing her husband, focused on the children. And which recently she went to Columbia. She was international. Countries saw her as a beacon of light. She just recently traveled in her last trip to Columbia, working with children from all over the world. And weeks and weeks ago, I took several members of the Georgia Ladies and Ladies of Black Caucus. And we celebrated her birthday months ago at 92 years young. Recently, through her fall, the fall by grace enabled her to not be able to do the things. But trust and believe, the butterfly head wings. So to Alvita, to Derek, to Bernees, and to Marty, and to the entire King family, and Isaac Ferris, we offer our prayers. And I want you to have this pinnacle moment that this is a pinnacle moment of defining moment in history. And if Naomi King did nothing else, even as she graced this very chambers, she instilled about the beloved community. And my brothers and sisters, thank you for the opportunity that you've graced her. And to let her know that in this chambers, we represent the beloved community. Would you just pause for a moment of silence? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, my brothers and sisters. Thank you, members, for your attention. Thank you, Representative, for your remembrance.
