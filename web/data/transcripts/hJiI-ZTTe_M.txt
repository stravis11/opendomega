Chairman Bill Yerda. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's a pleasure to meet to welcome Pastor Lee Smith and his family to the house chamber today. Pastor Lee has been the pastor of Lee's Burg United Methodist Church for the past 10 years. And when you've been a Methodist church 10 years, they like you, don't they? Prior to that, he served as pastor in Plains and Preston, Georgia, and also served as a Methodist youth director in Douglas, Georgia. He and his wife, Christa, which is here. Actually, I think y'all are settled by your 22nd anniversary this week. Is that right? Congratulations. They also have three children, Micah, Natalie, and Ben. And Micah, Natalie, you're here with us today. Welcome to the people's house. Pastor Lee has a heart for public service. He serves on the board of the United Methodist Children's home in Macon. And the Lee's Burg United Methodist Church also serves over 3,000 people a year through its food pantry and its clothes, closet, ministries. Thank you, Pastor Lee, for joining us today. And we're just honored to have you here representing Southwest Georgia and being with us. Speaker Burns, Chairman Yurda, and all of you distinguished men and women. It is such a blessing and honor to be here, to be a part of this time together. It is also an honor for my hometown, Lee's Burg, and the church there. And I'm just so thankful for their support. I'm all the different folks who help me and support me and encourage me. I've gotten thousands of emails that feels like this morning saying, we're praying for you. Don't embarrass us, so I hope I don't do that. It's exciting to be here this morning. It's also really a privilege to be here with my family. I will never forget the day that Chris and I were going to, the doctor, to find out, to see our first sonogram of our child. And so we get to the doctor's office and it had taken us a while to kind of start our family. And so we go in and the picture comes up and I see the picture and I'm like, something's different there. What's going on with this picture. And he started laughing and he said, what do you see, Lee? And I said, well, I'm no doctor, but it looks like there's two in there. And he said, that's right, there's two. So Mike and Natalie are twins. They don't look like it, but they are. And at 17, it's just a privilege to have them here. Being a pastor, it is a blessing for me to meet different people. And one of the things I've always tried to encourage myself to be is a student. Always to learn. And so I'm trying to always to learn from people that I've met. Whether that's from President Carter and we're praying for his family there in Plains as I got to know them. Or the men and women that we serve in our food pantry. I'm always trying to learn from these folks as I get to know them and as they become a part of my life. And so one of the things I've been learning here recently is what it means to be a shepherd. I've got a retired man in my church, lay leader, Larry Powell. He is a goat farmer. And he goes to his farm in Parrot, Georgia every day. And I get a chance to go with him on Fridays my day off. And I learn about goat farming and I learn about farming. And it's just been a wonderful kind of time in Leesburg learning these things. But I've learned some things about shepherding that are true. First, I've learned that sheep really do know the shepherd's voice. It's an amazing thing. He lets these goats out. They're free to go wherever they want to go on his farm. They could leave his farm if they wanted to. But the moment he yells at them beeps his horn, they all come running back. And then he goes back back into the confound of the pin that he keeps them in. I've also learned the shepherd does leave the 99 to find the one. If he does a head count, there's one missing. We get in the truck. We go looking for that one. Because it has value and it has worth. And then finally, just this last Friday, I learned that the shepherd never gives up on even the smallest. And most insignificant seeming animals that he cares for. We got to Larry's farm and a mother had had triplets. One was in its own placenta. The two were in their own placenta and they were very small. I'm telling you, some of the smallest goats I've ever seen. And so he left them on Thursday. When we got back there, he thought that one of them would be gone past and the other one he didn't know. And so when we got there, these two little were still alive. But we also found out that the mother had rejected them. Every time this little goat would try to go to the mother to get its milk, she would kick it away. Nature can be cruel sometimes, but because it seems like nature knows, right? Nature knows when something is weak and so nature kicks it aside. And so we were sitting there and we're about ready to leave and he had tried to give it its vitamins and all these other things. And so as we started it back away, he said, I can't leave them. And so he got out and we got those little goats, put them in a pen. And even though it was inconvenience, even though he was going to have to be up all night giving these goats the bottle, he took them home with them. Why is this important? Because friends, we're all shepherds. I shepard the Leesburg United Methodist Church. Each one of you shepard your districts that you've been appointed to. And together as a house, you helped shepard the state of Georgia. This is important. First Peter 5-2-3 says, Shepard the flock of God among you, exercise oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily according to the will of God, and not for sort of gain, but with eagerness. Peter is also the one who denied Christ three times, remember. And he's also the one after the resurrection where Jesus comes to him and says, Peter, three times, do you love me? Finally, Peter says, you know that I love you. You know all things. And Jesus responds, each time he asks the question, he asks, in other words, he says, 10 My Lams, Shepard My Sheep, 10 My Sheep. In other words, Shepard the people that I've given you. Today you are shepherds. Today if you're a teacher here, I notice we got some young folks up there. You're a shepherd. God puts us in different places to shepherd people in different ways. The question is, how will we do that? Will we shepherd them? Will we put them first? Will we go between the aisles and join together and know to put them first? Because that's what we've been called to do, right? And so that's where I am, and that's what my heart is telling me. Shepherds are people. They don't agree with you. Sometimes you don't agree with them. But never, ever forget why you're here. You're here to shepherd. And how do we do this? We watch the best shepherd of all, right? The one who did leave the 99 to find the one. The one who does know every one in his flock. The one that even if it's small and seemingly insignificant matters to him. The one that gave his life for all of his sheep. Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. This is the one that we follow. This is the one we try to be like as we all learn to be better shepherds. And the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you so much for this opportunity. I thank you so much for these men and women that you've called to this place. It is no accident or chance that they're here. Well, what I just pray that you would allow each one of them to see the shepherds that they are. I pray that you would encourage them. I pray that you would strengthen them. I pray that you would give them wisdom, Lord, as they follow after you. Bless this house. Bless the speaker. Bless all of these representatives here today. Lord, we just thank you so much for this time. And your amazing name we pray. Amen. We join them now in the pledge. I pledge to thee, Jesus Christ, of the United States of America. And to the word public, for which it stands, for the nation under God in indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Pastor Smith. For helping encourage us all to be good shepherds. We appreciate that and a great devotion. Clerks will unlock the doors. Members, you may join Pastor Smith and the South, any room for a photo. Thank you. You can please. House will come to order. Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information Aritz, is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, your Committee on Information Aritz has read the... Excuse me. As read the... Your Committee on Information Aritz has read the journals from the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And on another note, Mr. Speaker, this is something that goes back to my childhood and I've heard it many, many times. And I've said it to myself many times over the years. Be the best you can be with what you have where you are. You've turned out pretty well there, Chairman Tarvan. I think you've done a good job of following that admonition. Chairman Tarvan, the chair of the Committee on Information Aritz reports that the journal of the previous legislative day has been read and found to be correct. Is there any objection to dispense with the reading of the journal, the chair here is none, the reading of the journal is dispensed with, is there any objection to the confirmation of the journal, chair here is none, and the journal is confirmed.

This time we'll recognize Representative Carlton Howard, representative Howard to introduce our Doctor of the Day. Members, please give your attention to the introduction of the Doctor of the Day. He's given his time to be with us. Representative Howard, you're recognized to introduce our Doctor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It gives me a great privilege today to introduce our Doctor of the Day. He is Dr. Chad Array. He's been here before, but not to read, join the obstetrics and gynecology faculty in 2006 of the Medical College of Georgia. After graduate education at the College of Charleston, he graduated from the Medical University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy. He practiced retail pharmacy in Akin, South Carolina and Hospital pharmacy at the USC Children's Hospital in Charleston, South Carolina, before returning to the Medical School. He graduated from the MUSC College of Medicine in 2002. Dr. Ray is a graduate of the Medical College of Georgia of Stetrics and Gynecology Residency Program, where he was administrative chief resident. Dr. Ray is the resident's program director for the department. His interests include maternal mortality, global women's health initiatives, and workforce solutions for women's health. I'm further excited about Dr. Ray being here today because I just discovered that he delivered my niece a few years ago, who's now in high school at the Lucillane High School. She's 16 years old and because of what he did for her, she's flourishing well. I introduce you to Dr. Chad Ray. Thank you, Representative Howard, Mr. Speaker and distinguished members of the House. It's an honor for me today to serve once again as the doctor today in this people's house. On a personal note, when the late representative Wayne Howard introduced me three years ago, he made it very clear that I have a special place in their family, and I want to make it clear that your family has a special place in my heart as well. Educating doctors is, there's an extreme weight on the soil, and I want to be clear that that is a burden shared by both the faculty who educate those doctors, but also you all in this body. The decisions that are made in this chamber are equally as important as the decisions that I make and how I teach at the bedside in the operating room on labor and delivery and in the office. So I want to thank you for all that you do, and I also want you to all share in the pride of the amazing doctors we put out in this state. I certainly hope that we continue to do so and even at a higher rate. So with that, I'll just say thank you so much, and I'm very honored to serve today. Thank you. Dr. Ray, we appreciate you being here. Take care of us, and we agree with you on your mission. We want to take care of all those that we need to take care of, and thank you for your work at the Medical College of Georgia. Members, we want to pause and recognize two former members, not one, but two former members and great members. I might add that members of this House have owned the floor today. My dear friend, Pam, representative Pam Dickerson, Pam, where are you? There she is. Good to see you, Pam. And also another dear friend representing Nikki Randall. Representative Randall, great to have you all. We're going to move on to morning orders. We have a whole slew of morning orders we're going to take up. You know what a slew is? It's a bunch of them. So we're going to take up morning orders. I'm going to limit y'all to one minute, and then we have some other very important business that we're going to take care of. So some of you who may have a morning order may have to do it as an afternoon order. So, but first, I'm going to recognize the gentleman. Here he is. Chairman Ron Stevens, the dean of the Savannah delegation, who has a morning order and Mr. Chairman and friends, you don't have a time limit to do what you need to do.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome, Representative Westbrook. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I want to, uh, I want to tell you all a little bit about St. Patrick's Day real briefly. But we really want to recognize some very special guests today. But before I do that, I got the talk into my seat made about St. Patrick's. There's some things you may not know. Many of you may not know that St. Patrick was actually British. He was enslaved by the Irish. Later, found his way back home. The came a priest and made it his mission in life to convert the, the, the Irish to Christianity. He is indeed the patron saint of Ireland. And he is very, very important. It's a very important day to the community of Savannah. I want to recognize and if all of you will stand today, we have with us our parade committee for this year. A parade that is a hundred and ninety nine years old, folks. 1824. And I want to welcome our grand marshal, Mr. George Schwartz and his son, George Schwartz the fourth. Wait, raise your hands, guys.

But it was started with Isolene Campbell with 45 women more than a century ago. The Junior League of Atlanta remains committed to volunteerism, developing the potential of women and improving our community through effective action and leadership of trained volunteers.

We're very proud of you and the work that you do and we're proud to have you in the House chamber today. A couple of folks I'd like to introduce that really need no introduction, but I'm going to do it anyway. A gentleman who's becoming a fast friend didn't know him all that well, but he's becoming a fast friend. I have great respect for the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Georgia. Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones. Let's welcome Lieutenant Governor Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. He's doing a great job of leading the Senate and we appreciate what you're doing there. Another dear friend, and I can say that about the Senate, a lot of dear friends in the Senate, he's a President Pro Tem of the Senate from down in the Macon area, I believe. I believe that is. President Pro Tem of the Senate, John Kennedy. Let's recognize him of John Kennedy. With a great honor, a great privilege. I want to recognize the Pro Tem of the House of Representatives. She had to step out. But the Pro Tem of the House is Representative Jen Jones, and we're so proud of her and the work she does on behalf of the people of Georgia. And we understand she had to step out. She was called out unexpectedly, so we'll see her in a short term. And we'll report to her on the State of the Judiciary when it's presented. I guarantee, I'll let her know what was said. She'll be looking forward to it, no doubt, Ms. Chief Justice. Our special guest of the day, the judges of the Court of Appeals, if you'd all stand the judges of the Court of Appeals. Thank you for your service. Now the Supreme Court justices of the State of Georgia, if you'll please stand so we can show you our gratitude for your service and your work. A distinguished group, thank you for your service. Now they said I could introduce anyone I wanted to and I'd take a little while to introduce all the people I'd like to introduce in this body. But I'm going to take just a moment to introduce a special guest. The lady that's put it with me for 46 years, my dear wife, Dale Burns. If y'all would make Dale feel welcome. The great wisdom of Chief Justice said it probably feels like a lot longer than that to you. I'm sure it does. Now colleagues, for purposes of an introduction, let me introduce our featured guest of the day. Our honored guest who would deliver the state of the judiciary address. No stranger to this chamber, he's a former member, having been first elected in the year of 2000. He also served previously in elected office as a judge on the Court of Appeals of Georgia and as a superior court judge for the Wakecross Judicial Circuit. Like me, he too is a proud alumnus of Georgia Southern College. He went on to receive his jurisdoctess from the Mercy University School of Law. He served as a member of the Georgia Special Counsel on Criminal Justice Reform in 2011 and did great work there. And as co-chairman of the Georgia Criminal Justice Reform Council from 2012 to 2018, been affitted this entire state on his work. He currently serves as a member of our Georgia Behavioral Health Reform and Innovation Commission, and we're indebted to him for his service in all of these areas. It's here that I'll depart from his standard biography just for a second to tell you this. He's a friend and a leader who cares deeply about the future of this state and his citizens. While he has devoted his professional career to the legal system, his heart is devoted to helping those indeed clearly evidence about what I just told you. I consider it a great honor and a high privilege to welcome him and his colleagues of the judiciary to our House Chamber today. Please join with me in welcoming the Chief Justice of the State of Georgia, Michael P. Boggs. Thank you. Good morning and thank you for that warm welcome. Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker Burns, President Protein McKinney, Speaker Protein Jan Jones, Members of the General Assembly, Constitutional Officers, Presiding Justice Pinson and my colleagues on the Supreme Court of Georgia, Chief Judge Rickman, Vice Chief Mercere and my friends on the Georgia Court of Appeals and other judges who are here with us today in my fellow Georgians. I'm honored to return to this esteemed chamber, the People's House, where I began my career in elective public service to now present to you all as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia, my report on the state of Georgia's judiciary. I'd like to start with a point of personal privilege to express my most sincere gratitude to many of you here today for your steadfast friendship and support over these many years of my service. I also want to thank you all in this chamber for your ongoing cooperation and support for our judiciary that has enabled all of us in the state judicial system to fulfill our constitutional obligations as the third branch of government. As I said earlier this year in hearings before the joint budget committees in January, this body has regularly shown that you understand and you appreciate the work of our state courts and that you recognize the significant impact our work has on society and our democracy. It is my hope that this collaborative working spirit will continue to improve, strengthen and protect the administration of justice in Georgia and in doing so will uphold the rule of law a goal I know we all share. Of the past three years of unprecedented challenges the state's judiciary has consistently demonstrated its commitment to faithfully serving the citizens of Georgia. We remain strong and resolutely focused on the rule of law and administering justice swiftly, impartially and independently foundational tenets of our democracy and our system of justice. As a result I'm pleased this morning to report to you that the state of Georgia's judiciary is strong. This strength is found however in the midst of challenges. This past year has been a period of hard work and significant recovery. Courts at every level in Georgia throughout this state are emerging from the fog of the COVID-19 pandemic only to be confronted with new challenges presented by truly crushing caseloads. And despite the best efforts and hard work of our courts to stay as functional as possible, within the bounds of health and law many courts across this state have accrued a backlog of cases both civil and criminal. These all resulted from significant delays and proceedings through the last several years. As my predecessors former Chief Justice as Harold Melton and David Namius reported to this body before, the backlog could indeed take years to resolve. As they mentioned, unlike the Braves baseball games that were scratched from the calendar in 2020 never to be played again, the legal needs of Georgia's citizens continued during the pandemic and in often cases worsened. Business disputes, custody battles, resolving the unsettled estates of departed loved ones, those things did not stop simply because of a virus. They demand resolution then and now. But make no mistake, the numbers in certain parts of Georgia are truly astounding and the resolution of these caseloads will not be easy. Let me offer up just one example. In Fulton County where we currently sit, there are more than 4,000 pending indicted felony cases. And it's critical to note that the number of pending felony criminal cases in Fulton County that were indicted during COVID is substantially lower than the number of people arrested for felonies during that same period of time. As a result, in Fulton County, in addition to the indicted felony case load, there are almost 14,000 unindicted felony cases currently pending. Now Fulton County is not alone. These high case volumes are present in some other jurisdictions throughout the state as well. But it's critical for you to remember that criminal cases, unlike their civil counterpart, present significant implications on the constitutional rights of the accused. They post serious speedy trial issues. And importantly, they affect the families of victims who are awaiting justice and closure. Fortunately, Governor Camp has been responsive to the plea of our courts across Georgia for help. And during his first term, you're aware that he committed $96 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds to state courts and prosecutors, another 14 million to public defenders to address and focus on the remediation of serious felony cases. That funding has been used for temporary space. Our courts have used it to rent temporary courtroom space to hold jury selections or to hold jury trials. That money's been used to hire temporary personnel, including assistant prosecutors and to pay for senior judges. And importantly, those funds have been used to upgrade and modernize courtroom IT equipment. It's especially important for our courts that are continuing to use remote proceedings. And I'm pleased to report those funds are helping. After seeing a 36.3% increase in serious violent felony cases between 2019 and 2021, the circuits that received our grants have reported to us a nearly 12% decrease in those pending cases between the end of 21 and August of 22. In fact, they've seen a similar decrease among all felony cases beyond just serious violent felonies and all cases in general. In addition to those pending felony cases, the number of jury trials is also recovering across this state. After seeing a 75% drop in felony jury trials between 2019 and 2020, our courts saw an increase in these trials of more than 182% by the end of 2021 and a nearly 14% in jury trials increased just during the first eight months of 2022. But to be sure, there is still a long way to go. But our trial judges, and I want to really lift them up, our trial judges are demonstrating incredible leadership and tackling problems throughout our 50 judicial circuits. And to our trial judges, I say this. Thank you. Thank you for all that you are doing and you continue to do despite challenges not seen for generations and challenges, frankly, that we were not prepared to address. We know that you are on the front lines in the fight for the rule of law and you should know we all depend on you. Your efforts thus far have reflected well, I think, on the judiciary. They make us all very proud. So thank you. But our work continues. The ARPA Committee that I chair is continuing its hard work in implementing circuit applications for grants for calendar year 23. And based on what we've seen, you should know that the needs throughout your jurisdictions are great. We have awarded for calendar year 23, 39 million in funding to 37 judicial circuits for their efforts to remediate their case backlogs. On behalf of judges throughout Georgia to this body, I say thank you and we are very grateful for this funding, both to you and to Governor Kim. Unfortunately though, as is often the case, we've learned that money alone will not fix the problem. As you all know, workforce challenges have permeated nearly every sector of Georgia's economy, from private industry to health care. And you should know our system of justice, particularly our criminal justice system, is not immune to those challenges. Governor Kim, and you have made workforce one of your primary areas of focus for Georgia, and I want you to know that the courts share this focus, particularly given how workforce challenges in the judicial system continue to impede our efforts to address case backlogs. As you know, for a court system to operate effectively and justly, we need every component at full capacity. That means we need judges and prosecutors, we need public defenders and court reporters, we need clerks and interpreters in courtroom security. Without any one of those critical components, the judicial system simply doesn't work. And to be clear, our judicial system is having enormous challenges throughout the state and finding the workers it needs to fill these critical positions that justice demands. For example, the Proscening Attorney's Council, which supports, as you know, the DA's offices in each of our 50 judicial circuits, reports that it is experiencing its highest number of job vacancies and has the highest level of turnover in recent history. In December, just two months ago, PAC had 43 unfilled positions statewide. Compare that to just 11 unfilled positions in July of 20. You all know Pete Scandalakis, the executive director of PAC, and he sums it up like this, and I quote, our criminal justice system is labor intensive. If we have any vacancies in any of these positions, we have a standstill in cases. And before you know it, 20 cases becomes 40 and 40 cases becomes 80. We need experienced people, in quote, Pete Trident. To make matters worse, the problem is especially acute in areas outside of metro area and in rural parts of this state. Let me give you an example. In Daughtery County, Albany, there are only four full-time prosecutors. There have been at least twice as many in the past. The circuit received ARPA grant funding in 2022 to move through its backlog of 10,000 felony pending cases. 2,500 of those 10,000 felonies involved serious file felonies, like murder, rape, armed robbery, and certain sex offenses. Really, the kinds of cases where it's clearly in the public's best interest to have your most experienced prosecutors working. However, and despite that significant funding, the DA was unable to find enough lawyers interested in filling those open prosecutor positions. Meanwhile, and not surprisingly, the number of pending criminal cases grows larger. And so does the wait for defendant's charge, but not convicted of crimes who are sitting in local jails awaiting throughout this state in Dytman or Trial. And of course, as you know, and our system punishment is supposed to follow conviction, not preceded. And this pre-trial delay causes other problems, too. While the cost of building up our legal workforce requires a significant financial investment, to be sure it does, it may ultimately cost less than allowing defendants to sit in jail. In Daughtery County, Chief Judge Willie Lockett, my very good friend, estimates that there are more than 200 pre-trial detainees that have been in jail in Albany for two or more years. Pre-trial. At a cost of roughly $18,000 per individual, it has cost the county nearly $3.7 million to house those detainees. And of course, as I've mentioned, workforce challenges aren't exclusive just to prosecutors. Defendants accused of crime who cannot afford their own attorneys, also have a right to legal representation. But public defenders offices are also having a very difficult time recruiting and retaining lawyers. Several months ago, David Lipscomb, who chairs the Gwyneth County's Indigent Defense governing committee, told local reporters that before the pandemic, Gwyneth County had about 130 lawyers for defendants who couldn't afford one. During the pandemic, that 130 capacity dropped to about 80. In response, Gwyneth County, unlike a lot of other counties, but Gwyneth County added $1 million to its Indigent Defense budget to help recruit more lawyers. But not every county throughout the state has access to those kinds of funds. To help recruit needed public defenders, you all have been a help. You recently passed legislation bringing parity to the starting salaries of public defenders and prosecutors and this helps. And that parity is a tool, I think, that our state can use to recruit needed public defenders. But significant challenges still persist. In the midst of these challenges, though, and I really think it's important to recognize here, the hard and often thankless work of our prosecutors and public defenders that we do have that are in the trenches in your respective communities. Our system truly depends on you doing your job and doing it well, and you've done just that, and we appreciate you beyond compare. Of course, it's not just in the criminal arena where workforce challenges are manifest. As you know, there is no right to counsel for litigants in civil cases, like divorces and child custodians and eviction proceedings. Where, if you've ever been acquainted with any of those proceedings, you know the consequences are often enormous. 67 of 159 counties in Georgia have 10 or few licensed practicing lawyers. Even worse, seven counties in Georgia, all rural, have no licensed attorneys at all. I think you would all agree with me that access to justice is a bedrock of our nation's judicial system. Yet the basic right of access is denied to many during their most dire life challenges. Now, some of you might think that fewer lawyers is a good thing. I won't ask for a vote, Mr. Speaker. Indeed, though, I also recognize that even in this body, the General Assembly has far fewer lawyers now than when I served over two decades ago. As you all well know, the wheels of justice depend on lawyers. And truthfully, you may not think much of lawyers until you need one, but I'd suggest to you that there are many people in this state that need lawyers. To me, Georgia should be a national thought leader in promoting access to justice for its citizens, all 11,000 of them. And I expect you're going to hear more from our court and our access to justice committee on these issues in the near future. To be sure, though, I'm very proud of how our judiciary and our judges are leading and ensuring the state of Georgia's judiciary remains strong and resilient. All across Georgia, I hope you'd be proud to know that our court's judges and legal partners are looking for innovative solutions to complex and unique problems. Along the way, they're improving the administration of justice for our citizens. Let me offer just a few examples of judiciary-led programs in our state. In juvenile court in Tifton, Judge Rinder Hurd's courtroom was an early adopter of remote conference technology. He employed state-of-the-art devices to keep cases and ultimately the lives of children from Stalin. As the pandemic in Tifton has receded, Judge Hurd has kept this high-tech setup like some of the other judges have across the state so that he can continue presiding over hearing's and case reviews in a more efficient way. Now, the consequence is that, for instance, a psychologist living in Columbus or an ER doctor in Atlanta who's called on to testify in one of those cases doesn't have to drive the hours it takes from here to Tifton County. For a lawyer who is also a working mom doesn't have to ask for a continual of her case when she's at home with her own sick child. Our children who, as you know, are at the hearts of all of these cases and may well be placed in most of them and homes hours away from that four-county circuit in Tifton, can through this technology still participate in their hearings. And they can be aware of decisions that are affecting their futures all without missing full days of school. These are real scenarios that Judge Hurd has seen and resolved with his court's adoption of technology. Another innovation is occurring in Chatham County, where juvenile court Judge Roxanne Formy has founded the state's first ever treatment court for minor victims of human trafficking. Appropriately called HOPE Court, which stands for Healing Opportunities Through Positive Empowerment, this unique court focuses on addressing the specific needs of youth and families involved in sex and labor trafficking. Program aims to strengthen them and their communities by providing them with the support resources and tools they need in order to recover and lead healthy and productive lives. In addition, you should all be proud to hear that Georgia is one of the states taking a lead in expanding services to veterans, a population that has been historically underserved in this nation through our criminal justice systems. Fortunately, Georgia judges like Cobb, Judicial Circuit Judge Rob Leonard are leading the charge. I also have the pleasure of serving on the Council on Criminal Justice's Veterans Justice Commission. That is a commission that is chaired by former United States Defense Secretary and U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel. It includes former Defense Secretary and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta. We've been working over the last year to identify really the unique needs of veterans who find themselves involved in our criminal justice system. And we've been searching for solutions that can restore their lives and lead them on a path of being healthy productive citizens. Through our studies, we found that even though nationwide public safety officials in some places and prosecutors and courts have indeed modified their structure.

and objectives when addressing military veterans, only a fraction of state courts have actually established really specific justice involved and veterans focused interventions. You'd be proud to know that Georgia though is leading and meeting the challenge. Through veterans courts in Georgia, eligible nonviolent defendants are diverted away from our prisons and into highly supervised data-driven treatment programs. These programs are aimed at addressing their underlying issues. They create support and a network for success and stability. And as a result, and not surprisingly, you would not be surprised to find that the recidivism rates for these high-risk but nonviolent veterans are much lower. According to data from the Council of Accountability Court judges in Georgia, veterans courts have among the lowest recidivism rates with just 18% of graduates being re-arrested for a felony offense within three years. By contrast, the recidivism rate for a non-veteran, but similar individual who instead went to prison, that recidivism rate hovers between 60 and 81%. And if that's not enough to get your attention, these veterans courts also save taxpayer dollars. Veterans courts yield a savings of more than $13,000 per participant to the state while costing less than $6,000. Last year alone, our veterans courts in Georgia served 337 military veterans throughout the state. Those courts produce real savings. Savings both budgetarily and in live saved. On behalf of our many dedicated Accountability Court judges across Georgia, thank you for your continued commitment and thank you all for continuing to support Accountability Court judges in this state. Beyond these examples of judges improving access to justice, our state judges are also fully engaged in improving the administration of justice for many of our citizens and our state that have serious mental illness. A few points to highlight the issue. In the United States, one out of 33 adults isn't behind bars. That's one in 33 adults is incarcerated in the US. You might be surprised to learn that in Georgia, the number is one in 13. Since 1980, in Georgia, the number of people going to jail has tripled and the length of Senate has increased by 166%. I believe that much of this is attributable to deficiencies in our mental health service delivery systems. Nationwide, nearly a fifth of jail admissions involves a person with serious mental illness, a fear. We also know that people in the United States with mental illness are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than hospitalized. They're 19 times more likely to find a bed in the criminal justice system that at a state civil hospital. And while those with mental illness in the United States and in Georgia are traditionally arrested for fairly minor offenses, often like criminal trespass or loitering, empirical data demonstrates that once incarcerated, this population tends to stay in jail four to eight times longer than their counterparts at seven times the cost. In our own Department of Corrections, the mental health population has grown 100% in the last two decades, such that now in Georgia and at the Department of Corrections, a full 25% of the entire incarcerated population is identified as having a mental health issue. And on top of the really enormous moral and fiscal impacts that I've just highlighted, public safety is also adversely affected because we know in the United States that just a day or two in jail for this population increases their recidivism rates by 40%. Thankfully, Governor Kemp and all of you have recognized the importance of addressing this very significant problem in creating and supporting the work of the governor's behavioral health reform and innovation commission, a commission on which I serve. Your efforts have served, have ensured that Georgia continues to lead the country and thoughtfully and responsibly addressing this issue. Sincerely, I truly thank all of you for your overwhelming support last year and this year of the recommendations of the commission. And I trust that you recognize that your efforts reflect well on the priorities of our state. I also want to take a moment to acknowledge on this particular issue, the critical leadership of late speaker David Rostin. And thank speaker John Burns for continuing speaker Rostin's legacy in this regard. Thank you. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. We wouldn't be here without speaker Rostin, and I'm just so thoroughly thankful for my friendship with him and for his leadership. I also want to especially recognize and thank Judge Amanda Murcia, Judge Brenda Weaver, Judge Kathy Gosland, Judge Brian Amaro, and Judge Sarah Harris for their commitment to taking time and the effort necessary to assist the Behavioral Health Commission and the subcommittee on which I chair to improve access to justice for this population and to improve outcomes. Another way our court leaders are working to ensure that our citizens have meaningful access to justice is through our Judicial Council's Committee on Court Interpretors. They recently completed reviewing and updating the rules that govern court interpreting in our state. Of course, as you know, as George's population is becoming increasingly diverse, it is imperative that our state courts continue to be accessible to everyone. I particularly like to recognize my colleague, Justice Carlo Longman, Millen, and Suani Municipal Court Judge Norman Quadra for their efforts to lead this work. Thank you. Thank you. In addition to these tremendous examples, I think of Judiciary-led leaderships and initiatives, let me lift up an initiative in which one of our legal partners is also helping some of George's most vulnerable children. Through a medical legal partnership, our state's legal practitioners, lawyers, are assisting children with significant health risks and chronic illnesses. In 2004, Atlanta Legal Aid pioneered a health law partnership known as HILP, where they stationed lawyers in each of the hospitals run by children's health care of Atlanta, and they established a law clinic at Georgia State University, with the purpose to assist low-income families with legal problems that affect the health and well-being of these medically fragile children. In fact, through the work of these medical legal partnerships, five children in Georgia have received new hearts when they otherwise would not have been eligible. Help lawyers work. Thank you. APPLAUSE These help lawyers work with doctors and social workers and nurses while these children are hospitalized in order to provide services for these children who are already, of course, receiving care. They intervene to address underlying conditions that harm the children's health, such as poor housing conditions which can magnify chronic illnesses like asthma or sickle cell disease. They seek to assist to secure necessary special education services for a developmentally disabled children in Georgia. They facilitated custody for infants with terminal cardiac conditions that allowed them to be placed in supportive home environments and in turn be eligible for these life-saving heart transplants. And in fact, during 2020 alone, these lawyers worked on more than four, 640 cases serving 387 unique clients. Their work resulted in savings of $1.2 million in housing, education, family law, insurance, and public benefits. I hope you will continue to find ways to support this program, this initiative, and these lawyers in this critical work supporting Georgia's most vulnerable children. Before I wrap up, and that will be soon, I promise I try to end on a note that I hope you can all appreciate. If you've ever been in our courtroom or you've ever watched the live stream of our oral arguments, you see engraved in the granted above our courtroom, above our bench, a Latin phrase that is essentially translated to this, let justice be done though the heavens may fall. We're reminded of that phrase every time we enter our courtroom. To me, and I hope to you, that phrase uniquely encompasses the duty of judges, singularly encompasses the duty of judges. Judges are called upon to interpret the law and the Constitution. It's not our duty, nor should it be, to change the law of the Constitution. We don't render decisions based on our own desires or our own bent of will, but rather we follow what the statutes and the Constitution require. And... In doing so, we respect and appreciate the separation of powers and the awesome responsibility you all have as legislators to craft and shape the laws of our state. This is the embodiment of the separation of powers, and this is the rule of law. However, underpinning the rule of law is the safety of our judges. Our judicial system depends on judges deciding cases without fear. This includes fear for their personal safety or the safety of their families. The Chief Justice of the United States has made court security the centerpiece of his recent annual report, where he stated, and I quote, the law requires every judge to swear an oath to perform his or her work without fear of favor, but we must support judges by ensuring their safety. A judicial system cannot and should not live in fear, unquote. I have the pleasure of serving as Chair of the Judicial Council of Georgia, and I want to give a voice to judges all across our state who have an interest in this issue. And so you can expect that judicial security will be an area of focus as this year progresses. And in fact, just last month, I'm proud of our court for creating a new judicial council standing committee on judicial security that will be chaired by my good friend and colleague, Justice Sean L. and LaGroula. That committee will be focusing on security challenges to Georgia's judges, particularly those challenges outside the courthouse. I'm aware of ongoing efforts by the General Assembly to address this issue this year. I appreciate that effort, and I hope you know that you can expect some further recommendations from our committee for your possible consideration next year. Your interest in this issue is really underpinning the entire rule of law in our state, and I'm so appreciative for what you are doing to address it. As I close, let me just simply say this, I'm very optimistic about the year ahead for the state judiciary. Our courts are making significant progress in moving cases, in improving access to justice, in improving the administration of justice, and instead, vastly upholding the rule of law. Thank you again, Mr. Speaker, for inviting me to speak on behalf of the Supreme Court, as well as on behalf of Georgia's judicial branch this morning. I wish you all a productive balance of the session. May God bless you and your families, and may God bless the great state of Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, our Chief Justice, thank you, Justice Boggs, for informing all of us to ensure that we know the facts about our justice system in Georgia. Two more comments. Georgia is the best place to live, work and play. I like that play in this nation, but one of those reasons is because of our justice system. It's the dedicated judges that I see in front of me, justices, and the judges around this state that make it just that. A great place to live where you feel comfortable that justice will be served. And I'm so proud to have invited you all here today and have our presentation on the state of the judiciary. And one last comment, you have the heart and intellect of a judge. It's no doubt about that, but you have the heart of a compassionate man individual that wants and is serving all of the people of Georgia. And we love you and appreciate you. If I could say that about justice. At this time, I'll ask the doorkeeper to escort the Supreme Court justices and the judges of the Court of Appeals from the chamber. The majority leader of this house, leader of this house, leader of this house, has moved that this joint session be dissolved. All those in favor of the motion will say aye. All those opposed say no. The eyes clearly have it. There's no doubt. And this joint session is thereby dissolved. Members will please take your seats. Members please take your seats. Members will please take your seats. We're going to continue. We have a couple of morning orders we did not get to. But to my colleagues in the house, I know how this works. Sometimes you get the blame and sometimes you get the acclaim, right? But I want to share that with y'all. Chief Justice Boggs just acknowledged this house a few minutes ago. He called my name, but it was this house that did exceptional work last year. Speaker Ralston and would represent Evolver and represent Jones to work. Y'all are doing. They were all doing when it comes to addressed mental health issues in our state along with compassionate people like the Chief Justice. Let's give all our sales a hand here. We'll complete those elegant remarks by recognizing representative L Williams and chairman deloge. If he were to come to him, he needs and we're checked. He needs company. He needs shopper owning representative Williams is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Always good to be able to share with you, but this morning is particularly good. If I can get a picture, there we go. I want you to have the opportunity to see an unknown hero, but certainly a Georgia hero who happens to be from Liberty County. And unbelievably, his life kind of changed in 1970. His wife went to the hospital to deliver. Unfortunately, he lost the baby. And she had to have blood afterwards. He went to pay for the blood and then told him the blood was donated. He changed his life. In 1972, he became a blood donor. For over 50 years, every 56 days, he gives blood, which amounts to over 30 gallons of blood. He saved a lot of lives. David Clark lives in Fleming, Georgia. And he is truly a Georgia hero. And both the gentlemen, we're and representative deloge, both have relationships with him with the kind permission of the speaker I'd like to yield the remainder of my one hour. To represent a deloge at the will. Just thank you, David, for your friendship over the years and for what you've met.

that Liberty County entered the entire state of Georgia. Thank you. He waves so I'll take the rest of the time. With that, Mr. Speaker, thank you and I yield the will. Wow. Representative Williams, I know you're correct. A true American hero saving lives. And to my thanks and congratulations to all of our fellow men, especially Georgians who are blood donors, is something we should all consider. If you have it, if you've never done it with this plasma or or giving blood, you should consider it. It makes you feel good. We're going to move on now to afternoon orders. Representative Kendrick is recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Donald, your next representative Donald, who has Representative Kendrick right now. Take your time. You're good. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. It is that time of year. Many of you that have been here know what that means. It is time for my annual birthday rant. Because my birthday is in August and I don't get to hear the speaker call out my name and hear everybody stand in a clause. And I don't think it's fair. So if your birthday is outside of the legislative session, stand up, wave your hands so that our colleagues can give us a round of applause. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield a will. That was a good announcement. A good afternoon order. I like it. I'm going to invite Representative Donald here to come down to bring us a very special afternoon order. Before you do, I'm going to ask the clerk of this house to ring the bell. And then I'm going to ask you to explain why he's ringing the bell. If you will, sir, Mr. Clerk. Representative Donald, you is recognized for a very special afternoon order. Thank you. Back in May, we had an experience. A lot of you people here have gone through an experience. We were in a primary and my bride next week will be 42 years. Four days before the primary election, we found out that she had negative three breast cancer. A pretty large aggressive tumor. So with that, the travel and the journey continued to go. 16 chemo treatments, an ultrasound, a lot of prayer from here. And everywhere I went to speak, people came up and said, we're praying for a lane. They didn't care about me. That was okay. They were praying about a lane. With that being said, God is good to show you how good God is. They can't find the tumor. Yesterday, yesterday she was able to ring the bell. And after they went in and looked everywhere, they said, you're cancer free. So praise our Lord. Thank you. Last time I checked, this is a family. And we are proud of a lane and proud for a lane. And thank God for blessing us all, but especially prayers are answered. So thank you members for supporting Representative Donald Hue in the lane. And we just continue to pray that she will remain that way. Representative Reese has recognized for an afternoon order. Representative Teddy Reese. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be joined by Representative Malthus and Representative Frazier colleagues. Today is a very special day in my life. And for me and my family, today is my grandmother's 89th birthday. And I asked my colleagues here to stand with me because she currently resides in Representative Malthus district. And she was born and raised in Representative Frazier district, Burke County. My grandmother didn't get a chance to finish the 10th grade because she was called in by the family and with her parents were sharecroppers. She spent most of her life picking cotton and fields and doing what she had to do to survive. But Mr. Speaker, she was persistent. And she retired from the state of Georgia working 32 years, cleaning floors and beds and toilets for people with disabilities and disabled veterans at Central State Hospital and Millageal Georgia. So today I say happy birthday, grandmother. I love you. You're the best Carolou Harden. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Grandmothers are wonderful. Leader, illustration is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to recognize a dear friend of mine who's here at the Capitol today. Guy, Kamusa, who's the father of Craig, Kamusa, who many of y'all know is here. Guy and I got to know each other is practicing attorneys in Gwinnett County. He has a veteran of the Vietnam War served honorably and got his law license and now works as the attorney assigned to the middle health court in Gwinnett County. So he helps veterans who are going through the middle health court with his experience as a veteran himself. He's a tremendous leader. I know that he's here at the Capitol today walking around with Craig. If you see Guy, please shake his hand and thank him for his service through his country and his state. And thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. That completes afternoon orders. Mr. Claren, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions?
