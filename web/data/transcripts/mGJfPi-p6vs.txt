TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning everybody. Come on in and take seat and we'll call
our meeting to order. Chairman Martin, will you open us with the order prayer please?
Thank you for the stay you've given us today, and thank you for the peace that we feel
when we wake up in the morning.
Thank you for just allowing us to breathe and be thankful for that.
And so many people around the world are having problems and tribulations.
I feel like our days are filled with these days.
that we seek to be unhappy for it really should just grasp on to you and be happy
and we work up in the matter and we appreciate it and have the opportunity to keep this going.
For our state, our country, our watch over us and keep our minds for your life.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
Okay, happy Friday, everybody.
Let's go ahead and get started.
So come on up.
I've been up there we go trying to get you there we go now.
Turned on good morning, Mr. Chairman.
We've got two bills on the blue sheet here.
First one is Senate bill 28, kind of top third of the second page.
This is Lieutenant Governor's red tape rollback bill.
I actually just got off the phone with Chairman Blackman.
He's going to move this bill back to ways and means
and make a change for Department of Revenue.
So I'll be back hopefully next week.
and I can talk more about this at that time.
Second bill I have is Senate bill 140.
And right in the middle of the third sheet,
this allows doctors of automatry
to stock, dispense, and sell medicines
that they can prescribe that affect the eye
or the area around the eye.
Okay, see your question.
Who at part?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator, with respect to SB 208,
How does this not increase bureaucracy
and put more burden on government agencies
to engage in this rule-making process
on a regular basis?
Thank you, Whit, for that question.
We're ultimately incentivizing the deregulation
in government, so over time,
there will hopefully be less rules to enforce within the agencies.
And we just implement a spring cleaning process
with the agencies every four years
and look at the rules and make sure
that they're best serving George.
And so ultimately, the end of this process,
What we think will happen is it will not only be less rules for agencies to enforce,
but those rules will be looked at with an eye towards ultimately deregulating the forces
from government on Georgia business.
So you said this legislation is incentivizing that endeavor is there appropriations to support state employees
with this process in particular given how high the turnover rate of state employees currently are?
And now we don't have any appropriation in this bill.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
We have some.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator, when we talk about deregulating, I just can't help but think about the Department of
Banking and Finance, which is, that's all there.
The entire role is to regulate our financial industries.
How do we deregulate the important job they're doing in that regard?
And that would go on.
I'll worry about it.
Thank you, Chair, for that question.
Did you get to the end of it?
Yes, that's really my concern.
I apologize.
I've really not followed this legislation intently, but there's some things we don't need
to deregulate.
There's five parts of the five core elements of the bill.
The first of which, create something called a small business impact analysis, which I would
say is a cousin to a fiscal note.
allows members of the General Assembly to ask the state auditor to review bills as it relates
to small businesses. Small businesses in the bill get changed from companies with 100 employees
or less to 300 employees or less. And there's insensives, there's really a declaration in current
Georgia law for agencies to try to make those regulations as least burdensome as possible
for small businesses. The second thing that we do is we have an economic impact analysis
It looks at the larger rules that agencies may place,
and we define those in the bill
after an adjustment in committee at bills
that would cost $3 million or more to adhere to,
and we require those to be ratified by the General Assembly.
But specifically, I think to your question,
we have a four-year review period
where the governor will ask agencies every four years
to look through the rules that they have promulgated
and ask a couple of key questions.
One, are they serving the purpose
that they were originally intended to serve?
Two, are they still necessary to serve that purpose?
and three, are they the least burdensome way possible
that the intent of purpose can be complied with?
So ultimately, we're asking these agencies
to do something that all of us do in our businesses
on a pretty regular basis.
And that's some look at what we do
and make sure that it's as efficient as possible.
Okay.
Crypto Evans, did you have a question?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So the author, is there a fiscal note with this bill?
There's not a fiscal note representative.
This is not a bill that has a financial impact.
It's not levying in new tax, it's not changing in new tax.
It has agency directives in it that we think
can be accomplished with existing agency staffing.
But to really do an analysis on this,
not only would you need to look at potential costs,
you need to look at potential savings.
And I'm profiting committee that I don't know how you would
look at the downstream savings both within the agencies
and within the Georgia economy for ensuring
that we have the least regulations possible in the state.
Have you looked at whether the agencies have enough staffing
to do the analysis?
This is a pretty robust amount of analysis
that we're asking them to do.
Was there any concerns raised
or any discussion of potential concerns
about the ability of the agencies to handle this
without additional either oversight
or employees or contractors?
This is the second biennial represented
that we have brought this bill.
So there's been numerous conversations
with Lieutenant Governor's Office,
numerous conversations with myself in multiple agencies.
And we have not had any agency raise or red flag
and say we think this is impossible to comply with.
And so we'll obviously go through the process.
And if the process needs to be tweaked,
we'll be open to doing that.
But really all that we're asking is once every four years
that the agencies look through the rules.
Frankly, I would be hopeful that agencies
will be looking through the rules more often than once
every four years.
But that once every four year cadence essentially
just puts a spring cleaning process in place
where we ask them to look at their causative rules,
if you will, keep the ones that they need
and get rid of the ones that they don't need.
Thank you.
Okay, you don't see any more questions.
Thank you, Senator.
Yes, ma'am, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I've got a few things to talk to y'all about today.
I've already talked to you about Senate Bill five
on the front page regarding prior authorization
and also Senate Bill eight,
which is a department bill about the juvenile court judges.
But the new things I have to talk to you about
are Senate Bill 20,
which provides for a loan program for shelter vets
to go up underneath the existing veterinary education board
in the Department of Agriculture.
And then the next one that I have is on the last page,
page four, that's Senate Bill 213.
And that is an anti-cheating bill as one of my committee chairman who has the bill for me mentioned.
This is about commercial cheating services that offer for money to take your licensing
exam for you, take your online course for you, do your homework, write your essay, et cetera.
This would make that unlawful and it would be a civil penalty through the attorney general's office.
And then there's one that's not on your sheet but came out of committee this morning if you want me to talk about that.
Mr. Chair.
Yes, ma'am.
Go ahead, ma'am.
Senate Bill 160.
It is about reckless stunt driving and it adds the opportunity for an intelligent speed
limiting device to be placed on the vehicle after the second conviction.
The committee amended it and added a section about DUI, the school fees and I'm not as familiar
with the amendment so I'd be happy to come and talk about that later.
Thank you.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, sir.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have Senate Bill 119. It is the exact same language that Chairman
Leveritt had in the House Bill 377. Both bills passed out of both chambers unanimously.
It is just streamlining the process for someone to be able to convert a manufactured home
into real property.
Okay. Thank you, sir. I don't see any questions. Thank you.
Sir, come on in.
Morning, Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen of the committee. The I'll ask for only a
bottom of your first sheet. It's SB 12. It's one of those things that you don't think
much, but a lot of people won't want to know what's going on in their government.
And for that we have an open records request. One of the things that happened this
Like summer early fall, the Supreme Court made a ruling on a contractor that was working
for Georgia Tech that said, okay, he has to comply with an open records request.
I'll never tell you that the Supreme Court didn't do anything but follow what the law
says.
It was a little unclear.
It's always been assumed that open records request went to the government agency, which
the public funds were being expended in, not to contractors.
So in this case, what we're doing is clarifying in the law
that an open records request goes back to the,
whether it be local government or state agency
or whatever the case may be, where the funds are spent.
We're not changing what can be requested.
We're not changing any of the timetables or anything,
just basically making sure that when an open records request
is made, it goes to the state agency or local government
that's expending public funds for that reason.
And with that, you know, it's been kind of interesting
process when it got to the Senate.
The First Amendment Foundation, I had the Georgia Press
Association.
They had some tweaks there, really requested.
We made those tweaks.
They're neutral in the bill.
I've got great response and great support
from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, the Metro Atlanta Chamber,
ACCG and GMA.
I've been very helpful and very supportive in the process.
It's one of those things that I know
when I originally started with the bill,
Governor Kim, and I spoke, and I said,
hey, when I chaired economic development a long time ago,
said, we became the number one state
in the nation to do business.
I want to continue that.
My experience and local government kind of
was what brought me in to bringing this bill to y'all today.
And I'll ask for your favorable consideration.
Okay, as soon as you can.
Thank you, I don't see any questions.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and the Minimums of the Committee.
If you will, on page three, fifth one down, SB 121,
has to do with requiring increased limits for someone
who has had a DUI.
Currently, there's no increasing limits if you've had a DUI.
Our minimum limits in Georgia are 25, 25,
and that has not been increased in 14 years.
what this bill does is on first offense,
they have to increase their limits to 50, 150.
A second offense is 300, 300, 100.
Florida in 2007 increased theirs on first offense
to 100, 350.
I think when we look at what's going on today,
we've got to ask ourselves this 25,000
replace any car that any of us drives.
And for someone who has been convicted of a DUI,
I think there's a requirement
that they need to increase their limits
on that standpoint, so that's what that bill is about.
Thanks, Senator Harvard.
No seeing questions.
OK.
Thanks, sir.
Second bill is on page two.
Midway is SB 46.
And that is government serves the people.
This bill is a service bill.
And I don't know about y'all, but all of us
get calls from constituents on service issues.
This bill sets up GTA as the quarterback
to look at all government agencies on a service issue
and to create what I call a best practices issue.
I'll give you, for instance, I had a call
they pulled yesterday where they call the agency three times
before they got a live person.
When they did get a live person,
the call was transferred to a number that was not connected.
What this would do is allow GTA to set the parameters for us
and just like you deal with Delta Airlines,
they, at the end of the call,
you have a rating capability.
The other thing we think it should be done
is how long you have to wait on hold,
is there other things that GTA can do?
Many of your larger agencies are good at what they do.
They do a excellent job,
but some of the smaller agencies don't have the resources
that they do, and what we see is GTA could take this
and feed this down to where we deserve the people.
That's what this is really about.
It's their money and their services.
There is a physical note on it you'll find attached to it.
I think establishing best practices for every agency
of what they expect.
In a business, you have a bottom line, you have profit.
In a government, you don't have really what is,
what is the bottom line, but it is where we can deal
with good service.
And I think that's what this is really about
is serving the people.
Okay, you have a question for you, Chair and Martin.
Briefly Senator, and I'm on board with what you're
trying to do here in my question.
If I recall GTA's mission when it was originally founded,
I don't know that it's changed,
was to facilitate purchases in the technology area.
That their mission and their edict, if you will,
wasn't to do this.
Does this bill change their operating authority?
It gives them authority over the other issues
that are on the other agencies that are there
to really monitor service, and this is a service issue.
They can help them with technology.
That's still within their purview.
But this is to try to deal with the issue of service
down line and to share resources.
That's the other part.
That was my question.
Originally GTAs, it was to help purchase technology.
Then they got in the business of delivering technology
even though that never changed the statute.
Does this change their mission?
Does not change that.
So we're driving them further out of their original schedule.
That's my point.
I like what you're trying to do.
I just worry about driving them further out of their original meeting.
What we've looked at is this, in the ways they would have a person who would be the lead
for this, NGTA.
We do not want to add any more expense, but then we want to look at what we can do from
an automation standpoint.
What can we track?
What can we do?
And also within this, they are required annually to submit a report across the board for
all the agencies that were monitoring to the legislature and to the governor.
And that's the part that's missing today, is we need to see what our service looked
like, whether it's Delta Airlines, Home Depot, or Chick-fil-A.
They're looking for service that helps them be more profitable.
And I think for government, since we have no bottom line to really hear what's going
on, a service metrics for creative best practices is really what we need to do to serve the people
of Georgia.
Okay, we've got a couple more questions, but you're going to get me in trouble with the
speaker. If we don't get out of here at 9.30, so if you would, let's be as concise with
our questions and our answers as we can. Chair, Leader Heagley, you had a question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to the author of the bill. Can you elaborate on why you all didn't
see fit to allow the GTA, the additional time that they were asking for for implementation?
You're talking about it in the committee meeting correct. Let me say this to you
I've met with them multiple times and the first thing I heard was the day that you heard it in committee
And I'll be honest with you I have a meeting with them this afternoon and that really bothered me is that if you've got
Something with me come to me and we have been working with their people laying this out
And that was the first time we heard it was the day that you heard that in committee and that's a question
I'm going to have with them this afternoon so that I said if you've got a problem let
me know we're providing finance for the person that would be there we're trying to make
this as least expensive as possible but no one's looking really at the service issues and
I'm sure you like me have had constituents calling being able to get licenses being
able to get to someone alive we have 80,000 state employees we don't even know how many
working from home or working here we have no idea and that's one of the things
that I would like to see GTA start I think this is a foundation start is what
it is and it needs to be improved futuristically but it's a start. I appreciate
that answer but the concern is if we're concerned about efficiency I think we
should, and hopefully after your conversation with them today, if it is determined that
they need more time to implement this effectively, I hope you'll be coming back to us with
that.
I would, where it right now goes to 2026, 2027's fine, but I think we need to get something
implemented, and it's like this, my wife, and raising kids always said this, what gets
inspector gets done and that right now I think we need a little bit of inspection to be done.
Jim Powell has a question. I thank the offer. I think that this is something that's needed.
It may be a little bit broad as you got into explaining a lot of things but we've got some state
agencies that as a representative we do a lot of constituent requests and we've got a certain state
agency that it's just absolutely miserable with the amount of calls that we get
because they go, the doors are locked to their offices and they're told to call
a number. They call that number and it may or may not get through. Once they
get through the first thing is we're gonna play CHONHO. Well they sit there for a
period of time and then the phone goes dead. Is this the intent to get into the
weeds on this? Yes, we want to see who is not serving the people. One of
those things I had with GTA I said we need to do after hours because people are at work
don't need to quit their jobs or stop out of their jobs. We could go to seven o'clock
or whatever it is but we need to serve the people that are intent and that's the small
go thank you for this. Okay thank you sir. Okay thank you sir no other questions.
Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, committee of four bills, Senate Bill 17, Ricky and
Alyssa's Law School Security Bill, we presented last couple days, Senate Bill 56.
Georgia's state identification fund, this bill basically is funding public safety and
law enforcement officers that passed away during COVID-19.
This bill has been funded through the FY25 budget that's already passed.
Senate Bill 105 is a veterinarian bill that protects Georgia veterinarians related to telehealth and
other pieces related to their patient, client, relationship, and Senate Bill 110 is a free
range bill.
Okay.
Good job.
No questions.
Thanks, sir.
Senator, come over up.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Committee members.
Bottom of page one, second up is Senate Bill nine.
That's great work by Chairman Brad Thomas here in the House, helping to assist with artificial
intelligence deepfakes.
You've passed that before.
And then on the second page toward the middle is Senate Bill 58 that's transporting a wife saving organs to help save lives in time of meat
Okay, don't see any questions. Thanks senator
Thank mr. Chairman members of the committee page two
Six one down Senate bill 44 presented to yesterday help school systems lower taxes
Last page, four, third one down, Senate Bill 199 is a new request.
This is the ethics bill brought to me by the Commission.
It helps consolidate our campaign, committee disclosure reports and
our financial disclosure reports and does a few other things just around ethics.
I think that's any question.
No, see any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I remember the committee.
Senator, come on out.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've got Senate Bill 130. It's on page three, the seventh bill down.
It's an agency
legislation for the Georgia Board of Healthcare Workforce, the purposes to increase the number of
healthcare providers in our state. And it does it two ways. Number one,
it makes more institutions eligible for residency and fellowship programs.
and number two, it makes final year residents
and bella's eligible for the board's service
cancelable loan program.
There's no fiscal note because this does not anticipate
any additional money.
It's just widened the scope of the programs.
Thank you, Senator Howard.
Don't see any questions for you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, colleagues.
Sit down, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senate Bill 162, I've already talked about that's the licensing and credentialing bill
with the composite medical board that will get our physicians, PAs and nurse practitioner
protocol agreements months earlier getting out, getting people working.
Senate Bill 195 on the back page, second from the top.
This has been worked out with the composite medical board, the Department of Public Health,
Magical Association, Georgia and the pharmacists.
We have the third highest new infection rate of HIV in the Atlanta metro area.
This will allow our pharmacists to dispense pre-exposure and post-exposure medicine.
The, besides the quality of life issue, the economics are that one of these generic doses
that would be taken every other month is about $23.
The cost of treating HIV once they get it, this prevents them from getting it is about
$60,000 annually.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to see you questions.
Yes, sir, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, my fellow legislators, colleagues, friends, and y'all.
I'm Senator Rat.
Everybody calls me Doc, and I'm here this morning to wish y'all a good morning and ask you
to look at page three, Senate Bill 147.
Basically, all it does is its legislation that will allow the Georgia Department of
correction to give inmates being released,
documents relevant to finding work after release.
And since it's getting close to 9.30,
I'm going to get out of here unless there's any questions.
Thank you, sir.
I don't see any questions for you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, come on up there and tell us
what you got on with your mind.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Page two, about three quarters of what,
way down the page, SB 72.
I hope for Georgia Patients Act.
just provides opportunity for doctors and hospitals to provide non-FDA-approved treatments
and medicines, SB193 on page four, I covered yesterday. It's just a high school diploma
for ages 21 to 40, then SB 233 is expanding the behavioral health, perform an innovation
commission, giving the governor of the speaker and the lieutenant governor to extra appointees
for that commission, and then SB 259 is a second chance law when a child is suspected of
child abuse. It gives the family the right to a second opinion. That was probably the most
important bill I've done in years. Thank you Senator. No questions. Thank you sir.
Mr. Robertson. Morning Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much. Bottom of page two, SB 99.
It's a bill that clearly defines the definition of law enforcement officer in Georgia to attempt to
help our partners with the federal government when they are part of a
multidirectional task force or if they have to react or respond to a
forceful felony in their presence and then SB 100 is the equal rights for adopt
these bill. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Okay, don't, don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, Senator. More Mr. Chairman, I've got two bills on your sheet today.
page three, the third one down SB 112 has to do, it's good consumer protection bill, has
to do with HVAC manufacturer warranties. Currently you have to register that device or that
system once you purchase it to activate that warranty. This would take that step out. So
when the license professional installs it, that's your property that warranty would take
place then. No need for the activation portion of it because the manufacturer already has
information because you purchase that directly from them. So it takes that out and it also makes the
manufacturer the warranty transferable so the house is sold one time or ten times it follows
the property. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Okay, I don't see any questions. Okay, and then the second one's
on page three, second from the bottom, HB 180. That has to do with high demand apprenticeship programs.
And simply there's one change to it currently. And these are for high demand fields under TSAG.
And currently what you have to do is you have to get a company sponsor for that
To be eligible to get in the program companies can only have ten at a time apprentices
This would allow the the program school to be a sponsor as well
And they've got a list of companies that are looking for apprentices. So just it expanded that program. We have to answer any questions
Thank you, sir. Don't see any questions. Thank you
Thank you.
Senator Hatchie.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The first bill is on page two.
This is the first lady's human trafficking bill,
which updates our code to make sure that people who are guilty
of sex trafficking minors are held to the fullest extent
of the law.
The second bill is on page number.
What number is that one?
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.
It's a Senate bill 42, yes, sir.
The second bill is Senate bill 154 presented this yesterday.
This is the bill that deals with the closure of the U.S. Department of Education, and yesterday
President Trump did sign an executive order, so I think this would be timely.
And the last is Senate Bill 141, that's on page four.
This is a department bill for the Department of Revenue that just updates our code to make
our state more friendly for the taxpayer.
Okay.
Thank you Senator.
You don't see any questions for me.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Senator Strictly.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I have on the last page, about halfway down Senate
bill 207. This is our bill. This is our 30-year work on this together. This creates
sustainability process for how our occupational license boards deal with criminal records.
And this is our chance to help lift folks out of the criminal justice system by helping
them get a job. Happy to answer any questions.
Okay, I don't see any questions. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee bring before you to the Senate Bill 51, middle of the second page.
This relates to the qualification-based selection of architects and engineers.
It takes the same process that we use the state, university and federal level, and applies to the city and county governments.
Okay, don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, do any members of the committee have requests for anything?
No request, okay.
Before we set a counter, I'm going to recognize Vice Chairman Lebritt for an announcement and recognition.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's pending the processing of the chairman's PTSD application after the hearings we've had in the criminal lawsuit form, but we do plan to have another meeting next week on Tuesday afternoon, once we know when we're going to be going into session on Tuesday,
I was trying to set the time and get a notice out but we also have Senate Bill 69 to deal
with on that subcommittee so we will be holding here in on Tuesday to deal with that or
to begin looking at and hopefully take action on that bill.
So I just wanted to kind of get that word out to everybody again.
We'll have to notice with the exact time wait or day and also just want to utilize a quick
point of personal privilege.
