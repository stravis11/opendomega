Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. We will begin our day-to-day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 138th House District Chairman Mike Chokus. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, before I introduce Father Theodore, I would like to say a little bit about my Greek Orthodox Christian faith. We all know of the travels and letters of Paul to the Greeks in the cities of Athens, Corinth, Solonica, Antioch, Ephesus. As a matter of fact, the ancient Greeks were immediately receptive to this new religion of Jesus Christ. It should be no surprise that the New Testament was originally written in Byzantine Greek and a little has changed in the traditions of our church. Now on to Father Theodore. Father Theodore is a native of Pittsburgh. He moved to Georgia following his then-girlfriend, now wife Stacey. Stacey enrolled at UGA Goldogs and Father Theodore with the school at Kennesaw State University where he studied before theology. He studied meteorology and history. He was ordained a priest in March of 2015 after completing his seminary at the Holy Cross, Trinity Greek Orthodox, excuse me, at the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Church, the School of Theology in Brookline, Massachusetts. He is now the priest at the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Church in Macon. It was interesting we had a conversation a few weeks ago and we were talking about the hereafter and possibilities of going to heaven and he answered me in a meteorological term. He said, Mike, you got about a 60% chance right now. So with that being said, let me introduce you to Father Theodore, Father Theodore of my priest. Good morning. First and foremost, I must thank the speaker for having me here this morning and this honor of being here and also to Representative Chocus for the great honor of having been invited here today as the chaplain of the day and as a pastor and priest of the Greek Orthodox Church, the invitation to have the blessing to speak to you all today really seems quite fitting. This week on Thursday March 25th, we remember the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Greek Independence from the Ottoman Empire. Now if one examines my last name, Amor, Emer, however you want to pronounce it, with any kind of scrutiny you might assume that I don't think he's Greek and if you assume that you are correct actually, my ethnic roots from a couple generations back or from the Netherlands, Germany, and Ireland. So why am I up here speaking to you all today as a Greek Orthodox clergyman about Greek independence? Well really it stems from a journey that began in college. I discovered the richness, the depth and history of the Orthodox Church that traces its lineage back to Jesus Christ, his holy apostles and their successors. In addition, I encountered a new and profound manner of focus on the reality of Jesus Christ becoming man and the ramifications of that fact. One of the key principles, one of the key principles of our Christian faith is a principle that's not always evident on the surface. A good Greek word, Elephadia, freedom. God did not create us simply to follow rules or to be robots. He created us out of his divine love, out of his divine love, his dynamic beings, with the free will to utilize the potentiality given to us. God grants us the freedom to engage with the mystery of life, the mystery of life from the day of our birth. So in my learning of the Greek language, there's this really nice little wish that's given to a woman who's nearing birth. Cali Elephadia. Literally it means like good freedom. And I like to view this wish, good freedom in sort of two ways. First of all, I like to think of it like good freedom to the mother from this special gift that you've been carrying around with you for these past few months. Good freedom from that. But secondly, and even more important, I like to think of this as a wish for the new child. Good freedom. This freedom that you are about to be endowed with as a human being being born into the world. As we read in St. Paul's letter to the Galatians, we are called to freedom, called to freedom. However, with that freedom comes a great responsibility. St. Paul continues with his teaching that we need to use this freedom that we're endowed with wisely, not for our own selfish means, but as servants following the example in way of the Lord himself. Unless it was no mistake, no mistake that March 25 was the day chosen by the Greek people to declare their independence. March 25 is the day of the annunciation nine months to the day before the birth of Jesus Christ. The day that the Archangel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would give birth to the Messiah, the one who would give the world the opportunity for freedom from sin and death. Jesus Christ who himself, himself said that he came to serve not be served, served as an example to the heroes of the Greek revolution. They chose to put their only their own livelihoods at risk in order to open the doors to freedom for others. And we are all called, we are all called to the same high calling of facilitating this opportunity for those around us. And you all have this potentiality in a very concrete manner as those who serve in government to use the freedom wisely that you've been given as an opportunity, as an opportunity to serve our brothers and sisters out of love. God as the all-powerful one, the all-powerful one, could have made us robots just pulling our strings around like puppets. But instead he gave us being made in his image in likeness, the ability, the blessing to be co-creators and co-workers with him in this mystery of life. This is the beauty of the freedom that he has given us which we facilitate in a country like the United States. We do not force people into submission but we foster a society where it's a joy and an honor to serve our brothers and sisters and to employ our freedom wisely. As we honor the heroes of the Greek revolution this week, people who also saw inspiration in the heroes of the American Revolution, may we also be inspired by them to honor God's image found in each and every one of us as people of freedom using that freedom out of love for our neighbor. Love for our neighbor, neighbor whoever they might be, which ultimately gives glory to our God and our creator. Amen. At this time I would ask you to rise and entreat our Lord in prayer. Let us pray to the Lord, Lord have mercy. Eternal God and Father, ruler of the entire universe, ever enthroned in the minds and hearts of your faithful servants everywhere. We recognize your mystical presence among us and entreat you to remain in our midst as we come together this day. We pray to you to watch over and bless these servants, strengthening them and all of us both in times of hardship and times of joy, making us worthy to wisely use our freedom given to us by you. For you are most holy and blessed along with your co-eternal son Jesus Christ, and you're all holy good in life creating spirit, now and forever, into the ages of ages. Amen. Within communities, to the fire, under the United States of America and through the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God is visible.

order thank you mr. speaker on behalf of the house education committee we're here to recognize and celebrate reading awareness month across the state of Georgia there there is a movement of foot hear me when I say this that all children whether we are parents grandparents neighbors caregivers that we read aloud to our children for 15 minutes each day we know that a child's ability to read on grade level by the end of the third grade is one of the greatest predictors of success in their life we we have all kinds of data both on a state and a federal level and one of the best ways to help a child read on grade level is to have someone read to them so go home grab a book grab a child read to them and help to introduce that healthy habit into their household every day as we celebrate reading awareness month thank you mr. speaker chair recognizes representative Matthew Wilson for a morning order thank you mr. speaker there's been a great deal said in this chamber and nationally about the heinous shootings that killed eight people eight people here last week there's been a great deal said but I don't think that's enough are we just gonna run out the clock on this legislative session without doing something about it I was in a position of anger and frustration a week ago when a mass shooter rocked our state and then yesterday in Colorado 10 people were gunned down getting their groceries we've offered bills that have received no hearings we've channeled voices that have been stone walled does gun violence really have to touch your family before you're ready to worry about something other than your next primary let's do something about gun violence and about the epidemic in our society please I respectfully beg of you I pray this is not a tragedy that has to afflict a majority of Georgians before this body can address it thank you chair recognizes chairman Powell and representative to Lopes for a morning order good morning colleagues I'm proud to stand here with my friend from the coast today as we come up here to honor the life and memory of Martin Neesmith now most of you folks here don't know Martin Neesmith but if you did you'd have met one one of a kind Martin passed away this past November and I can tell you there wasn't anybody any finer he was probably in his professional life Martin was the youngest Chevrolet dealer in this country served on the GADA board the national board but there's some other things that are so special about Martin you know in his political career up here it was never elected but Martin served on the board of regents and back in him days you really didn't know what was a headache at that time to serve on the board of regency when he was there but Martin Neesmith was probably without a doubt one of the most decent human beings you've ever met always had an open hand to help charities from Clackston to South Georgia to Shelman's bluff where they located to help build a clinic down there for a lot of the friends and neighbors down their own coast not a nicer guy if Marty was alive today he'd be cutting up and having fun with you but for that we're gonna put this resolution on my desk I think probably fitting us in the back and for anybody that would do him the honor whether you knew him or not of coming by there and signing this resolution to proclaim hallelujah for the life of Martin Neesmith thank you ladies and gentlemen Chair recognizes representative Stacey Evans for a morning order thank you mr. speaker good morning colleagues most of us in here work outside this chamber and sometimes even during session we can be called away and this happened to me last week so I missed day 34 so that I could do some justice in a courthouse we'll see how that turns out in a few weeks I guess so I missed adding my yes vote in support of Senate Bill 140 putting a monument in honor of Governor Zell Miller on our capital grounds and so I wanted to add my voice of support at least in this morning order because it's really hard for me to overstate what Zell Miller's willingness to push for the Hope Scholarship program did for me personally I feel certain that I never would have gotten to Athens to the University of Georgia wouldn't have learned how to call the dogs wouldn't have met my husband wouldn't have my two beautiful kids and certainly wouldn't be standing here before you this morning I am that turtle on a fence post and I know that we've talked about that phrase in here a few times Dean Calvin Smiley talks about it a lot but every time I've heard him say he he gives credit to Governor Miller for that phrase and I don't know if Governor Miller should be giving credit to someone else but that's who I think about and I think of that phrase as metaphorical someone is putting a turtle up on a fence post so that turtle can see things that that turtle can't see when it's down on the ground and that's what Zell Miller and the Hope Scholarship did for me and so many first-generation college students lifted us up so that we could see a world of possibilities that were impossible for us to even imagine where we were in our current state this government made that possible that was a big thing and I just want to remind us that we can do big things and I hope we continue to strive for those big things and not get caught up in the small things thank you Mr. Speaker I yield the will to recognize his representative air heart for a morning order thank you Mr. Speaker in honor of women's history month today I recognize Sergeant Leanne Hester of the 617th military police company a National Guard unit out of Kentucky Hester is the first woman to receive the Silver Star since World War II for exceptional valor Hester Squad was shadowing a supply convoy on March 20th 2005 when anti-Iraqi fighters ambushed the convoy her squad moved to the side of the road flanking the insurgents and cutting off their escape route she led her team through the Kill Zone and into a flanking position where she assaulted a trench line with grenades and M203 grenade launcher rounds she and her squad leader then cleared two trenches at which time she killed three insurgents when the fight was over 27 insurgents were dead six wounded and one captured being the first female soldier since World War II to receive the medal is significant to Hester but she doesn't dwell on that fact she says it really doesn't have anything to do with me being female she said it's about the duties I performed that day as a soldier your training kicks in and the soldier in you kicks in you've got a job to do protecting yourself and your fellow comrades what an amazing and brave young woman Mr. Speaker I yield the well chair recognizes representative Taylor for a morning order thank you Mr. Speaker good morning it is my honor and recognition of National Women's History Month to highlight a friend and mentor to many of us and to introduce to others the honorable

The time for morning orders has expired. There were members of both caucuses who were not reached. And if you want to be reached on the next legislative day, then sign up with a messenger. What purpose does representative air heart rise? To make a motion. State your motion. I move that Senate Bill 144 be recommitted to the Rules Committee. The clerk will read the caption. 7144 by Senator Tipens of 37th, Gutsch, the 51st cows of the 46th, and others to be entitled to menop part one of article 1 of chapter 3, tonneley. The fish go to Georgia and Tatery, and the general provisions for housing authorities. On the ladies' motion, that Senate Bill 144 be recommitted to the Rules Committee. Is there any objection? Is there objection? Chair, here's none. And it is on his way back to Rules. We're going to pause for about five or 10 minutes before we go on to the Rules calendar. Okay, we're going back to the Rules calendar. We're going on to the Rules calendar. Going on to the Rules calendar. Senate Bill 219 was postponed yesterday to the next legislative day, and it will be postponed again today to the next legislative day. The clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 119. Senate Bill 119 was Senator Harper, the seventh goodman in the eighth, Burke of the 11th, Mulles of the 53rd, Anderson of the 24th, being entitled to men in Code Section 12, 690, of the fish go to Georgia and Tatery, relating to permit required for burning wood, land, marshes, or other flammable vegetation. This bill I'm referring to the committee on natural resources and environment. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative McDonald to present the bill. Miss Speaker Lasing, Joan of the House, has Senate Bill 119 was brought to us by our new chief forester, Tim Larramore, and the Georgia Forestry Agency. Senate Bill 119 eliminates the system of reporting in Code Section 12, 690. And aligns with our government goals of saving taxpayer monies with the cost savings of over $175,000. 160 annual savings is eliminating 16 phone lines that go to the Georgia Forestry Commission that have homeowners calling in when they want to burn leaf piles in their own yard. And $15,000 is to manage the website system that runs the phone system, that the platform there. The Georgia Forestry will continue work with all our media outlets around our state of Georgia and letting you know of how when in dangerous burn situations that we might have throughout our state during the burn season. What this bill does not do is take local control away from our counties that have different code requirements for burning. If you do have piles that you're putting together with any type of mechanical device, like a tractor, you still have to call the Georgia Forestry Commission for that. This only eliminates homeowners doing personal leaf piles with a rake and by hand. Mr. Speaker, if I don't have any questions, I will yield a well. You have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative dryer in the gallery to your left. For a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Isn't it true that burning yard waste contributes to greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming? It isn't also true that sometimes in very dry conditions, consumers might not be aware of a fire hazard with burning in their yard, which they could learn from calling the Department of Forestry. Well, in this bill, the Georgia Forestry has established for the first time guidelines that require that you have to be 25 feet from your property line and 50 feet from any structure.

This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Resolution 134. To Senate Resolution 134. Senate Resolution 134 by Senator Walker, the 20th, Dugan, and the 30th, the Capatric of the 32nd, but with the 55th, the parent of the 42nd and others, a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Georgia so as to provide for the suspension of compensation for certain public officers who are suspended because of an indictment for felony. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Judiciary. That committee recommends a disresolution to be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Eftration to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, Senate Resolution 134 is a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which would, in circumstances, where a statewide elected official, or remember the General Assembly, is under indictment for a felony offense, and it's determined that that official is to be suspended from office because the felony is related to the office here she holds, that the pay due for the public office shall be suspended. The pay would be recoverable if the person's ultimately acquitted of the offense, but it's just suspension while they are suspended from office and unable to do the job that they were elected to do under those circumstances. So we're removing a provision from the Constitution. I know there are some other speakers signed up on this, so I'll yield the well unless there are any questions. You do not have any questions. You'll the well, thank you. Chair recognizes to speak to the bill, Chairman Oliver. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in support of SR 134. We did a good thing almost 20 years ago to set up the system whereby an indicted elected official indictment shall be reviewed by a panel appointed by the governor, and with careful consideration as to whether or not the alleged criminal activity relates to the office holder, the panel has the right to suspend the office holder. It's totally appropriate and positive movement in my view that we also suspend the pay. You do have a constitutional right not to be incarcerated wrongly, but I'm not sure in the private world or in the instance of the public world, you have a right to a job and a pay for a job that you're not performing. I rise to support SR 134. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Wilson to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in favor of SR 134. Sometimes when I'm sitting up in the gallery and we're studying and debating these bills, I hear someone say solution in search of a problem and I kind of involuntarily flinch. So it brings me great joy to be able to this morning to say that this is the solution to our current problem. In Judiciary Committee, we discussed several hypotheticals that arise from our current suspension process and what adding these sanctions to it would mean. And I'm sensitive to the prospect of this being used for political prosecution, but this is already in our constitution for a reason. And I think we've got a good balance with several different offices charged away in. But moreover, this isn't a hypothetical. We've got two insurance commissioners right now. One was barely on the job a few weeks before his indictment in a multimillion dollar fraud scheme. He's about to go a whole term without having done the job that Georgia's put their trust in him to do. But the taxpayers have been on the hook for his salary, his health care and benefits this whole time. When you're a public official, you're not entitled to the job. None of us are entitled to this job. People put their trust in us to represent their interests to make their government work for them. If you can't do that, can't do the job, you shouldn't get paid for it. Now, I think the indicted insurance commissioner should have resigned because it's clear he views the public trust as nothing more than his own trust fund. But since no one can be compelled to that end, we've got to make it so that public corruption doesn't get so comfortable. You can just hang around picking up a paycheck until the clock runs out. We've got to do our job here and I urge you to support this measure. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the floor. I yield the well. Gentlemen, is yielded the well? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is an un. The previous question is ordered.

This bill I refer to the committee on code revision. The committee recommends the disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman EFstration to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is the second bill that was requested by the Code Revision Commission for our consideration this year. And this legislation directly relates to the U.S. Supreme Court opinion that was issued in the past 12 months and the accessibility of our laws in Georgia to Georgia citizens. The legislation to my knowledge has no no opposition and really could be characterized as cleanup within the law to ensure that there's consistency and compliance with the Supreme Court opinion. I'd be happy to answer any questions and would ask for your favorable consideration. You do not have any questions. I yield the well. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?

So it's to provide a cause of action against perpetrators for victims of human trafficking. This bill having referred the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes representative Bonner to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This morning I rise to present Senate Bill 33. This is a continuation of First Lady Marty Kemp's and the Grace Commission's efforts to eradicate human trafficking here in Georgia. I'd like to thank Chairman Eftration and his committee for all the work they did to help bring this bill to the floor and all the work that he did personally to see this. They happen. Senate Bill 33 does a number of things. First it creates a new code section to provide for a victim of human trafficking to have a civil cause of action against a perpetrator and allows victims to potentially recover damages and reasonable attorney fees. Secondly, it creates a statute of limitations for the filing of such a civil action and allows for a stay of that civil action lawsuit while any criminal action arising from the incident of human trafficking is pending. And then third it allows for the attorney general to have a cause of action against any perpetrator of human trafficking on behalf of the state under certain circumstances. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker, and I'll stand for any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I urge your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

Senate Bill 187 by Senator Tipkins, the 37th miller of the 49th Jackson, the second walker, the 20th and Butler of the 50th to be entitled back to amend Code Section 23519.2, the official go to Georgia annotated relating the eligibility requirements for hope scholarship, so as to establish a procedure for students with a disability. This bill ever further committee on higher education, that committee recommends the disbill, do pass. Chair recognizes representative wheat hour to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. They bring to you Senate Bill 187. In January of 2013, a young lady named Grace was running down Millage Avenue in Athens, Georgia as a senior in high school and was struck by a vehicle and left with this traumatic head injury. She recovered but was left with a significant disability. Went onto the university in Georgia and has been going through that process, going through school at her pace and her abilities as her abilities can allow her to. Unfortunately for Grace, with the seven year rule, her eligibility for hope ran out before she could finish. What this does, this simply allows students like Grace the ability to apply for a waiver, and if should they meet the requirements as illustrated in the ADA requirements for having such a disability, it would allow them the ability to extend that. And that time to be able to continue their college underneath the hope program. Does not cost the state a penny, but it gives students like Grace the opportunity to fulfill their dream of graduating from college. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will for any questions. If there are none, I ask for your favorable consideration. You do have a couple of questions to yield. I will take one. Chair recognizes representative Bentley to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman yield. I do. Isn't that true that I am a big supporter of individuals living with disabilities in the state of Georgia, and I voted for this bill out of the Higher Education Committee, and I will be voting yes for this bill today on the floor. I believe that to be true, and I appreciate your support. Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Gentlemen, yields the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none of the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of Senate Bill 187, the eyes are 165. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to Senate Bill 86. Senate Bill 86 by Senator Walker, the 20th paying to the 54th Hickman, the 4th Albers, the 56th, tops to the 14th and others to be titled, now to amend Part 2 of Article 15 of Chapter 1 and Title 10. The fish go to Georgia and it's either relating the fair business practices. So, Mr. Provide for requirements for solicitations of services for corporate filings. This bill ever further committee on judiciary, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Eftration to present the bill. Mr. Speaker, Senate Bill 86, as it comes before you today, I would characterize as one of the most important things that I have done here at the Capitol or that I will do at the Capitol. The bill is not what the caption reflects, but deals with the equitable caregiver statute. And what I do is I'd ask your indulgence right now for me to give you a little bit of the history that's going on, the cases that have been used to interpret child custody rights in the state of Georgia, and then ask for your favorable consideration. Certainly, the open answer any questions that you might have about the technicalities of the law. So, the US Supreme Court has issued an opinion in Troxel versus Granville 2000 that really made clear that the US Constitution protects a parent's rights to parent their child, and that that protection is really only overcome if a state can show in their statute that that parent is unfit, that they would cause some sort of harm to the child and that role as a parent. And we were aware of that in 2019 when we passed a very historic act. We passed the equitable caregiver law that allowed for third parties who had a history of taking care of a child to actually be able to be granted custody in the courtroom if under the circumstances that was appropriate to do. And a key element of that was that the judge had to find that the parent was posed harm to the child, physical harm or long-term emotional harm. That element is a necessary element. It's got to be there for US Supreme Court case law. And what we've done since the equitable caregiver statute was passed, we've seen great uses of this law throughout our state. And I would argue really for the first time in the courtroom, judges have been able to view cases as to what's best for the child from the perspective of the child rather than just thinking about whose parental rights are in play or what parents deserve. Who is the child actually looked to as their caregiver? And that's really an amazing thing that we've had thanks to this General Assembly taking a big step in passing this law on Governor Kimp's support in 2019. Right, now two years later, here's where we are. We have received feedback about the law that really has been sent to me as the author from 2019. And also we've seen subsequent case law interpreting our third party custody statutes and visitation statutes. And Senate Bill 96, as it's before you today, is a reflection of updates that are not only important to be made, but I would submit to you have to be made for this law to not suffer a very harsh consequence in our appellate courts. In other words, a view that this in some way can flex with constitutional protections. So what I'd like to do is just briefly go through with you the four big things that this bill does. All right, the first is relatively simple. There's a pro-save form. There's a form for unrepresented parties that we put in the statute trying to improve access. And the form has a mistake on it. So we address the mistake by including that harm element that I was talking about earlier. That's the first big thing that's done. The second is that there was a question as to what if a parent...

How to problem was unfit and then later is able to get their act together is able to care for the child what happens then. And the legislature very clearly said and I'll just direct you to it's the end of the bill here very clearly said lines 38 39 the adjudication of a person as an equitable caregiver does nothing to disestablish that parents rights. We made clear that this was not what is called in juvenile court a TPR a termination of parental rights that's not what we're doing here and parental rights remain in place. Because of that we must include I would argue to you what is reflected here in K lines 140 to 143. And that is that if a parent is able to get their act together is is able to address the issues that they had maybe it's a drug addiction issue maybe it's something else and they are a fit parent to look after the child. Then we must provide a provision where they're constitutionally protected rights according to I would submit according to justice or Connor in the Troxel case. That those protected constitutional rights of a parent are preserved and failure to include a provision like we have here in K could prove fatal ultimately to this entire statute and all the great work that we did. There's also been a question as to what what happens with child support and the legislature was silent as to child support in this case also think a policy argument could be made that an award of child support may incentivize a third party to pursue one of these cases because of a financial reason and that that's not what we were after here. So all we're doing in Senate bill 86 is just making clear that the court cannot award child support which in my opinion is already the state of the law. But it's just to be clear about that and if folks have concerns about an equitable caregiver receiving child support from a parent who was determined to be unfit then bring a bill. I mean I think that'd be great to debate and discuss this but we're all we're doing here is just including what the state of the law is currently. The final provision of the four things this bill does the final provision is it provides a specific period of look back. So and that's five years as proposed in the bill so again an equitable caregiver is let's say there's a neighbor who a parent says hey please look after my child for a period of time the neighbor looks after the child for for an extended period of time. So that takes care of the child the child views this person as an apparent like role and all the other factors are met that the parent is unfit to look after the child and a judge after considering all that evidence says okay I've determined that the equitable caregiver statute would apply. That is a rigorous legal analysis that's taken place at that point. And what we didn't want to happen is that somebody who may be cared for a child years and years ago say outside of five years ago shows up in court and says oh yeah I know this is someone else's someone else is the parent of this child but I'm alleging that I have standing here because I looked for the child say when the 14 year old was an infant I looked after the child. So that's the child for a year back then. You know that was not that was not the intent of the law to have an unlimited look back and there's some specific input that we've received about how this potentially could impact children who have not had contact with the equitable caregiver in a long time. So what I'd say to you here today is that we all want to do what's best for kids and we debate often what do we think truly is going to be the most beneficial and impactful thing for children in our state. And what I'd submit to you here is that the equitable caregiver law we passed was a wonderful great thing for the children of our state and this legislation does nothing to change that. In fact what it does is it strengthens it by protecting it within our law so that courts don't later seek to invalidate or determine to invalidate the statute. So this is briefly here. Now I have heard today some concern in the hall and I've been contacted by some practitioners who I believe are very well meaning and in the issues that have been brought forward. Interestingly enough I've been contacted by some people opposing the bill who were also opposed to the equitable caregiver statute from the outset. I don't want to assume intent but I do think there are some folks who want this statute to be struck by our courts because they don't like the concept of a third party having standing to bring to bring a custody case. But I do think that consideration needs to be considered by you today. Do we want the statute to be cemented in our law so that it's protected in place in the future so that judges in the courtroom can do the right thing. And I'll tell you this. Anyone who knows me up here knows how much I care about these issues knows that I'm not going to move forward on this bill without taking input from all those involved, all those who have reached out and whatever proposal if we get it to a vote in the Senate. Whatever proposal in the Senate is going to be after hearing from those folks making sure that they're heard and that we have a debate so that a rigorous discussion so that we can get their concerns addressed as much as possible. I care about this and the only place I'm coming from on this is ensuring that this law remains in place well into the future. I appreciate your indulgence. I know it's just before lunch. But a green vote on this helps to protect Georgia's kids going forward and helps to protect modern families. The fact is we now have family circumstances that were not contemplated in original custody laws. And your vote in favor of this here today will help to ensure that this good statute remains in place well into the future. I've committed, I've made a personal commitment to members in this chamber today as well that should this bill move forward and I certainly hope that it does. That this is not the end of the discussion with them and that we'll be able to continue to work on this so that at the end of session we all can take great pride in the fact that we've strengthened a good and important law. There's a member of our body. I hope he doesn't mind sharing this conversation, but there's a member of our body is a former judge. Judge shared with me that some of the most difficult cases are circumstances where the judge knows the right thing to do in the courtroom, but the law prohibits him or her from doing it. No knows what's best for the for the child and the law stands in the way. And a green vote on 86 will help to ensure that judges can continue to do the right thing in the courtroom that the child's interests are protected and that this law can survive to be utilized well into the future. Does not I was asked by representative about does this impact foster care does not have anything to do with foster care or with juvenile court proceedings. This is a superior court custody case determination to be made. I asked for your favorable consideration, Mr. Speaker, I'll be happy to answer any questions. You do have some questions if you care to you. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes the minority caucus leader leader Beverly to your left for a question. The gentleman yield. In the current scenario does the equitable caregiver is the equitable caregiver able to receive money from the non custodial parent. They they can receive, but they cannot be in my opinion. They cannot be court ordered to make child support payment to that in can a non parent custodian be awarded support as well. So if you don't have the child, can you be awarded support in my opinion? No, not under the existing statute. And that leads to my third question is are there currently any appellate court cases that are going on right now to address 99 3.1. It is outcome. If they're not, then where do you see this going? It has been told to me that there are courts. There are cases working their way through the courts, and I can't tell you specifically where each is. I can tell you that this is not a response to any specific appeal or any specific case that this is an issue I brought last session and that I brought again this year because I believe that we need these protections to ensure that this statute survives well into the future. Thank you, leader. Do you further you? Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Stacy Evans in the gallery to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. Am I correct that you could get some sort of partial custody arrangement under the language of the current law without showing that the current custodial parent is unfit? I disagree with that interpretation. It is a requirement for standing and that you'll see it here is the point you two lines one 10 to 112, which are existing law. It's demonstrated that the child will suffer physical harm or long-term emotional harm. That demonstration is a required element of the existing law. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes, ma'am. Let me preface this by saying I think there's a lot good in this bill and we've talked about it. My biggest concern is that the way I read this bill is that it does allow a shared custody arrangement between one parent who we think is fine, but it could call some emotional harm to keep a child away from a second person that has acted as a parent, the equitable caregiver. So that by K, we take away that ability for there to be a shared arrangement between the parent that has the child and someone who if kept away from the child could create that emotional harm. But I think we have different interpretations of the statute so that my concern with K wouldn't be yours. So it's not really a question at this point, but a statement. But that's my concern with the bill at this point. So I respectfully I completely disagree with with the assertion. A judge in a courtroom right now, let's say that this is under review that you have a circumstance if I understand the hypothetical where an equitable caregiver, the equitable caregiver statute has been utilized to allow for a joint custody arrangement under these circumstances. The fitness standard remains in place not only in statute, but also from case law. And it was argued at the time when we passed this in 2019 that judges were so aware of that requirement that it must be included in their orders otherwise there would be an issue later for those same orders. But to take it a step further, terminating that contact with that third party in the example you described would cause such emotional harm to the child that the order could be very easily written to ensure that that relationship remains in place and that that custody arrangement remains in place. So I would state this to the lady if you were willing to vote in support of the bill today, I acknowledge that this is an issue we need to continue to work on here in the final days of this session so that we can make sure that there is a strong consensus bill passed that addresses all the concerns that have been raised in the hallway and ensures that we have a strong law in place that will not be susceptible to a pellet review in the future. Thank you. Thank you for that commitment. Our speaker will yield the well and I'll ask the members for their favorable consideration. Gentlemen has yielded the well. We have a member that wishes to speak on the bill and chair recognizes representative McLauren to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning to everybody. As always, when I get up here, I want to thank you for your time and as the chairman pointed out right before lunch as well. I need to emphasize in as strong as possible terms, I respect the chairman, I respect his feeling for these issues. Honestly, we wouldn't be here if he hadn't been the champion of the statutory framework that we're talking about and which he referenced, which we all approved of a couple years ago and that I was proud to vote for. And we all care about the best interests of children. So fortunately, unlike a lot of debates, we can skip to a more technical posture than having to debate big value differences. There are concerned advocates about this bill. They're concerned members, obviously. And the biggest concern in this bill is the proposed subsection K. I'm in an awkward position to try to dispute with the chairman saying about the bill. But we're all kind of in that awkward position because again, the statutory framework that we passed in 2019 was an exemplary step forward in ensuring that the best interest of children was protected by allowing this person we called an equitable caregiver, which is a model recognized in other states, to participate meaningfully in a child's life because that participation is critical to that child's well being. I'm in an awkward position to say that the chairman's own fix is not what we need right now. But you heard it from the sponsor himself. This bill is motivated more by a fear of later review by courts and what they might conclude than it is by any sort of substantive policy reason why the structural framework we put in place is not sufficient. I'll say that again. This is a bill that attempts to stave off a constitutional challenge whose parameters were not quite sure of yet. We've heard about the Troxel decision, a plurality opinion from Justice O'Connor that doesn't necessarily bind courts to go in one direction or another in ruling on the scope of a parent's rights. All we know is that the Supreme Court does have an interest in a natural parents or legal parents rights over a child. That's all we know from that opinion. We don't know what specific pathway that's going to take. We don't know how Georgia courts specifically are going to construe that line of cases. But there is a concern. And if I were the champion of such an important statute, I would also share concern that it not be struck down. I think that's completely relatable. But here's what's also relatable in my opinion. The idea that an equitable caregiver is not just a third party. This is not a grandparent case. This is not a friend of the family case. The kind of visitation that we're talking about, course ordering, the type of custody that would be ordered is for somebody whose role in a child's life is so essential and so basic that it basically equates to parenthood. I mean, that's why this was such an important step forward is we're recognizing that in many families, the availability of the equitable caregiver is the same emotionally physically as having a parent. And it's allowing the law to catch up with that very fundamental recognition. I have to echo the chairman that that's such an incredibly important step. Critical to protect the best interests of the child. But that's also why to a member's comment from the floor, subsection K that terminates that relationship. If one or more parents, one or both parents, can show that they're not personally harmed to the child, that's a mismatch. And I'll explain why. If you go to lines 143, 143, it allows the termination of the equitable caregiver relationship. If the parent can show that they're no longer a risk personally of causing physical harm or long term emotional harm. But that's a different standard than we set up for how to become an equitable caregiver. But the standard we set up before, if I can direct your attention lines, 101 until 112, the five factors, we're talking about an equitable caregiver who has fully and completely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed and responsible role engaged in consistent caretaking, a bonded and dependent relationship. Full and permanent, I stress permanent, responsibilities as a parent of the child without expectation of financial compensation. And of course, physical harm or long term emotional harm. Those are the things that an equitable caregiver already has to show by clear and convincing evidence. So this is not a situation where if the parent is able to show, well, I'm not personally a risk, that that's enough. If the parent says I'm not personally an emotional or physical risk, that's well and good, that's good for the child. But that doesn't mean that that equitable caregiver relationship that we just went through the factors for is any less critical to the child's life. And it's awkward that this is in the bill, but again, the reason it doesn't squares because we have to remember where it comes from, it's an attempt to comply with some future litigation. But what are the facts on the litigation that's happening and to the minority leader's point. Several child courts as my understanding, the first level of court have evaluated these claims, these constitutionality arguments already. And of course, the constitutionality argument is that if a court forces indefinite visitation or custody, that that interferes unduly with the parent's constitutional right to raise their children, that's the argument, that's the worry that that will be the constitutional challenge. But several child courts have already passed over that argument. And the appellate courts have not ruled on that argument yet as the minority leader pointed out. And we don't know how that 2000, again, 20 years ago, US Supreme Court decision, will wreak any havoc on this statute, if at all. So that litigation is a big question mark. It's a huge question mark. And what this bill is doing is saying, well, instead of just waiting a minute to figure out what those appellate courts are going to say, let me tell you something, it could be that they say that the statute is unworkable and that we need to do something else. But you know what they'll do when they do that opinion, they'll give a specific guidance about exactly how to fix it. For example, I could imagine a subsection K where instead of just removing equitable caregivers rights, any time the court could have a finding that we put a process in place, a process that we like we do all the time where a parent can petition the court at a certain interval, if they can make a certain showing, you know, based on a specific amount of evidence, we do stuff like that all the time. So I think it's a very important thing to manage these conflicts. But as written these four lines, it's unclear. It's completely unclear what rights a parent has. Could they petition a court once a week, once a month? To say, I think there's no more risk of harm. I think there's no more risk of harm. Theoretically, the way this is written, it could embroil equitable caregivers in and the families. Well, you know, the entire family and the disparate elements within it in constant litigation, constant litigation over whether or not the equitable caregiver relationship could be terminated and given how close that person is to the child and how the judge has already found by clearing convincing evidence how important that relationship is, how traumatic is that? To subject a family to constant litigation over whether somebody who's standing in as a parent can continue to have that basic relationship. You know, the child support issue is an interesting one and there may be a debate about it, but the I can just represent to you that the code, the Georgia code recognizes the child support can be paid to non-parent custodians. And the reason is because child support goes to the child. It is the child's property. And so however it's supposed to get to the child, that's how it needs to get there. And in a way that issue with the bill, which is a problem, is symbolic. It's emblematic of the problem with the whole bill, which is this is not a bill that was motivated by policy concerns about what's best for the child. This bill is motivated by a concern, a hypothetical concern about a legal challenge that has to do with the rights of a parent. This is a parent focused bill, not a child focused bill. And that is the expressed concern that some advocates have shared. My request for you today, ladies and gentlemen, the House is there's always an opportunity to try to, as I've said before, fix something in the Senate or come back next year, do something later. But we can't allow subsection K in this bill to disrupt a really effective, really beautiful, honestly system that has already started to help families do what's best for children, just based on a hypothetical concern about how this could be litigated. The families, advocates, constituents, they don't want us to break something that isn't broken. And of course, tell us we need to adjust course because of constitutional concerns, we will do that. But let's wait until that happens. I appreciate your time today and thank you, Mr. Speaker, you'll do well. Okay. The chair of the committee is going to use the chairman's time. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none the previous question is ordered. The chairman's time under the rules will be 20 minutes and the chair recognizes chairman of station. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll be very brief. You know, I was just said about what the motivation was to bring this. This motivation, what's motivating me to bring this is not that this was given to me by anybody else. Not that some advocates said this is what we should do. It is purely from the perspective of doing what's best for the child. And that is by ensuring that this statute remains on the books, ensuring that we address these issues, which, as the previous speaker said, he would prefer that we just wait and see what the courts do with it. Well, it's not a 20-year-old Supreme Court opinion that we're interpreting. We have case law from 2018, the Georgia Supreme Court, Justice Blackwell and Patton versus Artis about the Grandparent Visitation Statute that we all care so much about. Georgia's Grandparent Visitation Statute was invalidated in 2018 by our Supreme Court in a unanimous opinion arguing that because the law didn't specify the standards that's included in Senate Bill 86, that it was unconstitutional. So you do have a very clear decision to make. And you care about Georgia's kids and you care about judges being able to award custody under the Act. Well, caregiver statute, you're a yes on Senate Bill 86 today. It's that clear. I mean, it really is. Is that straightforward? I'd ask that if you have any question, you know, he wants to talk about subsection K lines 138, 139 in this bill existing law existing law says equitable caregiver doesn't end up parents rights. So if, respectfully, if the representative wants to change that, bring a bill. Bring a bill to say you terminate parental rights if an equitable caregiver statutes utilized. But that's not the state of the law. This protection is not just about court interpretations. It's about ensuring that our laws that we pass are constitutional. And we know that we're going to be in statute that we know will be in place many years down the road. It's all it truly is all about ensuring that judges can protect children. And a green vote for this bill is the best way to do that here today. And I'd ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Okay, is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Erica Thomas rise, polymer inquiry, is it true that this bill would help to keep kids out of the foster care system. I know that's the gentleman's intent and I think it could be fairly read that way. Yes. All members voted have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of Senate bill 86 the eyes are 97. The nays are 69. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
