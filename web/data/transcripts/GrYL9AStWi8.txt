TRANSCRIPT
----------
Section 16, 546 in 45, 151 of the fiscal to Georgia annotated relating the trafficking of persons for labor or sexual servitude.
Chair recognizes representative Houston Gaines to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I bring House Bill 823. Over 3600 children are sold for sex in Georgia every single year.
The average age victims are brought into the sex trade is 12 to 14 years old and
Atlanta's been named by the FBI as one of 14 U.S. cities with the highest rates
of child sex trafficking. This legislation provides one more tool in our fight in
this state and the fight against human trafficking. We must work together to bring
this evil industry into the light and provide a safe haven for victims across the
state. House bill 823 brings Georgian
along with a recent federal rule
completed this summer. The federal
rule revised the list of offenses
permanently disqualifying individuals
from operating a commercial motor
vehicle for which a commercial's
driver's license or commercial's
learners permit is required. This
rule reflects a change made by
Congress and the no human trafficking
on our Roads Act which prohibits an
individual from operating a commercial
motor vehicle for life. If that
individual uses a commercial motor
vehicle and committing a felony involving human trafficking.
This legislation will ensure Georgia comes into compliance with this federal rule and
will authorize the Department of Driver Services to permanently revoke an individual CDL
license upon conviction if they use the commercial motor vehicle while committing the offense
of trafficking a person for labor or sexual servitude.
This legislation comes on behalf of First Lady Marty Kemp as we all work together to bring
human trafficking in our state to an end.
we must fight back against those who victimize our state and I believe House Bill 823 is another
step in tool to assist us in the fight against human trafficking and I would ask for your
favourable consideration. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer any questions.
You have a question if you care to yield. I do. Chair recognizes Chairman Welch,
do you're left for a question? Is gentleman yield? I will. Thank you for bringing this legislation
And I want to just express my gratitude to you to the members of this House and to First Lady Kim who are leading the charge that has been needed and been worked on by this House and by the Senate for the last decade or so, but I'm really proud of her I'm really proud of the administration for taking on this as a frontline initiative of the administration and I wish her and you all the success of the world with this measure. Thank you for bringing it to the House.
Thank you.
Do you further you?
Oh, you're for one more.
Chair recognizes representative Butler to your left for a question.
Thank you for bringing the bill.
Saturday in Columbus, we did a ceremony to bring attention to the problem.
And I learned following the ceremony that it was indeed truckers that helped save the life of a young girl.
One trucker saw something unusual, put it out on the network and called for backup.
back up and they were able to circle around the truck that had actually lured a young
girl into one truck. They were able to circle around that truck, stop him and keep him from
getting across the state line. So there are great people out there trying to help out
and thank you for this bill because I think it will help as well.
Thank you so much. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being
ordered. The chair hears none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection
to adopting the committee substitute? The chair hears none. The committee substitute
is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was
favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair hears none. The report of the committee
is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of House
bill 823 will vote I. Those opposed to vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on
the passage of House Bill 823. The eyes are 166. The nays are zero. This bill having
received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption
to House Bill 578.
House Bill 578 by President Dempsey of the 13th and others to be entitled to act to amend
Article 1 of Chapter 2, Title 49 of the Bishop of the George Anatetti relating the general
provisions regarding the Department of Human Services, so is to provide for the review
of certain law enforcement conviction down to this bill and referred to the Committee
You know, Health Human Services, that committee recommends
that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Dempsey to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Good morning.
House Bill 578 is a compliance measure brought to us
by the Department of Human Services.
It will authorize the department and its contractors
to receive conviction data on volunteers, students,
and interns utilized by the department and its contractors.
The statute has not been updated to keep pace
with the department's need to ensure that any person working
or providing services on behalf of the department
that has access passes a criminal background check.
The consequences of this not passing actually
will be that the department will not be able to fully vet
through fingerprint-based background checks everyone
that has access to these clients,
the client's confidential information,
the information systems and other information
that is confidential or protected in nature
or required by law,
because current statute limits the types of employees
we can conduct fingerprint background checks on.
The FBI recommends amending the state statute where possible rather than relying on the federal
statute.
It is important that the language not be changed one bit, not one comma, not one period.
It is all been approved by the FBI and we'll go back to them for their sign-off on as well
once we pass it here.
If there are any questions, Mr. Speaker, I will take them.
If not, I will yield the well and ask for your favorable support.
have no questions. Thank you. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? The chair hears none. The previous question is

have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House
Bill 578, the eyes are 166. The nays are zero. This bill, having received the requisite
constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill
bill 816.
House bill 816, member of the Senate of May the act, the 73rd and others to be entitled
an act to amend Code Section 147 for the fiscal to Georgia and to be related to professional
services in which a professional corporation may engage.
This bill I have referred to the committee on regulated industries that committee recommends
this bill do pass.
Chair recognizes Representative Mathy Act to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and good morning.
Today, I bring before you House Bill 816,
this bill simply gives caripractors and medical doctors
another way to incorporate and practice together.
Currently, they incorporate as an LLC,
and if they practice together,
This would allow them a way to incorporate
as a professional corporation.
Mr. Matos, Mr. Everhart, Mr. Reeves,
co-sponsored and passed House Bill 316 in 2015,
allowing optometrist and ophthalmologist
to practice together.
So this is a little similar.
There are no questions, Mr. Speaker.
I'll yield the well.
And I ask for your favorable consideration.
You have a couple of questions if you care to yield?
Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark
to your left for a question.
Yes, ma'am.
That's a generality yield.
Yes, ma'am.
Just a quick question.
How will this affect billing and insurance for patients?
If they go to their in-network doctor,
but they're seen by the chiropractor,
or if they're seen by both the doctor and the chiropractor,
Are they going to get two separate bills from their insurance company?
I believe that that will be how the clinics will set their businesses.
That's two separate licenses.
So I assume it would be two separate billing procedures.
Does the general lady for the year sure is there any way to protect patients by notifying
them ahead of time that if they were to go to a doctor slash tire factor that they
would in fact or could in fact receive two separate bills, one where their
insurance actually does cover it and one where the insurance may not cover it
in the case of a tire factor. Yes, ma'am. I believe that that's what the
insurance department of those clinics would clarify that with the patient.
Thank you. Thank you. Do you further yield? Yes, sir.
Chair recognizes representative Rodgers to your right for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Will the general lady yield?
Yes, sir.
Is it not true in regards to the lady's question that the person does not have to see either
the doctor or the chiropractor if they go to see the doctor, the doctor recommends the
chiropractor.
It's up to the patient's own option as to whether they're going to exercise seeing the
person or not.
Yes, sir.
I would imagine.
And will you further yield?
Yes, sir.
that probably at that time that they would be advised that there would be separate
billing. Yes sir. Thank you ma'am. Thank you. Do you further you? Yes sir I'll take
one more question. Chair recognizes representative Dickerson to your left for a
my question.
No, it was on.
There.
I think it went off.
Okay, it's back on.
Could you tell me what your profession is?
I am a character by the way.
Thank you.
And I will yield the well and I ask for your favourable consideration.
The lady is yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
You
Have all members voted?
Have all members voted?
If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 816.
The eyes are 161.
The nays are five.
This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed.
We are going to read the caption to House Bill 914.
House Bill 914, members, and a clerk of the 147th and others to be entitled to amend Title 43, the Fisherhood of George Annotated Related to Professions and Businesses,
so as to provide for military spouses licensed in other states.
This bill I refer to the committee on Governor and Affairs.
That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute.
You
Chair recognizes Chairman Heath Clark to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House have HB914 before you today.
This is an effort to piggyback on what Representative Al Williams started a few years ago.
In our nation, we're experiencing record unemployment in Georgia.
It's at 3.2 percent nationwide, about 3.3 percent.
And this is great, except for one group of people, and that is the military spouse.
Currently in our nation, the unemployment rate for military spouses is about 16 percent.
34% of military families live paycheck to paycheck and they depend on two incomes.
The military family is ten times more likely to move than a normal civilian family.
They transition about every two to three years.
So what we have today is a proposal that will require our boards that oversee professional
licenses if a military spouse has a professional license in another state with significantly
similar requirements that our boards will endorse that license so that military spouse
can get to work immediately in our state.
This would remove undue burden of having to apply, pay, take other exams over again, classes
over again, a significant cost to these families, and the whole time while they're dependent
on two incomes to survive for their financial needs and stability, that that person is not
able to work when they come into our state.
You compile that with the fact that they're only going to be here for two to three years
in many cases, and if it takes a year or longer to get that license in this state that they've
already obtained in another state, then it becomes hard to get hired by an employer because
as an employer is looking at the investment cost
and they're gonna lose that investment within a year.
So HB914 is a step to remedy this problem
and help military spouses get to work immediately.
There are some provisions that would,
if they violate the professional standards,
they would lose that endorsement
and notify the state that the license originated
that they could take action in that state if they see fit.
If there's a Georgia specific exam that goes over the rules
that are unique to our state and laws or regulations,
unique in our state, they would have to pass that exam as well.
But with that, Mr. Speaker, that's the bill,
and I will stand for any questions.
You have no questions?
Well, I will yield the well
and ask for your favorable consideration.
Chair recognizes representative Owl Williams to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I say I want to thank the gentleman for this bill.
This was a bill that was introduced by me about four years ago as first just for clarification.
It has been well explained the purpose of this bill. We really should not have to be
even standing here this morning. Because patriotism goes beyond saying you a
patriot and saluting the flag and tearing up on certain words. The folk that
have not followed the intent of this bill should be ashamed of themselves
because the only difference in this one is is saying Shell. They had the
opportunity to do right by these spouses from day one and they did
the same thing they had been doing and that's just keep passing them on. Can't do this to people
who have served their country and who've trailed their husbands or wives all over the world.
A highly young lady who was a registered nurse came to Liberty County, could not get hired,
changed professions because they couldn't do her paperwork and after six months of waiting,
She went into another profession.
We shouldn't have to be doing this.
It's bad when we have to make folk do the right thing.
So I don't even want, I know some folk that didn't do right.
Don't stand near me and sing the National Anthem.
And go back home and act like, well, I won't even say that
from this gracious floor.
But it's a crying shame that we have to do this.
The run we cross I would make, and I'll apologize
to the gentleman for not having said this,
but this bill was originally the Tracy Rainey Bill,
named for Tracy Rainey, the wife of now Lieutenant General
Jim Rainey, who was an untying advocate for the spouses.
And to honor her, I've injected the name Tracy Rainey.
She flew back from a graduation at Ohio State
to be here when the governor signed this bill.
And I would certainly hope that when we get to the Senate,
we ask them to restore her name to this bill.
But most of all, we need to let our constituents
who are in position to hire people,
who the bureaucracy seem to run everything,
to do the right thing by military spouses
and do what you should have been doing
for the last four years,
and people wouldn't be here having to have this done.
With that, Mrs. Speaker, I yield the will.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is not and the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute?
The chair here is not and the committee substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill?
The chair here is not.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass?
All those in favor of the passage of House Bill 914?
Will vote aye, those opposed to vote no,
and the clerk will unlock the machines.
have all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of House Bill 914. The eyes are 165. The nasal zero. This
bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore
past. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 486. House Bill 486 by
Representative Washburn and the 141st and others to be entitled to an act to
amend chapter 14 in Title 43, the physical to Georgia and
attended relating to electrical contractors, plumbers, conditioned air
contractors, low-volt contractors, and utility contractors. This
bill I refer to the committee on regulated industries. That committee recommends
this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Washburn to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I present House Bill 486,
This was asked to do with a plumbing license here, a master, and a gentleman plumbers
in advertising.
The bill simply prohibits someone who does not have either of these licenses from advertising
that they do.
What the bill does not do is add any requirement for additional license here for some folks
that might have concerns about that.
It simply says if you don't have the license, you cannot advertise that you do.
It is a good bill that protects these people who have spent the time and energy and the
money to become licensed in this important business and also protection consumers.
So I urge your favourable consideration of this bill and miss speaking on a yield for any
questions.
You have a question, did you care to yield?
Yes, sir.
I will.
Chair recognizes the chairman of the Agriculture and Consumer Affairs Committee Chairman
McCall to your right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Baker. Gentlemen, you. Yes, I will.
It is not true that I'm in favor of you, Bill, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing
in here that prevents a person from doing work on his own property. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the question. Thank you. You have no further questions. I yield well. Thank you,
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

to amend Article 5 of Chapter 2 of Title 46 of the official bill of Georgia, annotated
relating to miscellaneous offenses and penalties, which is just to provide for penalties for violation
of pipeline safety standards.
This bill had been referred to the Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Telecommunications.
that committee recommended this bill do pass
by committee substitute.
Chair recognizes Chairman Hausten to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This legislation will bring the PSC fines
for pipeline operators who in violation
to mirror the federal fines.
Since our state-manned fines have been different
from the federal guidelines,
They've encouraged us for several years to update our fines.
And we have it in the last two years,
they've been deducting points that affect
how much reimbursement we get.
I don't know if we can't reimburse them,
but how much money we get from the federal government
for doing this.
I don't think we really get ever get reimbursed.
But anyway, there's no opposition to this bill.
There's, this does not have any effect
the operators who operate call to dig what this bill would do would give us more money
coming into the state from the federal government and I asked for your federal, I asked for you
to please pass this bill. It has been a long day already, but let me tell you, nobody's
opposing this bill. In fact, we had Atlanta Gaslight testified in front of
committee. They were for it. This has absolutely no opposition. And I would
appreciate it if you vote yes. Any questions? Thank you. You have no
questions. Thank you. And I'll leave you. Bye.
Nobody would dare.

received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk
will read the caption to House Bill 861. House Bill 861, representative wheat
hour of the 119th. We titled an act to men chapter one, title 40, the fiscal
of Georgia and it's heading relating the identification and regulation of
motor vehicles. So as to amend certain definitions relating to commercial
carriers, this bill ever referred to the committee on motor vehicles. That
committee recommends that this bill do pass. The chair recognizes
Representative Weedower to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Colleagues, today I bring to you House Bill 861, which is a Georgia State Patrol Agency
Bill.
Let's say a carriage transport truck is heading south on I-75 and it gets pulled over
and ticketed for speeding by one of Georgia's finest apron troopers.
Unfortunately, with the current definition of commercial motor vehicle,
that same Southbound truck only delivers within the state of Georgia,
that's supervised well state in this cruiser and watches that truck joyfully pass right by.
You see, there are some sharp lawyers out there getting their clients out of citations
because the current definition of commercial motor vehicle states that the vehicle has to engage
in inter and intra state commerce.
On line 11, you'll see by changing and to ore and adding
ore both, this bill will close that loophole
and allow for the appropriate enforcement of citation.
Our troopers have all the capability in the world,
but I'm married with convictions.
We'll leave our troopers without hope of enforcing the law.
Mr. Speaker, I'll stand for any questions.
You have some questions.
Oh, you.
I'm just waiting till they finish piling up up here I mean chair recognized as
chairman Watson to your right for a question thank you mr. Speaker does
gentleman you hi do your bill mentions interstate and interstate commerce
could you explain to me how our interstate system is related to the
circulation of orders across our state.
Well, they begin in the same way.
They just keep cyclically going.
They never end.
So one state to the next, they're interconnected
from pond to pond.
Very good.
Thank you.
Chair recognizes Chairman Rhodes to your right for a question.
As a gentleman, you.
I do.
OK.
I heard in the definition something about a carriage.
Did the old definition include horse-strong carriages?
It did.
OK, does the gentleman further you?
I do.
OK.
Will this create a dualism problem for us?
No, actually, in fact, it does speak to that.
It actually does speak to that theory of dualism.
Sometimes it's either or, but sometimes it's both.
Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
To the gentleman in the well, you and I had a conversation about this bill as in the rules
committee of the day and at that time I asked you a question which you would not prepare
to answer.
So I'll repeat it for you now.
Can you tell me the relation between this bill and its possible effect upon a barotian
four?
Yes, sir. I do believe that the brochure for again if you were to sit Ali by they would have to sit
Ali by and watch as it passed through if they're not equipped with the right tools to engage in the citation
Chair recognizes representative prints to your left for a question
Is it not true that this measure could be a reflection of the concept of dualism?
The gentleman is correct.
Like I said, sometimes it's not one or the other, but sometimes it is both.
Thank you for this measure.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, if there's no more questions, I will yield the well.
Well, you have some more, but you answered the ones from Chairman and from Representative
Prince.
You yield the well?
You did the well. Thank you.
Gentlemen has yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee?
Which was favorable to the passage of the bill.
The chair here is none.
The report of the committee is agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill
8.61 will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines.
all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the
machines on the passage of House Bill 861. The eyes are 163. The nays are
two. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is
is therefore passed.
Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 968.
House Bill 968 by Representative
Abstration of the 104th and others to be entitled
and act to amend Article 3H,
Chapter 3, Title 9 of the fiscal
to Georgia and Tate of Relating
to limitations on recovery for deficiencies
connected with improvements to reality.
Mr. Bill, I refer to the Committee on Judiciary.
That Committee recommends that this bill do pass
by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman effustration to present the bill.
Considering the recent opinion of southern states versus Tampa tank, I want to thank you Mr.
Speaker for allowing me to present today House Bill 968 to you members of the Georgia House.
What this opinion gave us from the Court of Appeals is that expressed warranties that
are contractually agreed to fall under the Statute of Repose, which is an 8-year limit
in time.
So effectively, what happens is, let's say you have a contractual agreement for a 25-year
warranty on your roof.
This opinion means that under Georgia law, that warranty is only valid for 8 years, regardless
of what the contract was.
So it's very important that we bring legislation
to address this, and I'll quote on your desk,
you can see commentary from Consumer Advocate Clark Howard,
who said, I'll just quote here,
now the reality is it's up to the state legislature
when they come back next month to fix this.
Because if you and I, as consumers,
spend big money on our home,
and we expect that the work we have done
is going to be protected by warranty coverage,
then the company that gave us this warranty
can say, well, in Georgia, even though we said we were going to give a warranty for that
long, we don't have to. That's a stunner. And I don't understand how the Court of Appeals
made this decision that they did, but the legislature needs to fix it. So it's with
that in mind that I bring this to you today, would be happy to answer any questions, but
I don't expect on this important issue that will be any quarrel.
Do you yield for questions?
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
Chair recognizes Chairman Fleming to your left for a question.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman in the well.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you bringing this measure,
and I think you would agree with me that we particularly need to thank Clark Howard
for the attention that he brought to this measure.
But also, we need to recognize Jeff Lewis of Arnold Golden and Gregory
and to put it in Carl Lillian terms, he is a rather large bovine in this area and particularly
as it relates to things dealing with altruism and we need to thank him, is that not true?
Mr. Lewis is a partner at the law firm of Arnold Golden and Gregory and a distinguished
gentleman and individual who helped greatly with this important issue and was willing to
testify in your committee, Mr. Chairman and I think that's very appropriate.
Thank you very much for bringing this legislation but to a non-lawyer such as myself and I apologize
for not having asked this question in the rules committee, is this fix the contracts
that were previously engaged in or is this just moving forward in time?
What this does is it makes clear in Georgia law that the objective is for statute of
repose to not to apply to contractual warranties.
That would include warranties that are currently in effect and that would certainly involve
warranties going forward, so it would be both.
Because we're doing this not for us, but for all Georgians.
I think that this is a very important measure to ensure that it's clear that the statute
of repose doesn't apply to existing contractual warranties.
Mr. Chairman, further a year.
Yes, sir.
So on behalf of all the consumers of Georgia, I appreciate your work on this as well as
Mr. Lewis and those other learning attorneys that help educate business guys like me and
And also for all the affected parties, it could be roof warranties, home roof warranties,
copy and machine warranties, anything, as I understand it, this has previously been
agreed to, the contract paid for eight years in excess.
This allows both parties to enjoy the benefits of the contract.
That's correct.
Gentlemen's correct.
And if you look at line 33, it makes clear that that's on or after the date that the
This statute was previously and originally passed.
The statute that was subject to interpretations, yes sir.
I can't answer my questions.
Mr. Speaker, I know the hours late, so I'll yield the well, ask for the member's favorable
consideration.
Gentlemen, as yielded the well.
Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered?
The chair here is none.
The previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the Committee Substitute, the chair here is none.
The Committee Substitute is adopted.
Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable
to the passage of the bill?

have all members voted, have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines
on the passage of House Bill 968. The eyes are 165. The nasor zero. This bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. House Bill 378 was carried forward
from the last day we were here to the next legislative day. It will now be carried
forward to a date certain and that day will be Monday March 9th. That's House Bill
three seventy eight. Chair recognizes representative Henson for a morning
order.
Isn't it, does this compete with Chan easily teach?
I don't think so.
Good afternoon.
I'm just going to make this short and sweet.
So you can tell I'm going to recognize someone.
I'm going to recognize women in construction.
