TRANSCRIPT
----------
Ladies and gentlemen, as the uh chairman
is moving up to the front, um when I was
I'll take prerogative of the chair for
just a moment. When I was elected
29 years ago, um there was two things
that you could not that you could
purchase and never own. Uh, one was your
car and the man next to me to my right
uh, somehow got TABT done so that
forever you never have to pay an abalone
tax on your car. The next one's a much
bigger bite and uh, if anybody can pull
it off, I have full faith that the
gentleman to my right will be able to do
it. So, we're going to hear
um,
substitute to House Bill 1116 LC. I
guess you're going to do bill first.
both the same time.
>> Yeah.
>> You have the mic.
>> Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I I'll
I'll go up to the podium so that it, you
know, everybody can can hear me and see
what's going on. But I I wanted to let
everybody know kind of what we're
looking at here and lay out the the
framework of how we want to proceed. And
um the the idea would be is that you
know we know we're going to have
multiple meetings on this. We want to
get uh the bill um kind of that aligns
with you know the briefings that we've
been having so far out there and talked
about and uh let people work through
copies of it and then we'll come back in
the coming days and allow uh more robust
testimony and input from other sources.
But uh today try to answer some
questions from the subcommittee if there
are any. and uh again uh continue to
work through this. This is kind of part
of the beginning. This is uh certainly
not near the end. So we're we're in the
initial stages, not the end stages. So
Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for
letting me go through that.
Mr. Chairman, you have the floor.
All right. Thank you. Uh
Mr. chairman. Um,
as y'all have heard, uh, the speaker
in his announcement, um,
that we would be tackling and and coming
up with some some ideas on property tax
that we have been on an unsustainable
path with regard to property taxes. Um,
and this is really across the nation.
Um,
so as we continue to hear from our
constituents that uh people are having a
tough time uh having to make some tough
choices.
Uh got another letter the other day of
one of those very very tough choices uh
that a a homeowner was trying to make.
Um we we cannot let people be taxed out
of their homes. So, we have been
searching for months now uh digging up
data looking for a path to help our
homeowners and gotten uh a great deal of
input and uh we we have talked to our
our local stakeholders and partners.
We've you know come up with a a path and
a plan and a place to start here that
I'm going to try to embark on with these
two u two measures here today. A1 would
be a resolution one the enabling um and
I think it's respectful of our local
services and our operations or that our
governments have to provide but at the
same time provides meaningful relief for
our property owners and we don't see
this as a local versus state issue. We
don't see this as a one party versus
another issue or a state uh house versus
senate issue. We see this as um about
the American dream and to help create
generational wealth for gener uh for
Georgians and for their families.
Certainly uh continue to appreciate all
the ongoing conversations with all of
our members and our local partners and
um I think many of whom have indicated
that they would very much like to be
doing some things already on this front
if they had the tools to do so.
So with that, if I could, I'm going to
start with HR 1114, Mr. Chairman, and
just hit the high points and then I'll
roll into the enabling legislation and
then try to try to take any questions.
Um, if you look on uh LC 3969,
is that correct?
I got the wrong LC number.
HR114
H.
That's convenient.
We've had a few ver versions of this
thing. So, um,
if I could start with section one, um,
that authorizes, uh, local governments
is kind of the, uh, the framework for
allowing local governments to utilize,
uh, new growth and new development to
lower homestead property tax.
Section two and section four would
provide some guard rails uh, regarding
uh, some of the non-homestead
properties. uh as we get to um 2032,
section three would enable our schools
to levy up to 2% in sales tax. Um
all up underneath the overall cap. And
section five is our local homestead
option sales tax enabled um not as a a
new tax but as an option up underneath
uh the the existing. And so it would it
would be um used as a roll back for for
property tax as an offset. Section six
um is something that we see local
governments already doing. They add it
to your property tax bill. This would
authorize the local finance assessments
as a roll back uh you know either for
essential services um to be built or as
a uh capital assessment to function uh
through a referendum by the public and
then section seven is simply the uh the
ballot question. So those are that's
kind of the the framework that u you
know is set up to move into the enabling
legislation and that is HB
1116. We didn't quite align that up but
it's it's it's close. Um,
so if uh if I can start with the U
Homestead Opportunity and Market
Equalization Act of 2026,
uh on page two, we begin with the full
exemption. uh starting in in 2032, if
you look on page three down at the
bottom, it uh we start tax relief at
next year by moving the 2000
um
state exemption up to 10,000 and then it
phases in all the way up to 2032 to that
full
exemption.
If you sees towards the the the back end
of that, you'll see some of the things
that are are qualifiers with regard to
how that is is um implemented. Part
three, section 31, um
that that is the uh the sales tax and it
talks about how we uh continue that five
penny cap at the local level. So that is
not anything new other than to to state
that um we will will not exceed a 5%
cap.
Um section 32 is how those pennies are
are currently renewed. Uh existing
pennies uh that would would would be
utilized by local governments. There's a
whole um list of those that are
currently in use right now. Section 33
is um how the renewal would work for any
of these homestead pennies that we
utilize um and and how that would would
operate. We we actually authorize um the
they imposed without an additional
referendum to begin with and they
autorenew as they reduce and entirely
offset property tax. Section uh 34
uh
addresses uh that particular roll back
and how you would do that in midstream
if you had a penny that uh you wanted to
repurpose for homestead property tax
relief and moving to page 10 uh section
four. uh for one that is uh the splast
um and and allows that to be um broken
down and utilized in increments of 0.05%
like all the other sales tax um options
are are available right now. So it
allows a fractional penny there.
On page 12, um
this is the collection and distribution
and the mechanics of the homestead
option sales tax. And it's referenced as
new homestead option sales tax. And so a
lot of that is is legal pieces that are
pulled from other pennies that are
levied across the state. uh and and
would would any way speak to how those
are filled and and how the local
governments would use those to offset uh
property tax on an ongoing basis.
There are several pages.
So as we skip forward
to part six delineates how that assess
those assessments would work. Um again
this enables um assessments for local
services to be approved by a local act
that would roll back property taxes and
allow local governments to bill for
those essential services many of which
they already uh use that uh component.
Now, it's just a a function of your
property tax. You see it separately
listed on your property tax bill. Um, it
also enables capital projects to be done
through the assessment model. And that
would have to go to referendum very much
like your splast or or east would.
Those are pages all the way through to
uh page 27.
Uh on page 27, we get into a little bit
more about the schools that would um
allow the the reserve fund. It's
something that they have in our ongoing
discussions have mentioned that they
would like to see is a little the
ability to to raise that reserve fund up
just a little bit so that they can uh
prepare for a rainy day and any kind of
transition.
You'll also see some of the language
that would go into how we operate with
regard to non-homestead properties. And
there are 36 states right now that
implement some sort of a revenue cap.
And this is exclusive of growth, but it
would put a 3% cap on uh revenue
year-over-year um and allow that to be
exceeded uh by uh vote of of the of the
the citizens of the district. Um
something that we've had a lot of
discussion about and I know that's going
to continue to to be the case. Um the
next section is is very much the same
thing for the cities and counties.
Next two sections moving uh to part
eight. Uh that's on page 32, section 81.
This is where we take the um
the exemptions that are in place and we
allow them to count towards the digest
for our schools. Um right now the local
exemptions are not part of the
equalization or local fair share formula
and this would allow those to be um
utilized in the overall calculation for
that for the the formula with regard to
their local digest.
Um section 82 is a duty to notify so
that if you are no longer supposed to
have your exemption your your homestead
exemption that you you notify the
appropriate uh body. 83 is the penalty
for not doing that. Section 84 is the
database that we try to maintain so that
uh you know it's information that's
already available at the local level,
but this would track statewide with the
homestead exemption so that if somebody
were to want to switch their homestead
from one one county or one place to the
other that there's a way to check that.
I know I tried to get through it pretty
quick and be respectful of everyone's
time. Um again, we have a number of
meetings. I think that uh will continue
uh as we as we discuss this. I really
certainly appreciate all the help that
that I have received. Um appreciate the
speaker's leadership on this issue and
and certainly uh representatives uh Trey
Kelly, uh Chuck Martin, Bruce
Williamson, Chaz Cannon, Ron Stevens,
Vance Smith, Matt Hatchet, uh could go
on and on. uh certainly have had very
productive discussions and input and
assistance from GMA and ACCG and a
number of our school organizations. I
see some of them here today. Um also
want to thank the team downstairs
because David Knight and u our former
chairman Brett Herrell have spent an
awful lot of time crunching numbers and
looking at these things at the micro
level for a lot of our members. And so
we want to continue to do that. We want
to continue these conversations. Um, and
I, you know, just in closing, I want to
re reiterate that I I I really feel like
that home ownership
is, I think you'll agree with me, it's
part of the American dream, Chairman
Stevens. And, um, and again, it's a
foundation for which to build
generational wealth. And um
part of our job, you know, is to to roll
up our sleeves, work with our local
partners, our local stakeholders,
and uh if we have an issue, then
um we go to work for the people of
Georgia. We have a same we have a the
very same constituency and um that's
what we're prepared to do and we you
know, we know that others are are ready
to do the same. So, thank you very much
for the opportunity and I'll try to
answer some questions. I don't know if
I'll be able to. A lot of this drafting
is fresh and so we'll work through it
and make it available and come back and
answer questions and and have more
input.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
represent new.
>> Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
and thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I tell
you, isn't it true that in in this Ways
and Means Committee and subcommittee, we
often look at um very important credits
and other opportunities or exemptions
for for businesses that we that'll bring
the jobs that we need to Georgia. Isn't
that true?
>> Uh, the gentleman knows what he speaks.
Yes, sir.
>> Isn't this one of the Well, I know we've
had other times that we've looked at
ways that that local individuals and
homeowners can uh uh or property
taxpayers can reduce their rates or they
can electively up their rates. But isn't
this the first time that a bill has been
primarily
directed to give the majority of the
benefit to allow local governments to
rearrange over I think over several
years with multiple different tools to
be able to give the uh first fruits, if
you will, to those people who put down
roots in their in their community.
They've invested in a home and they'd
like to be able to keep it even when
it's paid off without potentially losing
it to the government. this bill do that.
>> Uh again, the gentleman knows of what he
speaks. I think if you look back
historically, what we've seen is that um
homeowners, you know, back a number of
years were not where we derived our our
property tax. It was from income
producing properties. And we've seen
that evolve over time. And uh this is
obviously a way to reimagine how we fund
and operate local governments. It's uh
again I think the mechanics of it are
certainly involved and and um you know
nothing nothing simple necessarily about
doing that but again I think what is
simple is telling the homeowner that you
know your your home cannot be sold on
the courthouse steps that we are are
going to fully exempt your homestead
property tax and that you're not going
to have to rent your home
from the government.
>> Thank you. Thank you for that uh that
opportunity to make a difference for
homeowners and and still recognize those
vital services through all the different
ways that have been allowed for local
governments to ease in over the next
what is it five or six years to come up
with other ways to take care of that
without the threat of losing your home
in the future to the government. Thank
you, sir.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Gentleman from Pine Mountain.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman,
appreciate all your hard work on this.
So, a county decides they're going to
implement a penny. Do they do that by
referendum or do they make that decision
as county commission that they're going
to implement that penny? And how long
can that term will that penny last? The
way this is supposed to work is that
they would have access to that penny uh
by resolution
to reduce homestead property tax and um
for a period through 2037 and then it
would autorenew for an additional 10
years for that same purpose. And if they
received more than was enough to uh roll
back the full homestead property tax,
homeowner property tax, then it would
spill over into other property tax for
roll back. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> Yes. Thank you.
Newton said, "Yeah, there we go. Now
we're talking." Um,
last year 2025, the average age of a
first-time home buyer in this country
reached 40 years old. And you mentioned
about the American dream of being home
ownership. Um, the fact that that the
average age of a person now is 40 before
they can actually realize that, I think
that's also unsustainable, which you
mentioned. Um, and a big part of that
cost that keeps somebody been able to
qualify for or obtain a mortgage for a
home is insurance and taxes uh in their
escro accounts. So, I think this is
going to go a long way towards not only
helping folks stay in their home that
are retired on fixed incomes and pay
their homes off, but also to be able to
buy their first home because they'll be
able to more easily qualify for a home
without the burden of the property tax
on that. And I I think it's going to
change uh a lot of lives and a lot of
families for a long time. And I really
appreciate your work on it.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. um you uh you
you would certainly be a subject matter
expert in that arena. I appreciate your
comments.
>> Representative Trey Kelly.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bman,
thank you for the work that you've done
on this. Would you mind elaborating a
little bit about the guard rails that
are placed
um around the amount of sales tax
that'll be charged so that people, you
know, I've heard, you know, people say,
"Well, you're just going to implement a
x amount of sales tax to cover all
this." We are allowing a a modest
increase in some areas, but could you
speak to the guard rails and the caps
that are still in place to the the
amount of sales tax that can be
collected ultimately? Well, right now
local governments levy at at different
amounts and and there are different um
restrictions on what they can levy and
the types of pennies that they can levy.
What what this uh does is enables a
penny to be used to roll back
specifically homestead property tax.
What it does not do is increase the
amount of local pennies available to
local governments. Uh we have uh we
maintain the the 4 cents state uh sales
tax uh maximum right now and this
maintains what is a five penny max for
local sales tax. Does that answer your
question?
>> It does. If I have one followup, Mr.
chairman and I came in just a second
late, but uh to help us address any
concerns we may have heard from local
officials, I know a few years back we
passed the marketplace facilitator act
that added a whole new stream of sales
tax collection for our state and local
government, but do you have any figures
as to what that's meant to our state
since that implementation?
The numbers that we've received are are
upwards uh increases of upwards of three
and a half billion or more um
>> for state and local
>> for for just the local pennies as to
what they're bringing in year-over-year.
>> Wow.
>> Um I do not have the 2025 numbers as of
yet, but that is that is the latest
figures as I understand them.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> And I'll just follow up with that as I'm
looking at the man that carried the
marketplace facilitator. Imagine where
we would be if we'd not had the insight
before CO. So, thank you, Chairman
Harold. Uh, to the man that um
knows how to run a county,
Representative Chaz Canon.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chairman, is
it not true that the way we do property
tax in this state is extremely complex.
>> Man knows of what he speaks. Gentleman
knows what he speaks. Yes,
>> Mr. Chairman, quick followup.
Is it not further true that what this
bill proposes is a way to deliver
meaningful property tax relief through
that complex way of property tax?
>> Uh I I would agree with that statement.
Uh Mr. Representative. Yes, sir. Thank
you.
>> Representative Williamson.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman
Blackman, thank you for the efforts on
all this. And is it not true if we put
it into historical perspective that many
citizens in the state of Georgia that
have been in their homes 40 years their
taxes are actually
more if you divide by 12 their annual
tax bill that's due one lump sum their
taxes on a monthly basis are actually
more than their original mortgage amount
before they got their
they paid for their
>> I think that's 100% accurate. Yes, sir.
Mr. I know that from personal
experience, but um so thank you for your
leadership on that. And is it not true
as I read the bill that this will offer
immediate tax relief starting with these
increased exemptions? Correct.
>> Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, in in
conjunction with what the House is
proposing proposing this year and uh
grant relief? Yes, sir. And then is it
further not true that this starts a path
for this state to move towards 100%
homestead and that we're talking about
the primary residence and five acres a
complete elimination of any property
taxes. This pass starts this year and
depending on the situations of every
local government it can be faster or or
or less fast. Let me put it that way.
But the ultimate goal is uh goal line is
in 2032 that it's mandatory and there
will be zero taxes on any homesteads in
the state of Georgia.
>> Yes. Yes sir. the the the phase in
begins immediately next year and uh the
uh different tools are enabled uh right
out of the gate for local governments to
to start giving uh a a very um uh robust
level of of relief to to our homeowners
across the state. Just one followup
question.
Is it not true that as we travel down
this path, this very important uh bill
that there's no example, no square with
the current exemptions in place, and
many local governments have different
exemptions. It could be a complete
exemption on seniors for school taxes 65
and over. It could be frozen homestead
relief at county levels. be increased u
what am I trying to say
exemptions across the board for local
governments but in no case does any
taxpayer back up along this path all
those exemptions remain in place until
the ultimate goal of zero taxes is that
not true
>> that that's correct even in the first
year that somebody purchases that home
and they're responsible for those taxes
after they sign up for their homestead
property tax exemption. Uh they would
get all the relief in those local
exemptions and then in year two they
would start being exempt fully uh post
2032. Yes sir, Mr. Chairman.
>> It's a slow methodical wellthoughtout
path to to property tax ultimate goal
complete property tax relief is not a
shock to the system. It's a process.
>> That is correct. And we
>> represent Scott Hulcom.
>> Thank you Mr. Mr. Chairman, um
I have some questions. Um just to make
sure that I understand it and to really
red team this. It's a major policy
shift. I certainly appreciate what
you're trying to do, but I want to make
sure that I can one understand it and
then two explain it to the folks that I
represent. So starting with HR 1114
which is the resolution um can you
explain to me
what is meant in lines 28 through 31. It
gives local governments and local school
systems the ability to establish local
grant programs and to appropriate local
tax funds in support of local homeowners
incentive adjustments. What does that
mean?
>> Yes, sir. Uh thank you representative
for the question. Um
right now the state is enabled to return
uh up to 18 $18,000 in added exemption
to homeowners. And um this would allow
local governments in an uncapped fashion
to be able to repurpose and do those
exact same things at the local level. So
if they see a surplus of funds based on
property tax revenue from other sources,
they could rebate or refund those
directly back to homeowners.
It's kind of the framework to enable
that. And I know um Representative
Richardson is uh responsible kind of I
think for part of that original idea in
Colombia County. It's something that
they are are wanting to do I think
sooner rather than later. Imagine that's
probably true for other counties as
well.
>> Okay. Thank you. And then
My next question is um scrolling down to
lines 46 to 51
is that requires
um
the voters to be involved but it states
any increase in revenues
would trigger a referendum. How how
practically speaking would that work?
Well, we we use the word may and then
that's why we back it up with the
enabling legislation. Um it's towards
the back of 1116. Be happy to get a
little bit further in into that. Um
maybe offline, but generally speaking,
the way that is written to work right
now with the two combined is that uh
very much like some other states that
put a cap on revenue uh growth
year-over-year
um exclusive of new growth. So, if you
had a new development or some sort of
new improvement, that would be exclusive
of the of the cap, but it would um it
would limit the revenue collected by non
homestead property tax. It's the way
that it works so that you don't see this
um movement from homeowner property tax
to nonhomeowner property tax. And so the
the idea is to to give them some level
of certainty and uh hold that that
revenue on property tax down.
>> Okay.
>> I hope that maybe rudimentary.
>> Thank you. And and then my um
my last two questions for now would be
one, has an analysis been done of if
this were
implemented with the potential to impose
sales tax charges of either 2 cents or 3
cents. And those are the maximums for
the two different categories
for and this is going to be implemented
at the county level is my understanding
based on reading the bill. It would if
those sales taxes were imposed,
would that compensate or be greater than
um what is existent? What is the current
property tax revenues that are
generated? Has that been analyzed?
>> The offset for homestead as to whether
or not how many pennies would would
actually
be needed uh per local community for we
have done an analysis for the majority
of the counties in which we have uh
numbers and revenue for and um we can
provide that to you. I think uh we we
tried to check and double check those
numbers, but we can provide those to you
um
you know locality, district by district
as to what we have. But again, we're
trying to continue to confirm those
numbers, but we we think we can show you
those. So, yes, we have been analyzing
based on on those models as to what it
would take from a sales tax um to to
offset homestead property tax by
district, by county. Okay, thank you.
And then the the the last question, this
is kind of like a bigger picture
question, is some municipalities issued
bonds and so the impact of during the
transition period if this were to go
into place of how would that implicate
any existing bond um issues or or would
it? And I I guess a big part of it is
related to the question that I just
asked of. If the the revenue stream and
the math is largely similar, then the
impact is probably negligible, but I
wanted to just raise that as a question
because I imagine that be something I'll
be asked by the cities I represent.
>> Sorry, I bit missed that. But yes, that
is a question that we're we're getting.
Um answered it much the same as you just
answered your own question is that you
know, if you have replacement revenue,
then that is something that covers that.
And again, something that, you know,
while we've put the number of years out,
so these pennies have time to to cycle
through to to their renewal date and um
in the hopes that, you know, a lot of
that bond uh is is spoken for where it's
not. I think in certain cases they have
that um we see exemptions that are
implemented at the local level all
across the state and communities are
having to adjust uh based on those
exemptions uh regardless. So
something that is kind of redistributed
to some degree, representative, but
great question.
>> Thank you.
>> Yes,
>> Chairman Don Parsons.
>> Thank you, Chairman. Chairman, I wanted
to ask you, I've been trying to figure
how to
>> frame the question, but you know, I had
mentioned before about, you know, I
understand I understand why there is
such a thing as a property tax, and the
only reason I can think of having it is
to provide to be able to pay for the
services that a a government uh provides
for the people that live there. the the
property owners that live there. They
need to pay something to provide for the
uh uh fire department, the police
department, uh for justice, those
things. That's the only reason I can
think of that there is one. But I can
understand being that you know that with
that need there would would be ones
established to begin with.
And um having said that,
you know, my problem with it is that
there's no precision in how uh the
property owner is actually charged,
you know, for the services that he's or
she is paying for. It's my understanding
in this bill
through through this process, there will
be a more precise uh way that homeowner
or property owners will know what
they're paying for as far as what
they're paying for as far as services.
And I think that's correct. But is that
correct? Just how how does that work? I
guess that's my question.
>> Well, it it's not overly prescriptive.
Um, Mr. Chairman, but I think you make
you have analyzed that properly and and
that if there is a local finance
assessment that is done for those
essential services. I think we
understand that we have to pay for
services, you know, certain ones,
especially those essential and that that
that would function very much like what
you see now if you're paying for water
or trash or, you know, other things uh
along those lines. Um, but that is is
how we we envision it and how we've
worked with the locals to to set up
something that would would do that but
also roll back um any any property tax
owed. So, you know, and and it would,
you know, come through a local act. So I
I think there are some checks and
balances in place.
>> Just to follow up. So what we're looking
for is for the property owner to have a
more precise idea
uh
>> transparent. Yes, sir.
>> More transparency in what they're
actually paying for. I mean, I pay I
mean what my property taxes my wife my
wife and I live in a house. Uh we don't
really require much. I mean, you know, I
don't think we've ever called the fire
department. We've never had the over.
Uh, you know, we we don't have a we
don't have a trash service in Cobb
County. I'm trying to think of other
thing. We have water, uh, which we have
to pay a lot for, but I don't really I
mean, what I pay in property tax doesn't
really relate to the services that we
that we get from the county. I'm just
hoping that there's a more precise way
that people will know what to pay for.
That's kind of what I that's my idea of
what we're looking for.
>> Yes, sir. That that that is uh
precisely. And I mean I think if I can
use your county, Representative Cannon,
I mean I I think he sees this as uh
something that they can do without any
of those assessments. Um I believe is
that you know with with the sales tax
that they have available to them, but
there might be another county that sees
that exactly the way that you're
presenting and that you know they they
end up billing out those essential
services and then it is very transparent
for the taxpayer. And I I want to say
that uh Vance Chairman Smith is is the
one who probably
said that the best. Did you you want to
share how you mentioned that to me the
other day? You said you you mean I get
an itemized bill?
>> Your mic is on.
>> Just itemize that bill what you're
paying for.
>> Yes, sir. Thank you, Chairman, for for
making that point,
>> sir. Chairman Trey Rhodess.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks Chairman
Blackman for your diligent hard work on
this issue. Um done a great job.
>> Thank you chairman.
>> There just a few places and I happen to
have one in my district that rural
Georgia that the county travels to the
next county to do most of their
shopping. Um
do we have a plan? I know there's only a
few of these places in the state. Is
there a plan or do we have a plan to
help those few places that the math just
doesn't quite work?
>> Yes, sir. Um, great question. The
speaker's indicated the the equalization
grants that we've talked about. I think
he mentioned them in our initial roll
out that those um are in play. I think
we what we've also seen is that we
continue to see some of those sales tax
numbers due to marketplace facilitator
go up based on your zip code. So a lot
of times where we you know have
purchased at retail locations that you
know you see Georgians and Americans are
you know more and more they're you know
purchasing uh for shipment to their
homes. So you you see more and more of
that sales tax coming back home. But yes
sir the answer short answer is yes.
That's been contemplated and we know
that it's not a necessarily a tremendous
amount of money uh for great many
counties but there are a small select
few that have that that may have some
unique challenges that we're ready to to
tackle.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Chairman Case Carpenter,
>> uh thank you for your hard work on this.
When I was listening to uh
Representative Hulcom talk about this
this grant money, um I have a unique
situation, I think, in our community
where if we add a penny, our local city
will have excess funds. Would this allow
them to grant money to the school system
to bring down that tax burden? Um,
obviously if it's collected on their
penny, are they able to share that with
the other entities in the community?
>> Those are all those are all shared and I
mean you can repurpose existing pennies
or portion of existing pennies. Okay.
>> So it you know there there's a a pretty
extensive way to
>> to tackle that.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Any other member? Mr. Mr. Chairman,
there's one thing I hope that we can
address. I know that the counties and
cities, well, the taxing authorities in
general, about 25 years ago, we forced
counties to have to start advertising
their increase in digest. There won't be
any need for that, I suppose, with this
bill.
>> There may not be, Mr. Chairman.
>> Anyone else in the committee?
Then we have one person to speak. Um,
Betty, is it
>> what?
>> I'm sorry. I think you know what I was
trying to mention earlier and tried to
speak with all the stakeholders. I know
that there may be some that wanted to
make a a comment or two, but the idea
was for everybody to have a minute to
digest what we've put out here, which is
sort of a complete substitute and then
take testimony extensively moving
forward.
>> Um, in that case, since this is our
first hearing, ladies and gentlemen, we
shall be ready for the next one.
There'll be many, I'm sure.
Get your questions together. And as of
now, the committee is adjourned.
