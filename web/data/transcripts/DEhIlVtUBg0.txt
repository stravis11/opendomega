Good morning and happy Friday. I know most of you are looking forward to a either a quiet or busy weekend but a break from our busy schedule here. It is a solemn day and that explains why Speaker Burns is not here. He is attending the funeral this morning. A trooper Jimmy Sineskar. We'll just all stand for just a moment. The family. He wanted to be with the family. Badge number 436, post 9, Marietta, the funeral is at 11 this morning. We may be adjourned at that time but if you'll keep him and his family in their prayers and thoughts, we could have another moment of silence in his honor. Thank you. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 146 district, representative Shaw Blackman. Thank you Madam Speaker. Morning colleagues. Excited to present to you today Pastor Chad Simmons. And he's joined by his lovely family. His wife Jenny is Sun Hudson and his daughter Liddy. If you help us welcome them to the people's house this morning. Just briefly to tell you a little bit about Pastor Chad. He's an assistant principal at Veterans High School. Long time football coach for the couple of state championships under his belt. And he is the pastor at exchange church in Perry, Georgia, which is an affiliate of our second Baptist. But it's my distinct pleasure and blessing to be able to present to you today Pastor Chad Simmons. Good morning. I've got five minutes and I want to honor your time this morning. This isn't my one chance to be at a place like this. But I want to tell you two things this morning. Number one, thank you for the work that you do. I know that it's hard work. Thank you for answering the call to serve. I want to tell you two things about exchange real quick and then I want to pray for you and we'll do the pledge. The reason we came to the name exchange church was really three Bible verses. Mark chapter 8 verses 36 and 37. Two really good questions are asked all of us in those two verses. What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul? And then the next verse 37, what would it profit a man to gain the world in exchange for his soul? It's a great question for me. It's a great question for my 11 year old son Hudson Simmons sitting on my right over here. It's a great question for you. Second verse, second verse that we choose to, that we felt like God was leading us to was second Corinthians 5, 21 and 22. For our sake, mine and yours, God made him, who's Jesus, God made him who knew no sin to be sin for us so that you and I might become the righteousness of God. And so it's an incredible question that we ask our people at exchange church. What do you exchange in your life for? What do you leverage in your life for? And so I want to challenge you with that today, right? The gospel is the most powerful thing in all of time and space and creation. And so my prayer for myself every day is the same question as myself every day. What am I exchanging my life for? And so what you think about that today, think about the Seznikar family, right? As they bury a husband and a father today who was in service for our state and protecting people in the same line of work that you guys are in, the same line of work that I'm in. But it's a great privilege to be here today. I'm going to pray for you guys and then after that we'll say the pledge. Let's pray. Father, we thank You for this glorious morning given us, God. Lamentation is 3, 22 and 23 says, the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. Says your mercy's never come to an end. Great is your faithfulness, God. We thank You that we woke up to those mercies this morning. Father, we pray for the family, the state trooper Lord, wife, children extended family. Father, we just pray that today you'd be their comfort. God, we pray that today you'd be their strength. Father, we pray that the name of Jesus would be exalted today. Father, we pray that you would be high and lift it up. I pray Father that souls would come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior because of His funeral service today, because of His life, because of His service, Lord. Father, I pray, God, not just for myself every morning, God, as I'm challenged with this question, what am I exchanging my life for? God, I pray that today the men and women in this room, number one, would exchange their life for Jesus because it affects the noun. It affects the forever. God, Jesus is better. Father, I also pray for the men and women in this room, God, that you would help them God to exchange today. God for things that bring you glory and honor. Father, bless the work of their hands. God is hard work. God is a call to service. Father, use them mightily. God, Father, their people chose for them to be here. God, so I thank You so much for their work. I thank You for their commitment. God, I pray for their families who are often, during times of session, God left at home, left behind. God bless their families as most of our people are away. God, and just use them mightily in our state and in our country. Father, thank You for Jesus and the different teammates. It's in the name of Jesus that I pray. Amen. Would You join me in reciting the pledge this morning? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America to the Republic for which it stands. One nation God is visible for the liberty and justice for all. Thank You so much. I appreciate that. Thank You. Let's get this picture. Yeah, we're full of the God. I think we'll have a great time. Thank You. We'll be back. Thank You. We'll be back. Thank You. We'll be back. Thank You. We'll be back. Thank You. We'll be back. Thank You. Thank You. Thank You. Thank You. Thank You very much.

This morning I would like to highlight and recognize prescribed fire or awareness week. Prescribed fire, also called control burning, is an important forestry tool for Georgia landowners. Of Georgia's 37 million acres of land, 24 million is made up of forest land. And if that 24 million acres of land nearly all of it is privately hailed, more than any other state in the nation. An important aspect of managing these forested acres is through the use of prescribed fire. As a cost effective and necessary tool for maintaining healthy forests. Over the last five years, the state of Georgia has issued more than 71,000 burn permits to employ the practice of prescribed fire on over 6 million acres of timberland. Some of the benefits of prescribed fire include lowering the risk of more dangerous fires, increased plant diversity, control of invasive species, reduced tree competition, and improved wildlife habitat. Currently my family has practiced prescribed fire on our land since its purchase in 1912. I learned a practice from my father and grandfather, and in January of this year I began yet another cycle of applying this practice to our family timberland and carrying on the traditions of the past. I've also, if you noticed in the two pictures, I've started passing on the tradition to my two girls. All it takes is some elbow grease, work gloves, and boots, and some Taylor Swift songs on the Bluetooth speaker. I'm embarrassed to know a lot of the words of those songs. So if any of you have any questions about prescribed fire or their practice of prescribed fire, please contact me or let me know or any of the members in the well joining me, we all have decades of experience. Lastly, I want to recognize some outstanding state employees from the Georgia Forestry Commission that are with us in the gallery this morning joining us for Patrick Floyd, Josh Baker, Aubrey Brown, Anthony English, RT Lumpkin, and Wendy Burnett. Now stand up, please give them a round of applause. Thank you, Madam Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you. The chair recognizes Representative Mom Taham from Morning Order. Thank you, Madam Speaker, members. Today I want to welcome to our state capital. I don't know if they're here. I know they're in the capital this morning. The Palne County Republican Women's Group, their officers are here with us today, Miss Lydia Haumark, Karen MacLeod, Lisa Sandy, and Janine Richards. Oh, there they are. Thank you all for coming down here to see us at the state capital. We always appreciate everything you do back home. Thank you so much. Members, please give your attention for morning orders.

Welcome, welcome to the people's house. We're moving on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 959. House Bill 959. House Bill 959, the clerk of the 174th and others to be entitled to amend Article 166 and Title 40 of the fiscal code of Georgia annotated relating the general provisions relative to the uniform rules of the road, so as to provide for a procedure for passing stationary vehicles on certain highways. This bill I've referred to the Committee on Motor Vehicles, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. Members, please give your attention to the well. Chair recognizes Representative Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Chair. Members of the House, I'll bring before you House Bill 959, the move it on over bill, and I know this has nothing to do with the ones that's been eating beans out in the any room, okay? This bill, we passed this bill last year. They had some confusion on whether a motorist had to be present for the oncoming car to move over. So we went back and clarified that. That's the only change from last year. The motorist has to be present. It's just a strand of vehicle you do not have to move over. And that was changing the bill from last year. I'd appreciate your favourable consideration. There are no questions. Chair recognizes Representative Reese to speak to the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Colleagues, one year ago, I stood before you in support of this bill. In this year, I stand before you again in support of this bill. Last year, I shared the story with you of Jonathan Begley, a 41-year-old toward driver and Columbus Georgia, who days just before Christmas. He was helping a disabled Georgia State Patrol officer when a vehicle plowed into him and took his life. He left his children on that tragic day. And for a few days or a few weeks, I had to witness a family that was dealing with a pain that most of us, many of us, are all too familiar with losing a family member unexpectedly. Today, I stand to renew my deeply rooted support of this legislation, this bipartisan legislation. See, I wholeheartedly believe we should do all we can to protect families and those working to keep us safe. On that dreadful day, Mr. Begley was simply trying to do his job. All Georgia's, all Georgia's, need to be protected by the slowdown and move over law. This should be simple and a universal desire of this body for first responders and all Georgia's to arrive home safely. A stall vehicle should not be a death sentence in the state of Georgia. Let's pass this bill with strong bipartisan support. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Gentlemen, as you all did well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none of the previous questions ordered. Is there any objection to the Green to the Report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none of the Report of the Committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes? All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The A's were 158. The A's were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1026. The House Bill 1026 by motion of Hagen in the 156 and others to be entitled to amend Article 3, Article 3, and Title 50, the official go to Georgia and attended relating state symbols so as to designate the southeast Georgia soapbox derby. As the official soapbox derby of the state of Georgia, this bill had been referred to the Committee on Special Rules. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. The chair recognizes Representative Hagen to once again present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. I'll try to be brief here because you've all heard about this bill enough, I believe. But I do want to thank you all for your support, your patience, and your encouragement in my tips to have this bill pass. And I also just do want to say that I'm very grateful to serve in this House with all of you. So the bill does exactly what it did the last two times that you heard about it in this chamber. It would designate the southeast Georgia soapbox derby as Georgia's official soapbox derby. Madam Speaker, I can't imagine I have any questions about this, but if there aren't any, I'd be happy to answer them. Otherwise, that is the bill and I ask for your favorable consideration once again. There is a question the chair recognizes Chairman Camp for a question. Does the General any yield? I do. Isn't it true that in a world full of vices, this is a good, clean, fun activity for our state? That's exactly right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield well. The lady has yielded well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted the way they intend to vote? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 155. The yeas were one. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption of House Bill 1048. House Bill 1048. House Bill 1048 by the way. I'm going to say a carper to the fourth and others to be entitled to amend Article 3, Chapter 3, Title 50. I think the fish go to George Annotetti relating to other state symbols so it does ignite cornbread as the official state bread. This bill ever referred to the committee on special rules that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter to present the bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker. House Bill 1048 is changing the world. That's right, you came down here this Friday to change the world, folks, officially making the state bread of Georgia cornbread. If you'll go in that any room, sweet Alex this morning got up at 430 and cooked a big massive cornbread for everybody in the house and some pinto beans. I look forward to your favorable consideration and I yield for any questions. Chair recognizes Representative Ridley for a question. Yes, sir. Is it not true that from now on you will be known as Representative Casey Cornbread Carpenter? That's right. Don't forget it, baby. You got to have a dream. Chair recognizes.

Representative Kinnard for a question. Mrs. Jimine Hill. I absolutely. Isn't it true that cornbread is something special, but wouldn't you agree that the biscuit is superior? Clearly, I don't believe that I wouldn't have dropped this fine legislation, my for him. One more question. Yes, sir. Would you entertain a motion to strike out cornbread inserts biscuit into make the state condiment gravy? I can I can do with some gravy, but probably not on the biscuit. I appreciate that though. Chair recognizes representative Buckner for a question. Does a gentleman you I do. Is it not true that in Tovette County, the oldest business, well, the oldest manufacturing business is a grist mill that was started in 1840 that my husband has run since he was 14 years old, not starting in 1840, but that was a little confusing. And that he and that we in our house think that the only bread is cornbread and I appreciate your bill. I absolutely thank you and I appreciate what your your family's done to feed thousands and millions, I guess, of Georgians over the years. Why to interest in this bill. I'm telling you. I told you. I told you. You know, all this infighting is something nice to be able to agree on. Something that's kindered over there, I guess. Chair recognizes representative Sains for a question. Don't say don't say hash puppies. Does my friend and gentleman yield I do. I like the end product, but I know that the committee which and came from strongly vetted this bill, but want to make sure nothing got lost along the way. Are there any ingredients to this bill's recipe that could be considered germane by some? Maybe. All right. Does the gentleman further you? Is it not true that this is the best tasting bill this body is considered in this biennium? That's that's I firmly believe that. All right. One more and I'll get out of the way so we can get home today. Chair recognizes representative Anule Weds for a question. Does the gentleman yield? One concern I have reading this bill, it does not specify that cornbread should indeed not have sugar in its ingredient list. Well, so here's what I would tell you. Back in the early 1800s, they changed the way they made that start making cornmeal. And when they did it, when they went to steel mill rollers, it actually took some of the sweetness out of the corn. So adding a little bit of sugar to cornbread actually brings it back to life. So with that out, yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is not in the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? For what purpose does Chairman Martin rise? Paral and entry inquire. State's your inquiry. Isn't it true in the interest of bipartisan ship and to recognize the gentleman from going that on his advancement of the biscuit? There would be room for the biscuit to be George's breakfast bread. If the gentleman so states the chair will take one more parliamentary inquiry. For what purpose does representative Moore rise? Well isn't it true that if we pass this bill today that we'll make people in Alabama upset and jealous isn't that true? Well that would be a good thing if the lady so thanks. Thank you very much. Have all members voted as they intend to vote? Have all members voted if so the clerk will unlock the machine. On the passage of the bill the a's were 155 the nays were 3. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1034. House Bill 1034. House Bill 1034 by Rickson. Franklin and the 160th and others to be entitled to act to amend chapter 4. Title one of the EFISCO to George Anitetti relating to holidays and observances. So it does designate the 4th Friday in November of each year as national sugarcane surrepte. In George of this bill I'm referring to the committee on special rules that committee recommends a dis bill do pass. The chair recognizes chairman Bershatt to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker I'm feeling in I'm pinching for my good friend Representative Franklin who's out sick today. First I want to say happy Friday folks we made it through the week. This is a very very simple bill. What this bill does line 29 and 30 says that the 4th Friday in November of each year is designated as national sugarcane surrepte in Georgia. Many of you are not familiar with sugarcane sugarcane is a long family farm pastime in South Georgia typically in the rural regions where you cook down a cane into syrup. It is fantastic. You many of you have had the bottles on your desks with the sugarcane surrepte in them and it's very tasty. It's really good on biscuits and cornbread so I would appreciate everyone's favorable consideration of this bill and with that I'm going to yield the well. Unless there are any questions. The gentleman has a question or two. The chair recognizes representative mom to hand for a question. Thank you Madam Chair Speaker. Does gentleman yield? I do not. The chair recognizes leader frustration for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. I do not think it is gentleman yield to my friend I do. Isn't it true that this is one sweet piece of legislation for us to consider this year? Yes sir I do believe that is true. Very very sweet. The nectar of the gods. We'll see how this last question goes. The chair recognizes representative Ridley of the 6th for a question. Thanks Mr. Speaker. Does my friend yield? Gentlemen does yield? Is it not true that even though it's not your bill you've got a little bit of conflict of interest with this bill since your wafer first to you as her little sugarcane? The gentleman yields the will. Thank you Madam Speaker. And with that the gentleman does yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee has agreed to? Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted?

If a member has signed up for an afternoon order please make your way to the front. Please restrain your comments to a time period of one minute each. We have a number of afternoon orders. The chair recognizes chairman representative Seabaw from morning order. Colleagues could I get your attention please and we please stand. Please join me in celebrating the life of Irvin van Perlberg, a long time prosecutor, former Mary Edd. Councilman, former assistant district attorney and cobb in the deputy attorney general for the state of Georgia and a beloved actor at the Earl Smith's string theater. He would so have loved our session today. He lost his life last week from a battle with Column Cancer. He was 72. Mr. Perlberg served as deputy attorney general for the state of Georgia, directing the Georgia Medicaid fraud division until his retirement last year. He was born in Brooklyn, New York on February 2nd and came south to attend the John Marshall Law School in Atlanta and found Mary Edd and made it his home. Van was a mentor to many up and coming lawyers and relished that role as much as anything he did. He was active in local politics representing work for on the Mary Edd. City Council from 2006 to 2012. He was very deeply Jewish in his commitment to justice, said Steve LeBogue, Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Column Ameth. He lived and breathed that every day of his life. My predecessor, former state rep Bert Reeves, who worked with Perlberg in the Cobb D.A.'s office, said he looked at Perlberg as an example of how to serve in public office. Former attorney general Sam Olin stated he loved to laugh and he loved to make people laugh. And our Georgia attorney general Chris Carr said Perlberg was a talented prosecutor in trial attorney and was deeply committed to the rule of law. As deputy attorney general of the state Medicaid fraud division, he helped to recover millions in taxpayer dollars and he served as a trusted mentor to so many along the way. I will miss our morning coffee on the Square in Marietta, our discussions of politics and the books we had read. Colleagues, we have lost a lot of great friends over the past several weeks and Baron Perlberg is one of mine. And the van was a Democrat from New York from which he never recovered. But he was my constituent and he was my good friend. We please join me in a moment of silence as we celebrate the life of my friend and a great servant leader of Cobb County in the state of Georgia. Mr. Van Perlberg. Heavenly father, thank you for the life of Van Perlberg. He was faithful servant that brought life into any room he walked into. He loved people unconditionally and his memories will be chairs today and forever. Amen. Chair recognizes representative saints for an afternoon order. Saints. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I come with sadness from our small one by one mile town of Woodbine at the loss of Miss Lucy Gaye who was a dear friend of mine and that in her 80s was still an avid texture and Facebooker and a patron of the Woodbine Public Library and an avid reader and we we mourn her loss and celebrate her life. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for an afternoon order. Good afternoon colleagues. Today I bring you your moment in black history with my childhood crush Prince. He released 39 studio albums for movie soundtracks, four live albums, six compilation albums, 136 music videos, 13 EPs, 104 singles and a sold over 20 million albums in the United States alone. He's received seven Grammy Awards and an Academy Award for Purporay. He was also the person who I first challenged by parents about going to a concert and I told him I absolutely was going to the Prince concert even though you told me I can't and they said leave your leave your car keys on the kitchen table and you could do whatever you want. So thank you for this moment in black history and thank you Mrs. Speaker. Chair recognizes representatives Hong and Tran for an afternoon order. Thank you Madam Speaker. Colleagues tomorrow. Many Georgians of the Asian descent will be celebrating the Lunar New Year. It is the year of the dragon. It'll be a great day spent with family remembering our ancestors eating lots of food and celebrating the New Year. We will be having a celebration here at the Capitol next Thursday. We're going to have lion dancing and all kinds of stuff in the afternoon. So I hope you guys will join us in celebrating. Happy to be presenting a resolution and we'll have a lot of different communities from all over Georgia here. So I hope you'll join us and representative Tran will tell you a little bit about the year of the dragon. First thing colleagues if you haven't booked your spot at a Chinese restaurant it might be too late to celebrate tonight. So last year was the year of the rabbit and we wish us our body to act swiftly and creatively in serving our fellow Georgians. This year's the year of the dragon and as a dragon myself. So if you're either 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 or 72, you were born in the year of the dragon which means hopefully this year as a body we act with just, we act with strength and we act with wisdom. So from my Vietnamese community, Juppemang Nam Mø, happy New Year. Chair recognizes representative Bonner for an afternoon order. Thank you Madam Speaker. Colleagues today I rise in support of our Georgia veterans. Servant as the chairman of the House, Defensive Veteran Affairs Committee is a true honor and it's in that role that I've had the opportunity to witness firsthand the efforts by my colleagues to meet the needs of veterans and the active duty military here in Georgia. Having served in that committee has chairman this session and his vice chair and session's prior. I'm proud of my colleagues' efforts. Every one of our committee members has served, has a direct family member that has served or represents one of our active component military installations. This committee is composed of members from numerous backgrounds, beliefs, and political views. But when it comes to the work for our Georgia veterans, this committee pulls together as brothers and sisters and arms to honor our nation's heroes. Over the years we have taken up legislation before our committee to protect retirement benefits, established public recognition of Georgia's men and women in uniform, provide job training opportunities to ensure we meet the needs of our veterans with mental health and other health care needs, and to make lives easier for service members and their families on active duty here in Georgia. I look forward to continuing to work with you and this chamber in all the Georgians that are interested in improving veterans lives. I'm proud of our history of service and welcoming those who are willing to lay down their lives for us. Thank you Madam Chair. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Chaz Cannon for an afternoon order. Thank you Madam Speaker. I also rise today in support of Georgians who serve. Georgians home to nearly 90,000 men and women in uniform in the top 10 of all states. We're home to 13 military bases in all corners of our state from mountains of North Georgia to the banks of the Chattahoochee to our coast. Having served myself, I know the sacrifices that are men and women in uniform make. Just recently that was made strikingly clear with the loss of our three of our finest in the Joan Attack in Jordan. That's why I'm proud of our efforts in the General Assembly to meet the needs of these Georgians. We've provided the opportunity for Georgians to support their veteran neighbors and their post-service educational pursuits through the Jack Kale Veterans Act. We've supported the retirees by exempting military retirement income from state tax. We've just enacted House Bill 414 last year to establish the Veterans Mental Health Services Program. We've continued strong funding for the Georgia Department of Veteran Service, providing nearly 55 million for the Department which assists veterans in receiving the benefits they've earned, while supporting our older veterans through the state war veterans homes. I'm proud under this gold dome. Despite our disagreements on issues of the day, one thing everyone in this chamber has always agreed on is the need to support those Georgians serving our country. I'm out of speaker, I yield the will. Chair recognizes Representative Matthew Akk for an afternoon order. And David Knight, Representative. Thank you, Madam Chair.
