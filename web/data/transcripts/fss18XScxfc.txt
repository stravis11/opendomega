today that we've been experiencing over
the last month or something like
that as one of the most beloved members
ever of this chamber and this Capitol
Hill, this
Capitol. If you haven't seen
him, it's right down here to my right.
If you would have seen him a few weeks
ago, it's a
miracle. Miracles still happen and
miracles are
continuing. He has some caregivers here
with him
today. Jamie Shepherd's
here. His family's done such
outstanding work and helped the good
Lord perform miracles in so many
[Music]
lives in this state and around the
world. So, thank you to the Shepherd
family. Miss Alena Sheepard, his
grandmother who founded the Shepherd
Center has made a
difference. And thanks to the support
from a lot of folks, will continue to
make a difference in so many
lives. Thanks to Jamie and the staff

[Music]
Well, that's all just about all I have
to say on that. In the words of that
wise man, I think that's about all I
have to say, but not
quite. He should have stayed standing up
there. Remained standing
up. A man who's
um really enshrined himself in the
history of our state in many many ways.
I believe and I think the records of
this house and the records of his
accomplishments, his friendships as he's
built in this room and around our state
and the difference he's made in so many
different areas with his compassion, his
support as appropriations chair, but
mainly as a human a fine fine human
being. U we're glad to have him back
here
today. He'll be
back. He's determined and you can see
that. So, a friend of all of us in this
room, a friend of Georgia, and our dear
friend Terry England.

If you don't think the good Lord works
in mysterious ways, that's proof of it
right there.

prayer by our

allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning will be
introduced by the gentleman from the
172nd House District down in Moltry,
Georgia. Aren't you from Mot? You're
from Motry, aren't you? I thought you
were. I'm just making
sure. That is South Georgia 172nd House
District. Represent Chaz Cannon.
Chaz. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning,
members of the
House. It's my honor to share with you
this morning the Reverend Dr. Hugh Ward
from Moltry, Georgia. Reverend Ward, or
as most of us refer to him as Hugh B,
was born in Jackson, Mississippi in
1940. He graduated from high school in
1958, went on to graduate from Asbury
College in Wilmore, Kentucky in
1962. Soon after, he joined the United
States Marine Corps.
in 1966 and was sent to language school
to become an interrogator. Uh later
deploying to Vietnam with the Third
Marine Division in
1968. Reverend Ward later received a
master of divinity degree from Columbia
Theological Seminary and a doctor of
ministry degree from the Graduate
Theological Foundation. He served 22
years as the senior pastor at First
Presbyterian Church, uh, my family's
church in Moltry, where members of my
family have been long-term members.
There are a multitude of honors and
accolades that Reverend Ward has
received over his many years of service.
Aside from those many honors, the most
important to me is that he married Beth
and me over 20 years ago. He's baptized
both of my children, and he prayed for
me during some of my most difficult
times in my deployments to the Middle
East. Reverend Ward at the very youthful
age of 84 continues to serve his
community on a daily basis. His wife of
many years died could not join us today,
but she still sings in the choir every
Sunday morning in Moltry. They have two
daughters, Mandy and Katie, and five
grandchildren. Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you Reverend Hugh Ward.
Pleasure. Thank you.
This probably is one of the greatest
honors ever bestowed on me in my
lifetime. And Mr. Speaker, I've watched
you on
TV. Uh but you look a lot better in
person.
Love you, man.
And second, I have to say how
heartwarming it is to see the way that
you obviously have held Terry England in
your prayers and thoughts and such a
warm welcome this morning. Sir, it does
me good to see that here in the state
capital. Well, Mr. Speaker and members
of the house, I'm grateful for the
opportunity to speak to you this
morning.
I'm grateful to my state representative
Charles Cannon or as we call him
Chaz. Chaz himself had a distinguished
career in many venues in the
classroom on the athletic field as
graduate of West Point the military
academy on the battle on the battlefield
in the Middle East and now in the public
arena. He's retired Army officer. His
wife Beth is a registered nurse. His two
brothers-in-law also served with
distinction in the United States Army as
well. But thank God their pastor is a
United States
Marine.
Hurrah. And then this is a word about
your work, not my work. Here I bring
words of gratitude for my president and
CEO of Conquer Regional Medical Center,
Dr. James Matney and from our foundation
staff. Thank you for your unwavering
support of the Georgia hard program.
This program has enabled Cocket Regional
Medical Center to expand its service
lines to bring several capital projects
to fruition and assist with the care of
our indigent patients. Our rural
hospital has a feisty effective Georgia
heart administrator named Gina Horn
McDonald. She has out hustled every
other healthc care facility in South
Georgia as she spread the good news
about supporting our local
hospital. I also applaud the work of my
good friend Sam Watson who's across the
way there. Former father, husband to
Emily, and an effective and devoted
citizen. I want you to know something
about my county where I've been a part
of for 35
years. It has given birth to some of our
state's greatest endeavors.
the Sunb Belt Expo. And if you've never
been there, I hope you'll come and see
the great things that happen there. The
Moose Moss Diving
Tigers, Saxby Chamblas makes his home in
Moltry. a YMCA that comprises
65,000 square feet of space, the
birthplace of Ameris Bank, which we knew
as ABC Bank in the early days, a
nationally recognized hospital, and the
Philadelphia College of Osteopathic
Medicine and some of the finest churches
that excel in reaching out to a needy
world. I love living in Cockwood County.
Representative Cannon's father-in-law,
Frank Harrison, kidnapped me from
Decatur and brought me to an island of
tranquility in Conquort County to pastor
the First Present
Church. But speaking to you this morning
enables me to give you a
testimony that I did always plan to be a
preacher and a
pastor. No, I'm here to confess to you
that at one time I actually worked for a
living.
I pedal chemicals for a major
corporation, Ashlin Chemical Company.
One of my favorite purchasing agent was
a man named Larry Moore at Masonite
Corporation in Laurel, Mississippi. He
had been a Saberjet pilot in Korea. But
I'll be honest with you, when I met him,
he weighed as much as a saber
jet. And over lunch one day in a small
barbecue joint in Laurel, Larry looked
over an ear of corn dripping with butter
onto his paisley tie and he said, "What
would you be doing if you weren't
calling on me?" I said, "I'd be playing
golf." And he said, "No, you idiot. What
would you be doing with your life?" And
I said, "That would be a different
question. I would resign from Ashlin and
become a Presbyterian
pastor. If you resign now, he said, this
time next year you'll have a year behind
you. And so I here I am 53 years later
before you. God speaks to us in a
plethora of ways and sometimes we
listen. You, ladies and gentlemen, are
one of the largest congregations I've
ever addressed in my whole life as a
minister. And ever since Mr. Canon
invited me to be your chaplain for this
day. I have prayed mightily that you all
would have wisdom and courage to serve
this great state faithfully. I believe
you will all work for the welfare and
happiness of all to see that justice and
compassion are allotted to your folks
back home and throughout the entire
state. Look, I know and you know we live
in a beautiful but burdened world. And
at times it appears that our poor
bleeding world is stumbling from one
blunder to
another. But we, the citizens of your
state, have elected you, whom we believe
possess a broad vision for tapping the
wells of wisdom, a wisdom that leads us
in these challenging days toward a
future of peace and prosperity.
And so, though I am not your personal
spiritual guide, I'm here to encourage
you in your labors, praying you will
help us all pass on to our children a
better world than the one we received
for God's good and God's
glory. I pray that this day in your
daily
adventures, you'll love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your
soul, and with all your
strength, and your neighbor as yourself.
time. You
stand. I'd like to ask you to pause for
a moment of silent
prayer as you pray for
Terry, as you pray for your
constituents, as you pray for our state
and our nation. Would you pause with me
just for a quiet moment?
Oh Lord our
God, your love is unfailing and your
mercies are renewed every
morning. At this moment, we lift up our
souls to you as honestly and completely
as
possible. As we're able to do this, oh
Lord, fulfill in us what you long to
accomplish, our freedom from sin and
selfishness, our release from anxiety,
lives tuned to truth and beauty,
devotion and
goodness. We know, Lord, that you're the
beginning and the end. You see the end
from the beginning, and you have seen
have seen us and been with us in all the
ordinary moments of our life. You have
laid your hand upon us in ways that are
beyond our comprehension. And because of
this, we have seen for ourselves the
extraordinary ways you're involved in
the most ordinary moments of our
lives. And we come to you. We come to
you thinking of the rhythm of our lives,
the daily routines we have here, of
sleeping and waking, of washing and
dressing, of eating and saying goodbye.
We come thinking of our work and the
boredom and excitement that comes from
our daily toil here in this hallowed
place. In the midst of our thousands of
wakings, in the course of meeting our
constituents, and even in the fractured
moments of our life, we know, oh Lord,
if you speak anywhere, it is here in the
midst of our living. But it is in the
cracks and crevices of our existence, in
the hairline fractures of our life, we
are not alone. We have come to know that
you're the God of victory for us, for
all of us. You're victorious over sin
and death, those things which have a
strangle hold on humanity. Because of
you, we're awakened to a living hope
that after every cross comes a
resurrection. After every winter, there
is a spring. As we commit ourselves to
you, let us go forth from this place
with our confidence restored. That
compassion is able to conquer greed,
that peace can overcome war, that love
is stronger than hate, that life is
mightier than death. With that
inspiration, let us arise and go into
the world to find beauty and simplicity,
to find riches and plain living, to find
self-worth and self-giving. For your
sake, O Lord, we pray. Amen.
I pledge algiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the
republic for which it stands. One nation
under God, indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all. Awesome.
Great message.

We're ready to move on to the rules
calendar. Mr. Clerk, would you read a
caption to Senate Bill 72? 72.
Senate Bill 72 by Senator Brass the 6th
and others to be entitled act to amend
chapter 52 title 31 of the official code
of Georgia annotated relating to
terminally ill patients rights to try
investigational drugs, biological
products and devices. This bill referred
to the committee on health. That
committee recommends that this bill do
pass.
Chairman Hawkins is recognized to
present Senate Bill 72.
Speaker, uh Senate Bill 72 is also known
as the Hope for Georgia Patients Act. It
is an addition to chapter 52, which is a
Georgia right to try act. This
particular bill deals with experimental
drugs and devices for folks that are
terminally ill and have no way to
survive with typical treatments. Um, if
you look on page five, and I'll quickly
go through this. Uh, the first section,
it deals with proof of need. Of course,
it must be
life-threatening. And it's also uh
there's an analysis done of the
patient's genome. These will be DNA and
RNA uh type active drugs. Next section
deals with uh release of
responsibility.
Um bottom of page six, manufacturers
flexibility. Uh top of page seven, this
is not a mandate. It's not an insurance
mandate. Um and then at the bottom of
page seven, the docs are not held liable
for trying these uh techniques, methods,
and
medications. Then the next section
speaks to the release of manufacturers's
liability. Next comes the personal
liability release. And again, it
reiterates this is not a mandate. This
bill is the last hope for some patients
to have a chance to live a little bit
longer. That's the bill. Mr. Speaker, if
there's no questions, I will um
relinquish the well and vote for your
favorable consideration.
They might have a chair and sit down.
Yeah,
you have a question to your right.
Represent Chairlady Silcox is recognized
for a question. Does the gentleman
yield? I do. Isn't it true, Mr.
Chairman, that this bill will allow
cancer patients that have drugs that
been have totally not been approved by
the FDA to try experimental drugs as a
last chance on their life? That's very
true and I appreciate the question. Some
of these drugs take many, many years to
be able to make it to market. This will
allow a patient to a shortcut for a drug
and probably the only drug that will
work for them and a chance for extended
life. Thank you for the question. Thank
you for bringing the bill. I appreciate
it. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Dr.
Hawkins, you have no further questions.
Thank you. The gentleman's yielded the
well. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? Hearing
none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the
committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the passage of
the bill, we'll vote yes. All those
opposed will vote no. And Mr. Cler, will
you unlock the machine?
[Music]
Have all members
voted? All members voted. If so, Mr.
Clerk, will you lock the
machine? On the passage of Senate Bill
72, the yays are 161, the nays are zero.
This bill having received the requisite
constitutional majority, is therefore
passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the
caption of Senate Bill 63 63? Senate
Bill 63 by Senator Dixon the 45th and
others to be entitled and act to amend
part 15 of article six of chapter 2
title 20 the official go to Georgia
annotated relating the miscellaneous
provisions under the quality basic
education act. This bill referred to the
committee on education that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute.
The lady from Columbus, Representative
Carmen Rice, is recognized to present
the bill. Representative
Rice. What Senate Bill 63 does is it
would allow it was a provision to allow
homeschool students to take um their
tests their senior year getting ready
for college. Those tests would include
PSAT, SAT, preACT, ACT, the AVAB, and
advanced placement test in their locally
zoned schools. And so, um, and it also
requires a provision that the school
district would announce and put online
the information for the registration for
these tests. The homeschool students are
willing to pay any fee that a student in
their zone school would have to pay. and
then the school district would pay the
cost that they would of any student
that's within the school. And with that,
Mr. Speaker, I will take questions. You
have no questions.
Thank you. And I ask for your favorable
support of this bill. I appreciate it. I
yield the well. Ladies yielded the
well. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? Hearing
none, the previous question is ordered.
Is any objection to adopting the
committee substitute? Hearing none, the
committee substitute is adopted. Is any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? Hearing none, the
report of the committee has agreed to.
Shall this bill now pass? All in favor
of the passage of the bill will vote
yes. All those opposed will vote no. And
the clerk, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock
the machine?
[Music]
Have all members
voted? All members
voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock
the machine? On the passage of Senate
Bill 63, the yays are 166, the nays are
zero. This bill, having received the
requisite constitutional majority, is
therefore
passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the
caption to Senate Bill 8585?
Senate Bill 85 by Senator Brass the 6th
and others to be entitled act to amend
article 12 of chapter 3 of title 20 of
the official code of George annotated
relating to post-secary education grants
for foster children and adopted children
so as to establish a grant program. This
bill referred to the committee on higher
education. That committee recommends
this bill do pass by committee
substitute.
Representative from Swainsboro, Georgia
down in Emanuel County, Representative
Butch Parish. Mr. Chairman's recognized
to present the bill.
Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Senate
Bill 85 establishes the Georgia Foster
Care Scholarship Act and it provides
grants to former foster youth for
undergraduate education. It sets
eligibility based on age and and
involvement with the Department of
Family and Children Services. The
funding for this program is subject to
annual appropriations and a former
foster youth is eligible for for the
foster care scholarship. If the young
person is under the age of 26 and is in
foster care or was in foster care for
six months after the age of
14, the scholarship will be in an amount
to cover the students tuition, room,
board, books and deducting any
scholarships or tuition waiverss or
federal and and state financial grant uh
grants available to them. No scholarship
will exceed $30,000 per year. Uh the
scholarship may be used at any hope
eligible Georgia institution to which
the student has been
admitted and the scholarship is
available for no more than 10 years
through the completion of a bachelor's
degree or a total of 190 hours or 127
semester hours. And I'll remind you that
the appropriations for this is subject
or the funding is subject to annual
appropriation. Mr. Speaker, if there's
any questions, I'll try to answer them.
If not, I'll ask for your favorable
consideration.
Gentleman has a question or two. Okay.
Yes, sir. Representative Moore to your
left is recognized for a question. Good
morning. Does the gentleman yield? Yes,
ma'am. Isn't it true that as a foster
parent, I'm excited about this bill?
When it came to committee, I almost did
a backwards flip. Isn't it also
true that I wish this bill had been
written 10 years ago? So many children
could
have have uh had a course change of
course in their life just from this
bill. And I look forward to seeing
Georgia's foster children attend and
graduate college. Congratulations. Thank
you so much for your comments. I
certainly think it can have a positive
effect on many of the youth in this
state. Thank you.
Representative Chastain to your right is
recognized for a question. Mr. Chairman,
gentlemen, yield. Yes, sir.
Is it not true that by establishing a
grant program for the foster children
that this Senate Bill 85 directly
addresses the financial barriers that
often hinder uh vulnerable youth from
pursuing a higher education. Yes, sir.
Great program and thank you all. I know
a lot of you have interest in what DeFax
does with our foster kids and this will
certainly be a great handout to help a
lot of folks. Thank you very
much. Gentleman has yielded the
well. We did have a speaker that is
signed up to speak in favor
representative Park Cannon, but I don't
see Representative Cannon.
There she is.
Take your time.
Representative Cannon is recognized to
speak to Senate Bill 85. Give the lady
your attention, please.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you,
[Music]
members. I'm here to speak in support of
Senate Bill 85. I wanted to just bring
to attention that I feel this
legislation addresses really the future
of our state and a commitment that we're
making to our future. I think it's not
just a policy, but it's actually a
promise to countless young people who
have navigated the challenging impacts
of the foster care system. I have spent
a lot of time with individuals who aged
out of the foster care system what we
consider too young before we changed it
to 21. um establishing this scholarship
for those in the Georgia foster care
system for eligible students currently
enrolled under the age of 6 26 really
help us with our statistics surrounding
youth in the Georgia foster care system.
If you've looked at them, you know that
they are quite sobering. They face many
obstacles that can make educational
attainment seem insurmountable. With a
lack of family support, financial
instability, and the emotional scars of
their experiences, these young
individuals often find themselves at a
disadvantage. However, this bill gives
us a chance to change that narrative. It
actually provides these grants to the
foster care youth who meet specific
requirements. The requirements I believe
help us ensure that the financial
barriers do not hinder their pursuit of
higher education. I think it's essential
to a note that this program is subject
to appropriations, meaning that we all
have to remain committed to ensuring
that these funds are available. It's our
legislative responsibility not only in
this measure but in the budget to
responsibly advocate for the necessary
resources to support our youth.
Moreover, I believe for the adopted
children, just as generally
recognizing that whether they've been in
foster care or whether they've actually
gotten adopted, they deserve the
opportunity to thrive, we as legislators
and parents should really see this bill
through to the end. I'm hopeful that the
foster care youth that are listening
right now and that are outside know that
we are committed to your opportunities
to succeed. I want us to all vote in
favor of this bill. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
A lady has completed her remarks and
yield to the
well. That completes all those that
signed up to speak to the bill. Is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered? Hearing none, the
previous question is ordered. Is there
any objection to adopting the committee
substitute? Hearing none, the committee
substitute is adopted. Is there any
objection to agreeing to the report
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill?
Hearing none, the report of the
committee is agreed to. Shall this bill
now pass? All in favor of the passage of
the bill will vote yes. All those
opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk,
will you unlock the machine?
Have all members voted?
All members now
voted. I think all members are voted
now. So, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the
machine? On the passage of Senate Bill
85, the yays are 166, the nays are two.
This bill, having received the requisite
constitutional majority, is therefore
passed.
Okay,

Is there any objection to the adoption
of the privilege
resolutions? Hearing none, the
resolutions are adopted. Okay. We'll be
in recess until 1:00 p.m. This house
will stand in recess until 1:00 p.m.
members, if you have a page, we're going
we'll take some page photos during the
lunch break, like right now. So, if you
have a page, come on down.
All right.
All members, if you'll come to the
floor. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the
bell? Let everybody know we we're
getting ready to get started.
Okay, members, we'll get started. Mr.
Clerk, we we'll uh we just show on the
road with Senate Bill
233. Mr. Cler, will you read a caption
of Senate Bill 233?
Senate Bill 233 by Senator Brass of the
6th to be entitled an act to amend
article 6, chapter 1, and title 37. The
official code of Georgia annotator
relating to behavioral health reform and
innovation commission so as to revise
the subcommittees. This bill
haven't this bill haven't been assigned
to the committee on public and community
health. That committee recommends that
this bill do pass.
All right, members, if you'll all please
take your seats and uh give the lady
who's coming to the well your attention
as she presents Senate Bill 233.
Represent Sharon Cooper is recognized to
present Senate Bill 233. Chair Lady
Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies
and gentlemen of the House, I'm bringing
Senate Bill 233. Uh this was requested
by Commissioner Tanner as he runs our
department of uh behavioral health and
disabilities. U this is about a
commission that is housed there under
him, the behavioral health reform and
innovation commission. it has been made
up of 24 members and he uh asked that be
extended to 30. Uh when he took over the
commission was made up of mainly of
health professionals uh psychiatrists
different kinds of doctors uh forensic
psychologists licensed clinical
behaviorists and what they found out
they were really lacking. and people who
had experienced mental health problems
themselves or they have family members
or they had lost a family member uh due
to fentanyl or drugs and this bill
corrects that. It adds six members and
they are specifically listed as someone
has lived experience having survi
survived the disease of addiction or
someone who has lost a member of his or
her immediate family to drug overdose or
fentanyl poisoning. Uh so I would ask
for your favor consideration. I believe
that will make the commission more
inclusive and it did extend it for a
year. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will
leave the well if there are no
questions. You have one question. Yes,
ma'am. Representative Gamble, to your
right, straight out in front of you.
Does the gentle lady yield? I do. Is it
not true uh that Commissioner Tanner and
the Georgia Council on Recovery have
been very instrumental working with you
and so many of us on this piece of
legislation. This is good for all of
those Georgians, over 900,000 Georgians
that are in in recovery and we certainly
want to see that number increase, and
this will help to do that. I I
appreciate the uh question from the
member. You what you say is certainly
true and Commissioner Tanners has been
doing a excellent job not just about on
mental health issues but also with our
disability community. So once again I
will yield the well and ask for your
favorable vote. Thank you
ladies yield to the will. We have a
couple of speakers. I'm going to
recognize Representative Park Cannon and
Representative Mary Margaret Oliver.
Representative Cannon, I gave
Representative Oliver heads up about
five minutes. Max, can you do it in that
length of time? Go for it.
Representative Park Cannon is
recognized.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You're excited
about this bill. Really looking forward
to having some more members who are able
to help us on this innovative
commission. I do think that it's
important that we consider possibly in
the future adding paranatal providers to
it since we are dealing with mental
health outbreaks of those who have
recently been pregnant. But I am here in
support of it. I have spent time with
many individuals who unfortunately have
battled addiction, who have experienced
overdose, and who are impacted by the
decision-making here today because the
challenges surrounding behavioral health
are multifaceted. We must draw the
insights of those who have navigated
those challenges firsthand. Their
discussions will enrich our lives and
make our policies more compassionate.
It's necessary to commit continue this
important work towards meaningful
behavioral health reform that we have
started many years ago. Many of you will
see this is not a sprint. This is a
marathon. It requires our sustained
efforts, our commitment, and our
patience with these individuals. I think
this legislation does have some
structural changes, but it's really
fostering a culture of support and
understanding for those experiencing
addiction. I'm just grateful for this
bill and invite you to vote yes with me.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you for your comments. Ladies
yield as well. Representative
Representative Mary Margaret Oliver is
recognized to speak to the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also rise in
support of Senate Bill 233. I've had the
privilege of serving on this commission
for several years. And for those of you
that might be new to the House, I'd like
to tell you why this particular effort
has been uniquely successful with the
support of the governor, with the
support of the speaker, and with the
support of the lieutenant governor. You
may be aware, I think you are aware that
this effort began under David Rston who
came forward and told us members that he
was tired of not being able to help the
folks in his district with serious
mental illness. He always said the same
thing. He always said he was tired of
not being able to help people. He said
that his wife always told him that
you've got to help people and not only
think about elections. He said, "We're
going to pay for what we do as we go."
And he said, "It's going to be
bipartisan." And he stuck by that. And
others have stuck by that, too. The
reason this has been successful is that
there was a unified effort of
leadership. We have over the last four
years contributed over half a billion
dollars of new mental health monies.
That's prior to whatever we'll make some
progress with hopefully in this fiscal
year 26 budget. It also gives credit to
the structure which we're changing a
little bit in this bill, a positive
change. The structure was not based on
political appointees. There only one or
two House members, only one or two
Senate members that's not changing. It
was the professionals in the field from
your districts in different categories
of caregivers. and the substantive work
that's gone on through the subcommittee
process has been extremely strong based
on professional expertise and not
political agendas. The additions to the
commission as set forth in 233 are
recognizing the very strong
contributions necessary contributions
from the addiction community across
Georgia. This has always been a mental
health and addiction commission effort
and the addition of additional addiction
related professionals and addiction
related family members is strong. We
also are having an ongoing discussion.
This is coming out of CHOA. It's coming
out of your health care providers.
What's the difference between the
developmentally disabled and the
mentally ill? And that conflict in some
cases that combined diagnosis in other
cases has reach has reached us and we
are particularly with uh leadership
that's coming in a wide variety of ways
from the settlement of the civil rights
case in relation to the services to the
developmentally disabled. This is a
strong addition to the very strong
history and basis. We're extending the
commission for one year. Many
commissions I've served on, I've only
served one year. They may or not even
met. But this commission is unique and I
ask for your support. Particularly the
support of uh Commissioner Kevin Tanner
who as a good leader does many many
hours of work if not most of the work on
this commission. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies yielded well. Thank you for your
comments. That completes our discussion
on Senate Bill 233. Is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered? Hearing none, the previous
question is ordered. Is any any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the
passage of the bill? The hearing? None.
Board of committees agreed to. Shall
this bill now pass? All in favor of the
passage of the bill, we'll vote yes. All
those opposed will vote no. And Mr.
Clerk, will you unlock the
[Music]
[Music]
machine? Have all members voted?
all members voted. If
so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the
machine? On the passage of Senate Bill
233, the yays are
164, the nays are two. This bill has
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore
passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the
caption to Senate Bill 9, SB9?
[Music]
Yeah, it was just sitting there a minute
ago.
That's the confusion. You gave me
Senate Bill Nine by Senator Alberts, the
56 and others be titled act to amend
part one of article 3, chapter 12 of
title 16 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating the general
provisions relative to obscenity and
related offenses so as to repeal and
replace code section
161280. This bill haven't been referred
to the committee on technology
and and infrastructure innovation. And
that committee recommends this bill do
pass by rules committee substitute.
Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Chair recognizes
Representative Brad Thomas to present
the bill. Representative Thomas. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to
present Senate Bill 9. Uh this bill was
passed through technology infrastructure
innovation committee. Uh and it was a
house priority last year as
HB986. Unfortunately, it didn't quite
get across the line in the Senate. So,
let's start by discussing this the crime
that's listed in this bill. In order to
be found guilty of of uh fraudulent
election interference, you have to do
meet the following criteria, and I'm
going to talk through them by line
items. Line items 38 for 43 defines who
this applies to and is specific to
political organizations. We've roughly
estimated that this actually would apply
to somewhere between 2 and 4,000 uh
people statewide. It has to be
materially deceptive. In order to do
that, one, it has to depict a real
individual that speech or conduct that
did not occur in reality. And it has to
appear to a reasonable observer to be
authentic. Three, it has to be uploaded
and disseminated with the knowledge of
its falsity, which is one of the highest
standards that you would have to prove
in court. Uh, it again it also has to be
in line 46. It has to be within 90 days
of an election, which is really
important. This is a piece of
information that 90 days tightly
prescribes it to the election process,
which makes sure that it it doesn't hit
any constitutional
issues. Say you do meet all those
criteria. If you do, this is the major
uh major change from last year's bill is
the first offense is a misdemeanor. The
second offense is a felony. Last year,
the first offense was was a felony.
Uh, so what's not covered as a crime in
this
bill? Lines 55 through 57. First
amendment protected speech is not. And I
want to make that very clear. First
amendment protected speech, such as
satire and parody as listed on line 56,
aka memes, are explicitly written as not
applying in to this bill.
Um, if you create any media and provide
a disclosure of its generated, you can
create a a a image or um a video or
deceptive media is but it's not
considered deceptive if you just put a
disclaimer on it that simply says it's
AI generated and it defines what that
is.
Um, so here's another one that I got.
I I hate to tell y'all, but people like
me might need a little bit of help
looking good um
visually. Thank you. U and we may use AI
to make us look a little bit better in
particular
media. This is explicitly once again
lines 134 136 minor editing is excluded
from this bill.
And again, if you can create content 97
days out and it's not affected by this
bill. And I want to make something else
clear. This is about visual and audio
files. So text that you would create.
Say you use an AI and you create text
that is not included in this bill. It's
just visual and
audio. So let me boil this down for for
y'all. If you
get accused of a misdemeanor first
offense in this, this is what you would
have to do. You'd have to be one of
around a couple thousand people in the
state that are specifically tied to
political action campaign or committees,
political compi committees, or as
defined in the bill. You'd have to
create an AI generated video audio and
distribute it with the intent to deceive
and throw an election. You'd have to
upload it within 90 days of an election.
you you didn't put you didn't put a
simple disclaimer on it that said it was
AI generated and it had to be the level
of quality that it was to deceive other
vot uh to deceive electorate and with
that Mr. Speaker I feel like I've
presented the bill I'd be happy to take
questions
gentleman has a couple of questions uh
representative Lisa Campbell to your
left is recognized for a question thank
you Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman
yield? I do. Um, can you just uh verify
first uh what LC number we're looking
at? Uh 492385s.
No,
I'm I'm honest. Okay, I got the it's
maybe LC. You know what? I'm sorry. I
know grabbed the wrong one.
It's a different Thank you,
Representative Williams. Although I
would tell you my my bill number is
correct that I presented. It's LC56041S.
Oh 1s. Okay. Thank you. And um will you
accept another question please?
Absolutely. So I just want to make sure
I understand any and all use of AI and
campaign materials regardless of the
scope and span is allowable as long as
there is disclosure. Um I wouldn't say
it's even more tightly prescribed than
that. um within 90 days of an election.
It is completely fine. It's not
deceptive if you put a label on it that
says it's AI generated. So, thank you.
And then um and then minor editing. Um
would something like if you are using AI
on yourself or someone else uh say you
edit um a facial feature, would that be
considered minor editing or not? No,
because it doesn't change the substance
of the actual image in and of itself. uh
that that and that is I can find the
line item in here where it's explicitly
written but it is explicitly excluded.
Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to
clarify what I'm reading is line 140
part B minor editing of a piece of
existing audio or visual it which is a
little broad. So I'm just trying to
understand maybe in a practical example.
Uh, I I would say if you've seen some of
my campaign mailers, um, it I need a
little minor editing that doesn't
substantially change the the observer's
understanding of such media. And that
that that's the point of making sure
that a lot of Photoshop is regularly
used. And I don't mean to use Photoshop,
but it does have an AI component in it
now. And let's make sure we don't we
don't inadvertently capture that. And
would you allow just a a tiny bit of a
further clarification on this? Sure. Um
my question is really trying to
understand um in past C campaigns we've
seen in opposition oppositional
advertising changes to your opponent's
features not your own your
opponents would that be considered minor
I I wouldn't say that it substantially
changes the observer's understanding of
the media meaning like if they change it
to the point where they've now have that
individual committing some crime that
they didn't commit then that would be a
substantial change, but minor image
changes wouldn't apply to this bill.
Thank you. Yep.
Gentlemen, you representative Rice to
your left is recognized for a question.
Thank you, speaker. Do you yield? I do.
Is it not true that by defining and
criminalizing the use of materially
deceptive AI generated media and
campaign advertisements, this bill helps
protect the integrity of Georgia's
elections and ensures that voters
receive accurate information? I I I
would agree with that and and you know,
we we talked a lot. What people don't
realize is we spent a significant amount
of time on this last last session um
with regards to making sure that we did
not feel in any way we infringed on some
first amendment rights. But if we have
multiple videos of of elected officials
that have deceptive material in it and
there's no possible way to identify
who's who actually I would ask you whose
first amendment rights have been taken
away. If no one can believe what you
see, then then whose first amendment
rights has actually been taken away?
It's been the person that did something
that was proper or you know operated
within the bounds of what the law is.
This is just simply to say this it's to
let the electorate know that what they
have is AI generated or it happened in
reality and I think that that's an
acceptable place to be in a first
amendment situation.
And thank you for the question.
You have one more question if you if you
want to take it and then we have some
speakers on the bill. Uh yes, Mr.
Speaker, I'd be happy to take any
questions. Representative Jasmine Clark
to your left is recognized for a
question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does a
gentleman yield? I do. All right. So,
we've had this conversation a couple of
times. we did um about the 90 days and I
understand that the um I guess
explanation for why you would um say if
it's 91 days you can do all these things
but as soon as you hit the 90-day
threshold it does I understand that it's
something about legally how you can tie
it to an election but could you not tie
it to elections based on the content of
what is being presented and doesn't this
90day days really handcuff us from
protecting people because
um yeah, we're already seeing ads for
2026 now and I'm just a little worried
that this still allows that deceptive
material into the frey. Are you So, it's
a it's a fair question. Uh the 90 days
has been something that we are now have
21 states that have adopted some version
of this bill. Um I would say that the
90-day rule typically is in there to tie
it to make sure it's specific to
election, but it also gives at within 90
days. You know, a lot of campaigns don't
have a lot of money. They're not a a US
sized race that have the campaign funds
to be able to to combat this type of of
false or deceptive media. So, uh,
keeping it at 90 days at least gives an
opportunity for time for the campaigns
to come back and put something out
instead of it just being a last minute
thing two days before the election day
and it throws an election and that's
really what this is about. So, thank
you. Did you further yield?
Real quick question. Absolutely. I
understand that but I think what you
just said is what my concern would be.
If a campaign that is very well funded
has 300 days or whatever 365 minus 90
is, I don't feel like doing math. They
have that many days to make deceptive
materials about you and then it's just a
90-day moratorum. How do you undo that
damage? And a lot of times in the in the
law we use the word reasonable and why
couldn't we just say if it could be
reasonably
um assumed I don't assume is not the
right word but you know tie it to a
reasonable expectation that this was
about an election so therefore you
cannot do it this way. I'm just
wondering is there a workaround to I
think that again we get into this really
question about first amendment rights
and we want to make sure that we're
doing everything we can and by tying it
to an election of the date we did it
only further tightens the
the I guess guard rails to make sure
that if if it does go across to the
judicial branch and they want to take a
look at it it's very tightly prescribed
we feel like it can survive uh and it
will eventually we will get some more
guidance from the judicial branch on
what's acceptable and what's what's not.
But right now, I have to tell you this
is one of the most tightly prescribed
bills in the United States. So, thank
you for the question. Thank you.
Uh with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the
well.
Gentleman is yielded the
well. That completes the uh initial
comments on the bill. We have some folks
signed up in favor of and those are
opposed. I'm going to recognize repres
Representative Charlie Bird to speak to
the bill. Representative Bird.
Give the lady your attention, please.
Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My fellow
patriots, I rise in fierce opposition to
Senate Bill Nine, a bill straight out of
Governor of California's
playbook, designed to crush free speech
and silence. We the people. It isn't
just bad policy. It is
anti-MAGA, anti-America attack on our
rights. Last year, Georgians stopped
HB986. Now the radical left is back with
SB9, sneaking it through procedural
tricks because they know we would never
accept this tyranny
outright. It's California's liberal
style censorship criticizing,
criminalizing deceptive media within 90
days of an election. Who decides who's
deceptive? Win 90 days of the election.
Who decides who's deceptive? A
government board picked by the same
establishments that's used to us before.
This isn't freedom. It's Soviet style
control.
SB9 could jail you for so-called
deception, exposing
corruption on felony charges up to five
years. We already have deception laws
for lies that harm. This is silencing
disscent plain and simple. If it passes,
Georgia becomes like California.
the centers in
handcuffs. To my Republican colleagues,
do you want to be the ones who brought
California liberalism agenda here to
Georgia? This is about liberty itself.
It is not moving voting no. I'm
rejecting this
unconstitutional assault on the first
amendment with everything I've got. When
we come for our first speech, free
speech, I am never going to stop
fighting. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well.
Lady has yielded the well. We have
several other speakers on the issue.
I'll recognize Representative TR for
comments on Senate Bill 9.
Representative Tran. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I rise
today in favor of SB9. And to clarify, I
may look like an AI deep fake of the
minority whip and the only Filipino
member of the House, but I am indeed not
an AI deep fake of these members.
In all
seriousness, just a year ago, we saw New
Hampshire during the New Hampshire
presidential primary, a voice robocall
went out to Democratic voters that
imitated President Joe Biden's voice and
told Democratic voters not to go out and
vote. And that is the danger of AI that
poses us today. As we are in an arms
race within the election campaign
season, those with the best technology
can generate AI at the fastest levels,
with the deepest of fakes, with the most
realistic renderings of ourselves. And
one day we are going to reach a point
where technologically AI can generate
these deep fakes at a speed where in a
microscond they can generate 365 days
worth of campaign material to be used
against us or used to defend us. So, we
have to be concerned because I'm
concerned about the human element of our
elections, the most important part of
our elections where we go out to voters
and we shake their hands, we listen to
their concerns, we meet with them one
onone. But if we hit a point in which we
base our elections and win our elections
on AI technology, we will lose that
human element. we will lose the most
precious part of our democracy and that
is hearing from our constituents. So
with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well
and ask the members to vote in favor of
this bill.
The gentleman has yielded the
well. Representative Sanchez is
recognized to speak to the bill.
Represent Sanchez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise also to
uh speak in favor of Senate Bill 9. I
believe this is a great bill that helps
ensure elections are not riddled with
misinformation, distractions, and
interference. In fact, uh I was actually
talking to my family just the other day
about this, how why we don't have
labeling of AI when you see it on social
media. And this I'm glad that this bill
has this measure in it uh to help with
that because a lot of people struggle to
differentiate between something that's
AI and something that's real. and that
can have a huge impact not just on our
elections but on daily life in general.
And so I'm glad to have this measure in
the bill for our election process at the
very least. Uh I know some of my
colleagues brought up legitimate
concerns about the 90-day window and I
do agree that it should be longer, but I
do think we have to start this now
because we are currently have elections
right now in my county. We have a
special election in less than a month,
right? And so we need and we have
elections this November as well. So we
need to do something as soon as possible
around this issue because it's it's a
growing in intensity and danger and just
in general when in regards to artificial
intelligence we have to remember that
you know there's a lot of great uses for
this technology medical uses efficiency
in certain sectors but we always have to
make sure when new technology emerges
that we balance with the good and the
bad that comes with every new
technology. We have to make sure that we
keep Georgians safe and well informed,
especially in the times that we're in
right now. I believe we need to make
sure we target our use of AI to only
where it's truly needed because as many
of you know, AI has become a huge drain
on our energy and resources,
specifically when it comes to
electricity demand and water
consumption. And so it is a great tool
but some studies have actually shown
that just to train the model of this
kind of uh technology like open AAI's
GBT-3 it consumed over 1,200 megawatt
hours of electricity which is the
equivalent of powering 120 homes in one
year a carbon dioxide emission of 552
tons. The study was funded by Google who
is implementing their own AI program. So
it might even be
underounted. Throughout our history, we
have
seen new technology emerge that makes
life easier. But with every invention,
we must learn the consequences of
unchecked unregulated use. Our
environment, our air, our water cannot
be disregarded in the pursuit of turning
our family photos into studio Giblly
characters. If you get that reference,
you're a real one. Once again, I support
this bill as a great first step in
setting up guardrails for this important
emerging technology. I hope that we
continue working on this issue to
continue to ensure the safety and
well-beings of Georgians and I urge you
to vote yes on SB9. Thank you. I yield
the well, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank
you. The gentleman's yielded the well.
Representative Beckles.
The lady's recognized to speak to Senate
Bill 9. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Today I rise in support of Senate Bill
9, a common sense measure to protect our
elections from AI
manipulation. This
bill this bill does two simple things.
First, it makes it illegal to knowingly
publish fake AI generated videos or
audio that falsely show candidates
saying things they never said, but only
when done to deliberately deceive voters
within 90 days of an election.
Secondly, it creates clear rules for
campaigns that want to use AI content.
They can still use it, but must include
a disclaimer that clearly identifies
what is AI
generated. This isn't about restricting
free speech, political satire, parody,
art, or journalism remains fully
protected. As technology advances, our
laws must keep pace.
This targeted bill protects voters from
deception while preserving our
fundamental freedoms. I urge your
support. Mr. Speaker, if I may, full
disclaimer. I did ask my AI cousin
Claude to generate a floor speech that
you guys can understand. Thank you, A.
Luell.
[Music]
Thanks, Claude.
[Music]
Whoever Claude
is. Representative Williams, you know
who Claude is? I didn't think you
did. Chairman Todd Jones is recognized
as speaker of the bill. Representative
Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Vance, I have
your blue sheet up here. I'll bring it
back for
you. This is a serious subject and a
serious day. I'm just going to take a
few minutes of your time, but there's
been a couple of things lobbed here that
need to be addressed. The fact is is
that we are responsible in so many
different ways to 10.7 million Georgians
to ensure that when they go into the
election box, they can trust that the
election box is in fact filled with 100%
integrity. We always argue about whether
or not there should be paper ballots,
machine ballots, machine score. We talk
about audits. We talk about everything
about what the voting process is. But I
would argue with you, the most important
thing we can do for our constituents is
to ensure that when they go into that
box, when they are saying to themselves,
I'm going to cast the ballot for this
individual or for this referendum, the
most important thing we can do for them
is make sure that we have given them
accurate information.
We cannot live in a world where our
constituents, 10.7 million Georgians,
almost 6 million voters are asking
themselves, "What I just saw, is it real
or is it not real?" At that point, the
integrity of the election, no matter you
if you fall on paper ballots or machine
ballot, is
gone. We have to be able to vote towards
what we know to be right. And let's talk
about
American. We talk about the
constitution. The constitution speaks to
the idea that if an individual is
charged with something, they will face a
jury of their peers. This does that. But
it does it in such a way that it has the
most loftiest bar. They must do it with
specific intent. It must be proven that
they knew the falsicity of it. They must
have taken the action to download that
video or that image. And it must be done
in such a way that a reasonable person,
a reasonable individual would say this
is in fact something that would affect
the election or infect the integrity of
the election or the administration of
the election. So, I ask you
this. Alabama, our sister to the West,
and 21 other states, but I'll focus on
Alabama, have taken the exact same
language and unanimously put it through
both chambers, and a Republican governor
signed
it. A previous speaker spoke to the idea
of liberty.
We can all go on and on and I'm sure
many of you have in your election, in
your town halls, and any comments that
you make to your peers and to your
constituents all about liberty and the
fact that you've been called to serve in
this chamber. You were called because
you believed in the Constitution and you
believed in making sure that everyone
has the opportunity to in fact pursue
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. What this document does is
ensure that everything that our
constituents see is in fact something
they can in fact take to the bank. And I
ask you to to support this bill. I ask
for your favorable consideration and Mr.
Speaker, I yield the
well. Gentleman has yielded the well.
That completes our discussion on Senate
Bill
9. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? Hearing

will you unlock the
machine? Have all members voted? For
what purpose? Representative
Representative Al Williams rise.
Parliament for inquiry.
State your inquiry. Sir, is it not true
that the last speaker I wanted to make
sure mentioned that that leftleaning
radical liberal state of Alabama passed
this br this bill? That's what I heard
him say. Thank you, sir. Gentleman's
correct. He he'll have to correct that
in the media. I won't correct it for
him. Now, we have great friends over
there. Specled better is a fine man. And
I'm certainly he does a great job in
that Alabama
House. Have all members
voted? All members voted this. So, Mr.
Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the
passage of Senate Bill 9, the yays are
152. The nays are 12. This bill having
received the requisite constitution
majority is therefore
passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read a
caption to SB69, Senate Bill 69?
Senate Bill 69 by Senator Kenny the 18th
to be entitled an act to amend title 7
and article five of chapter 11 and title
9 of the official code of Georgia
annotator relating to banking and
finance and depositions and discovery
under the Georgia civil practice act
respectively so as to regulate third
party litigation financing practices in
this state. This bill having referred to
the committee on rules that committee
recommends that this bill pass by rules
committee substitute LC 49
2394S. Representative James Burchett is
recognized to present Senate Bill 69.
Represent Burchett.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon,
colleagues. I rise to give you my
support and ask for your vote on Senate
Bill 69. Senate Bill 69 seeks to fill a
hole in the code. Currently, there are
no provisions whatsoever that outline
regulations on um litigation financing.
Nowhere in the code will you find it.
So, what this bill seeks to do is put
some guard rails and regulation on the
industry. Um, for some of you that don't
know, there are companies out there that
will finance litigation
um, and they will seek a um, interest in
any judgment that is had in that
litigation. And there has been testimony
that suggests that some of these
litigation financeers
um, will influence how and how a piece
of litigation is litigated. and and in
in my opinion that is, you know, not not
correct, not right. Um the the uh
finance here should not uh weigh in on
the decisions that the lawyer uh and the
client make. And so what this seeks to
do here is uh put some guard rails up
around this industry. And so I'm going
to run through some of of what the bill
does here. Uh first off, it defines what
a litigation finance seere is. Currently
there is no definition in code. Um and
um also defines what a litig litigation
financial agreement is or financing
agreement is. It also uh puts in um uh
what provisions are required in a
litigation uh agreement. Some of which
are the recital of what I just said is
that the um uh litigation financeier
cannot weigh in on the process of
litigation. cannot uh for instance
cannot say all right if you guys are
going to settle I don't want you to
settle this is not enough to settle for
that's one of the um um claims that I
heard in testimony some of the other
provisions it requires in these
litigation agreements is um that there
can be no amendment um of the contract a
without written agreement um obviously
the the clear um uh name and principal
address of the finance here and it
recites um that uh again um finance
years cannot inject themselves into the
decisions of the parties or the
litigators. Um what the bill also does
it um it defines who can be a financeier
litigation financeier and it's in line
with our financing institutions. In
fact, it's in the code section for banks
and banking. And what it requires is
that for instance, if uh much like a
bank or financing institution, if you
had a felony in the past uh 10 years,
you cannot be a financeier uh under this
bill. One of the other things and I'm
sure we'll hear about uh if you're a
foreign adversary of the United States
as dictated by the federal government,
then you cannot also be a
financeier. Um, one of the the largest
provisions in the bill is that it
requires registration uh of these
financiers with uh the department of uh
banks and financing and um also gives
the ability of the commissioner to deny
um a financeier if they don't meet the
requirements of this code section while
at the same time allowing for some due
process for that uh financeier if they
disagree to uh request in writing a
hearing. to make their
case. Um it exempts u importantly I
think um an agreement that it's uh
taking a case on contingency between a
party and um a litigator or lawyer. So
if I want to take a case and essentially
I'm financing my u fees and and my work
throughout the case then it exempts that
uh sort of arrangement and that
arrangement is um pretty customary in
some of these um civil cases.
Um it's one of the the provisions in
here is any if if if the financing
agreement or the finance year does not
come in line or comport with the
provisions in this bill then that
contract is void or um non-actionable
um discoverable. And then lastly it it
says that any of these agreements uh are
discoverable in litigation. So as a
defendant, if a plaintiff is utilizing
financing, then they can discover both
the terms of the contract and what the
contract is. So, um, if if I'm litig
litigating against the party as the
plaintiff, then I could discover whether
or not, uh, excuse me, as a defendant,
um, I can discover whether or not the
plaintiff is utilizing a finance here
and then how much that financeier is
financing of, uh, this litigation. I
think what this bill does is puts a
regulation and parameters around an
industry that is frankly wide open at
this point. Um, I know there's been u
many hours of of testimony and debate
over this subject matter and um I'm
asking excuse me my colleagues to uh
please favorably consider uh Senate Bill
69. Um and the LC I'm reading from is LC
492394s. And with that, Mr. Speaker,
I'll yield for questions. Gentleman has
a question. Representative Raman, right
up the center aisle on your left.
Does the gentleman yield to my friend? I
do. What's with the face? It's a It's a
fine question, I promise. Um, just to
confirm, this will not apply to bail
funds, nonprofits, things like that.
Correct. That's correct. Yes. Uh, there
is a provision that I just spoke with
one of my colleagues about that exempts
nonprofits that um, uh, it's on
line 372.
Gentleman, yield for another question.
Yes, sir. One more. Representative Rice
to your left extreme way to your left is
recognized for a question. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Is it
not true that prohibiting entities with
foreign affiliations from acting as
litigation financeers safeguards our
judicial system from potential external
influences? I I can't I can't agree
more. uh representative. I think this um
preserves the sanctity of our civil
justice system as well as gives
protections to consumers and litigants
in the process. And with that, Mr.
Speaker, uh I will yield the well. The
gentleman is yielded the well. We do
have one speaker signed up to speak to
the bill. Chairman Todd
Jones. Chairman Jones is recognized to
speak to SB69. Representative Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and my apologies
to the body. I don't typically get up
and speak and now twice in a row, but I
thought this was so important because of
the conversations that we've had over
the last two years about third party
litigation funding. If you think about a
phraseology that you hear from our
constitutional officers consistently is
we're number one business, pardon me,
the number one state to do business. You
hear that over and over that 11 straight
years we've been the number one state to
do business. I want to try and make an
argument with you very quickly that what
we should really be looking for is to be
the number the number one in innovation,
the number one in thought leadership
because here's a piece of data that I
think should concern this entire body
and our friends across the third
floor. We are eighth in GDP. New Jersey
is ninth. North Carolina is 10th. The
challenge is our growth rate is
literally a third of North Carolina's
and a half of of New Jerseys, which
means by about 2030 we will drop to 10
and possibly by 2035 drop to 11. We have
to be thinking of different ways to get
more innovation into our economy, into
our industries. One of the ways that we
protect innovation is to ensure that bad
actors don't capture trade secrets,
patents, and other intellectual property
through bad actors and the litigation
process. Third-party litigation funding
has a purpose, and I agree with the
whip, but it also could be used as a
sword against our nanotechnology
companies, our logistics technology
companies, our cyber companies. How do
we ensure that that doesn't occur? SB69
does that. So, I ask for your favor
consideration for all the reasons that
the majority whip laid out for you. But
I would also ask you to add just one
additional component. And that component
is about the future of Georgia. It's not
about 2025 or 2026. It's about 2030 and
2035 and 2040. We must protect the
intellectual property of not just our
large corporations, but what I hope to
be the next Apple, the next HP, the next
Google inside of some garage here in
Atlanta or in North Georgia or in South
Georgia. Let's protect them. Let's
protect the future and let's make sure
that we keep Georgia on a pathway not
just to be eighth in the union in GDP,
but hopefully one day jumping up to
number one and unseeding that that state
that sits on the West Coast. Thank you
very much and I yield the well. Number
one. I like the way that
sounds. That completes our
comments. Discussion on Senate Bill 69.
Is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered? Hearing none.
The previous question is ordered. We do

this bill, having received the requisite

caption of Senate Bill 105105?
Senate Bill 105 by Senator Anna Devarte
the 31st and others to be entitled act
to amend chapter 50 and title 43 the
official code of Georgia annotator
relating to veterinarians and veterary
technicians. So as authorized license
licensed veterinarians and veterary
technicians to practice
veterary tea advice. This bill have
conferred the committee on agriculture
and consumer affairs. That committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute.
Transportation chair Jasper's recognized
to present the bill. Representative
Jaspers.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, Senate
Bill 105 is for the expansion and the
use of tele medicine in the veterary
practice. And when I was asked to do
this bill, I kind of went sentimental. I
have two great veterinarians in my life
that have taken care of my kids animals,
my 4ers, my FFA kids, and our community,
Mike Christopher and Dr. Mike Zagger.
And I hope they're
listening. What this bill
does is enforces the veterary client
patient relationship that is the bedrock
of a veterary practice. This means
practically for you that every veterary
practice will have to have a
relationship with your
animal before they can diagnose it using
tele medicine. It's the same way they do
it now. We've had many bills that over
the past few years using tele medicine
and medicine and dentistry and all sorts
of things and the veterinarians have
worked hard on this. So if your vet
offers tele medicine, you'll be able to
use your phone, your iPad to communicate
with your
veterinarian. Now this is really very
important in large animal veterary
practices where there's a shortage of
big shortage of veterinarians and many
miles between them in your care. This
will help a lot in improving that care.
In the bill you'll notice there's a lot
of language guiding the use of tele
medicine. These veterinarians are very
thorough in writing a bill. Also in this
bill you'll see telet triage and tea
advice. Teletriage is used to determine
whether or not immediate referral is
needed to a licensed veterinarian.
You'll be able to call and have that
done. Now just like I said a moment ago,
since you don't have the veterary client
relationship, they cannot
diagnose. Tell advice is what it says.
It's I like to say it's call a vet.
you'll be able to ask general questions.
The key thing in all three of these
sections is it's Georgia licensed
veterinarians are doing the work and
their associates in their offices.
Someone asked me about pay a few minutes
ago. This bill does not address pay.
That's these are small businesses.
They'll do pay as they choose, but it
does create a very clear framework. In
section four, you're going to see House
Bill 91 that was done by Chairman Cooper
before crossover. So, we've seen it and
voted on it and passed it easily. This
will allow those who have graduated from
a foreign school of veterary medicine a
pathway to practice and most importantly
teach in Georgia. these we are shortage
of many of these specialties across our
state or in our state education and
they'll be able to do it but they have
to be licensed in Georgia this gives
them a pathway to do it this legislation
is the work of Georgia veterary medical
association the cattleman's association
pleasure animals all the different ones
have had their input in it and Mr.
Speaker and members, our veterinarians
are very serious about the care of pets,
your pleasure animals, and our food
animals, and they've worked very hard to
improve the ability of care in this
modern age. And I ask for your favorable
consideration and vote on this measure
for our veterinarians. Mr. Speaker, I'll
be glad to answer any questions if there
are any.
You have at least one. Representative
Barnes to your left. Represent Amati
Barnes is right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Does a gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am.
Um, you said we had a shortage of
veterinarians. Do we also have a short a
shortage of vet techs as well? Oh,
absolutely. All right. Thank you. Well,
I hope this uh helps out for our
shortage in the state. Thank you. Yes,
ma'am.
Professor, gentleman has no further
questions. Thank you. It's your
favorable vote. Thank you. Thank you for
presenting the bill. I know you know a
lot about animal husbandry. That's where
you came from. So, thanks for your work
and your career and thanks for bringing
the bill. Is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered? Hearing
none, the previous question is ordered.
Is there any objection to adopting the

killed in the line of duty. These
payments are made through the Georgia
State Identification Fund, which is
overseen by the Georgia State
Identification Commission and
administered by DOAS. This bill
establishes a presumption of
qualification for identification related
to CO 19 for deaths occurred on or
before April 15th of 2022. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Um, we know that there were 68
COVID 19 deaths that would qualify and
the state was only able to pay 39 of
them. Uh, this bill would pay the
remaining 29. The money was already
appropriated in the amended budget that
we passed and was signed by the
governor. Uh, and I'm happy to answer
any any questions. Mr. Speaker,

other copper wire u from air
conditioners and and uh
telecommunication systems. So, I want to
kind of walk through the different
changes. One of the main changes we're

two of the official code of Georgia
annotator relating to base year
homestead exemptions so as to postpone
the date by which local governing
authorities are authorized to opt out of
such homestead exemptions.
Representative Blackman, will you
explain the substitute to House Bill 92?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh fellow
members, House Bill 92 is our cleanup
measure that we sent over to the Senate
on last year's property tax relief
measure and includes a few additional
fixes from our original bill that went
over there that would help our local
governments if they chose to reconsider
their decision. Um, in addition to uh
the original provisions, we added a 5%
population exemption for our counties on
the F lost. We added HB229 from
Representative Neil that includes
incentive on the sales tax which would
give a refund for school districts on
their uh East Blast Capital
expenditures.
It would uh extend a a rescension
provision through 2029 and then April
30th of this year for this particular
year and March 1st every other year.
There is a reopt out back in uh forward
in 2027. There is a simple uh opt out
disclosure on your
bill and there's also uh if you're a
consolidated government then you do not
have to enter an intergovernmental
agreement with yourself. So just really
wanted to thank the Senate has been a
collaborative effort here. Thank AC
accGMA GSBA and so many local
conversations that we have. Vice
Chairman Irwin, thank you.
Representative Neil, thank you. Uh,
Representative Cannon has been extremely
helpful as well as so many others uh,
regarding feedback and uh, conversations
along these lines. I think this is a a
good measure and a good step forward and
cleans up a lot of what the original
bill was intended to do. Mr. Speaker,
I'd be happy to stand for questions if
there are any. Gentleman has no
questions. Okay, now yield the well.

Representative Williams, I'm going to
call on you
first. Members, we're we'll have three
afternoon orders that I'm going to ask
you to go ahead and
stand as we hear from. The first one by
Representative Al
Williams, Chairman Delo, the Chattam
delegation which is Chairman
Hitchens, Representative Chaz Cannon,
Representative Hulcom, and
Representative Griffin
and Representative Bonner. Yeah. And
Representative Bonner, our um any folks
who've served in the military.
Repres we certainly were considering
those that served with the third ID. But
if there are other veterans, but that
was it was not an exception. We were
just talking to people who served in
Hinesville, Fort Stewart area, and
Hunter Army airfield. But we welcome any
veterans that would like to join
us on yesterday in
in there were four military people
missing in Lithuania. We're not certain
of their fate at this time. So we're
asking this house to go in prayer for
their safe discovery and they may be
returned to their families safe and
sound. We don't know what the outcome
will be, but I do know that the
effectual prayers of the righteous
availth much. So prayer is needed now as
these folk that fight hard for their
country have left their families behind,
leaving Fort Stewart and the Third
Infantry Division. And we're joined by
former members of the Third Infantry
Division and certainly veterans from
this house. and we'd like to ask for
your prayers for them and their families
and hopefully we'll have good news to
report in a day or two. May
we Amen. Thank you for members of you
remain standing. We're going to
recognize representatives carpenter
Jason Ridley represent Jason Ridley and
repres and and chairman
Tarbon to recognize and condolence for
the passing of one of the citizens in
their area who's going to speak
repres Thank you Mr. Speaker and
uh Mr. Ridley had to leave quickly and
nothing urgent, but this is a very
strange
uh eulogy, I guess I might present. This
is a very good friend of mine. And uh I
want you to do something. I want you to
remember this name. His last name is C O
F I E L D Koffield. Charles Koffield
from Chadzsworth, Georgia. I want you to
read his
obituary. It's a good read.
very
unusual. I want to tell you a little bit
about Charles. He's uh first I want to
condolences to Bernita, his wife and his
family. Some special friends in his
company that are very special to me.
They know who they are. As I heard about
this and read, I thought of things in
Charles life that I knew. Boys Life
magazine, of course, Boy Scouts, a
Norman
Rockwell painting, Tom Sawyer, N
Rockchy, Thomas
Edison, John Wayne, and Father Knows
Best.
Each time I left with Charles, left
speaking with him, if I rode in a car
with him on a hunting trip or spent time
with him playing
cards, I never
left that I didn't feel better about
humanity and I didn't feel better about
myself. Charles was a mentor, a
motivator, and built character among his
employees.
He will be greatly
missed. And I will finish by
saying I'll see you again someday
cuz sorry. Every community has people
that make it a better place. Charles
Koffield was one of those people. He was
very accomplished. But what made him
special was his presence when he walked
in a room. Whether it was surrounded by
millionaires or ditch diggers, Charles
aka John Wayne had the unique ability to
make you listen. His wisdom and his
stories never got old. He invested in
people he was having a conversation with
and mentored countless of business
owners in Northwest Georgia and around
the world, including myself. It was an
honor to be his breakfast cook for 25
years. his wife and family employees all
have a huge void to fill and we could
not let this day pass. Today's the day
of his funeral without paying homage to
this one-of-a-kind individual. Rest in
peace, John W.
Thank you, members. Sounds like a very
special
man. A ripsity
bail has remembrance if
you remain standing on a passing of a
loved
one. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for being
acknowledged. Colleagues, I feel like
I've been keeping a secret. Uh, my
grandmother passed on March 9th, and I
just would like to give her a moment of
remembrance.
Reverend Church was deeply influenced by
her family's values of hard work and
education with her laboring father as a
Pullman porter that provided for her
family and her mother ensuring that she
had an academic foundation beginning at
Expelment College Nursery School. She
pursued her education through
segregation, excelling at Ashby Street
School, Booker T. Washington High School
and later earning a bachelor degree in
arts and m in bachelor degree in biology
and a minor in mathematics from
Spellelman College at the age of 20 and
earned her master's degree in library
science from the Atlanta University as a
fellow of the Andrew Carnegie Library.
She embarked on a distinguished career
in library science beginning at Howard
University. Reverend Church was a
dedicated civil rights advocate
supporting her husband Dr. Roy C. Bell
and her cousin Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. specifically in the work of the with
the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and instrumental to the
desegregation of Grady Memorial
Hospital. But her life kept unfolding.
At 57, she became a real estate broker.
At 74, she became an ordained minister.
At 77, she earned a doctorate in m a
doctorate in ministry. And at 90, she
was still driving the church, housing
the unhoused, and dancing through life
with style and grace. Even in her final
years, she minded. Even in her final
years, her sharp mind and humor and
quick and her faith was unwavering.
Reverend Church has left no dreams
unpursued, no lessons unlearned, and no
love unexpressed. Her tenacity and
prayers and legacy live on as as live on
with us. She kept unfolding until the
day of her life and had completed her
masterpiece. Earlier this year, I gave
you all a book. And if you if you will,
please continue to stand with me. If I
read a
prayer, please assume the posture of
prayer. Dear Lord, you said in your
word, out of the abundance of your heart
and the mouth speaketh. Father, it is
out of the abundance of my heart that I
speak love. I speak
appreciation. I speak thanks. I speak
joy. I speak blessings. I speak peace. I
speak good success. I speak victory. I
speak prosperity. I speak hope. I speak
faith. I speak these things by the power
of the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Lord, for
living within me. For your words say,
"Greater is he that is in me than he
that is in the world." Thank you Lord
that I can do all things through Christ
who strengthens me. I know the Lord is
in you. I live I know the Lord in you. I
live and move and have the being and
have my being. I give all the glory and
honor to you. It is it is in the
precious name of the Jesus I pray. Amen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the will.
The memorial service will be tomorrow at
the Word of Faith Cathedral at 11:00.
The visitation will be at the Murray's
brother's funeral home this afternoon.
Thank you. Thank you.
There's nothing like having a wonderful
grandmother and sounds like you had one
as
well. Our condolences to the family.
Representative Park Cannon is recognized
for and after an
order
members got some folks joining
you. Representative Cannon and friends
is this condolences represent Cannon.
No, it's
not. Y'all may be seated.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Four years ago,
my life changed here at the state
capital. Um, there was a two-page
election bill that overnight became a
20page election bill, Senate Bill 202.
Our chamber adjourned for the day. Many
members went out to the right down the
stairs and I got a text message that
said that that bill was being privately
signed in the governor's office. I went
down the lefthand stairs here and
shortly after was unlawfully arrested,
taken to Rice Street Jail, given two
felonies, which I would have had to
serve eight years. When I came back that
next day with my arm in a sling because
of the treatment that I received, there
were some members who disagreed with me.
There were many members who stood with
me. I want to thank those who stood with
me and I want to thank those who
disagreed with me because it has really
matured me as a person. It has helped me
to understand that I am in this work for
good trouble. I'd like to thank Dr. King
and his family. His family actually came
and walked me back into the state
capital. There were a number of
community members who wore shirts and
came and lined the halls so that I felt
safe that day coming in the state
capital. And even right now as we speak
with uh John Lewis up in heaven, I can
hear him being so proud of me on that
day. He used to always say, "Part,
you're so young. Park, you're doing it.
Park, keep going. Park, keep the fight.
Keep the spirit." And so today, I come
to you to let you know, I started a
phrase then on which I knocked on that
door that we will keep knocking. and I
hope that you too find a way to keep
knocking in your community. Sometimes
those doors shut in front of you and
sometimes they open. As an update on my
cases, um I am now unfortunately having
to sue the state of Georgia. I had my
day at the Georgia Supreme Court in May
and found out unfortunately that I was
not successful in my case. And so now I
have a few other cases and a few other
divisions seeking justice in the state
of Georgia. And until we seek justice,
we keep knocking. Thank you very much
for your attention today.
I yel the representative Roman is
recognized for an afternoon
order and friends. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. colleagues, I grew up here and
words like liberty and freedom and
protection from tyranny actually deeply
mean something to me personally. They're
not rhetorical devices I use to appeal
to the other side. They are actually
things I grew up sincerely and deeply
holding as a priority in my life. And
after today's conversation, it made me
kind of realize we are in a bubble right
now because next week session ends and
so we're all trying to get our bills
done and I get that. But right now
around the country there are people who
when they are walking down the street
are being approached by masked
unidentified people put into unmarked
cars and disappeared sometimes for weeks
on end. This is not an
exaggeration. Many of you have spoken to
me about various policies as it relates
to immigration enforcement and reassured
me that whatever we do here is all about
getting the criminals. Well, I can tell
you right now that I know plenty of
people who are not criminals that are
literally being disappeared. That is not
an
exaggeration. And in addition, those
that we know of are legally here under
visas, under green
cards. And the administration has
explicitly said they are not charging
them with crimes. And yet somehow we
have now found a way to criminalize
speech because anybody who stands with
me as a Palestinian or my community is
now being deemed as a terrorist
sympathizer. The thing about liberty is
that it is actually much easier to lose
than we think. And a lot of times we end
up being manipulated to willingly give
it away.
So today, I was frankly inspired to come
to this afternoon order last minute
because I really sincerely hope that in
our in weirdly sort of mediadriven world
that we can for once look and critically
assess the decisions being made with our
support and what they could mean across
the board and as I always say the
unintended
consequences. I am deeply deeply deeply
fearful of the road that we are on right
now. When somebody who is unidentified
can just put you in a car, that to me is
terrifying. So, colleagues, please, keep
an ear out on your constituents, keep an
eye out for your
constituents because unfortunately, we
are now hearing these cases regularly,
multiple times a day. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I yield the well.
That completes our afternoon
