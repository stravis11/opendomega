TRANSCRIPT
----------
So I want to thank everybody for coming out today.
Today the Georgia State Senate Democrats have submitted a true tort reform bill.
The Pro-People Pro-Business Act, which brings together the important and related interests
in protecting people as they look to buy their groceries or be entertained and protect
business from frivolous lawsuits.
It is reflected in it now with this SB223.
This bill does not close the courthouse doors or place unnecessary impediments to people
for receiving compensation for legitimate claims.
It ensures that businesses are protected
from frivolous lawsuits.
Specifically, how does it do that?
It does in a few ways.
One of the critiques of the CVS case was,
it appeared, although not accurate,
that if your business was in a place of high crime,
that alone would allow you to be sued.
Our bill actually clarifies that
and says this is affirmative defense to any claim,
just because you're in a high crime area
that would not allow a person to see you.
So, although the case did not say that,
our bill clarifies, if your business,
if the only reason to be sued is that you're in a high crime area,
that would not be a reason under SB223
that can sustain a lawsuit.
Another issue that was brought up was
that what if a business owner had never had a problem before?
How did you deal with that?
We've made that also an affirmative defense.
So if a business owner's never had an issue before,
That is affirmative defense that he can actually claim against a potential litigation.
What this does is really start cutting off frivolous litigation, not legitimate litigation
but frivolous litigation by establishing an affirmative defense.
It goes further though.
One of the things these cases talk about is a lot of times you'll see where lighting is
not good, where there's no security, and we realize that most businesses they actually
want to provide those things to keep their customers safe, to keep the people safe.
But if they do that, how do you kind of get a reward to some extent?
And what we've done is, we've created a rebuttable presumption that if a business has
created has this proper lighting, if a business does have security, if a business does have
proper camera system, there is then a rebuttable presumption against liability.
That is very strong and it can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.
So what we've done here is we've actually married the interests together.
We want people to be safe.
So we give an incentive for business actually to make people safe.
If they do that, then the only way to actually be to file that lawsuit is having a rebuttable
presumption against liability.
It can be overcome, but it has to be by clearing convincing evidence.
The significance of that is, you have when you start talking about frivolous lawsuits,
a frivolous lawsuit would not get through that type of evidentiary standard.
But a legitimate lawsuit would be able to get through that evidentiary standard.
the courthouse is not cut off. For a person who's trying to bring something
frivolous, they would not be able to show clear and convincing. But somebody
who has a legitimate actual claim, they will be able to still get to the
courthouse. Also, we said, if there's a possibility just because you're in a
high-crime neighborhood, we want you to have an affirmative defense. That by
itself will not bring liability to you. I think we've done the perfect
marriage here to make sure people are safe. And at the same time, also to help
businesses continue to thrive or actually growing those particular areas. And
And that's what we call the Pro People Pro Business Act.
It actually brings the two interests together,
which are not mutually exclusive.
Businesses, we won't then to thrive,
but we also want to make sure people are safe.
And we brought those two interests together
in this particular bill.
And with that, I don't answer any questions.
The bill has all kinds of issues.
I don't think there's a lot of things to do, I don't know.
What is it about the promises by Bill, the aspect of it
that he has decided to do a little bit on that?
All of it is connected, make no mistake.
It promises liability is connected with the cost and damage or anchoring damages.
Everything is connected because it all goes to the courthouse.
When we really look at our constituents and people that we represent,
we realize that a lot of our constituents, they're going to places like grocery stores.
They're going to places that sometimes those parking lots may not be as safe.
And we realize that sometimes those businesses are having to pull out
because of higher insurance rates.
So what we said was, we know you want to keep people safe.
But you're concerned if you do that, can a frivolous claim actually be brought against you?
And this bill actually says it will be almost impossible for a frivolous claim to be brought against you.
If you do the things that we all want you to do to help keep your customer safe,
you will actually get a strong benefit, a legal benefit for doing that.
And that's what we say.
We think this is the perfect marriage between the two interests.
They were never mutually exclusive.
We want businesses to actually have lower rates, but we also want people to be safe.
Let's find out how to make those two things happen.
We think SB 223 has done that.
This here deals with the premises liability aspect for a third party wrong to a conduct.
So we've actually done a criminal action.
So this is not goes into that particular part.
We wanted to narrow this down because this is one area that we heard our biggest concerns
in that particular bill.
And we thought this was an area that a lot of people are very concerned about.
The other thing we got to remember is, when we talk about
premises like Billion III party run to a conduct, which
is interesting is the bill that Republicans are basically
presented for, is trying to answer something which was
legitimate cases.
They're not addressing frivolous cases.
They're actually trying to cut people off from the
courthouse on legitimate cases.
When we talk about the CVS case, that means it was the
actual case where somebody was injured, the person was
shot.
When you talk about the Six Flags case, that's the actual
case where somebody was actually beating to a coma.
So these were real cases that happened.
These were not frivolous cases.
And that's what I found interesting
about how the Republicans have approached this.
They did not try to cut frivolous cases off.
They're actually trying to cut legitimate cases off
from the courthouse.
What our bill does says is no.
We won't let legitimate cases go forward.
But if you have a frivolous case,
it's going to be very difficult
for you to get over these evidentiary hurdles
and that's how it should be.
With that, thank you guys so much.
Thank you.
