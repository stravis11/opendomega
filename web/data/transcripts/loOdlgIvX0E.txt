Our chaplain this afternoon will be introduced by the gentleman from the eighth House District Representative Stan Gunther. Chairman Gunther. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues it's my honor to introduce to you Reverend Stephen Taylor Lee pastor and McConnell Memorial Baptist Church in high was the Georgia before entering a full-time ministry Steve spent three years as a high school as a high school teacher and coach in North Carolina. Born in Athens Georgia in 1963 he grew up in college towns across the southeast as his family followed his father's teaching career. Steve graduated from Westrowham High School and attended Western Carolina University on a athletic scholarship earning a bachelor of science in education in 1985 and was there during his freshman year that he met his wife Desi Freide. They have celebrated 40 years of marriage in December and together they have two children and five grandchildren. Steve completed his masters of divinity at M. Christopher White School of Divinity at Gardner Webb University. With more than 38 years in full-time ministry he has served as the lead pastor of McConnell Memorial Baptist Church in high wasy Georgia for the past 10 years. And avid outdoorsman he enjoys working out hiking with his wife and fly fishing and if you're ever in high wasy Georgia on a Sunday and you need a place to go to church I highly recommend McConnell because I've been going I've gone there before for a good number of years and I got plenty of friends there. So if you would please welcome our pastor. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for being here. My pleasure. Ladies and gentlemen of the house thank you so much for the opportunity to come. Speaker Burns thank you so much for the invitation and stand so much. It's a pleasure to be here. Let me ask you a question today. When was the last time you caught yourself thinking or saying out loud to someone else if I'd only known then what I know now? Now have you ever wondered why we say that? Usually we say it because there was some decision that we made in the past that didn't work out the way that we had hoped or the way that we had planned and it affected not only our future but it affected the people around us in ways that we couldn't have imagined at the time. And while many people believe that hindsight's 2020, hindsight doesn't give us the ability to go back and undo poor decisions that we've made. Nar does hindsight give us the ability to look into the future, to know all of the different ends and outs of decisions that we will make. And so therefore we have to ask ourselves the question how do we make better decisions? We are not limited only to hindsight. Nar do we have to depend on wishful thinking for the future. The Bible tells us that there is a place we can go with our questions and we can ask the one who knows the answers and who is not unwilling to give us wisdom and godly discernment for the decisions that we need to make. The Apostle James put it this way in James chapter 1 verses 5 through 8 he said, if you need wisdom ask our generous god and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking but when you ask him be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver for the person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Their loyalty is divided between God and the world and they are unstable in everything they do. Standing here before you I realize that leadership comes with the constant need for wisdom. Wisdom to discern not only right from wrong but wisdom to seek the common good. To uphold justice James assures us that whenever we lack wisdom we have a direct line to the one who is more than happy to give it. However the passage also tells us that when we go to the Lord and we are asking for wisdom and discernment we must trust unwaveringly in what he has to tell us avoiding the instability that comes with doubt and distrust. In moments of decision making may we be people of faith. I think that is the challenge to each and every one of us. When it comes to decisions that we make in our personal lives. When it comes to decisions that we make in our public lives we have to ask ourselves the question how many of the things that we have made major decisions on in the past would we go back and change if it were possible. I would say if we are honest with ourselves and the people around us would say there are many of those decisions that we would go back and do differently but we don't have that advantage but we do have a source of wisdom that we can go to. As you navigate the challenges of leadership today may you be reminded that true wisdom is never out of your reach. Seek it from God. Trust in his direction and move forward with confidence knowing that he is faithful to guide you each and every step of the way. Learn to listen to the sound of his voice so that you can discern it out of the many other voices that are going to be clamoring for your attention. Pulling on your shoulders, wanting you to make decisions that please them and not necessarily that please God. Trust the Holy Spirit to guide you through God's Word and He will give you the wisdom and the courage to act upon what you hear from Him. Ladies and gentlemen of the house would you stand with me as we pray. Heavenly Father, we seek your wisdom today as we carry out the responsibilities entrusted to us for the people we've been called to represent. Grannis clarity of mind, strength of character and unwavering faith in your guidance may our decisions be made with integrity in our hearts remain steadfast in service to others. Let us not be tossed about by winds of uncertainty but anchored in the wisdom that comes from you alone. In Jesus's name we pray. Amen. We feel like a United States of America and to the Republic which stands one nation or not the God individual who is liberty and justice for all. Perfect. Doorkeepers you may open the doors. Members you may join Brother Steve out in the South any room and thank him for being here with us. We appreciate your message. Thanks for making the effort down from Hal Wassie. We appreciate you. Members if you will stay close to your seats we're going to go a little bit out of order this morning. We have a distinguished gentleman who's joined us here today.

Mr. Speaker I believe the ego has landed on today and members of this distinguished body we're here today to hear from a great Savannah and a great Georgian and great American. You know when I was sitting there and I saw all the people coming over to him outside and inside I realized there's something special about Nolan Smith and so I just want to read briefly a little bit of the resolution that Nolan Smith Jr. born in Savannah Georgia that's a collaborative by itself in his early days of Calgary day school. Nolan's passion for the game is unwavering many of you have seen him by ways of his leadership with UGA to two national championships under his guidance and his determination to lead in in areas of great leadership. Now Nolan also played in the NFL becoming a reality when he was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round for the 2023 NFL draft. You all know beyond that in the community Nolan is always giving back to our young people every year he sponsors a camp this year we partnered with him with Feed the Hungry and his foundation but not only that he did us proud and he went to the Super Bowl and number three represented and he bought us home a Super Bowl champion.

We're also going to recognize some folks who make it work. So Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Resolution 336? Mr. Clerk. House Resolution 336 by Representative Willis of the 55th Crawford of the 89th and Miller of the 62nd. A resolution recognizing and commending the Shepherd Center upon its 50th anniversary. 50 years of making a difference in people's lives. No doubt. Representative Angle Willis has recognized, to speak to the resolution of first, we're going to have a video. Welcome to Shafard Center. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, it is my absolute honor today to recognize an institution that is truly saving lives. In addition to saving lives and paying attention to spinal injuries and very delicate medical situations, this is the institution responsible for caring for our colleague. Who's watching right now? So let's all say hi to him. Hi, Terry, we know you're watching, and we're glad you're getting better. So this resolution is recognizing and commending the Shepherd Center for its 50th anniversary. And with us today, we have a member of the board, Clark Dean, but we are privileged to have Jamie Shepherd with us. What I want to say about the Shepherd Center today, in addition to it being a stellar institution, is that the Shepherd Center was founded in the midst of a tragic occurrence. And it shows us that when we experience things in our lives and choose to give birth to something that serves people, that it can be standing 50 years later. And for that, we say thank you, and it is only appropriate in women's history month to say that this Shepherd Center was founded with the dream of a mother whose son was going through a health condition. So we thank you. We welcome you, and it is my privilege now to welcome, to speak on behalf of the Shepherd Center, Mr. Clark Dean. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker Burns. Thank you, Ms. Willis. And thank all of you for this gracious recognition for the Shepherd Center. Shepherd Center is one of those places that you never want to have to need. But boy, are you glad that it's there when you do? The people that come into our hospital are oftentimes facing the worst news they've ever heard. People that are suffering from brain and spine injuries, people who are going through MS, people who are going through conditions of consciousness, massive concussions, our law enforcement friends, friends in the armed services, folks that dive into two shallow pools, you never know when it's going to happen, but we are so grateful to be here as a beacon of hope, turning I can't into I can's for those patients who find a way to live into Excel. I'm reminded of one of our patients, Mr. Lodgeoy, who is a famous Olympic, Paralympic swimmer, and I was sitting next to him shortly after I joined the board, talking to him about his injury. And I asked him, I said, I got asked, how long was it after you had your injury that you started swimming again? And he looked at me and he said, son, he's like, before my injury, I didn't know how to swim. And he said, lose my legs, made me a champion, made me a champion. And we are so proud of the patients that come through Shepherd Center that are champions in their own rights, not all of them are Paralympians, but they're champions, and we hold them up, and we thank you guys for supporting our hospital that brings people from not only around this great state, but around the entire world to give the best care possible for these conditions. We thank you for your support, thank you for your recognition. We wish that the founder, Elena Shepherd, was here earlier today, and she wasn't able to be here for this session, but she sends her best, she sends her love, and we just appreciate all you guys do. Thank you all so much. Thank you, Julie. Thank you so much, thank you. Park, just put the phone up. I want to just bring the phone up. Let me say something first. I would ask a couple of you to ring Terry England's phone, because guess what his ringtone is? The UGA fight song. Because Nolan Smith was just here, so we need to do that for him. He had to put another big smile on his face. Jamie, do you a grandmother? Tell her we can't even express our gratitude for what Shepherd Center has done for countless people around the world, as you said, Clark. But especially what is doing now for our beloved friend, Terry England. And for many, I'm sure many of you, as I have, have had family members that were made whole again by the word Shepherd Center's done. Thank you for being on the leading edge of caring for our neighbors. We appreciate you all, and we look forward. This body does, as it always has, the work we do, whatever we can do. So thank you, thank you, thank you very, very much. God bless you. Thank you, Inga. Appreciate you ensuring this got done today. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Clark.

Y'all come down and join her. Ladies recognized. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. We have some special folks in the gallery today. If Travis Strickland, his wife and Mary and her mother Carla, if they would please stand up, we have a resolution to celebrate Travis today. He is the 2024 West Georgia soil and water conservationist of the year. Travis Strickland is a fourth generation farmer whose land is situated between Winston and Wattesburg. Originally, it was a cotton farm through World War I under most Strickland. The farm transitioned to cattle upon most return from the war and has since been operated by successful generations of family, including Irvin Strickland, a World War II veteran, Donald Strickland, a Vietnam war veteran. Travis began his farming journey as a child assisting with the family food plot and feeding cattle. After the passing of his father in 2015, he assumed full responsibility of the farm where he now breeds Angus cattle. He has since continued its operation with the support of his wife, Mary, and their two young children, Kyler and Tate. In addition to his work at the farm, Travis serves in his community as a full-time firefighter and operates a pine straw business. This distinguished gentleman has given inspiration to many through his high ideals, morals, and deep concern for his fellow citizens. He possesses the vast wisdom which only comes to experience in the strength of character which is achieved through overcoming the many challenges of life. It is a Bentley fitting and proper at the outstanding accomplishments of this remarkable and distinguished Georgian to appropriately recognize him. Therefore, be resolved by this house that the members of this body command Travis Strickland in the 2024 West Georgia Soul and Water Conservationist of the Year and extend sincere best wishes to his family and him for future health, happiness, and success. Please join us and welcome him to the People's House. Thank you, sir. I yield the will. Thank you, representatives. Hey, soul and water is pretty important, isn't it? I appreciate your efforts and what you're doing to ensure that we have food and fiber by protecting our soul and water. Thank you all. We appreciate it. Congratulations. Charity Dipsy is recognized for a morning order in the afternoon. Give the lady your attention, please. She's got some folks that you may know up in the gallery. The lady is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my privilege today to welcome back someone who is a dear friend of mine, but also is a dear friend of us who worked here 10 years ago, particularly. Anna Miller is upstairs with her family. She's very special. There was no doubt she worked in the Speaker's office and one day, actually 10 years ago today, she called in and said, I can't be at work. My baby has decided to come a little bit early. So she left us. Session was still going on. But today she is here with her husband, Chris, their son, who is 10 years old today, his brother, Shepherd, their sweet Ruthie that's not here with us today. I'm going to welcome them in just a minute, but I want you to know how special these children are and truly how special Anna and Chris and their entire family is. Both of these young boys were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. And it was 19 months old. Shepherd was three and a half years old. As a family, they have worked so hard to support the cure, the resources, the knowledge, and the life experiences that help others navigate type 1 diabetes with a young child. They have advocated and fundraised for a cure for years and raised as a family over $800,000 to go toward that. Let's all welcome back our friend Anna, Miller, and her family. Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. Emmett, raise your hand, stand up, son. Guess what today is? Is Emmett's birthday? Say Happy Birthday to Emmett, please. He looks good for 50. Yes, sir. Happy Birthday, Emmett. Good to have you with us. Leader Heagley, you ready? Leader Heagley is recognized for an order. Morning, the order of the afternoon. And friends, some folks joined. If you are joining, I guess some folks from Columbus and some other folks. Mainly Columbus looks like to me. Ladies recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, today is Columbus Day at the Capitol. And we wanted to point out to you that you have some snazzy little hats on your desk. This represents the Columbus clean stones. And we're so excited that we're bringing AA baseball to Columbus, Georgia. I would sing, take me out to the ballpark, but we don't have enough time for that. So we want to say on behalf of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce and the City of Columbus and Columbus State University and all of our partners in Columbus, we want to thank you for your service as a member of this body. So thank you on behalf of Columbus, Georgia, where your hat will pride. Good job. Representative Dawson recognized for a morning order. Give the gentleman your attention, please. And friends. Good afternoon, Speaker and colleagues. Today I rise asking you to please help me welcome the Mayor, City Council, City Manager, City Staff, Students and Staff of the Terrier School at CEREMB and other residents of the City of Chattahoochee Hills.

Representative Marvin Liem. Do you want to go ahead and go? Representative Liem has recognized for an order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to welcome Rockbridge Elementary and Principal McCrea here today. They were also here this morning, but they had a bus to catch so they may have just left. But we forge on. The school whose student body comprises students coming from over 40 countries and over 20 different languages spoken at home is at the heart of my district. And I want to acknowledge the fifth grade student leaders that came today. But I also want to acknowledge the school's leadership in serving as a polling place and demonstrating civic leadership that way in proactively implementing positive behavioral interventions and supports among other social-emotional learning programming. And continue to be the embodiment of communities in schools, particularly Principal McCrea's proactive on the ground partnerships with the neighborhoods and complexes that surround the school and are worked together in the past year. Dressing resources for the intersection of English language acquisition and developmental disability. I also want to give a shout out to the doorkeepers for being so welcoming to them and for Chairman Carpenter for playing Simon Says with them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative Hilt.

He says he has some friends. Where we're going to see. Yeah, he probably had to pay him, but that'd be fine. Dr. Jim Hilton has the time for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

And if you come, you will get your golf towel this year that goes with your golf balls. So come to the reception tonight and pick up your towel. Thank you again, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, members, we have a fairly important piece of business we need to tend to. House Bill 68. It's going to take care of this state for another year. I want to get the Governor's signature on it. So, Mr. Clerk, members of your pleas come to the floor and take your seats. Mr. Clerk, why don't you hit the bell a couple of times, folks. No, maybe don't know what we're getting ready to do. All right, members, we all, we're going to take out the budget. The budget's been on your desk since 20 to 11 yesterday. So we're meeting all legal requirements for this budget. All members, if you'll please come to the floor. Doorkeepers, if you'll close those doors, you don't have to keep them closed. If you'll close them. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 68. House Bill 68. There is an emergency notice that burns on 59 Jones and 47 of the frustration of 104th hatched to the 150th. To be entitled to make and provide appropriations for the state fiscal year, be getting July 1st, 2025, ending June 30th, 2026. To make and provide such appropriations for the operation of state government and its departments. This bill I'm referring to the Committee on Appropriations. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the chair resolves the House into a committee of the whole House for the purpose of considering House Bill 68, the General Appropriations Bill. The chair appoints the gentleman of the 104th, the majority leader of the administration, as chairman to preside over the Committee of the whole House. Leader of the administration. The chair recognizes the gentleman from the 150th district, chairman hatchet, to present the bill. Is it on there? Well, I just want to say, just for everyone's information, this is House Bill 68, not Senate Bill 68. There's a big difference. So, House Bill 68 is the fiscal year 2026 budget, and it is set by revenue estimate of $37.7 billion in state funds, an increase of $1.5 billion or $4.4% more than our original fiscal year 2025 budget. If this budget seems a little smaller to you than the amended budget we voted on just last week, your eyes are not deceiving you. It is. While the amended budget included $2.7 billion in surplus funds for one-time investments, this budget does not. And while $1.5 billion in new revenue seems like a lot of money, and it is, it doesn't go as far as you think when you spread it across a growing state of 11 million people who have a wide range of needs, including education, healthcare, and public safety. I've made no secret about this budget. Things are tight. Many of you have asked for funding for your communities or asked us to support programs and initiatives within state agencies. I wish we could address them all or go further than we did, but we can't. The needs are great, and there are many worthy causes competing for the same limited resources. Much of the new revenue recognized in this budget is tied up in the things we must find every year, like enrollment growth in K through 12 and higher ed, and increase utilization in Medicaid, or the new revenue is already dedicated, like lottery to hope and pre-K, and motor fuel to transportation. Still, the needs exist beyond those items. Just last week, we passed a public safety-themed amended budget that included an infusion of cash for the Department of Corrections. And this budget keeps the momentum going with a total increase of $250 million over the agency's prior year budget. Much of the funding in the corrections FY26 budget is an annualization of the needs we recognized in the amended budget, including funding to hire more than 700 correctional officers to lower staffing ratios and improve bed capacity so that the department can implement life, safety, and security projects. This budget also recognizes that salary enhancements are working to attract and retain staff in the prison system, and it includes additional salary increases to keep our foot on the gas. The House version of this document also addresses deficits in the corrections budget, where funding for vacant positions has long been used to cover gaps in increased operational costs, including utilities and health services. Now that the department is having more success at retaining staff, these expenses must be accounted for and made whole in the base budget. Finally, this budget includes $38 million in additional funding for the four private prisons in 21 county correctional institutions that are an essential part of the correctional network, and House of 11,000 of the state's least violent offenders. Without these partners, the state would not have bed capacity for all of our offenders. Specifically, the budget includes $9.9 million to increase the per-dem per county correctional institutions to $30 a day, and $28.5 million for private prisons, for pay parity, for staff, and consumer price index adjustment. There are some other noteworthy public safety items in this budget, where the House has exceeded the funding recommended by the governor, including $3.1 million for a 4% salary increase for juvenile correctional officers in the Department of Juvenile Justice. DJJ faces many of the same issues as corrections, including hiring and maintaining adequate staff, and the House felt it was important to maintain parity and pay with corrections. $9.5 million for additional community supervision officers who are responsible for supervising offenders on probation or parole, and for monitoring their reentry back into the community. Because of improved retention, additional funds are needed, and finally $8.1 million to offset the loss of the federal victims of crimes at VOCA funding to victim service providers such as child advocacy centers, domestic violence shelters, and sexual assault centers. While the theme of this budget so far has been on public safety, this is also very much an education budget. The House version of the HB68 includes an additional $1.5 billion in education spending for the FY 20 over the FY 20 or five original budgets. The all that wash over you for a minute. Half a billion dollars more in education. The House supports the governor's recommendation for enrollment growth and fully funds the QBE formula, but we also include $98 million in additional education spending above the governor's recommendation, primarily on student safety and mental health. The House budget includes $150,000 for school safety coordinator position at the Department of Education and a $25 million investment for the Department to work with JEMA on new school safety initiatives designed to assess and prevent school threats. I'd like to thank the governor for adding school security as a regular funding stream in last year's budget. Those funds are included in this budget as well and provide school systems with additional resources to promote a safe learning environment. But it's become abundantly clear that school safety and student mental health go hand in hand. That's why I'm excited to announce a new program created in the House budget in the Department of Education called Student Support Services. This $62 million program is an umbrella of services, if you will, that's designed to cover the needs of the whole child. It's a collection of ideas and long time requests many of you are likely familiar with that support our students in ways that the QBE formula can't. This new program provides $20 million in mental health grant funding for middle schools and high schools. School systems will have the flexibility to choose how to provide services including using telehealth or contracting for the services. $5 million for school systems to hire social workers to do outreach and address chronic absenteeism. $10 million in funding for grantees to provide out of school care and programming or base 2.0, as some of you have heard, federal funds reutilized post-pandemic for this purpose with positive results on academic outcomes. And finally, $28 million to implement an e-source of funding for disadvantaged students, otherwise known as a poppy weight. While our equalization grant provides additional funding to school systems based on the wealth and needs of the school system, this funding will be earned and targeted based on the needs of the child. Together, these programs aims to support the whole child with needed services outside the classroom to improve mental health and boost academic achievement. Literacy has been a major focus of concern for members in this body as well as the Senate. That's why the House has included an additional $10 million in funding to implement recommendations from the Georgia Council on Literacy, including funding for 116 Re-Sub-based Literacy Coaches to support teachers on the science of reading. Finally, we know our teachers care so much about their students and often dig into their own pockets to fund resources for their classrooms. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this budget includes $7.5 million to fund a program approved last session to provide educators with $100 to purchase school supplies. We look forward to working with our partners in the Senate to fully fund this program. While this budget is heavily weighted towards public safety and education, there are plenty of other items worth mentioning, including $19.2 million to address the shortfall in out of home care for foster youth. $6.4 million for a 2% provider rate increase for child-caring institutions, child-placing agencies, foster parents and relative caregivers. $3.4 million for a 150 new now-com flavors. $32 million in reimbursement rate increases for providers treating patients on Medicaid. $8.3 million in new funding for graduate medical education, including $2.8 million for 150 new residency slots, and $5 million to establish a grant program to support new and expanding residency programs. Nearly $10 million in new funding for maternal health initiatives, including grants for labor and delivery services for rural hospitals and an expansion of the state's home visiting program. $23.5 million to provide an enhanced annual COLA supplement to our state retirees. So I know you're wondering how are we able to accomplish this thing when I told you knee revenue was tight. Last year, our state did something novel for the first time since 1981, we opted to not issue debt for capital projects. In fact, we spent the last two budget cycles cash funding, huge investments in our state's infrastructure. To the tune of $2.8 billion, mainly with surplus cash. A one-year pause in the issuance of bonds was a fantastic idea to lower the total amount of current and future debt. But it's not a viable long-term strategy to forego funding real operating needs and public safety and education to avoid using debt responsibly. We will again have a bond package as we resume our normal budgeting procedures, as just a matter of win. The budget recommended by the governor included $866 million in base funding from last year and the capital projects fund that was recommended to be continued in FY26 for new projects. The House agrees to utilize $545 million for those capital projects, but shifts $321 million of these funds to meet needs and other agencies and recommends issuing that amount in bonds for projects at the Department of Education, Corrections and the Department of Juvenile Justice. It should be noted that the amount recommended for bonds is one-third of the amount normally issued by the state in any year. And the mix of capital projects funded with cash and bonds is still below the ceiling set by the governor. And just to give additional context, debt in Georgia is not the same debt in Washington, D.C. where cash is borrowed to pay for runaway spending. Here, our Constitution allows for the issuance of bond debt for projects, capital investments like buildings and infrastructure that result in something tangible that outlives the life of the state. So what does Georgia's state debt look like? It's a new roof on your elementary school, a new addition at your high school to meet enrollment growth or a new building at the Technical College to meet workforce demands. It's improvement to state assets from parks to prisons. Each time the state issues debt, the General Assembly must fund the highest amount of principal and debt service required for the projects which we have done. As an additional precaution, the state constitution requires that if bonds needed for debt service falls short in any fiscal year, the very first revenues received in the next fiscal year must be set aside and deposited into the sinking fund to meet the shortfall. This has never happened because we always meet our obligations. Triple A bond ratings are not handed out like participation trophies. They are earned. The designation is given by three separate rate of agencies who independently evaluate the state's revenue structure, financial position, and habits to determine credit worthiness. Georgia has done the work. Since 1992, we've held the Triple A rating for all three rating agencies. We're currently only one of 12 states that issued debt with that distinction. The rate of the rate of the rate has expanded across administration and parties for decades now. It's a designation we've been proud to claim throughout the financial good times and the bad. This budget doesn't change that. Finally, the House makes an adjustment to the promised scholarship based on initial implementation. The Governor's recommendation funded the maximum amount of the scholarship authorized. A number that experience from other states and our own programs like the special needs scholarship tell us we will likely not realize in the first year. It utilizes these savings and redirects them to other education initiatives I highlighted earlier. Together, these two adjustments generated funds that could be used throughout the budget to meet the needs of Georgians in public safety, child welfare, health care, and education. It is a thoughtful spending plan that I hope you will support. It was crafted within from your subcommittee chairs who listened to hours of testimony and the staff of the House budget and research office who help us make these numbers work. And they are Christine, Sarah, Abby, Courtney, Bailey, Morgan, Amber, Anna, Molly, David, and Patrick. Thank you. Colleagues, I ask for your favorable consideration of House Committee's substitute to HB68. And Mr. Leader, I will take any questions. Chair recognizes the minority leader, Leader Hugley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does the gentleman yield? Yes. Is it true that I'd like to thank you for a lot of the good things that are in this budget, but I do have a question. Can you explain how the additional amount for the employees' retirement system explained to me how that's going to work in reality for them because I'm going to get this question when I get home. So we have roughly 26.5 million in that program in the budget that allows for an annual like bonus payment, 13th payment for our retirees. This increases that amount of what that bonus payment will be every year. So it takes that balance to 50 million and then the ERS board will apply that to all the retirees. One more payment a year. We've put a billion dollars in that fund, the last two amended budgets, and the plans are to do another half a billion next year, or this amended budget. That will get that to 80%, which then allows the fund to do some better colors. Hopefully they can. What is your name on here for another question? I have to ask you on behalf of my constituents who are always asking me about the now waiver. I know we have done some adjustment to that, but can you try to get more out of the Senate as you move this bill through? We will try as I do with a lot of stuff. Thank you. Thank you. And what we've done is an increase of 50 over what the governor had put in the budget. Thank you. We will put a new budget in the budget. Chair recognizes chairman Dubenick. I could ask you something about if you left the Senate in this version of the budget, but I won't go there today. Mr. Chairman, is it not true that this budget passed, soon to be passed here by the House prioritizes a number of new initiatives for the 1.7 million students and 11 million people in the state of Georgia? It does. As you said, sir, and it helps a lot of our students and our school systems with programs that they've been asking for help with. And as I said, mental health is on our mind. It has been for several years, and this is an attempt to assist our school systems with that issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your hard work. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Hefner for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true? Mr. Chairman, this is gentleman Yale. Yes. Thank you. Is it not true that HB68 recognizes the Georgia War Veterans Nursing Home in Augusta, Georgia and Augusta University in their partnership and interagency agreement with the Georgia Department of Veteran Services? Yes, and we supply more funds for it to have more of our veterans in those empty beds. Mr. Chairman, for the year? Yes. Is it also not true that I am excited about supporting this budget because of those...

funding allocations for both entities, for facility improvements, and it addresses the needs for innovative academic research, infrastructure expansion, enhanced living space, and additional specialized care as you just indicated for Georgia veterans. And I'm excited that you're excited. Thank you very much, sir, for bringing this bill. Thank you. Jim and Yield, for further questions. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Canon, Park Canon, for a question. Thank you, Mr. Leader. Do you Yield? Yes. Okay. Is there any money in this budget for the Irwin County Detention Center? What kind of center? The Irwin County Detention Center in Oceola? Don't believe there is. I don't think so, but there is money for our department of corrections that if they choose to use that facility, I guess they negotiate, but specifically I don't think there is. Okay, thank you. Do you further you? Yes. On section 19.6, why is it a priority for our state to increase the funds at 4% to cover the salary of private prison officers? Which line? 19.6? Point. Does it grow? I was just funding the- Point one. Point one. Funding the increases for private prisons. Yes, why is the priority? We believe that there is a high need to keep parity between our private prisons and our state run prisons because they don't need to be taking employees from each other and it does occur. So we try to help them and help us at the same time. So they don't, we're not stealing each others and pull these. Private prisons, as I said in my comments, they are essential to what we do now. And we need to make sure that we take care of them like our own. Chair Rick- Go ahead. Chair recognizes Chair Lady Dempsey for a question. Thank you, just the Chairman Yel. Yes. Isn't it true that when you look at this budget and as you spoke to the concerns that it addresses related to mental health, you can find it throughout the budget. It was not that long ago that most of that just appeared in behavioral health. But today, as you read this, you'll find it in education, you'll find it in corrections, you'll find it in public safety, you'll find it in health, and also in behavioral health. We've expanded it in a way that truly does begin to meet the people who need it in the place that they are. Yes, yes, we have been finding mental health professions for years and this budget continues to help in that arena. So, Mr. Leader, with that, I'm gonna yield the will and I ask for your favoral consideration of HB68. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanna thank you for your work and I want to join in thanks for Director Christine Murdock and the entire House Budget Research Office staff for your tremendous work. And the chair, once he's back at his desk, the chair recognizes Chairman Hatchett for a motion. Mr. Chair, I'm moved to this House Bill 68 new pass by Committee Substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Chairman Gullet. Thank you, Leader, for all the hard work and long hours put into this budget that prioritizes our state's many needs. I would like to second the motion of due pass. Representative Gullet has seconded the motion. At this time, we'll call the question as to House Bill 68. All those in favor, shall this time say aye. All those opposed shall say no. The ayes have it and House Bill 68 passes by Committee Substitute. The chair recognizes the gentleman from the 150th District, Chairman Hatchett.

I have all members voted for what purpose is represented? Stacey Evans' rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stacey inquiry. Mr. Speaker, isn't it true that, for I believe now the third year in a row, we are fully funding all hope scholarships and all hope grants at 100% of tuition. And isn't it further true that even with this important spending, we are still holding over $1.6 billion more than the $700 million we are required to hold in reserves. And then it would be great for this House to exercise its authority as an independent branch of government and take that money and put it toward pre-K. I know the lady believes what she speaks. And we do appreciate that vote you have on the board too as well. Thank you for always being a great advocate for pre-K. Thank you. For what purpose is represented? Carpenter rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Stacey inquiry. Is it not true that this budget includes $9.2 million of additional funding to address homelessness in the state of the Georgia? And I appreciate the work of the Appropriations Committee. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen, those are what he speaks. I know he's passionate about that area. For what purpose is represented by La Lierie Ries? Parliamentary inquiry. Stacey inquiry, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that this is the first time in over 40 years that we've updated the state's QBE funding formula to provide additional resources to support students living in poverty? Well, the gentleman certainly has an opinion. I'll say yes and no. I've been here a while, so it's something we have been doing a great job of supporting QBE and fully funding. And isn't it further true, Mr. Speaker, that this is a historic force, first step toward ensuring that no child's future and their educational opportunities are limited by their parents' financial situation or where they call home? The gentleman knows what he's speaking. This house is committed to young people in their education in this state. And we appreciate that dedication. For what purpose is represented? Barnes, Ries? Parliamentary inquiry. Stacey inquiry. Is it not true that we are once again this year feeding over 70,000 children in the state? And we have also added, is it not true that we've added $100,000 to start trying summer meals for the kids as well? I'll know the latest passion about that and knows of what she speaks. What purpose does Chairman Hitchens rise? Well, the minister inquiry. The staging inquirer sir. Is it not true that while many people think that the private prison system is an outlier of the Georgia prison system, they in fact work together daily. They have a member of the Georgia Department of Corrections on board each prison. And if it weren't for them, we would not be able to incarcerate all the people we have in this state. I know the gentleman knows of what he speaks. And our private prisons do help us provide a safe and secure place for our prisoners in Georgia. And we appreciate the work they do. Have all members voted. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? On the passage of House Bill 68, the Yays are 171, the Nays are 4. This Bill Henry C. DeRec was a constitutional majority is therefore passed. Congratulations Chairman Hatchett. All the members, all your subcommittee and all staff.
