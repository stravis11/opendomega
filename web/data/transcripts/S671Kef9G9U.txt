TRANSCRIPT
----------
Welcome everybody, thank you so much for coming out to this press conference in support of religious freedom by passing RIFRA
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act Senate Bill 36
We're at a pointy at moments where we are
Really one one and a half steps away
From protecting religious freedom for everyone in our state
If you're not aware of this
And you're going to hear this, you're going to hear this multiple times.
There are 39 states, now 39 states that offer these protections for their citizens without
incident.
And in addition to those 39, the federal government has these protections.
Georgia does not need to be an outlier outlier in the fight for religious freedom.
To get things started, we're going to ask our dear friend and pastor Frankie Vega to open
us in prayer.
Amen.
Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you in the proud tradition of our spiritual forefathers
who bathe the foundations of our freedom in their own blood.
We stand as the modern vests of tried and true forefathers of our faith as the black
government of pastors and ministers who fought for the religious freedom of our country
and the founding of our First Amendment. I encourage you today to stand with us as we
are moving forward in our faith courageously, foraging forward because of our pureed
and predecessors who fought to have religious liberty in our nation. And we're calling
upon, we're calling upon Georgia to stand together as 11 million people are standing
for faith in our nation, and we're calling upon our honorable legislators to stand courageously
to pass RIFRA this day to our honorable speaker of the House to our elected representatives.
We're calling upon you today to do what is right and to have courage in your heart to
stand for what our nation has been founded.
Our First Amendment clearly says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment
of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the
government for redress of grievances.
So we're calling upon our legislators to honor the founding of our First Amendment and
reflecting that on our state and that we would be the 40th state, the epicenter of civil
rights that has affected the entire nation in 49 states as our fight to stand and arise
for freedom, that again all the eyes of our nation are looking upon Georgia to do what
is right and to stand.
Let us pray.
Father in the name of Jesus, we come before you now thanking you for this opportunity
to stand and as Christian constituencies and people of faith and faith communities, all
alike we stand, Father, and ask you to supernaturally grant us according to Proverbs 21 and
one that you said the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord and you're able to turn it
whichever way you wish and we thank you Lord that our elected officials father
providentially have arisen to a place of political prominence father so that they would be able to
use their influence and even their affluence to affect what is morally right and just and true
and Father we know that you've established this nation and bathed in the foundation of freedom
father, freedom to worship you and to seek you. And we thank you, God, that as people of faith,
we have fought in every major battle and forefront, Father, to turn our nation into what is right.
And without the voice of moral clarity, Lord, we cannot guide our nation as we have done so many
times in many instances in the past toward the right moral direction and path. And, God, I thank you.
We pray right now for our legislators. We pray for the speaker of the house. We pray for our
honorable governor Brian Kemp we thank you that they're influenced and in this
moment in this hour is arising to be able to support what our founders have
bled and died for so that we can stand without any prohibition against our
ability Lord to proclaim your gospel or to be people of faith and God I ask you
today that you would touch their hearts today even as many of them are
listening right now that you would touch their hearts father to remember how
faith has forged our Declaration of Independence, how the Word of God and the
faith has forged our Constitution and even the Bill of Rights that we
cherish and hold today. And I thank you God that as they convene and come
together they will pass. Rifra, even on tomorrow there will be no delay God
we're asking you no delay but it would go forward God even as men of
prominence politically have given their word to stand and support the
a riffra and our support for religious freedom. We thank you for this God. We know, Lord,
that you said the effectual, fervent prayers of righteous men and women make tremendous power
available, dynamic in its working. And you said, blessed is the nation, whose God is the Lord.
and we thank you for that now.
In Jesus' mighty name we pray, amen.
Amen.
Good morning, I'm Thomas Hammond
and I'm representing the Georgia Baptist Mission Board.
I'm the executive director there.
And on behalf of 1.4 million Georgians
who attend 3,500 churches across our state,
I would strongly encourage our house representatives
to put forth tomorrow the Rifford Bill to be voted on.
We want our house of representatives to vote for our freedom.
This is one of the most basic rights we have as Georgians.
And that is, of course, the freedom of press,
the freedom of assembly, the freedom of speech.
We want this equally as enforced by law.
When you think about the fact that Georgia
is the only state in the South that doesn't have a riftra,
it's time to move now.
When you also think about the fact that we might have
little in common politically with states like California, Nevada, Oregon, New York, New Jersey,
but one thing we do have in common with them is we don't have Arifah. We strongly encourage
our representatives to bring this to a vote tomorrow. Let's pray together. Father, your word tells us
that if we lack wisdom, we can ask for it and you would give it to us generously. And I ask now
that you would give wisdom to our leaders. Your word also tells us that we are to pray
for our political leaders. And we're doing that right now, Father, that they would have
boldness and courage to do what is right. I prayed, Father, that this vote would be taking
place tomorrow, that we, all across our state, might experience the freedom of enjoying
the protection that is so desperately needed.
And Lord, I pray for our governor, governor Kim, and all of our leaders.
I'm grateful for them and the sacrifices that they make every day.
But I pray now, Lord, that your will be done.
And we pray this in Christ name.
Amen.
Hello.
My name is Bishop Garland Hunt.
and I'm the senior pastor of the Father's House,
in peace-tree corners, and also serve
as president of the Douglas Leadership Institute.
I was born here raised in Atlanta area.
My parents were in the aftermath
and was very segregated south.
And they experienced white-only fountains,
restrooms, and dining facilities.
I grew up in this, and one of the children,
I guess, of the civil rights movement.
But let me just say this.
that I believe that religious freedom is more critical
than even civil rights legislation
because religious freedom is not a civil right,
it's an aliable right.
It's a right that comes from God.
As a man of God, I do understand
that religious freedom restoration act
is very important for the government,
not to discriminate against believers or Christians
or any one of any religious faith.
In order for that discrimination not to take place,
there needs to be a compelling evidence of the government
in order to restrict the person's religious freedom.
We as Christians, as believers, as religious people stand,
and we say that this is an alibi right from God,
and we're saying that Georgia should not
preclude believers, Christians as myself,
the freedom to have the expression
of what I believe I shouldn't be able to do it in the marketplace,
I should not have to be able to exercise my belief in just
in the church, but also in the marketplace.
So today, we ask that this particular legislation
will approve refer in this nation, the 40th state finally,
so that religious freedom is not discriminated against
in our state.
Let me pray.
Lord, we thank You now for Your goodness and mercy in this place.
We can only call on Your name.
For Your name is great.
You are truly the Alpha and the Omega.
You're truly the beginning and the end.
And we look to You for You, the author of our faith.
And therefore, O God, we pray that for government, O God, is under Your hand.
So we cry out to the government of God now that you were employed, that you were inspired,
that you were moved by legislation even now, and according with that, with our governor,
to approve refer in this area, that we were out of the pre, the freedom to preach the
gospel and declare the gospel without any inhibition, that we are the freedom to have the
expression of the gospel and live the gospel no matter where we are in this state.
Thank you for your blessings on Georgia and we thank you now for your truly grace upon
us now.
In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.
Amen and amen.
I am Dr. Alvita King and I stand here before you today as the chairman of the Center for
the American Dream with the America First Policy Institute.
I am here with friends from the Spiritual Legislative Council, the Douglas Leadership
Institute, Senator Ed Seltzer, and so many others.
I was a state legislator here in the 70s and 80s and was able to help pass some good
legislation.
And I'm praying today in the name of Jesus as a scripture in 1 Peter 4 and 10, each
of us and each of our elected officials should use whatever gifts we have received to serve
others as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms. Well, Rifer is a good,
various form. Let's vote yes right now. Red and yellow, black and white, all are precious
in God's sight. We are one blood, one race, male and female, of course, Democrats, Republicans,
one voice and one vote. We must vote yes together now. Jesus said in John 17 that they all may be
one. Let us show here in Georgia that that is possible. Please join me in the last few notes
of glory, hallelujah. If you know it, sing it with me. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory,
glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. God's truth is marching on. God give us the
the courage, give our leaders the courage to vote what's going to help and serve.
Yes for a religious freedom, yes for riffa.
God bless us all in Jesus' name, amen.
Thank you.
You're morning.
That's a tough act to follow.
You have heard it said that elections have consequences.
Elections also have expectations.
And for those that came out and pounded pavement and cast their vote in November to elect
the people in this building, there was an expectation.
There was an expectation that our values, that our faith and our religious freedom would
be protected, and it would be stood for.
And so as we stand here with that expectation that we delivered on Aryan, we're asking this
building to deliver on its end. And the folks in this room and the folks around this
state with 13,000 evangelical churches and faiths that abound, there is nothing that
unites us more than our faith. And as we look ahead the next year, whether it's primary
season or general election season, we have long memories and we have expectations. And
And we expect this to be done now, as we...
Applause
It is hard as I are to stand with the people of this building.
I have taken shots from numerous folks over the years,
because I have said that the people in this building are good and noble people.
And I believe that to be true.
And I expect that over the next few days they're going to prove that to be true.
They're going to stand strong, but let me say this.
This is not a moment that counts for great courage.
This is an easier moment than we've allowed it to be.
A few years ago, there was a bunch of saber rattling
around this issue.
We knew that it was just saber rattling.
But as we stand here today, I don't even
hear the sabers rattling.
There is absolutely no reason to stop this bill now.
And there's every reason to press forward.
because if you want to hear the grounds shake
with the pounding of pavement by faithful Georgians,
if you want to see victories at the ballot box,
if you want to see our culture in state grow stronger,
vote this thing through now.
Now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And now I want to introduce my good friend, Ed Setsler.
And I'm going to say, I normally say very nice things about it.
But Ed is an ordinary guy being used by a great god.
and he's written an ordinary bill
that is similar to what's in 39 other states.
It's the exact same thing that's in federal law.
There's no nuance to this legislation.
It has been tested in the courts.
There's nothing all that special about it.
It is to make Georgia just like what our founders intended.
So I'm grateful for the sponsor's bill.
I'm grateful for the Senate that's already passed it.
The House Judiciary Committee that's already passed it.
We look forward to the House passing it this week.
The author of this bill, Senator Ed Setson.
Thank you, Cole. Thank you, friends. I'd like to thank the folks that have joined us today,
the speakers, the dozens of people behind me, the representatives and senators. There's too
many to count behind me. People from all faith backgrounds. We've got Christians, Jews, people
from a wide variety of faiths and perspectives because no matter what faith background you
come from, no matter what your faith tradition is, the ability to practice it openly outside
the walls of your church is as Pastor Vegas said earlier exactly what our founders intended.
Every Georgian should be free to exercise their faith without unfair federal state and
local government intrusion.
Senate Bill 36, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects ordinary people from unfair state
and local government intrusion by exactly mirroring the language, by exactly mirroring
the language from the federal referral law that protects people from unfair federal
government intrusion.
After the federal referral law has passed in 1993, the United States Supreme Court in
The surprising decision ruled in 1997 that the federal law and the United States Constitution
did not protect people of faith from state and local governments without state legislatures,
without state legislatures specifically acting to put those protections in place.
This is a whole on the Constitution.
Since then, 39 of 50 states have adopted their own state riffer laws or have seen their
States Supreme Courts Act with binding rulings that their
constitutions nationally protected these rights, protecting
people from unfair overreach by state and local governments
in 39 states.
In 2016, Georgia passed a state bill that included language
very different than the federal referral law.
It was passed in 2016.
It was very different than what was proposed today.
And that very different language was vetoed by Governor Nathan Deal.
In 2017, our Republican Attorney General wrote in an opinion,
recognizing that our state statutes and our Constitution do not provide these protections
to people of faith in Georgia, that people of faith in Georgia under the current state
of law have the lowest possible level of legal protection that exists in our system,
that constitutional protections that folks expect to have and we have at the federal level
do not exist to protect people under Georgia law.
Since just 2021, however, eight states have passed state-level rifer laws, most with bipartisan
and many with near-unanimous majorities.
Rifer simply puts the First Amendment right to free exercise on the same level as the
The First Amendment writer Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Press, and Freedom of Assembly,
not by providing any kind of guarantee, but by providing a fair judicial balancing test,
where courts can weigh the duties of government with the basic rights of people.
So there's balance in fairness.
Under RIFRA before government can force a person to violate their faith, they must show
a compelling governmental interest and demonstrated they've accommodated the
person where they can and and they're impacting their their rights in the least
restrictive means possible. What does this mean? A couple examples we've seen
across the country. There was a boy out west, a Native American boy who was going
to be entering kindergarten. He stayed had a riffer law. Well the local school
board and his community told him I'm sorry boys can't have long braided hair.
Well, his family said, wait a minute, it's our, it's part of our Native American religious
heritage.
Long-rated hair is what boys have, it's our custom.
Well, school said, cut your hair or you can't enroll in school, with a family brought
a case, and the courts ruled, you know what, there's really, because they have a state
rougher along that state, they ruled there's not a compelling governmental interest to make
boys cut their hair if girls don't have to.
There wasn't a compelling interest for that.
And then the young man, the Native American,
young boy got to enter kindergarten
with his long braided hair,
because that's what that balancing test
was applied and it brought about a fair outcome.
However, it doesn't always rule on someone's behalf
in Florida.
There was a Muslim woman that was from the part of the tradition
within Islam that had where people were a full,
women were a full face veil in public.
She made the claim that she shouldn't have to remember
full-face veil for a photograph.
Well, the government said,
before we can issue a driver's license,
you have to remove your face veil.
When she brought in a speut,
she sided the state's riffle law, went to court.
You know what the court ruled?
They applied the balancing test.
And they said, ma'am,
you're gonna have to remove your full-face veil
to take your driver's license to throw that.
So there isn't compelling governmental interest
to have your face on your photo.
You're taking it in a photo
and put on your driver's license.
But the other part of the balancing test said,
what's the least restrictive means
that we the government can accomplish this?
Because the state of Florida had a RIFR act,
the government had to ask her,
how can we work with you to do this?
And the woman said, well, my real issue is
I don't want to have males that I'm not married to
taking my photo and I don't want to be exposed
in a room full of people.
So the RIFR law simply said, you know what?
Ma'am, we'll take your driver's license photo
the female photographer in a private room.
Your illicit right can be recognized, and our need to have your photo and your driver's
license can be recognized.
This balancing test, the delicateness and the fact-specific nature of riffer, takes a wide
variety of cases from people cutting their hair to living their faith, defeating the poor,
to covering their face for a driver's license.
It takes these circumstances and applies the law fairly so people of faith can recognize
enjoy their faith practices as much as possible while the government's duties can still be performed.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's 32 years of case law behind this. This is not new language. The
language we have in Cinnable 36 was, takes the federal language word for word,
Governor Brian Kemp's legal team worked to craft two clarifications to make sure that the
framework under Georgia, even more closely mirrors the federal framework by saying that
that Georgians, if we pass into Bill 36,
can't sue judges, seem like common sense.
But we want to state that in the bill
because you can't sue at the federal level.
We shouldn't be able to do it here.
It matches the federal law.
And he also included something that the previous
opponents of Riffer asked for, this clarification
that this does not establish a state religion.
In no way does Riffer do that, but Governor Kim's teams,
and let's just put that in the bill.
This is in no way establishes an efficient state religion.
Common sense stuff.
That bill has 32 years of legal history behind it.
And it's really the reason we can be very confident
that what we have before us today
is not going to create this parade of terribles
that the opponents of RIFRA claim.
I've got a chart here I'd like to,
if you could bring that in for me, Nathan.
I'm going to show you,
because this is breast conference
and because opponents of RIFRA have made wild claims
in front of you, the media, I want to come today
I want to lay these things out for everybody.
I told the business community here in town in Atlanta
and around the state, this is commonscent stuff
that applies across the nation.
We've kept the controversy down,
because this is not a controversial bill.
This is a simple, basic protection
that we're looking to put in place.
We've not been holding rallies,
we've not been having protests,
because we've been reckoning,
this is a simple, basic stuff.
We're having this press conference today
So I can explain to you the Atlanta news meeting,
the details, once again, of exactly what RIFR does.
And speak to the falsehoods you're hearing
in the hallway, in the halls of the Capitol
that are dramatically misbetraying this bill.
I'm here because the business community
asked me to speak to these things, clearly.
What you see before you hear in this chart
is you see the four prongs of the United States First Amendment,
freedom of religion, freedom of speech,
freedom of press, and freedom of assembly.
Because of the 1997 Supreme Court ruling,
Bernie V. Flores, you can see even though speech,
press and assembly receive full constitutional level
protections, which is called strict scrutiny level
protection, the freedom of religion
has the lowest level protection in Georgia.
That's the state of the law in Georgia.
While our civil rights laws cover just about everything,
The one place, the one hole, the one hole our United States Constitution does not protect
is one thing.
It's the freedom to practice your faith as individuals' faith comes into contact with
state and local governments.
Our U.S. Constitution and our Bill of Rights protects everything else, but this one thing.
That's why we have a river bill.
The gap you see right here, next slide, please.
What you also see here is, is you see within Georgia.
You can see all the states around us have full protections.
In fact, 39 of 50 states have full constitutional protections for the right to practice your
faith at the state and local level.
What you see in Georgia is you see these dots.
What do you think those are?
These weird shaped areas, those are military bases.
If you're on a military base in Georgia, you have full constitutional protection for
right to practice your faith. What do you think those dots are? Those dots are
our state prisons. There's a separate federal law, the Aralupa law that
provides specific protections, religious protections to people who are
institutionalized. So if you are in a, if you're a convicted felon today in a
state prison, you have full constitutional protection for your right to
practice your faith.
But law-abiding Georgians do not.
If that's not an absurdity, what is?
Law-abiding Georgians should have the same level of basic
protection to their right to practice their faith that
convicted felons in our prison system have.
That's the state of the law today.
The last slide is a very simple one.
You can see America overwhelmingly.
Every area in green, citizens have the full right
to practice their faith and have protection
with respect to state and local governments.
Except for the states in gray.
You can see Georgia stands alone.
As Thomas Hammond representing 1.4 million Georgia
Baptists said earlier, New York, New Jersey,
California, Oregon, they don't have it,
but notice Georgia.
We are the only Republican-led state in the nation
is not have these basic protections,
and many decidedly blue states, like Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Illinois, have these same protections.
This is not controversial, friends.
All we want is the basic right to protect our faith
that we enjoy with respect to federal government intrusion,
to protect us from cities, counties,
and public universities and public schools.
This is all we're asking for.
Friends, we share these things with you because this is solid law.
I have with me here, I've shared this, this was shared with House Representative Members
yesterday, the Senators have seen this.
This is a letter from 11 Law Professors.
It's sent to me from Doug Lackock.
Doug Lackock is a professor emeritus from the University of Virginia.
He is the attorney that wrote the federal referral law in 1993.
Doug Lekock sends this letter specifically with respect to Senate Bill 36.
He's joined by ten other law professors from Georgetown University, Princeton University,
Stanford University, University of Virginia, Notre Dame, and Harvard, sitting professors
and professors emeritus from these schools sent this letter to me saying we support Senate
Bill 36, because Senate Bill 36 does exactly what federal law does for people.
Nothing more, nothing less.
The claims you've heard in the hallway, the political claims that are levied against
this bill to try to influence elections and deceive the public and deceive the media,
is debunked by this letter.
Anyone want to see this letter?
I've got plenty of copies.
Anyone in the media, I give you a transcript of this.
In that, ladies and gentlemen, Senate Bill 36 is Governor Brian Kemp's language.
We passed a river bill out of the Senate last session that mirrored the federal language
exactly.
Governor Brian Kemp said, you know what, guys?
Good work.
Let's add these two clarifications to make sure there's no misperception about the two
things we alluded to earlier that you can't sue judges and that you can't, that we're
not somehow establishing a state religion by doing this.
clarifications that really don't require legal language, but Governor Kempsel, let's make
it crystal clear for all Georgians.
This is the same protection that exists at the federal level, we're simply replying
at the state and local governments.
Ladies and gentlemen, I love to conclude with you now.
I will address a couple things.
I know our people in the back, their legs are probably getting a little wobbly sitting
on these stairs, but there are eight questions I'm going to address.
on this debate, people in the news media have tried to weaponize mass media to accomplish
political goals by saying things that were simply not true. I want to, as I told members
of the business community here, I will come and talk to the Atlanta news media and address
every single one of these issues head on and very clearly that's what we're here to do today
to address these questions. The first question I will address is that you're going to hear
in debate, as this is debated on the floor of our legislative
chambers, one claim will be made, which is outrageously false.
People say, Representative Susser, why do we need a referabill?
Aren't we protected by the United States Constitution?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, as we said earlier,
the United States Constitution protects every single civil
right in our Bill of Rights and our whole framework
of federal civil rights.
In the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 1965,
fear of housing, all of those are protected
by the federal law except for this one thing.
The chart that I showed you,
the whole and our law, our federal law and constitution is,
because of this 1997 Supreme Court decision,
citizens cannot openly practice their faith
and they can enjoy their right to free exercise,
with respect to impacts by state and local government
unless a state legislatures specifically
and acts a bill exactly like Senate Bill 36.
That claim is demonstrally false.
Are there any questions from the Atlanta media
about that fact?
Any questions?
Does anyone dispute that fact in the Atlanta media?
Anybody?
Okay, so it's established the Atlanta news meter
recognizes that for this basic right
to be protected from state and local government impact
And I thank you for that.
The Atlanta news media wants to play this fairly.
It's very clear.
So there's no dispute that federal constitutional and
statutory protections don't apply to protecting people of
faith with respect to impacts from state and local government
unless the only protections we have for that is unless we pass
a state-level refer statute like Senate Bill 36.
Secondly, I hear this wild claim that it was said, the other than our rules committee
will probably be said in this debate as we move forward, unfortunately.
It's sad to hear.
People have said, well, Senator Sessler, Riffer is just a license to discriminate.
One of the things I've told our businessmen is, guys, it's not helpful when folks tell
these lies, they agree.
I'm here today on behalf of business leaders, community leaders to dispel and debunk these
falsehoods, the claim that rifres a license to discriminate, friends, rifres a balancing
test, rifres not an exemption, rifres doesn't exempt people from any laws. It simply recognizes
the powers that government has for important interest have to be performed. We doesn't
take those away. But rather than giving citizens the lowest level protection, almost no
no way to their rights, it simply elevates the rights of people to full-level constitutional
protections so that the courts can weigh the duties of government with the basic rights
of people so that the balancing test works like it's supposed, that's all it does.
This, if there's any question about that, and there's any question about what our federal
courts think about that, I would direct you to a 2012 Supreme Court decision, it's called
the Hosanna Table Lutheran case, the United States Supreme Court, in a 9-0 opinion.
How many opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court are 9-0 opinions these days?
And a 9-0 opinion where Justice Alina Kagan joined Justice Samuel Alito in their position
said that just because there's a established civil right in the federal law that's enumerated
and clear, it doesn't wipe out and invalidate someone's religious claim that the two have
to be balanced against each other.
The idea that rifer should be discarded and we don't need any right because it's going
to somehow work against people's civil rights and a non-zero opinion.
The U.S. Supreme Court said, basic rights are balanced against other rights.
In any right that's enumerated a law, the Constitution is weighed against others.
This is not about discrimination.
It's about giving every right under the umbrella of rights.
They're appropriate level wage.
They can be balanced by the courts.
The idea that refers to discrimination law was made nonsense that is at a table 2012 Supreme
Court case.
All rights are simply balanced against each other fairly.
We just want to make sure that religious rights don't win every time, but they get the
fair away they're supposed to have.
Third concern, this is something that a good friend of mine
from our Metro Chamber brought to me and said,
Ed, can you please be very clear about this?
And as a good friend, I've known him for years,
as I'm happy to.
There are 18 municipalities in Georgia
that have passed local non-discrimination ordinances.
Now back in 2015, some national groups came to the state
and said, hey, we're gonna come in with,
and I don't know what authority some national group has
to even say this.
They were talking about what they're gonna do
local non-schrimination ordinances. Guys, this bill leaves in place those 18 local
non-schrimination ordinances. It does it purposely. Now there are three states
that wipe out local non-schrimination ordinances. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Utah.
Local non-schrimination ordinances are not legal in those states they've been
prevented by their legislators.
Georgia doesn't do that.
This referral all leaves those 18 nondiscrimination ordinances in place,
so that as a person of faith, if we can take the rights which are not recognized
now and give them full religious rights, those nondiscrimination ordinances and
those communities, which raise the interest in the protections
for people from the LGBT community and from other communities,
elevates those rights higher than the other parts of the state.
We're okay with that.
The local ordinances are passed to do that.
But as courts weigh these interests,
the citizen of faith shouldn't have no rights.
It should weigh these fairly.
This is a down-the-middle fair bill that allows those local communities
to enact those ordinances in the past and in the future.
More communities will probably enact those.
Riffer doesn't seek to change that.
It leaves those in place.
And to my good friend on the chamber
who asked me about this,
the groups in 2015 that said they're gonna wipe
those laws out, I don't know who they were.
I know now who they were, but they wasn't me.
This building specifically does not do that.
Claims the contrary or trying to deceive you
as the news media that say that we leave those in place.
And because of that, I tell people,
river travels well.
There's a higher interest, higher protection
for certain groups.
The one community recognizes we welcome their ability to do this.
The people of faith should not be hobo with no rights.
People of faith, their rights should be recognized fully
and let courts weigh these things out
in this balancing test as they should.
The friends I know are, our time is moving on.
I know it's hard to hear me talk.
I just want to address these issues
because these are flat-out,
myth-shoots that have been told in this process.
The fifth question.
It was asked of me and our rules committee last week,
where have these problems been in Georgia?
Show me problems in Georgia where we need this.
This is just a solution looking for a problem.
The enemies are ripped for say.
Well friends, there's a young man named Chike.
He was a Boonham.
He was a student at Georgia Clinic College.
And in 2017, he followed the instructions.
He was gonna share his faith in the student center
and was told to stand over the free speech zone.
He actually went to his free-speed zone and actually we're sharing his faith.
He was told by the school administration, you can't say those things.
The content of his speech, they said, was not okay.
They shut him down.
He brought a case.
He said, wait a minute.
First of all, I tried to work it out with the administration.
They wouldn't listen to him.
He shut him down.
He had no choice.
So he brought a case.
That case, as it was working with the system, he made a claim on free exercise.
Even a claim on free speech.
Our current attorney general, who is friendly to the concept of religious liberty, said
I'm sorry, your free exercise claim won't stand.
You don't have constitutional level of strict scrutiny protections for your right to free
exercise.
Your protection is the lowest level possible.
The school can shut you down for any rational reason they choose.
And they said that you're upsetting some other students that they can shut you down.
That's completely legal because the current state of the law in our state is that government
can shut you down for any rational reason you choose because he does not have constitutional
protections for free exercise.
Now fortunately, GK had two claims.
He had a claim for free exercise and he had a claim for free speech.
His free speech claim actually on speech grounds and went all the way to the United States
Supreme Court and he actually went his case on speech grounds.
But it was very clear, our current Attorney General confirmed you do not have
cautious protections for your right of free exercise, and in she case case was a
shocking example to prove that for everyone. Number six, to pass Rifford, Georgia
needs a comprehensive civil rights bill. People say, we're one of only a few
states that doesn't have a comprehensive civil rights framework at the state
level. Well, you know why we don't? Because federal law protects all of these
civil rights very, very well. The robust protections of our federal law and
constitution provides better protections than we could provide at the state
level. We talked about earlier, the robust protections in our federal courts
give more protection to people than any state statute could and would and
It applies to every single case of law that could be raised into a whole umbrella of
civil rights law, federal law already protects you for it.
Every single thing except free exercise with respect to state and local governments.
We are filling this hole.
If this hole wasn't needed, we wouldn't have a bill.
We wouldn't be having a press conference today because there would be no need to do it.
that federal law provides robust protections.
In fact, in the federal system,
if your civil rights are violated
and you win on the merits,
you get full attorneys fees.
It is a way better system for people
than anything our state could provide.
That's why we leave it at the federal level.
Also prevents extra lawsuits,
prevents venue shopping, unequal justice.
Our federal system provides one level of justice
across our state,
whereas 159 candidates could create
a massive patchwork that would be K.I.
That's why we don't need a federal civil rights statute
to pass RIFRA.
The state in the future is used to do that at some point,
but it's not needed for RIFRA.
We're simply patching a whole.
A couple more claims.
Well, Representative Setsler, RIFRA only protects Christians.
Friends, I have Christians and non-Christians behind me here.
I like to thank folks from the many communities
that join us today.
If you look across the nation,
RIFRA laws have protected people primarily
minority faiths. We talked about the Native American boy. We talked about the
Muslim woman. We talked about, we talked about folks in other states who were
Christian business people. We also have Mary Steinmetz from Kansas, a Jehovah's
Witness woman who believed in her faith she couldn't take blood transfusions.
She died because her state didn't ever refer law and she was not willing to
take a blood transfusion for a medical procedure she needed in 2008. Her
For years, law and court letter to lose her life through cirrhosis of the liver because
she wouldn't take a blood transfusion and there was no referal on her state when all
this started.
Friends, it helps mostly minority religious groups.
It's not just a Christian thing.
Folks, I will have an ed, you know, refer's just an extreme law.
It's, it's, it's, it's, this, this, this, this light system discriminate.
Where are you?
We've covered that.
You're going to hear these wild claims again and again, friends.
We've covered these things.
All we're doing is to take the same protections that protect
folks from federal government intrusion and unfair federal
government action and apply it to our state law.
Friends all conclude today.
I'd like to thank the folks that joined me.
But if we can pass, Senate Bill 36,
the Legislative Freedom Restoration Act tomorrow
and our statehouse.
I'd like to thank somebody that would be a hero of that
process. The hero, if we pass Senate Bill 36 tomorrow into law, the hero of that
process would be Governor Nathan Deal. In 2016, when the Rifer bill and other things
passed through the House, there were some concerns, there were some bad language in that
bill, that other things added and some other things that really muddied up the federal
framework. If we pass Senate Bill 36 tomorrow, Nathan
Deel is a hero for religious freedom for vetoing that bad bill in 2016. It was a bad
bill in 2016. It had extra stuff in it that wasn't the federal language. We simply want
the federal protections to protect folks in Georgia and Nathan Deel will be the hero
by vetoing that bad bill and leading the way for the federal language that would be
signed by Governor Camp, support about the House and Senate going into law to dad. I
like the folks to hear that, like to thank him for that,
but we've got to complete the drill.
This is our finished and raised press conference.
We had people with faith with us today,
there's gonna be some praying,
and they're a ton to after our press conference.
But friends, I'd like to thank the media for being with us,
and I'd like to offer you the opportunity
to ask some questions if you have some.
Are there any questions?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, that language that was offered in committee doesn't provide with their states have with
that language of committee was going to do was going to exempt a claim of discrimination
from refer even applying.
We're talking about the balancing test.
When you have any claim of discrimination
versus another claim, they have to be weighed by the courts.
Would those, without amendment would have done,
would have invalidated and wiped out
RIFRA completely.
RIFRA couldn't be weighed on behalf of the person
of faith against those claims.
Those claims would have completely exempted RIFRA loss.
It was a Trojan horse that would have not
have created a balancing test, who would have made any one of these claims of discrimination
completely exempt from even consideration of the person to faith, it was a Trojan horse.
Yes sir?
Yeah, I'm confident the House of Representatives will support this.
I'm confident the votes are there. I think there are people in both parties who'd like to support
this. I think with recognition that when you look at Utah passing their
Riffer Law a little over a year ago, it was unanimous in one of their
chambers. It was voted with overwhelming majorities in most states. We had
bipartisan support in Wyoming, other states. It's really up to the decision of
individual members for themselves and in the minority party here. I think
There are many who recognize this is right.
I would welcome a large bipartisan vote,
but I know we've got the votes in the floor
with the House to do this.
It's just a matter of making the decision
we need to do it this year.
I thank the leadership.
I thank the leadership that's deliberating on this.
Carefully, they're friends of mine.
They believe in this deeply.
It's a matter of timing.
I think it's important to recognize the timing
respectfully is now.
Any other questions?
Any other questions?
I have any other questions.
Guys, I've covered a lot of ground,
because specifically members of the business community
have asked me how to address these questions head on.
We've talked about these in committee.
I talked about these a couple of years ago.
We first presented this bill,
but I wanted to go head on to the falsehoods
you're hearing out there in the political,
in the political speak in committee.
You might even hear him in the well
of some of our chambers,
but the federal law applying to city, county,
in state governments it's common sense not controversial as some of our
speakers earlier said and because of that I would encourage Georgia leaders to
act tomorrow day 39 to pass the Legislative Freedom Restoration Act this is
no demand this is it's a request guys this is this is a process we're not
standing here in protest we respect the leaders in this chamber deeply they
agree with this legislation. We're just urging folks to see the urgency of now.
Last year, there were some concerns about just some of the cast of election year.
This is the year to do this. We can do this with substance. We've taken questions.
We've had the debate. We've answered the questions. And the time is now.
I'd like to thank members of the business community who support this. We're standing behind me.
and let's pass the British Freedom Restoration Act in 2020. Thank you.
