----------
We're going to talk about education issues. Today's teenagers don't remember life without cell phones,
once they get to high school, most have them, and in some cases, they've had teachers even
encouraging them for assignments. On July 1st, last year, a Georgia law took effect to ban
them for children in eighth grade or younger. The author of that bill joins us. Republican
representative Scott Hilton of Peachtree Corners. He chairs the House Committee on information
and audits, he serves as Secretary of the House Education Committee.
Also here is Democratic Senator Rashon Kemp of Atlanta, who works in education.
He is on the Senate Education and Youth Committee, along with government oversight and urban
affairs.
Welcome to you both.
I appreciate this.
Let's start with some numbers.
It's been six months, as I said, since state law went into effect to ban students in kindergarten
through eighth grade from using cell phones.
A recent survey conducted by the Professional Association of Georgia Educators or Page
with Georgia Southern University found that nearly 72% of educators believe the distraction-free
education act will improve student learning. About 71% of teachers indicate a similar ban on
personal electronic devices are needed in 9 through 12th grades and that number climbs to 83%
among high school teachers.
So apparently they really want this German Hilton.
You sponsored Bell to Bell for the younger students.
What has led you to keep this going?
What kind of response have you received so far?
Well, you highlighted the data,
but the response from parents, teachers, administrators
has just been overwhelming.
And frankly, life changing for a lot of students
who are now realizing, man, I can learn in a cell phone
free environment, we are seeing grades improve,
fights in the class go down and students socializing and you know really a lot of improvements to mental health
So just all around a tremendous impact K through 8 and it's just the next logical step is to expand that to high school
33 states plus the district of Columbia have done a cell phone free
legislation bipartisan
Collection of states George is the only one that did K through 8. I'm proud of us for doing that
I think we put our toe in the water and help get folks and parents used to it
and now I think the next logical step is to include high school.
So a phase in worked, you think?
I think so. Your thoughts?
Well, look, I'm a former high school teacher and principal
and I can tell you, my teacher is what pole that same amount.
You know, I think it is critically important
that we extend this up to high school.
Having been in a high school environment,
we know a lot of what Scott referred to,
you know, the fights and the bullying
and just the distractions are, you know,
they don't stop at eighth grade
and so it's important for us to bring that up
to the high school level.
Okay, so it's HB-109-109.
109, tell us exactly, would it be exactly the same?
It's similar to the K-8 with a few exceptions.
We wanted to carve out, high school is different.
We recognize that.
And so there's a lot of different off-campus activities
that students participate in, dual enrollment, jobs.
We want to make sure kids have the flexibility,
parents have access to them for those type of activities.
but the science tells us that a bell to bell works best.
The reason being is we want teachers
to get out of being the cell phone police,
allow them to teach and students to learn.
So it'll look similar to K-8 with a few exceptions,
and we want the community, we want teachers, parents,
please reach out to us through this legislative process
so we can perfect this and get it right the first time.
Where are you in the hearing process?
Yeah, we expect to get a hearing in the next couple weeks.
Again, would encourage folks to reach out to their lawmaker,
Let us hear your feedback.
We'd love to know that.
We want you to be a part of this process with us.
Okay.
You have another education bill, SB 381.
And that would direct education funding through the QBE,
the quality basic education formula,
to help students living in poverty,
students in foster care,
students who are in unstable housing.
So tell us a little bit about that.
Yeah, you know, Georgia's one of only six states
that does not account for poverty
when we're funding students in our funding formula.
So it's time that we update.
It hasn't been updated since I was five years old.
It's time that we update our QBE formula
and account for the things that are impacting students
in education now.
And I truly believe that when we better invest
in students in our poverty from Atlanta,
all the way down to Valdosta,
we're going to see improvements in educational outcomes.
We are in the state in which 30% of our kids
are reading on grade level or not reading on grade level,
meaning 70% or not.
So we have to do more to invest in public education
and I think addressing poverty is the way to go.
So how would this work?
So what this would do was give additional 25%
of what we currently do with QBE to school districts
that have high students and amount of students in poverty.
And it also directs them how to spend the money
to make sure we're investing it properly.
We can't just pour money
without some oversight and expectation
that we're investing properly in educating our students.
Okay, and so any where where's that bill right now same with representative Hilton's bill
We need a hearing so people reach out to your folks in the Senate and tell them to hear send a bill 381
Yeah, you're you're feeling really good about things with this
You did get pushback last year though didn't you we did some parents were concerned about school safety as a dad of three kids
I share that same concern. We talked to the safety community who all said this was the best decision
In case an emergency, you want kids focused on getting to the right place.
But yeah, we feel good. I appreciate the speaker lending his support.
And just all the things we're doing around education to promote
literacy and really help our kids advance in Georgia.
It's a great day. We're moving the right direction.
And each school district has done this differently.
Talk about the different ways they have
stopped having the kids, you know, some are putting them in packages
packages or you know yeah we believe every school district knows best and so
they ought to be able to design a program that works best for them what's
neat about the K through 8 bill is a lot of high school said proactively let's
go ahead and do a cell phone three classrooms on our own and so a good
majority of systems have already implemented this without even needing a
lot because they see the benefits first hand I'm curious I mentioned the fact
that I remember doing stories about how teachers were using the cell phones to help kids
learn.
So that takes that all out altogether, right?
It does.
Yeah, what we found is, you know, when you do that, you know, the kids immediately.
You know what's going to happen.
They do the school activity and then they're back on social media and so we definitely want
to allow for school devices, think Chromebooks and tablets and things like that.
But for your personal device, I know from it, it's just so tempting to, you know, start
surfing the internet and things and we, that's a distraction from learning.
Okay, and the teachers still have them too.
They're still allowed to have them.
I want to get to another bill that you're looking at.
You plan to drop a voucher accountability bill.
What is that?
Yeah, you know, all public schools,
they are expected to have students perform at grade level
or they face repercussions the same with charter schools.
And you know, I believe that if we're going to give
public dollars to private schools,
the same expectation should be placed up on them.
And so this bill would require them to show some academic
success with their students or face a lose in the ability to have students come in with
a promise scholarship.
So accountability in what way?
So just tracking the data or?
Academics.
So, you know, all of the schools that take advantage of this program, they have to give
a norm reference test.
And so now we're saying let's take that a step further and say that students should
be performing at grade level on those tests.
If they're not, then you, given some opportunities over four years to improve, if not, then you
you could face losing opportunity to bring students in
on the promise scholarship.
Oh, interesting.
OK, I wondered, I know you're on education in the house.
Talk about anything else that we may see come up.
You know, I've got a really important bill
that I'm working on, especially for our community,
in regards to what's called this red shirting.
You know, a lot of families, especially those
with summer birthdays, want to hold their child back,
just to give them more time to develop, mature,
and enter school at the right age.
And so state law is kind of silent on this issue right now.
So I introduce legislation that says to empower parents
in that decision making process to say you can decide
when you first enroll your child into school.
And so that helps parents give them the certainty
and be able to plan that process for their child.
So it's not using the age, it's not saying six
or what is it, six right now, right?
Yeah, right now Georgia has to offer public education at age six.
some parents, especially of boys in the summer
are enrolling their child at six in kindergarten,
which some of the science tells us
that that's best for that child.
So I believe that the parent knows best
what path that child ought to take.
And so, again, this legislation will empower them
in that decision-making process.
And I would think you like that too.
Yeah.
I'd love to learn more about it.
All right, Ben, I love that.
Well, thank you both for coming on the show
and it's always good to have people
talking about education.
Where does the biggest portion of our budget?
Education, so thanks so much for coming on.
