----------
Good morning everyone if you if you would please come in and take your seats and
we'll call the meeting to order.
Representative Hope him to open up with word prayer. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Let us

our loved ones. And please comfort those among us who are struggling and suffering and
hold them in your hand. We ask this in your holy name. Amen.
I mean, thank you very much.
Okay, we'll hear from our visitors over here.
Good morning, Senator.
You've been meeting 6 a.m. this morning?
Committee this morning, so I had to, when I woke up at 4, I just drank a lot of coffee.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, committee members, I'm here to present SB 102 at some page two, second from the bottom.
All we've done with this bill is we've added some language dealing with cock fighting.
And there's been a little misinformation going around number one, I love fried chicken.
And number two, the individual would have to have intent to fight chickens,
In Cox in order to violate this law, currently the federal government comes into Georgia and
enforces this law, and our local law enforcement have no jurisdiction over this, because today
Georgia is not illegal, and we are the only state in the United States where it is not
illegal.
A leads to a lot of gambling, drug trafficking and sex trafficking, and appreciate the consideration
of the committee.
Okay.
Do you have a question for you, Kim and Powell?
My friend, I have concerns about this, but this is dog fighting and you left the language
in on dog fighting.
Dog fighting is in there, yes or we just added the cock fighting into the dog fighting
statute.
I'm afraid that's what you've done, but I've got a couple of questions in the original
version of your bill.
It basically even folks who have long since quit fighting roosters were still breeding
these.
Did that have y'all taken that have you taken that language out that would be so arbitrary?
The folks who are raising these roosters there is there is nothing illegal about anybody raising gamecocks as long as they're not raising them with the intent to fight them.
The way the bill's written it does not make it illegal to raise gamecock.
In my district, we still my cousin still raised the game foul. He just doesn't fight him anymore. He shows them.
So then this how would this be interpreted folks that raise these roosters and they send them out of stake
Obviously people know when they send a
Rooster of Mexico or wherever it may be
That they're doing that for a purpose. So we'll just have any infringement on those people
I would say from a law enforcement standpoint if there were something where they were sending them across state lines
That would be a federal violation anyway
especially if they were sent on to Mexico or Puerto Rico where I know
cock fighting is a sport in those countries so I don't think that would that
wouldn't impact as much the state jurisdiction as it would federal
jurisdiction which would already be an effect under federal law so did any of
the other language I think the first version we looked at folks had a lot of
old antique gear that your grandfather's and others had it would be illegal to
to possess those old antique emblems.
No, sir, it would only be illegal
if they possessed those with the intent
to use them to fight.
I myself, if it were illegal to possess them,
I would be violating the law today.
I have a lot of my grandfather's,
my father's and my uncles,
fighting apparatus from when they fought birds
when I was a kid.
Thank you, sir.
I have another question, Richard Williams.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
to the author of the bill to follow up on what representative just asked, I'm one of the
few probably had a chance to completely to spend a week with a group in Alabama that
raised fighting cocks, one of the biggest exports to Philippines and believed me, everybody
knew they were for gambling and from the Philippines they went all over the far east so it's
I've just the problem I have is it's almost like exporting a forbidden drug, even though
you don't get caught, it might not be specific, but when we know the reason, it's a real
problem to be able to export these birds.
Yes, sir.
That would currently be a violation of federal law and cock fighting is illegal in Alabama.
If it didn't stop much.
No, sir.
Anybody that wants to break the law is going to take more than passing law to stop them.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
I'm just here for Senate Bill 177, it's a transparency bill related to foreign funded activities.
Okay, 177.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you sir.
Thank you all.
Okay.
Senator Williams.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
Second page, a little over halfway down, Senate Bill 29, this has to do with DNA sampling collection and analysis of DNA samples of someone who's arrested for committing one of the seven deadly sins at the time of booking when they are fingerprinted, they would be swabbing them for DNA sample.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
And on the back page, I still have Senate Bill 260, which is Central State Hospital Redevelopment
Authority revitalizing that one.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Senator Wolfe.
Good morning, on page four, Senate Bill 284 would allow the securities division to require an investment advisor that defrauded Georgians to allow them to require them to return the funds to the defrauded investors.
Currently, the only tools they have are civil fines,
suspending the license issued in the CCS order.
That kind of thing.
Okay.
Don't see any questions.
Thank you.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'm Reed.
Chair and members of the committee,
I believe Senator Sam Watson is coming for Senate Bill 59,
pertaining to municipal sovereign immunity,
but I'll let him request that.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do we have any requests from committee members?
Carefully dimsy.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman.
I think on your desk you have a substitute to SB 131.
This is to deal with an important issue
to the house particularly involving parity.
It adds one member to the behavioral coroner
and council, the insurance commissioner,
and a parity compliance review panel,
which is so important right now for us to really make sure
that everyone is treated with mental health issues
the same way they are with their own health.
This passed the House 170 to two on March 3rd.
Okay.
Don't see any questions for you.
Jim Erwin, you had a request?
Yes, sir.
Senate Bill 17, I believe it's before you also.
It was substitute of some language members.
Remember this is the bill for the crisis alert for schools
as well as their mapping.
The substitute deals with the mapping allows the school system
if they recently have purchased these maps
and already have them in place.
We realized we needed to give them some data
to use those maps and to allow the administrator
to approve those maps for the crisis alert.
Don't see any questions.
Okay, you've heard the explanation on that.
On Senate Bill 131, is there a motion to approve?
Please.
So I have a motion and a second to approve the substitute.
Have a question, Chair.
Leader, hugely.
Mr. Chairman, I wanted to offer something
as a substitute for that bill as well.
not changing what the general lady has offered, but I think it will be wise for us to add the
language from representative tile or Paul Smith's bill as it related to Tana and making
those changes to Tana if that will be possible for consideration by the committee.
Okay, we would need the proposed substitute and I don't have that and we don't have copies
passed around so I'm going to prove that out of order at this moment.
Okay, so on Senate Bill 131, is there a move to approve that?
Move to the second, any opposition? Okay, it's been approved.
All right, now on Senate Bill 17, same thing you've heard the explanation of that,
is a motion to approve that and move in second in your position. Okay, those are to approve.
Okay, and let me mention something to you about the substitutes as well. If you have a substitute,
what we need to have you to do is bring 35 copies in the original 01 and 02 of that substitute,
to Leo in the room's office.
Reason we ask you to make those copies, our printer is on the blink up there, and we
can't make the print for you, so if you have a substitute, we need the original one and
two plus 35 copies, and that needs to be turned into the room's office, so we'd ask you
a cooperation on that.
Okay, now, let's set a calendar, today this will be a supplemental calendar for day 39
under modified structure. You've heard Senate Bill 131 by substitute, that's the
LC-33-9827ERS. Have a move in a second. Is there any opposition? Okay, it's on.
and then Senate Bill 17 by substitute that's LC 49 2 4 0 8 s have a move in a
second is there any opposition that's on okay that sets our supplemental
calendar for today and I suspect we'll be seeing you later on in the day y'all
have a good day thank you
You
