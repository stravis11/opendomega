TRANSCRIPT
----------
Good afternoon. My name is State Senator Nebula Assam Parks. I stand before you
today not just as a state senator but as a fiery advocate for every
Georgian family and as a first expectant mother ever in the state Senate. I'm
fighting not just for the future of my children but for all of our children. We
are out of crossroads folks where the choices we make today in this legislature
will echo in our homes our schools and our wallets for generations to come.
Now, let's talk about priorities because it seems we've got a case of misplaced ones
right here.
We've got a legislator that's bending over backward to pass a tax break for gun owners.
Yes, you heard that, right?
While our families are counting pennies trying to make ends meet, the powers that be think
that we really need is a cheaper way to buy guns during hunting season and build that's
not just a missed shop but a misfire in addressing the real needs of Georgians.
But here I am, standing up, not just for common sense, but for common decency, I've introduced
a trio of bills that aim to lighten the load for Georgia's families.
First up, it's Senate Bill 51, because believe it or not, in the year 2023, we're still
taxing menstrual products.
As if managing menstruation is a luxury.
When ladies are gentlemen, it's time to end this archaic discriminatory pink tax and
acknowledge that tampons and pads are not optional.
They are a medical necessity.
And let's not forget, the most vulnerable Georgians.
Senate Bill 372 is here to offer a tax break
for supplies used in the first three years of a baby's life.
Dipers, strollers, you name it.
Because if there's anything that you unite us, left or right,
it is a belief that our infants deserve a healthy start in life.
And next, we've got Senate Bill 527.
Because somehow, we've forgotten that the education
is a cornerstone of our future.
This bill is about restoring the sales tax holiday
on school supplies, and this isn't a new concept.
It's a proven relief that we, inexplicably,
let slip through our fingers.
And it's time we brought it back.
Making it easier for parents to provide
for the children's educational needs
without the added stress of the sales tax.
And it's about supporting our families
and investing in our children's future.
And folks, this isn't just about taxes.
It's about values.
And it's about choosing to support families over fire
arms, babies over bullets.
And while some in this legislature are pre-occupied
with pandering to the gun lobby and playing politics,
I'm here fighting for policies that
put Georgia's families first.
So I ask my colleagues, and I ask every Georgian, what
kind of state do we want to live in?
One that prioritizes tax breaks for ammunition
or one that invests in people,
from our school children to our hardworking parents,
and to every woman and girl
who's ever had to pay extra for a basic necessity.
And the choice is clear.
Let's choose families, let's choose progress,
and let's choose compassion and common sense,
and let's pass these bills and show the country
what Georgia really stands for.
Thank you.
I'm open to any questions.
How about these bills are, oh, they're very, I get emails every day asking me to please
pass the bill and menstrual products, please end the sales tax on diapers.
Please reintroduce the school supplies tax holiday because they feel like it is a grave
injustice that we've prioritized guns and not the basic necessities of hard working
Georgia families. Well, I feel like this has bipartisan support. It's just not being
prioritized right now, which is a shame. And as we've seen in the state senate, we've
already passed a bill, a prioritizing five day gun tax holiday, but none of these bills
have been brought to the Senate floor.
There's also a measure to provide incentives for the state of Georgia, the number one leading
cause of children is guns and so that I supported but we don't need a gun
tax holiday for guns. This was not something that none of my constituents emailed
me about, called me about or have mentioned in a town hall.
Are these bills going to sign a committee yet?
I got a hearing only on the Senate Bill 51 last session and they've been
assigned to the Finance Committee and I've asked for a hearing in a vote and I
have not I've yet to receive one on a personal level. Do you remember going
school shopping and there not be a tax on my parents prior to like I can't
honestly I I am not what about to be 35 my memory is not that sharp but I do
remember though going on the days that there was a tax holiday and we bought
everything that day and in the stores were packed because it has saved on average annually Georgians 50 million dollars in sales taxes
This is
My chief staff provided for me you he found it actually online and
He was able to tell me that's about how much it's been saving Georgians when we had it in effect
That's a big number 50 million dollars is a big number
for that one weekend correct we would wait until that one weekend because it
did provide I grew up in a working class family my mom was a warehouse worker
my dad was a file clerk you know I went to I grew up on free and reduced
lunches and so these schools the the tax holiday and school supplies was a
form of relief for my family and something that we look forward to and it
saddens me that we haven't brought this back even though we have a sixteen
billion dollar surplus and yet we've prioritized a tax holiday for
goods instead of school supplies.
It's just shocking to me.
It's not only beneficial to your
constituents, but this is the first one.
Yes, it is personal to me.
And I feel like my story is a story of many
Georgians in the state of Georgia.
And that's why when I come to the state senate,
I know that I have a lot of shared lived experiences with so
many working Georgians.
And that's why I introduce these bills because I want to make
sure that they get the relief that they deserve.
What is your choice?
The final thought, saying, do you want to leave us with?
We should no one understand.
Georgia should know that Democrats have introduced bills to provide relief when it comes to
menstrual products, when it comes to products for babies under the age of three, and when it
comes to school supplies for children and teachers, and that we are trying to pass them.
We are prioritizing these bills over trying to pass a five day tax all day for guns.
Look.
Thank you.
