Please join us in pledge of allegiance A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic which is saying One nation Indivitable with liberty and justice for all and the Georgia flag A pledge allegiance to the Georgia flag in the principles of which is saying With some justice moderation Friends it's an honor to bring our guests past of the day to day and I just

For those of you who know me and know what I got to do for 30 years, I worked part of the gym with Justice State probation officer and it was my calling to do that. And it was my mission field that I got to work in and had the privilege to work in. And just to share with you just something that happened this past couple of months, I spoke to one of my former probationers, they reached out to me calling me because they had an issue. Turns out he's in his 40s, which means I'm old really old now. But after we were talking on the phone, I was on my way here, actually, one morning. And he said, Chuck, can I pray for you? And to go from that young man sitting in my office, they probably one time hated the... hated everything that was coming out of my mouth and everything I stood for to now be praying over me. I just say, do I tell you that? Do you know that there is a God and he does work within the hearts and minds of people. And Emily Kelly, I met her because through this job, and she serves as the director of the Office of Chaplain Services for the Georgia Department of Juveness Justice. Chaplain Kelly's first began as a chaplain intern at Metro RYDC Regional Youth Attention Center. In 2015, while attending Emory University's Kenner School of Theology, she continued as a religious volunteer and was hired as the Northwest Georgia Regional Chaplain in 2018. In addition, she earned her Master of Divinity from Emory University. Chaplain Kelly is a provisional beacon within the United Methodist Church and has held a clear discernment for working at the Department of Juveness Justice throughout her ordination. She believes that taking the time to truly see and hear each person we interact with, we can actually change the world. To hear the hearts and souls of other people, we can change the world. This might have honored and introduced you, Emily Kelly. Good morning, good morning. It is truly an honor to be here this morning. The youth we serve within the Department of Juveness Justice are always in some sort of transition. So you'll find a copy of a prayer that we're going to be looking at today as we prepare and also as a way as we center down for this final day. It starts with saying it helps now and then to step back and to take a long view. The kingdom is not only beyond our efforts, it is even beyond our vision. We accomplish in our lifetime only a tiny fraction of the magnificent enterprise that is God's work. Nothing we do is complete, which is a way of saying that the kingdom always lies beyond us. No statement says all that could be said, no prayer fully expresses our faith. No confession brings perfection, no pastoral visit brings wholeness. No program accomplishes the church's mission. No set of goals and objectives includes everything. This is what we are about. We plant the seeds that one day will grow. We water seeds already planted knowing that they hold future promise. We lay foundations that will need further development. We provide yeast that produces far beyond our capabilities. We cannot do everything. And there is a sense of liberation with realizing that. This enables us to do something and to do it very well. It may be incomplete but it is a beginning, a step along the way, an opportunity for the Lord's grace to enter in and do the rest. We may never see the end results, but that is the difference between the Master Builder and the Worker. We are workers not Master Builders. Ministers not Messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our own. Amen. Now if not known, Senator Chuck Payne long as some of y'all may. However, I have a feeling that it does not take long to learn that he believes that we shall hope instead of want. In fact, a little birdie has shared with me that if you are going to speak to Senator Payne, that you must wrap it up in a gift of hope. Now I think we want to see this as a beautifully wrapped gift. But I am also reminded of how a room looks when the gifts have become unwrapped. There is wrapping paper all over the floor. It is under chairs and tables. It is half way but not completely inside the garbage bag. This dishevelled image of hope is what it presents hope in my mind. As the prayer we read says it helps now and then to step back and take a long view. Can we take a step back or are we so caught up with what we think we want? As a Chaplain, I respond to various situations. And I have to remind myself to take a step back before entering into a pastoral care moment. I think back to a youth I was notified about who had just learned that his brother had died. As I was walking to see the youth, I knew that we had never had an interaction that ended with him asking me if I could pray for him. And so while I wanted to pray for him and I wanted to take away the paying-filled grief away from him, I knew that those words would only be a temporary act of trying to problem-solve. I could have checked a box but I would not be acting on a vision of ministry that I hope for. Instead of re-rapping the gift, I did not pray aloud for this youth. I instead did my best to collect the torn wrapping paper. And I asked him, I asked him instead if he would want to read a book with me. I gave him Howard Thurman's Meditations of the Heart and each week we would get together and wrestle with the text. And at the end of every time we would meet, I would ask him how I could be praying for him. And he would respond, I don't know. Now is this the answer that I wanted? No! But finally, finally one day when I asked how I could be praying for him, he said to me, he opened up and shared the prayers with me. And we sat on the gym floor together and we prayed. Now I was able to, a year later, anoint him with oil following his baptism. This story puts into perspective of why our hope must overcome our desire to want. The prayer we first read says that nothing we do will be complete. You entered into this position within the Senate with your own sense of calling, and own vision of hope. You have spent countless hours, and on this final day I feel like I should say countless hours again, striving to make the state of Georgia a better state. You have built on its foundation. What is your vision of hope? Take the time to take a step back and to remind yourself why you first felt called to this position. Will you pray with me? Almighty Creator, we understand that we are merely adding to a foundation that is ever changing. You give us the ability to have a vision of hope. Allow for each person here to recognize the community of people that they have around them, and the various visions of hope that each person has. Liberate our minds as we remember that we cannot do everything, but enable us to do something, while it may be incomplete it is a beginning. May the presence of God be felt and seen in this space. May a vision of hope remain throughout our time. Amen. you you you you you you you you all we need to As the AJC put it, the best dress senators in the room here. I think we had several that made the best dress legislators here. A couple of our freshmen senators made that list. Senator Islam, Senator Eccles, Senator Williams. I know I'm breaking the rules right now, but... Anyways, let's give everybody around those senators round of applause. For looking their best every day. We also have a very special guest here. We have the Watermelon Queen. George a Watermelon Queen here today. Let's give her a round of applause here. Thank you. You You You You You You You You You You You You You We have we have some special guests here today. We're going to do special presentations, but the senator from the 21st asked very nicely, but it really wasn't him that got it there. It was his, his wife, Shantel Beach here. Let's welcome Shantel Beach here. He, he and the, she and the senator from the 21st just celebrated 39 years of marriage. And anybody can put up with the senator from the 21st for 39 years as a special lady. I can tell you that. But we are here today because we have the Kings Ridge Christian Academy. The King Ridge Christian School. And they are have several young men here with us today that are part of the state champion basketball team. That one earlier this year and the single Georgia high, single A Georgia High School Association. It's great to have them here and I'm going to recognize the senator from 21st to introduce them. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be brief day 40, but I just want to congratulate these young men on their state championship. I was on the founding board of Kings Ridge in 2001 when John Smolts and Jeff Foxworthy started that school and we only had K through 8. Then we had decided to have a high school and our first graduating class was six seniors. We couldn't even have fielded a basketball team. And now in 2023 we're state champs and I'm very proud of this school. It sits on a hundred acre campus. It's almost a thousand students now and Coach Martin. I'm very proud of your team. You've built a successful program. You know, we started with great academics. We now have great fine arts and now we've got great athletics here at Kings Ridge. So I'm very proud of them. My wife is Director of Admissions at Kings Ridge. And with that I want to introduce Coach Martin to introduce these young men and congratulate them on their state championship. Coach Martin. I just want to say thank you for taking time for this to happen. It's humbling and honoring to be here. I feel very privileged and special. Thank you gentlemen. I appreciate you a ton. Behind me you will see Micah Hoover. Step forward, Micah if you would please. Jack Thomas. Zach Thomas. And Isaac Martin. I'm so proud of these young men. I think we accomplished something that most people thought we could not. But we give all praise and glory to our Lord and Savior. Thank you. Thank you. Good job, Coach. Good job, Coach. Thank you.

You did give up. That's great. Thank you, einzige slap. Fine. a very special guest. Come on up here Senator. Commissioner, we got our Commissioner of Agriculture here today. Let's get around to applause for our Commissioner Agriculture here. He's here to check on the budget. I can assure you that.

Dr. Delvany Head is here today and I'm I'm penshitting for Senator from the 39th right now but she is making her second visit here. Third third third visit here to the Capitol. So we appreciate her service and let's give her a warm welcome for everything she does. Thank you Mr. President, Senators and distinguished guests. Thank you for the warm welcome. It is an honor to be a part of this great tradition. It's an honor to be a part of this great tradition and service doctor of the day. It's also a privilege to serve the people of Georgia as a member of the Southeast Permanente Medical Group with Kaiser Permanente. While some of you may be familiar with our practice, we are the largest physician-owned physician-led group in Atlanta. I practice at the Kaiser Permanente Cascade Medical Office which is one of our 26 locations across the metro area and I'm honored to practice in the same area where I was raised. As an Atlanta native, I've lost count how many times I've passed by this I kind of building so I'm honored to be able to serve here. It's more meaningful than words can say. Well thank you again for the warm welcome. I look forward to serving you on today and I promise there are no co-payments involved. Are there any unanimous concerns? Chair here in none. Does any senator wish rise on a point of personal privilege? I reckon I... I reckon I have a senator from the 55th or point of personal privilege. I'll get you next senator. Thank you Mr. President. I wasn't quite sure if my team was available. But I say that very hard and it is my pleasure to recognize an incredible group of men that have been serving the community since 2006 with the truth and union-large number 594. Their organization prior to self-making good men better. Their values include integrity, kindness, honesty and fairness. They do this about looking after those less fortunate, improving themselves and living a life to be remembered for the right reasons. Over the last couple of years they have clean streets, provided over one ton of food and food drives, volunteered in countless parades, charity walks, minted youth and conducted numerous school drives. Truth and union lawtists organize countless blood drives, book drives, back to school bashes and other community driven supports, support drives throughout the years, providing school supplies, food, games, free haircuts and other needed items, as well as monthly mobile food drives with new baffle, AME Church distributing an average of 9,500 pounds of food, as well as quarterly food distributions to senior citizens at Redland Creek Villars.

Thank you so much for visiting with us and five of you can come down and take a picture. Look forward to seeing you on the floor. Thank you Mr. President, I yield well. Thank you Senator. Recognize Senator from the 34th. Good morning colleagues. I rise this morning to shine a light on someone who has been making each of us look awesome on a routine basis. Keenan Rogers born on July 13th, 1932, in Rochester, New York to Gordon and Vita is a Canadian American actor, musician, performer, and our photographer.

Kenan currently serves as the senior broadcast specialist with the Georgia State Press Office, where he is most often recognized in his role as a Senate photographer. Also, lifelong actor Kenan has played many roles from stage to screen, from Wyatt Catchett in a Christmas Carol to the Tony Award-winning Alliance Theatre, and Sparky in forever played at the historic Strayen Theatre in Marietta, and from backhead Thompson in the vault starring James Franco and honor Hayes in upcoming film, Love, Courage, and the Battle of Bushy Run. Kenan is an accomplished actor who pursued his acting career while the Senate is not in session and has enjoyed calling the Hollywood of the South his home. A songwriter and musician Kenan plays piano, guitar, oboe, and sings. He and his siblings have music, YouTube channels, where they are best known for their brilliant and unique forehand piano cover. And Roger Phanamaz has been invited to perform all over the world from stage in Italy to TV shows in America. Kenan grew up in Dunwoody, Georgia, and his six siblings, one of which is a fraternal twin. He graduated from Shambley High School, and then studied at Florida State University, where he graduated with his bachelor's in economics. And I know I got a red light, but I'ma try to keep going. While in the Florida State, he also was a member of the world renowned flying high circus, where he performed for thousands on the Russian bar, flying trapeze, and as ring master. Starting as an aid in the Senate press office during the 2018 legislative session, Kenan has served as Senate for seven years after serving as Senate photographer until 2020. Kenan joined the Senate press office in as the full-time broadcast specialist in Augusta in 2021. His an integral member of the team known for his dedication and excellence, his infectuously positive attitude, and his readiness to help wherever he's needed. Will you join me in congratulating our photographer, Kenan, the actor, the musician, the renowned Kenan? Come on up here. You're going to be a big fan of Kenan. Thank you, Kenan, for all you do every single day for us. Thank you. I yield the will. I'm begging out of the center from the seventh, from Point of Personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to discuss an important issue. Then I believe we should consider addressing as we finish this session and approach our session next year. The rules of the consent calendar do not provide sufficient opportunities for senators to individually object to pieces of legislation. I respect and support local control, but the current rules are flawed because of the often bizarrely drawn districts we represent. In my own delegation, there are those who live far outside of my county, several counties away, yet have the ability to object to legislation that would disproportionately impact my county, because their district contains one, two, or three precincts in my home county. That's not right. That's not local control. However, there are bills that impact other counties in disproportionately partisan ways that I object to purely on the basis of political fairness. Yet I do not have the opportunity to ask to vote on them. And it is my hope that when we reconvene next January, this body will consider changing the rules of the local consent calendar to be fair to each individual senator. I'm sorry, a deliberative body, but I do not believe the current rules provide sufficient opportunities for all senators to weigh in equally on local bills. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield a well. We're going to have a senator from the six. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues on March 27, 2023, which was on Monday, a mass shooting occurred at the Covenant School, a Perrokyl School in Nashville, Tennessee. Six people, three children and three staff members were killed in a calculated attack where the attacker used an AR-style rifle. At this time, I'd ask for a moment of silence and remembrance of the victims. The senator has asked for a moment of silence. Assistant would stand in a moment of silence. Thank you. Colleagues, I remind us that we have a crisis in this country. The easy access and lack of accountability related to guns is literally killing our children. In fact, all of you know, but guns are the number one cause of death related to children. And we also have a crisis related to mental health, which this chamber and this General Assembly has done work on over the last several years. But I encourage us to tackle both of these issues, two issues that were not addressed in this chamber this year. Next year, I encourage us to tackle the crisis on guns and the crisis further attack the crisis that we have with our mental health system. To ensure that we do all that we can to protect our children's and our children in schools and in our communities. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. I recognize the senator from the 29th for appointed personal privilege. Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, I rise today to remember yesterday while it was a day off in this chamber. It was a special day to me because it was the 81st birthday of Elizabeth Cobb Robertson who 16 years ago left this earth when the heavens opened up. And took her from her only son. And I never let a day go by that I don't think about my mother. Think about the sacrifice that she made for me. And to remember in everything I do, I do because of the character and values that she instilled in me. And growing up as a young boy, always was particular to mine my peace and cues when my mother walked into the room. But 16 years ago, my mother was transformed so I know that any room I'm in, my mother's there watching. And so today, I want to say because of yesterday, happy birthday to my mother. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the well. We're getting out of the center from the 44th for a point of personal privilege. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I was a colleague I rise today to recognize the life of Mr. Lorenzo Lindsay of Atlanta, Georgia. And who passed away last week? Mr. Lindsay was from Atlanta, Georgia and belonged to Warren United Methodist Church here in Atlanta. He was also the brother of Mr. Michael Lindsay, our doorkeeper there to the right. And also Reverend Lewis Lindsay, one of my former pastors. And I just want to recognize his life and his legacy today. And also a family that I went to high school with and at Fountain High and Forest Park years ago, that was Reverend Harrow Gray, who lost his son, daughter-in-law, and the granddaughter. And the senator from the six just told us about gun violence. But their deaths is devastating to the family, to all the friends and their supporters. They lived in Congress, Georgia, a beautiful, beautiful family. So Mr. President, I will ask at this time if we would recognize and do a moment of silent prayer for Mr. Cory Gray, Mr. Meekal Gray, and little Mr. Jalita Gray, and their untimely death. And the family members of Reverend Harrow Gray, and also silent prayer for Mr. Lorenzo Lindsay. And please let the doorkeeper, Mr. Michael Lindsay, his brother know how much we care about him, about he and his family. Amen. Amen. Thank you very much. Recognize the senator from the 35th. Senator from the 35th. I'm going to try to stand up. Thank you, Mr. President, senators. It has been a tedious 40 days for me and for some of us. But we made it through. So happy signing, I die to all of you. But I want to particularly thank all of you who have helped me navigate through these 40 days. I appreciate it. I have mobility problems, but they are temporary. So I hope that I won't come back next year with the same problem. But I know I won't come back with the beat noise because I got on the scooter this morning. And the light didn't come on, but it was charged and it didn't beep anymore. So thank you ever did that for me as well. So thank you very much to the doorkeeper that went the extra mile. Dr. Turnball. I found out he's a Harvard graduate. How about that? We don't know who's all around us to be. But he's been excellent in waiting on us. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak here at my desk and get through this. Today I was supposed to recognize rapper Rick Ross. And he's on the other side. So he's not up there. He's the one who this week had the bulls in his, in his, the break broke away. And we're going to the neighbor's house in the holy field mansion. So if, if any of his people are up there, Rick Ross, we welcome you. And thank you again, Mr. President, and everybody in the Senate. Thank you very much for helping me. I appreciate it. All right. Thank you, Senator. All right. If there's no more points of personal privilege, we'll move on. You have a consent calendar or privilege resolutions before you. Does any Senator wish to remove a resolution from the consent calendar? Hearing none. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair here is none of the resolution on the consent, consent calendar is adopted. Secretary, read the captions on the, on the, look. Senator resolution 427 by Senator Bras of the 28th, a resolution recognizing the positive economic impact of golf on the state of Georgia and for other purposes. Senate resolution 428 by Senator C of the 34th and others a resolution recognizing and committing Kenan Rogers and for other purposes. Senate resolution 429 by Senator Strickland of 17th and others a resolution commending director Fred Mays and for other purposes. That completes your, Ms. President. Is there objection to the adoption of the resolution on the consent calendar? Chair here is none of the resolution on the consent calendar are adopted. Are there any motions to withdraw and commit? You have, we've already done this. You have before you a consent calendar of local bills, Mr. Secretary, have any objections been filed to any of the bills on local consent calendar? Mr. President, Senator C of the 34th and others have filed an objection to House Bill 678. There is objection to House Bill 678. This House Bill 678 will be withdrawn from the consent calendar and be taken up later on this evening. Is there objection to agreed to the Florida Committee on state and local government operations, which is favorable to the past of the bill on the local consent calendar? Chair here is none of the Florida Committee has agreed to. Questions on the passes of the bill and local consent calendar? All those in favor of vote. Yes, you have posed nay, Secretary, and a lot of machines. Senator from the 53rd for what purpose do you rise? To excuse the Senator from the 8th. Well, the votes are started, so but he will be excused further. Thank you. On the pass of the bill, yeas are 52. The nays are zero. This bill has received the local consent calendar. The constitutional majority is therefore passed. We will now take up House Bill 678, which was objected by the senator from the 34th. Senator from 36, 6. For what purpose do you rise? I would like to ask for unanimous consent to excuse the Senator from the 37th. Without objection, the senator from the 37th is excused. So this is the House Bill 678, is the local bill that the senator from 34th objected to. Secretary, read the caption. House Bill 578, by Representative Scott of the 76, and others, a bill to be entitled and act to amend and act creating the Clayton County Board of Commissioners approved February 8th, 1955 as amended, so as to provide a code of ethics to establish a board of ethics. Committee of the Senate on SLOGO recommends that this bill do pass respectfully submitted by Senator again of the 47th district chairman. That completes the ordinance, President. Recognize the senator from the 34th speaks to the motion. Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. I rise to ask you all to join me and the senator from the 44th to vote no on this local legislation. I know all politics is local, so please join with me and the senator from the 44th as the representatives from the county and help us vote no on this. Please, thank you, I yield the well. Senator, is yielded well. Senator from the 47th of what purpose you rise? Not a question for the senator. She has yielded the well, Senator. Does any of the senator which speak for against the measure? Chair, here's none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. Previous question is ordered. Is there objection to agree to the 40th committee which is favorable to the past of the bill? Chair, here's none. For the committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The other question is on the past of the bill. All those are fair or yey. All those against nay, the secretary and law and the shing. Thank you. All right. On the past of the bill, the yeys are four. The nays are 49. This bill has failed to receive the recic constitutional majority and is there for lost. All right. Let me get everybody's attention. It's low loud in here. Let's bring it to order. I know everybody is excited but it's a little too loud in here. No, we got a lot of folks in here but it's time to start the rules calendar. Let me have your attention please. All right. We're taking bills from the table. We'll go with what was left on the table from day 39. We'll start down that row. Recognize the senator from the 50th for motion. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that we remove House Bill 416 from the table. Secretary, read the caption. House Bill 416 by Representative Salkox of the 53rd and others have built me an act to amend Article 3 of chapter 4 of Title 26 of the official code of Georgia annotated. Relating to the practice of pharmacy so as to authorize qualified pharmacy technicians to administer certain vaccines to provide for a definition to provide for conditions to provide for requirements for qualification to provide requirements for the supervising pharmacist. Thank you for many of the sound health and human services recommends that this bill do pass or so at least made by Senator Watson of the first district chairman. Recognize the senator from the 50th speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. To now bring in House Bill 416, what this bill does is it will authorize a qualified pharmacy technician to administer certain vaccines to those who are 18 years of older, 18 years or older. The impetus behind this bill is during the pandemic, the prep act under the prep act, a declaration was passed that allowed pharmacy technicians to administer vaccines.

Madam Chair, I recognize Senator from the 23rd. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a straightforward bill which eliminates the Georgia Higher Education Assistance Corporation.

I'm happy to answer any questions on the underlying bill. Here you none. May I speak to the amendment? Yes, sir. All right. There is an amendment. It's a friendly amendment. We appreciate the chairman of the Higher Education Bring the Amendment.

I ask for your favourable consideration of the amendment and the underlying bill. No questions? I'll yield a well. You can have one question, Senator. Senator from the second. Absolutely. Does the Senator yield? Absolutely. To my friend from Savannah. On this joint resolution of the General Assembly, would that resolution require a two-thirds vote, or would that be a resolution by a just simple majority? My understanding, sir, is it's a simple majority. I may be corrected. I would defer to legal counsel. But my understanding is it's a simple majority of joint resolution. You have no question, Senator. Thank you. You'll well. Sorry. Senator from the fourth, would you like to speak? I would like to ask a question of the bill author, if that's possible.

Statue of inquiry. Is this constitutional under George's Constitution because of the authority that it gives the Board of Regents to control the university system?

The question on the passes of the bill, as amended, all those in favour of vote yeh, pose nay, secretary and lot in the machine. Thank you. All the passes of the bill, yeh, are 53 and ayes, are zero. This bill, having received the constitutional majority, is therefore passed as amended. Recognize the senator from the 30th for motion. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask that we lift HB 514 off the table. Senator is requested, HB 514, be taken off the table. Secretary, read the caption. House Bill 114, the Washington of the 144th and others, a bill to be entitled and act to amend chapter 66 of Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated. Committee to zoning procedures, so as to provide for the length and renewal of moratoriums related to zoning decisions, to provide for legislative findings, to provide procedures for the levy collection use and waiver of fees related to zoning decisions and related permits. The committee of the Senate on economic development and tourism recommends that this bill do pass by substitute, respectfully submitted by Senator Beach of the 21st District Chairman. Senate Committee on economic development and tourism offers the following substitute to House Bill 514, a bill to be entitled and act to amend chapter 66 of Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to zoning procedures, so as to provide for the length and renewal of certain moratoriums relating to zoning decisions to provide for legislative findings. Senator Duke and the 30th offers the following amendment, amendment 1 to amend the Senate substitute to House Bill 514 by inserting after title on line 5, the following to amend chapter 71 of Title 36 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to development impact fees, so as to modify the required revenue source for a development project involving workforce housing. That can please the Ornumist President. Without objection, I recognize Senator from the 30th, speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I can. I'm going to speak to the underlying bill in the amendment while I'm up here to save a little bit of time. 514 just does away with the preventing people from, I just went blank on what it's called, moratoriums. There we go. You know, I got to moratorium when I looked at the Senator from the 25th and I went moratorium came to mind for some reason there. Okay, the moratoriums and the perpetuity, which you have those six months, you can have moratoriums, it comes off for six months, you review it and then it can go be voted to go back on again. There are a list of exceptions. If you look on starting on line 23 all the way down to 40 there. If there's any of these categories that come into play, then the gap in the moratorium can be waived there, but it just that and I'm going to shift to the amendment and then I'm going to wrap the two back together then. We on the amendment, if you remember Senate bill 136, we pass it out of here a while back. 136 is the one that allows vocal municipalities to waive impact fees on developments that are for workforce housing. It's not a mandate. It's an allowance. It passed out of here. It passed out of the committee unanimously. It passed out of three committees in the house unanimously, which is a feat in and of itself. It kind of just hung out there. So we have because it's a common area and we're trying to improve workforce housing across the state where we identify across the state that is one of the leading issues that we're having. We put the two together and subject to your questions. You have no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable consideration. I yield well. Does any of the senator wish to speak for against the measure? Chair here and none. Is there objection to previous question being ordered here and none. We're going to take up amendment number one.

Is there objection to agree to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill. Chair here is none. The board of the committee has agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered. Chair here is none. The main question is ordered. The question is on the passes of the bill by substitute. All those in favor vote. Yeah. I'll pose. Chair here. Chair here. Chair. Chair. Chair. Chair. Chair. Chair. All in the passes of the bill. The yeas are 42. The nays are 12. This bill haven't received the recist to the Constitution of Majority is there 4 pass. Senator from the 48th. What purpose do you rise? Mr. President I ask that we blow unanimous consent to blow House Bill 374 off the table. Is this your first bill senator? This is the lead floor bill right? Yes sir it is back again. I want to tell you what. The senator from the 48th is asked that HB 374 be taken off the table. Secretary read the caption. I'm sorry senator. I'll put us. The recognize senator from the 42nd. I would like to move that we agree as amended to HB 374. Is that is agreed? Senator you mind seven. Secretary read the caption. House Bill 374 by representative Thomas of the 21st and others.

That completes the armist present. Recognize senator from 48 speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President. House bill 374 passed Monday evening with a vote of 103 to 67 which means a significant number of Democrats supported this bill. If you're doing the math that is 62.6% of the House chamber. There are a few differences between the original SB 145 and the infamous leaf blower act in this bill which are as follows. Number one, both bills, SB 145 and this bill, HB 374 both have the leaf blower act. We've, I think said everything there is to say about this one. Number two, this bill before you now incorporates House Bill 374 by Representative Brad Thomas to include what is generally being referred to as the Mableton de Anixation Bill. It specifies that it will not include more than 10 parcels of property that it must be in an area that's typically found on a fringe of boundaries. It must be approved by all owners of the surrounding land. This has been approved by ACCG and GMA. Number three, both versions now have HB 438 by Representative Victor Anderson to include the pre exemption, preemption excuse me, fuel choice bill for gas appliances for homes and businesses. The new language closes the loophole which would allow cities to use building codes or other ordinances to limit natural gas appliances and homes and businesses. The original SB 145 which passed out of this chamber several weeks ago now also includes Uno Dostres, one, two, three additional bills that were done so without my authorization. That's what we all came to start calling it as the Feliz Navidad Christmas Tree Bill. This is not that version. What some folks have referred to as the Green New Deal is not on this version before you. This is a clean bill and it does not contain any uncertainties or questions on your mainness. We have a vast number of bills before us today and there is talk as you've just heard about several amendments being put forward. I can tell you that this bill before you has been vetted by countless committees and when I just spoke this morning to the original author of this bill to the chairman of the government affairs committee in the house. To the chief legal counsel in the speaker's house they have all asked that we please keep this bill clean and free of amendments so that we can move along and get it taken care of. I think considering what we have before us it would be incumbent upon us to vote for this bill if there are already amendments. I will be opposing them and with that Mr. President I yield the wealth. You do have questions senator. Senator from the 33rd you are going to yield the well to senator. It is your choice. Senator from the 33rd? Senator from the 33rd. Thank you Mr. President. Senator Yeild. Mr. Mayor. Could you mention Mabelton? Could you explain to me a little more what you were talking about in terms of Mabelton and being able to de-annex? Certainly. If you will go to section 3 of the bill. Section 78 through 90. Authority is granted to the government and the municipality of D. Annex in the area or areas of the existing corporate limits. In accordance with procedures, read further. All the owners of all the land except the owners of any public street road highway or right of way. The purpose of this bill is to de-annex, continue complete description of the lands, provided no more than 10 parcels. So we are talking a very small area. The purpose of this senator is to allow fringe areas, very small fringe areas, to de-annex from a city back to the county. If it behooves the city in the county to do so. So the senator for the yield? Yes sir. Is this your first bill? I'm sorry? Is this your first bill in the senate? Yes sir it is not. Okay. Thank you. Senator you have no further questions. Thank you Mr. President. We are going to have the senator from the 40th second for purpose D. Rouse. Point of order Mr. President. State your order. Is it true that this senate committee added several pieces of legislation to this bill and that the senate should not consider HB374 because the senate committee substitute to HB374 is not germane to the House bill because de-annexation is not related to leaf blowers. Senator has been titled to her opinion but as the author said this thing has a number of subject matters that I do feel like are our germane to the underlying issue. Further point of order Mr. President? State your order. Is it true that the senate should also not consider the senate committee substitute to House bill 374 because it also violates the Georgia Constitution Article III Section 5 paragraph 3 which says no bill shall pass which refers to more than one subject matter or contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof and D. Nxation is not related to leaf blowers. Thank you. Actually the House bill the house version does speak of Diane and then in House bill 374 I believe you knew that there are two different left heating to the state or executing a D. I think there are two different measures pertaining to the senator's underlying bill that are owned the rules calendar. And I'm I think you might be referring to that other bill senator. Senator. Mr. President, point of order, it's my understanding that the deanexation bill is the leaf blower bill which came out of here as SB 145 was added in Senate Committee in SLOGO to HV374. And under the Georgia Constitution as well as Senate rule 3-1.1B, the Senate is not in a position to be able to consider that because that amendment done by the Senate Local Government Operations Committee is not germane to the underlying bill as it passed the House and therefore it is out of order. Senator, I respectfully disagree because I think we're still talking about two different measures. However, you're welcome to object or try to amend this bill now on the floor or you're always welcome to vote no on the bill as well. Point of order, Mr. President. Yes. I respectfully appeal the ruling of the chair because deanexations and leaf blowers are not related to each other and it violates the Georgia Constitution for this body to consider them in one bill. Senator has that right. All those in favor of the... The chair has ruled the... Senator, the subject matter is germane. Senator from the 42nd is challenging the ruling of the chair. So the question is shall the ruling of the chair be sustained? And it takes 29 votes to reverse the chair. So all those in favor will vote. Recognize the center from the 42nd. Thank you so much, Mr. President. The parliamentary order question I'm putting before the body as well is dealing with the two subject matter rule as well as the violation of germaneness. Do we need to have two different votes on both of those because I'm objecting under the grounds of germaneness, under the Senate rules as well as under the two subject matter rule in the Georgia Constitution which is also encapsulated in rule three dash 1.1B of our senator. The two subject matters is a legal issue, not a parliamentary issue. So all those in favor of the senator's motion shall be allowed to vote and all those who agree with the chair vote, yay, all those who disagree with the senator from the 42nd vote, nay. Secretary-Anne Launt machine. Thank you.

We're going to have Senator from the 43rd. What purpose do you rise? Senator Anchor, is it not true that this is about the ruling and not about the Senate upon a 42nd motion? Senator knows what we speak. On the appeal of the ruling of the chair, the A's are 33 and the A's are 22 and the ruling of the chair is sustained. Does any other Senator wish to speak for against the measure? Cheering none. Is there objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none and the previous question is ordered. Senator has asked for unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. Is there objection without objection? The amendment is withdrawn. Senator from the second. On the adoption of the committee substitute, those in favor will vote ye oppose. Is there objection to the adoption of the committee substitute? That objection, the committee substitute is adopted. Is there objection to agree to the board of the committee which is favorable to the passes of the bill? Chair here is none. The board of the committee is agreed to. Is there objection to the main question being ordered? Chair here is none and the main question is ordered. Questions on the passes of the bill by substitute, all those in favor vote ye oppose, all those in favor vote ye oppose. On the passes of the bill, the ye is our 32, the nays, our 20, this bill, him and the rest of the constitutes the majority is therefore passed by substitute. All right, we're going to take out some special actions right now. I recognize the Senator from the 32nd. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the House substitute for Senate Bill 155. Senator Zasit, the Senate agreed to Senate bill the House's version of Senate bill 155. Secretary Reed the caption. Senate bill 155 by Senator Cruipatric of the 32nd and others, a bill to be entitled and act to amend part one of Article 4 of Chapter 11 of Title 16 of the official code of Georgia annotated relating to general provisions relative to dangerous instrumentalities and practices. So as to revise provisions relating to harming a law enforcement animal, to provide for the offenses of interfering with or harming a public safety animal or search and rescue animal. That completes your order, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill relates to clarifying the law on cruelty to canine animals. This bill has now passed the House unanimously and needs to come back for an agree because we removed the word taunt from line 6th day. I look forward to the Senate's agreeing to protecting these important team members and what asked for a green vote and unless there are questions I'll yield the well. You do have a question, Senator. Senator, from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. Will the Senator yield? Be glad to yield to my firm from the 53rd. Senator, do you think the language may be a little too broad? It says you can aspire to harass or conspire to tamper. Don't you think that would be very difficult to prove or disprove in court? Actually, Senator, if you look ahead of that on line 59, it talks about intentionally. So proving intent is something that prosecutors do all the time. And if you look at line 60, that covers public safety animals that are not on duty. So for example, if somebody went to find the kennel where the police animals were capped and poisoned, a piece of poison meat over it would cover that. And then the next line 61 covers animals that are actually on duty. So I don't think that would be hard for an animal prosecutor to prove. Will the Senator further yield? Sure. So you said intent, but it says should have known that the animal. So how do you have intent if you don't even know that that's a service handle? Thank you, Senator, for the question. No or should have known is something that's used all the time in prosecuting cases. And it relates to the reasonable person standard, which is a known term in the legal world. Okay, thank you, Senator. You have no questions, Senator. Thank you, I am. Does any of the Senator would speak for against the measure? Chair here is none. And the Senator has moved that the Senate agreed to the House substitute on Senate Bill 155. All those in favor of vote, yay, all those opposed, nay, Secretary and a lot of machine. On the past of the bill, the yay's are 43, the nays are 12, and this bill has seen the Brexit Constitution majority and therefore it has passed. Senate, stand at ease, we're trying to get this equipment back up and running. You tell me in our repeat it for you. All right, Senate, come back to order. We're going to have to quiet down in here guys. This is way too loud. You can't hear what's going on up here. So let's come back to order. Yeah. Senator has moved that the Senate insists on the Senate's position on House Bill 189. And Secretary to read the caption. House Bill 189 by representative Meeks of the 178th and others, a bill between Donald and Actum and Article 2 of Chapter 6 of Title 32 of the official code of Georgia and Aded. We're relating to dimensions and weight of vehicles and loads. So as to provide for an allowable variance for weight limitations upon a vehicle or load, calling certain commodities within a certain range in areas of the state, that completes the ordinance. The Senate offers the Falling Substitute to House Bill 189, a bill between Donald and Actum and Article 2 of Chapter 6 of Title 32 of the official code of Georgia and Aded. Relating to dimensions and weights of vehicles and loads. So as to provide for an allowable variance for weight limitations upon a vehicle or load, hauling certain commodities within a certain range in areas of the state, that completes the ordinance president. We're going to have Senator from the 8th, speak to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I just, this is our truck weights bill. This is House Bill 189. This Senate Substitute, the pass that our committee passed out of this chamber with 44 votes. I just asked that the Senator sit with me and vote in cist. You have no questions, Senator? You have no questions. The Senate has insisted on its position on House Bill 189 without objection. We'll send it back over to the House. Moving on to Senate Bill 560, I recognize the Senator from the 52nd poor motion. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate left Senate Bill 56 off the table. Senator's move, the Senate Bill 56 will be taken off the table. Secretary, read the caption. Senator from the 56. I said left it off the table, but my motion should have been to agree to the House. To agree. Senator, you are correct. He is still trying to find the bill so he can read the caption. But the Senator has moved for an agree on House Bill 56. Senate Bill 56 by Senator Hopsettler of the 52nd and others. The Senate Bill 56 by Senator Hopsettler of the 52nd and others. A bill to amend Chapter 5 of Title 48 of the official code of Georgia and it is related to add the alarm taxation. So as to require the state revenue commissioner to contract with the board of the employees, the retirement system of Georgia to offer certain county tax commissioners the option to participate in a state and minister deferred compensation plan. The House offers the following substitute to Senate Bill 56, a bill to amend Title 48 of the official code of Georgia and it is related to revenue taxation. So as to require the state revenue commissioner to contract with the board of trustees of the employees, retirement system of Georgia to offer certain county tax commissioners who are not eligible for any retirement system or county 401k or 457b plan, the option to participate in a state and minister deferred compensation plan. That completes the ordinance, President. Recognize the senator from the 52nd to the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I do want to spend a little time on this because a lot of this subject matter has been vetted from through the finance committee and passed out unanimously but did not get through the main body that's then been attached over there. So you'll see Senate Bill 56 in your special book. If you go to the other book and look at 454, that has the fiscal note. Just the first book, if you trust me, but if you want to trust and verify, get the other book out too. I'll try to explain this pretty well. So this original bill was simply for the tax commissioners. There's about 30 or so rural counties that don't have any kind of a retirement. They're the only cost tuition officers that don't they bring in a big and two billion dollars of state. And this set is out of simple 401k match for them, no defined benefit, defined contribution. 340 pass that out. If you go to the next section in there, then you're going to see about the IRC conformity that has also been looked at here. But then if you go to section 22, you're going to see about the income tax where we're changing the structural a bit. That's on page 6 of the bill, I believe. So when you go to that, we had a tax cut that ratched it down last year. The sentence position was that we should do standard deductions, the house at the time, only personal exemptions. I think after a year of this, they've looked at it and agreed that standard deductions were the way to go. So we had looked at accelerating those standard deductions, but we're going to put them in there now as a full 12 and 24,000. This will help people at the bottom because it will be the first 12 and 24,000 that will be exempt. The second thing it does is it eliminates the marriage penalty. We also are changing the five year look back on this 10 percent point 1, 0 percent decrease from a three year look back to from a five year look back to a three year look back. And then because of another change where we're letting people that that itemize on the federal return, they can itemize or do the standard on the state. Those that itemize by losing the personal exemption would actually have a tax increase. So there's a $300 credit for those people to make sure they don't get a tax increase in the changeover. And then the last item we talk about is something called forced issuer. This deals with, well actually there's two more items, but this one deals with the fact that COVID would be added to the list of disasters. There's a company that probably has a billion dollar investment that may not make it because of COVID, they may make it, it's going to be really close and so it would really just help this one company, but would let them extend the period a little bit longer to get those credits due to COVID, which you know is certain hurt businesses as well as you know hurricanes and things like that do natural disasters. And then the last thing we're doing is we're decoupling the accelerated appreciation that we've done since 2022. We've done accelerated appreciation. The federal government is changing that where stand will continue to do the accelerated appreciation. This really doesn't change anything except what year this taxpayer gets it in. They'll get it quicker in hours. We're going to get it eventually either way, but this would change it to that. Now then another section that has not gone through the Senate but did go through the finance committee and passed out is digital downloads. This has been looked at for some time for parity just as we did with the marketplace facilitator. Digital downloads does not apply to any streaming monthly service. This is just the end user whether you get it through a book or through something you keep permanently. It would apply in this case. And again that passed out through the committee. Now if you go to the fiscal note 454 it will have everything in there except the digital download. And so if you go to page two of the fiscal note for the three people that are following along or whatever just in case I make sure I cover it for you. It's accurate except when you get to 27 and 28 there's an additional line for rate reduction. That was going to happen anyway. That's not new money. And then according the fiscal note for 170 which is not in here because that's where the digital download was. It's 4 is 3.7 the first year 95.3. 102 million and 87 million and 107 million to the positive side. So it lessens the effect of the revenue. I know in the house since over this many issues together I it's a little frustrating to try to keep up with all of them but I certainly would like to answer any questions. I will say that every one of these issues went through the finance committee we've added it and all passed it out. If there's no questions I'll yield to well. You do have one question Senator. Senator from the 19th. Thank you Senator. Do you yield for serious questions? I yield. I know it's a big deal. I just want to walk through a few things and make sure I'm clear on it. Senator from the tax commissioner piece you said it's a 401k. Who pays the match? The match is going to be paid by the state. The cost is going to be about 225,000. I understand there's certain legitimate argument about who would pay that. The counties of the state they collect money for both entities. This is only about 30 rural counties that have no program at all. And my belief was that the minimal cost of a quarter of a million dollars with all the stuff that we do around here was worth it to be able to say that every single construction law in the state has some form of a pension plan. Again this was not defined benefit it's only a contribution. Senator further yield? Yes. What stops those who are on another plan from now coming on to the state plan which would obviously if there's only 30 you say 30 is 225,000. We now multiply that and I guess 4 that's 120,000. Multiply that by 5 you're going to have what right at one. There's language in the bill that says if you're on another plan you're not eligible for this plan. And furthermore the house added to make it clear that if you if your county offers a retirement plan then you have to get off of this. So if anything I think it would go the other way. Well, Senator Yield for a few more questions? Sure. On the state income tax reduction can you tell me what the savings to taxpayers will be from this version of the plan? Well the savings would be in year one a total of 94.7 million but you've got to add back in 170 which is not in here which is 43.7 on digital download so it's going to be about 50 million. The net the savings the tax payers from the income tax can be about 94 million. Then the digital the digital parity act I guess adds about 40 you said 43.7 million. And that just provides parity between digital downloads that are maintained for ownership and their more their older medium is that a fair way to right.

Is the objection taken at the table? Chair here, you're done. I'm breaking down the Senate from the 56th. Thank you, Mr. President. I apologize for the confusion. I want to thank our friends of legislative council for all their great work here. This is Senate Bill 13 that we passed with all support minus one, which allows our sheriffs to conduct online auctions. It is a very simple bill. It just brings us into the 21st century. In addition, the House actually stripped that part of the bill out and put their own bill in there, but there was good stuff there. So this restores our language, but also allows for an additional bite at the apple to add an additional part of the approach. The appraisal process for your property taxes, which is an important component for those who have had to go before a hearing officer in the past. But there's not enough appraisers today. So in the last part of this bill, which I think is a great addition, is it allows any former or current appraisal or chief appraisers that size be your hearing officer to add a bit more hearing officer is in order to process these. People don't end up at the board of equalization in perpetuity and an opportunity to appeal property taxes. I know that we have seen extraordinary rise in our property taxes and the assessments on those over the last many years. And we want to make sure we're not taxing people out of the house and we have a fair process. If there are no questions, I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Do you have a few questions, Senator? I think I have a senator from the 41st. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a parliamentary inquiry. Mr. President. How state you're inquiring? Can you tell us how this is in order, the first person at rule 7-1.6? I could be misunderstanding this but it seems like we've completely stripped a bill and put another bill on top of it. Because the first line say, by striking lines one through the end of an inserting and lieu thereof. So I just am unclear about how we're able to do this. No offense to the chairman. I appreciate your bill. I'm just trying to learn here. Yeah, well, this is a special action so that rule doesn't actually apply to this. Senator from the 53rd. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent to be excused under rule 5-1-8. Without objection, Senator from the 53rds, excuse. Senator from the 19th. Thank you, Mr. President. Senator, are you yielded? I yield to the appropriations, chairman. Thank you so much. I got some questions. It looks like these examples of additional powers that now these hearing officers can have. But they're, and I see how the bill is written in that way. But they're excluded from all wireless property. Why? Why was property meaning typically for cell sites or what used to be the old microwave towers? You might remember from years past. Had a whole separate governance structure that was put in the code decades ago. So they have always had a separate car about and we didn't want to interrupt the code while making this change. Will the center further you? I do. Well, this require then if a wireless company submits a property tax appeal that now the county will have to go get a certain special type of a praser to be the hearing officer for those hearings? No, it doesn't really change what they were doing in the past, Mr. Chairman. It allows them to stay where they were basically in the code. So when we made the other changes, we wanted to make sure that they stayed separate as it's been in the past. Yes. Will the center go for one further question? Certainly. When you had one no vote on your last bill, do you know who it was? My guess is it could have been the center for the 19th. I'm not sure. Thank you. Thank you. You have no further questions. Thank you. I'd ask for your farewell consideration. Does any of the senator wishes to speak for against a measure? Chair here's none. The senator has moved that the senate agree to the House substitute to Senate Bill 13 as amended without objection. All those in favor of the measure will vote ye. I'll oppose nay, secretary and a lot of machine. All in the past is of the bill. The yeas are 37. The days are 14. This bill haven't seen the reclusive majority is therefore passed. Okay, we're going to break for lunch. I know the pro-TM has got lunch provided for everyone. So we're going to break for lunch and look at coming back probably around two o'clock. Come back around two o'clock and break for lunch and figure out how many more bills we're going to take up here.
