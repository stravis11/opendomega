TRANSCRIPT
----------
For some, there's a lovehate
relationship when it comes to
technologies. There's love for what it
provides with everything at our
fingertips on a keyboard. But with the
growth of AI, there's a backlash in
communities when it comes to having data
centers the size of football fields or
bigger in their backyards. Georgia's one
of the top data center markets in the
nation. And joining me are two lawmakers
looking to regulate data centers in
Georgia. Republican Senator Chuck
Huffstetler of Rome is chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. He's also an
exeicio member of appropriations among
his other committees. And also with us
is Democratic Representative Debbie
Buckner of Junction City. She's on House
Appropriations and she's secretary of
the House Rural Development Committee
among all of her committees, too.
Welcome to Lawmakers again this session.
Great to be here again, Donna.
>> Love to have you here. So, you both have
bills on data centers and they're both
bipartisan. They're your bills. They're
a little different different. Before we
get into the bills, I'd like to know
what led you to even take on this topic
and you know, I'll start with you,
Representative Buckner.
>> Well, um, last session there were about
four proposals in one of my counties and
they were it's a rural county and there
were a lot of questions. How much water
will they use? How much electricity will
they use? Where will that come from?
um who's going to be responsible for
making sure that all the things that
this data center needs can be provided
and not hurt the existing customers, the
people that live in the county. Now,
>> so there were going to be four in just
your county.
>> There were four different entities
looking at spots in one county.
>> Wow. What led you to get into this?
Well, I went back in 2017 and saw a data
center in uh Nevada. And my bill was
actually last year. It's a continuation
of last year, Senate Bill 34 that said
we want them to simply pay all their uh
power costs, their electricity costs.
We've had six rate increases in a couple
of years. And I gave it to the PSC and
they then came up with a rule that said,
"We're going to make them pay all their
cost." And Georgia Power agreed to it.
And I said, "Well, then y'all like my
bill?" It says exactly that. And they
said, "Well, no, we don't like your
bill." Uh, so it makes me wonder, too
often those things are hidden behind
trade secrets so that you don't really
know who's paying for them. But, um,
it's it's important that we codify into
law that they pay all their costs. Our
consumers have had way too many rate
increases. I think we saw from the PSC
elections in November, the consumers
around the country were very unhappy,
Republicans and Democrats both. And so
we need to get protection for the
consumers. We've we've got uh 60-year
cost still for instance on plant Vogle.
The gas turbines they're wanting to bill
for the data centers are they're going
to bill us for over 45 years. Who pays
for that if they're gone a few years?
Even the PSC staff said, "Yeah, the
protection looks like it's there for a
few years, but we don't know after
that." So we need to protect our
consumers. Our rates are in the top
either fifth or highest rates in the
country according to two different
studies. We shouldn't be that way. The
consumer shouldn't be getting all the
cost.
>> Yeah. So your bill it would do exactly
do what
>> it would say that all the cost
transmission distribution substation any
cost for the data centers could not be
put on the consumer's bills. They have
to pay all that cost. as it is right
now. Too many of them only pay the
operating cost and all the construction
like Vogle cost a 25% increase on
residential bills because they've got
all the construction costs to pay for
that for the next 60 years. Let the
companies that are needing this
additional electricity pay for it. And
to that point in 2023 residential
customers in Georgia bought less
electricity from Georgia Power than they
did in 2011. The demand's not coming
from the residential customers. Why are
they paying all the cost? Wow, that's
that's interesting. We're going to get
back to your bill a little bit more.
Representative Buckner, your bill HB528
deals with more transparency when it
comes to data centers. Tell us about it.
>> Well, we were really concerned in my
part of the state about um telling us
upfront what you're going to need. If
you're going to come be a neighbor of
ours, we want to be a good neighbor of
yours and we want to know what how many
gallons of water a day, how many
megawatts. We wanted to know that
upfront and and we've kind of made it be
a carrot or stick kind of situation
where you tell us that before you start
applying for your permits and and um
moving forward with your project and
then that will mean that you will be
eligible for whatever tax incentives
there might be. If you don't tell us
that upfront, then you're not eligible
for those incentives. So, it gave some
leverage to the local counties. Um we
just felt like that was fair. it was
fair to for them to provide the
information. If if I invited you to
dinner at my house, I'd want to know how
many people were coming. I'd want to
know if you had any allergies so I
wouldn't cook the wrong thing. Well,
that's the same kind of situation here
for our counties. They need to know that
they've got enough water to take care of
the families that are counting on it
right now, plus the data center if it's
coming. They need to know about the
power as well.
>> Yeah. Let's let's talk about that water
for a second. Some people don't
understand why they need so much. It's a
cooling.
>> Right. Right. They use millions of
gallons of water. And in the beginning
when we I first learned about data
centers, the um data centers were very
consumptive. They used it, let it go.
Used it and let it go. So it was
consuming the water. Now since we've
been putting in all these bills, we have
more people saying, well, we can do a
closed loop system where we're recycling
that water and the water's used to cool
down all of the equipment that's inside.
It gets very hot and of course in the
summer really hot. So they have to make
sure that they keep it cool.
>> So do we have any guarantees that will
happen at this point?
>> We could we could very easily say that
they're all required to have a closed
loop system that they were required to
use gray water. We could say that they
were required to to do all kinds of
things. But we have not been doing that.
And that's what's been a little bit
concerning for local governing
authorities, a lot of legislators
because we've got about eight bills now
I think on different things to do with
data centers. So people are beginning to
say, you know, maybe we need to slow
down a minute and look at this and see
what we need to do.
>> Yeah. I think the interesting thing when
they were first coming in, people would
just see these huge spaces be buildings.
They didn't really know what they were.
They look like warehouses. So there's
that part of it, too.
>> And and I need to add, I am not opposed
to data centers. They need to be built.
Uh we simply want them to pay their
taxes, uh pay their electricity cost.
the the closed loop system. I've got a
county in my district that's already
requiring those. I would liken it to say
your car radiator. You use the same
water over and over again.
>> So, um they they pay a tremendous amount
of property taxes. They don't bring uh
much revenue to the state. But we've
also got an exemption that the finance
committee has looked at today. One of
them a bill by Democrat, one by
Republican to eliminate those. That
sales tax exemption they get is between
the state and local money is about $3
billion a year. You know, we collect 15
billion in state income taxes. Three
billion is a lot of money. And one of
the things says if you and I go to
Walmart and buy a laptop, we pay sales
tax. But if you buy 15 million worth,
you don't pay sales tax.
>> We need to level the playing field for
everybody.
>> And they were given those tax breaks
because it was looked at as an economic
development arm, something to to bring
people in. You don't think they need
that anymore?
>> No. And a University of Georgia study
that I had done, I'd ordered it last
April, came out and said at least 70% of
them would come without any of that $3
billion given to them that it's totally
unnecessary. We're throwing our money
away.
>> Right. Well, how do you feel?
>> Well, that I I read that same study and
thank you for ordering it because it was
very enlightening. Um, we've given away
probably over close to $500 million in
tax credits. U, it's the it's the way
we've always been used to doing
business. you feel like you have to give
something to a company to come to the
community to provide jobs. Um, and it
provides some construction jobs. It's
there's a lot of controversy about how
many jobs are there after the
construction's complete, but um there is
a lot of um unknown about what do we
really need to do we really need to
offer any kind of tax incentives. They
are getting a lot of things here in
Georgia because we have abundant water.
we have uh a good network of of power
generation and we have workers that can
work. So all of those things make us a
good place to come without us having to
give all these tax credits and they're
just taking advantage of them because
they're there.
>> Now Senator Huffedler said he he isn't
against them. What about you? Are you
not against them?
>> Oh no, I they're necessary. We're going
to have to have them. If you anything we
do that um with a cell phone to a
computer, whatever, we're going to have
to have data centers. But um we need to
be sure that they are in the right
location where the resources that the
data center needs can be provided
without a hardship to the community.
>> I know we're hearing so many bills. You
a few of them are likely to pass, right?
You're feeling good about it this year,
>> right? I think there's going to be some
bills that do pass out. I hope they pass
out of both the House and the Senate.
Yeah. But uh
>> that's the key. They may get the
crossover day, but they may not go any
further. Yeah. You feel the good about
yours, too?
>> Well, we're hoping that um something
will move over in the House. There are a
lot of bills over there that are just
sitting around waiting, I think, to see
either what the Senate's going to do or
how they might be able to combine them.
>> And I think you may see some bills
combined. There may be one that looks at
the tax credits that puts some
transparency on it, which I fully agree
with that. So, we'll see.
>> We'll see. We'll keep up with it.
