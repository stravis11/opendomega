Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members voted while you're voting. I want to remind you of something. Check it out. As you all are aware, the house rules. We brought the trophy home, Mr. Wepp. We really whipped up on the Senate. We all did good work. We had the best cheerleaders. That was across the finish line. It was a great day to be a house member like every day is. So thank you all for everyone who participated yesterday, whether you're on the sideline cheering and expecting and encouraging our members to do their best and they did. So the Senate was extremely overwhelmed by the house presence as they are on most occasions. No doubt about that. Have all members now voted? Have all members voted if so? Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Doer keepers, will you please close the doors and keep them closed? As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from down in the 157th House District, Representative Bill Workiser. Representative Workiser. Thank you, Mr. Baker. Today is an honor for me to introduce my pastor, Brandon Newell. With him, he's got some guests, but as toddlers will often do, they're down in office watching. So Brandon's family, his wife, his wife Grace is with him today, as well as his father-in-law, Jimmy Gymson, along with their two children, Grace and Ray. Brandon start his education at shorter college, then went to New Orleans, theological Baptist Seminary, and his serve churches in Tampa, and Douglas Phil, Georgia. He's been our pastor for the last two years, and has done a tremendous job, love what he does, and not being the traditional first Baptist, but trying to reach people of all walks in life, and has done a great job and expanded our ministry. And so it's my pleasure to have my pastor here today, Brandon Newell. Good morning. This morning, I would like us to look at Hebrews chapter 4, verse 14. Hebrews is a book written to a people who had a great understanding of the Scriptures. Throughout Hebrews up to this point, we have seen things that Jesus is superior to angels, that Jesus is our high priest, that we must be sure not to disobey and lack belief because if we lack belief, we will not enter God's promised rest to those who believe. For the Israelites in the wilderness, that rest was found in God's presence and the promised land, Canaan. For us, that rest is found in God's presence and the promised land, heaven. And light of all this, we find ourselves at the end of chapter 4 of Hebrews. Hebrews 4, 14 says this. Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. When we see the word, therefore, in Scripture, what we must ask is what is therefore. Hebrews 4, 14, therefore actually links back to Hebrews chapter 2, which expounds a great deal about Jesus being our high priest and while we did not read Hebrews 2 today, I encourage you in your free time to go read it. What exactly is a high priest? A high priest is someone who makes intercession for himself and for others. He offers sacrifices and makes sure that people can be in good standing before good and holy God. We saw in Hebrews chapter 2 that Jesus is our high priest who made intercession for us. This is good news for both those who are lost and those who are found. Those who are lost now have an opportunity in Jesus to have Jesus plead their case before the Lord and to be forgiven of their sins so that many may enter into fellowship with God forever. Those who already have trusted in Jesus Christ now have Jesus our high priest, prayerfully interceding on our behalf to God the Father. In regards to those who have not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, this passage gives beautiful imagery of what Jesus has done for us. Romans 3.23 says that all of sin and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 6.23 tells us that the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ, our Lord. Romans 5.8 tells us that at just the right time Jesus Christ died for the ungodly. Remember what a high priest does? That's right. They make sacrifices on behalf of the people so that they may be in good standing before the Lord. Now those high priests would make blood offerings that would last for a season and would have to be done again. However, Jesus our great high priest has made a once and for all offering himself. And this offering he made is not a seasonal offering or temporary offering but an everlasting offering that is completely satisfied the wrath of God for all eternity. Jesus died for you and for me so that we could dwell with God forever. Romans 10.9 says if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Friends, it is not my responsibility to make you believe in Jesus. It is simply my responsibility to tell you about him. He is our great high priest who loved us enough to offer himself so that we may spend eternity with our maker. I hope you will trust in him. Would you stand with me as we pray together? Father, thank you for your mercies that are new every single morning. I thank you for these men and women you have appointed. What a privilege it is to come boldly before your throne to make our request known to you. In a moment you are going to lead us, Lord, by your Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that you would as we have read this text illuminated to us. Your word is living and breathing. Have your way in our hearts today, Lord. Convict us where we need to be convicted, edify us where we need to be built up. Whatever it is you would like to say us, say to us, help our hearts be receptive to you, Lord. In Jesus' name, amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, Brother Newell. Thank you. Thank you, Brother Newell, for that devotion. We appreciate you and your family making the long journey from Glenville all the way up here. Doorkeeper, you may open the doors. Members, you may join Brother Newell in the south any room. And welcome here to give them thanks for being here today and ministering to us. Thank you.

Okay, members, if you all come to the floor, we have some, we're going to have a whole slew of morning orders here in just a few minutes. But we're going to take up an invite resolution, this special to our state, special to our country. So I'm going to ask all members, come to the floor, if you have conversations that need to occur.

Take them to the any room. That one's empty. I can see that when they have food out there. So go enjoy yourself and go talk. If you're from the Senate and you're on the floor, we dealt with y'all yesterday. Just saying thanks to the red. I appreciate you, man. All members, please come to the floor and take your seats, please. I'm going to go to the floor. Members, we have a special delegation that's from a place over in Ireland. We hold very special. And our hearts and is very special to the state of Georgia. Pretty special to something that's occurring that Representative Birchett is going to tell you about. So Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to a resolution? We're resolution by Representative Birchett of the 176th honoring the esteemed delegation from Wexford, Ireland upon their visit to the Georgia State Capitol. The whip representative James Birchett is recognized as a speak to the resolution and introduce our guest. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise before you to ask for your support of Senate Bill. No, that's the wrong one. I'm honored to welcome the delegation from Wexford County, Ireland. Many of you had the opportunity this past year to go and visit Ireland. But this esteemed group of elected officials and business leaders and cultural ambassadors and academic partners has traveled here to strengthen their deep and deepened their enduring ties between the Irish country and the state of Georgia. On the floor with us, we have Kahirla, Pitbury, Councillor Catherine Bittywalsh, Councillor Breeden Murphy, Councillor Oliver Walsh and the president of the Georgia Southern University, Kyle Marrero. The full delegation is in the gallery with us. I'm going to ask that you stand and be recognized. This year marks the 180th anniversary of the Dunbroody ship's first commercial voyage from Wexford to Savannah. A testament to our longstanding economic ties. Interestingly, one of our own colleagues, Chairman Petrie, had three stoways on the Dunbroody. That's why Chairman Petrie is here today because of those three stoways that made it to Savannah, Georgia. Today's initiative, like the Trade Bridge Partnership and Georgia Southern University's Wexford campus, continued to expand the opportunities for collaboration and innovation between us both. Georgia Southern, the first US public university to establish a learning center in Ireland, has provided hands-on experience for over 300 students since its first cohort in 2022. It's partnership with Southeast Tech University in Ireland, Foster's research, economic exchange in key fields such as coastal sustainability and advanced manufacturing. Georgia Southern's Eagle Freedom and our delegation will be in the any room for pictures afterwards. I highly encourage the opportunity for you all to go in there and take a picture with the Eagle. We flew over us this morning and very much appreciate it. I'd like to invite Kahirlock, Pip Green to offer a few words. Good afternoon. Thank you, Pip, for our chat. Speaker Burns for this opportunity to speak to you in this magnificent chamber today. I represent County in Ireland called Wexford. We are deeply embedded in America as we are in Ireland. The whip has already said the first sailings of the Dumbrodi from Wexford to Savannah would have brought out immigrants and would have brought back as in trade with a brought back timber. That continued until the late 1850s. The people were already here at that stage and we have prospered. Obviously a lot of people have been there. Peter has three young men come out as always on that boat and here we have the result of that. But again it's a single honor to be here. We have a branch now of George's University in Wexford Town. It is a collaboration between Chancellor Merero and Wexford County Council that has brought this about. I think it is a testament to the endurance and the compadre we have with our people in America and in Ireland. This is my second visit to your wonderful state. I can do state, your people of industry, very like ourselves. You want to prosper. You don't want to fight with your neighbors. All you want to do is have a good education for your children. And I am talking to Senator Smarning. Most of your budget goes on education. We are the same. We need to educate our young people to prosper and go forward in the world we have today. And again thank you for accepting us onto your floor of this wonderful building and God bless you all. You know something. You did good. I am trying to make sure to get you all. Thank you. And the entire delegation for being here. Thank you all. Safe travels back home. And we appreciate you being here. God bless you all. And thank you for helping build our relationship between Ireland and these United States. But especially Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you members. Thank you President. I really appreciate you being such a good host. I think it's probably a place many of you have visited. Bucky's pretty cool spot. What is that? I thought that's what that was.

Before I get started you should all have goody bags that were delivered to your offices. They're not on your desk in here but in your offices. So look for those. I'm proud today to recognize Richard Sebastian senior director of operations. Josh Smith Michael Bowie and most importantly Bucky. The Warner Robbins Bucky's was the first Bucky's in Georgia. It's now how I give directions to my house. You get off at the Bucky's exit and turn left. It's got a hundred and twenty gas pumps and the cleanest bathrooms around if you know that if you've been there. More than that though Bucky's is a valued community partner they have great jobs great benefits and it's a place for people to eat and gather. It is the place to be on a Houston County Friday night after football games all the teenagers go because what do you need at 11 o'clock? You need slushies and candy and beef jerky. Georgia currently has two Bucky's locations one in Warner Robbins one in the Calhoun area two more are coming in Brunswick and Monroe County. I am honored today to present the Bucky's team with this resolution honoring their commitment to Georgia and recognizing them for all the great things they do in our communities. I'm not going to read it all but I will read one part of it. Whereas Georgia travelers and travelers through Georgia deserve a safe well at place to stop shop refuel and rest.

On behalf of Bucky's just wanted to say thank you we are currently in nine states and you're the first state that has done this for us so thank you Georgia. And based on our results at Warner Robbins in Calhoun and I'm sure a new Brunswick starting August 4th. All I can sum it up in three words. Bucky's loves Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. And Georgia loves Bucky's no doubt so thank y'all for y'all's presence in our state you're at a lot to us and we most certainly appreciate you. Members you may join our representative baller to our friend some Bucky in the south any room and get some pretty cool photos there. We appreciate y'all.

We had a children of all ages were getting polio there is no cure for it it is an infectious disease and like many infectious diseases you can't cure it you have to prevent it. Even a U.S. president had polio and came and made Georgia his second home and benefited from the therapeutic opportunities at the warm springs.

Senate Bill 153 by Senator Hatchett, the 50th, and others to be entitled to enact to amend the official code of Georgia and intended. So it's a revised, modernized correct errors or emissions in. And re-enact the statutory portion of said code as amended. And further is the work of the Code Revision Commission. This bill ever referred to the committee.

Give the gentleman your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring you Senate Bill 153. 153 is annual code revision bill that revises the code, corrects errors in the code, corrects things that are unconstitutional. This is the work of the Code Revision Committee that presents this. And it's an annual bill we do. And the most important thing it does is re-enacts the code for the state of Georgia. So I ask for your favorable consideration to this bill. You have no questions. The gentleman's asking for favorable consideration. Does that mean you're done? Yes, sir. Gentlemen, is the gentleman yielded the well? Is any objections to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered.

This bill, that one for the committee on intergovernmental coordination, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Betsy Holland is recognized to present the bill, Representative Holland. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I bring you Senate Bill 252. This is a land conveyance bill. It simply allows for the city of Atlanta to transfer property to Atlanta public schools and vice versa in a no-loss land swap. So there will never never result in a net loss for the exchange. The reason we need this in a general bill is that we have codified that a municipality with over 300,000 people must do this in a general bill and Atlanta is the one city that has that population. And with that, I will ask for your favorable consideration. I would... He said he was one. You do have a question. Is the lady will yield? Yes, I will. Representative, I all Williams to your left has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? Of course, for my colleague. Sitting here on the front row, I'm just pondering my memory. Is this your first bill? The gentleman may be mistaken. While this is my first time presenting a bill in the well, this is the Bill of Senator Sonja Halpern. But this is your first time presenting a bill in the well. Yes, sir. You've done an excellent job. Thank you. See you soon. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if there are no more questions, I would be happy to yield the well. The lady, let's see. You survived that question.

And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted, take your time. I got you. All members voted. This so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All the passage of Senate bill 252, the yeas are on 169. The nays are zero. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Good job, Representative Holland. We will see that often, do we? Congratulations. Good work, members. Good work. We're ready to move on to the rules, calendar. A little bit further. Mr. Clerk, will you read a caption to Senate bill 68? Senate bill 68. By Senator Kennedy, the 18th, another is being titled, and act to amend titles 9, 1340, and 51 of the officials go to Georgia annotated, relating to civil practice contracts, motor vehicles, and torches respectively. So it's a provide for substantive and comprehensive revisions. And provisions regarding civil practice, evidentiary matters, damages, and liability in towards actions. This bill, I refer to the committee on rules, that committee recommends the disbilled do pass. By committee substitute. Representative James Barchett is recognized to speak to the bill, Representative Barchett. Barchett. Will Barchett. Well, colleagues, this is for real this time. I rise to speak to you today about Senate bill 68. And I just got encouragement from chairman of appropriations that if you'll just vote like we did on House bill 68, we'll be fine today. So I know everybody has eagerly anticipated this bill coming to the floor. And I'm going to run through what the bill does. And for a minute, I want to just say this to you all. I know that each and every one of you is under a great deal of pressure from folks in the hall and folks back home. But I want to put this in perspective for you. Yesterday, this wasn't a law. Tomorrow, hopefully, it is the law. And guess what's going to happen tomorrow? Sun's going to come up. You're going to say, you know, good morning to your kids and your wife. And life's going to go on regardless of what happens here today. So I don't want you guys to take this bill as life or death here. I know you guys are getting significant amount of pressure. And I respect each and every one of your positions. Senate bill 68 had roughly 15 hours of testimony. And I want to thank each and every member of the subcommittee and the chairman for thoroughly betting this bill. All in all, 25 changes were made in the House to the bill. And I'm going to speak to exactly what the bill does. I know there's been a lot of talk about what the bill does, but I'm just going to put it in simple terms for you. I first think these are reasonable revisions to our Civil Practice Act, our Evidentiary Code, and then to our premises liability. The changes are as follows. In the Civil Practice Act, it determines how and when monetary values for non-economic damages can be argued. That's it. That's one section. Another section is when the discovery can begin. That's it. That's what the section does. How long an attorney has to voluntary dismiss, which we are doing, we're moving closer to the federal system. Currently, you can do until the first witness is sworn in. We're moving to 60 days after an answer. The federal system is a pawn answer, voluntary dismissal. Next, we're clarifying that attorneys cannot double recover their fees. I don't think I have heard one person articulate an argument why attorneys should get double fees. And I know I realize I'm arguing against my own profession because I am an attorney, but I don't think it's patently fair for an attorney to recover twice for the same amount of work. Another thing the bill does is allows evidence for seatbelts. The best argument I think for this is that it's required by law for folks to wear seatbelts. And this allows evidence to come in whether or not the seatbelt was being worn. One of the most substantive changes to our tort provision is determining when negligent search security shall lie. Now, there are two provisions within this bill that allow for two doorways or pathways to find whether or not there's a liability. The first one is more, it's more difficult to find liability, but the second one I would argue is almost exactly what the totality of the circumstance is. And I expect that that is what is going to be utilized by attorneys going forward. And lastly, one of the provisions allows for the actual cost of medical bills to be submitted to the jury as evidence. And that's it. That's what the bill does. It's about how lawyers act in court and then how and when a person can be sought for liability for negligent security. That's it. That's what the bill does. There's no hidden tricks. And I know that we're going to have a lot of testimony about the unfairness of the bill and how we treat victims differently. But I ask you, please, just read the words on the page. And I know it can be discombobulating to read these words because it is a very highly technical bill and it is a lawyer bill. But I'll submit to you folks. This is a bill that makes reasonable revisions to our civil practice act and reasonable revisions to our evidentiary code as well as reasonable revisions to our liability, third party negligent security liability. And Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. And I'll stand for questions. Gentlemen, have a couple of questions. Let's see. I'll recognize Chairman Warkeye's or to your left four questions. Gentlemen, recognize. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Would you like to give them a view? How do you? It's a not-treat that just by reducing the threat of excessive litigation, this will encourage businesses to come here and to expand. I know that is the attempt to bill. Yes, sir. Mr. Speaker, if there's any evidence to your right, is recognize for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On line 171-171, this is in the seat belt section of the bill. It talks about if it's a failure, now I'm paraphrasing, a failure to where you seat belt, that insurance company cannot cancel your insurance or go up on your insurance rate. So now we're going to tell insurance in this one instance what they can charge and what they can't charge. Does that open the door that we can do that with other parts of insurance? Well, I hope so representative. It is my intent to seek some sort of regulation upon the insurance company. Can I follow up with? Yes. I want to do so. Tell me, with that statement, I'm not a lawyer. With that statement right there being in this bill and that will be the law. So if somebody finds out their insurance goes up, what happens? If I'm not mistaken, that's already the current law, too. This is new language to this section, but it is already the current law. They cannot drop you or cannot increase your coverage because of failure to make where to seat belt. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Gentlemen for the yield. We're representing Darlene Taylor of the center out to your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Isn't not true that by passing Senate Bill 68, we're taking a significant step towards lowering operational costs for our small businesses here in Georgia. I expect that to be true. Gentlemen, yield one more. One more. One more. Briefly, just Howard to your right to recognize for our question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With the gentleman yield. I do. Is it not true that allowing jurors to see both billed and paid that this will promote transparency and fairness and warning damages? I think that gentleman knows what he speaks. I think this is a more fair system allowing for the actual medical bill costs plus whatever is billed. So I agree with the gentleman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I expect a good amount of testimony. I'm asking for your favorable consideration for Senate Bill 68. Thank you. Gentlemen, yield to the well. Here's our posture, members. We have those that want to speak that are opposed to the bill. To this measure, we have those that want to speak in favor. Then we'll have a minority report as well. When that time is here, then we have chairman's time. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to allocate 30 minutes for those opposed. And then 30 minutes for those in favor. And I'm going to allow them to allocate that time amongst themselves as they so see fit. So we'll begin with those opposed. And I'm going to recognize representative Owl Williams to speak to the bill. Representative Owl Williams recognized to speak to Senate Bill 68. Representative Williams. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not my happiest moment since I've been on legislature? Here's a bill that could well have been worked out to the good of both sides. And for some clarifications, those of you who don't know, I spent most of my working life on the small business side of the legend. I started out in Providing County Insurance many years ago and I still hold the distinction of having written the two biggest premium policies in the history of Southeast Georgia. I still stand there. I also wrote the biggest life policy ever written. So I've gotten quite a bit of money off insurance companies. But I've heard and I also employed 200 people here for three years and transported 50,000 people a month to medical appointments. My liability insurance was pretty huge. 110 vehicles on the road every day. But there are a couple of things. A slightly overused term in Georgia. Is hard working Georgians. I'm talking about hard working, real hard working Georgians today. It bothers me when a hard working dump truck driver who's right-handed living in North Georgia loses right off. It bothers me when a hard working Georgian in Southeast Georgia gets in an accident and is no longer able to work. It bothers me that these people could reach the point where the American dream disappears, not just for them but for their children. All of a sudden the child's education is not assured. And maybe they're not eligible for

They'll mill scholarship, but they won't go to college. All of a sudden they can't do it. Maybe because when they came out of the hospital in this field, their medical bills left. It's going to devastate the finances of this family. Now, there are a few words that I have become mesmerized by in my years of development. One of them has been oxymoron. I love that word. And this bill is a perfect example of an oxymoron. Some of the argumentals. You can't tell me for 11 street years, you are the best place in this nation to do business. And then on this hand, tell me what is the word, assess fool or a hell hole for insurance? Folks, I have heard so many announcements over the last six years of businesses coming to Georgia. I've seen people living better than ever before. This hell hole has not taken three car, the rogues away. This hell hole has not made the standard of living Georgia invivable everywhere in the South. Don't tell me what businesses might do. All I know is they have not left. What are the best friends I have in the world? Has been in business 55 years in Liberty County. He and I have had thousands of conversations and he's never told me his business insurance is too high. He's mentioned the time when his roof got blown off and $12,000 bill in insurance companies settled for $7,000 and he had the rest now that bothered him. I've spent all this time watching recruiting companies, all of this country and particularly here in Georgia, trying to bring business to Georgia and the fact of our tort costs are number 10, and the list of 10, there are nine reasons to come to their so far down the list. I've never lost the client to this in Georgia. And I've been on the development authority for 25 years, hundreds of companies that come through and not one of them has said, we're not coming to Georgia because you're a tort coster to high. No thing about hard working Georgians, if we talk to them today, 90% of them would not know what in the world tort means of old-eyed. All they wanna know is, am I gonna get a jury? This is gonna be fair. And what do you mean by tort? You telling me I can't get me? Because I'm a hard working Georgian, you don't think my claim is worth X number of dollars because I'm not a member of the country club. I'm just a hard working Georgian, I'm just a father. So my recovery is limited. I submit to you hard working Georgians say, the fairest court in this state is a court when you go in with a claim for damages. Because if you're broke and you commit a felony, it's not if you're going to jail, it's how long you're going to jail because you can't afford to law you. But if you're broke and you have a terrible accident that devastates your family, you got a shot of being made surely whole. This has not bothered our progress in Georgia. No, I never heard a discussion about insurance premiums except homeowners and car insurance being too high until we made it in the conversation. We sent people the information and they started calling people and people started talking, I served on the board of a solar company. One of the dearest friends I have who happens to be a white conservative Republican. Best man at my wedding in 1978. We differ politically. But guess what? He's never told me his insurance premiums are too high and all of my board meetings. Please don't fall for the rope or dope. It ain't about insurance premiums. Don't be there for, look at it. They only insurance most people who are hard working Georgians have as a homeowner's policy, a car policy, and the life or a health policy. That's it. This is not for hard working Georgians. This is for good living Georgians who want to live better. Let's deal with this for what it is. And I didn't want to come. My doctor told me not to even show up today. I'm not well. But this is too important. And I will not continue to see hard working Georgians being used just don't billboards and not in the board room. It's time for them to get a little play. Don't take away the shot. Don't let some girl who's been raped and not be made whole. Don't let somebody who a multi-aloperator did not secure his property. He can't be sued. You can't be against trafficked. It won't want to take away the liability, responsibility to these folks. Folks, let's give it a thought and do something real for once, for hard working Georgians. Let's just speak out of you, Louelle. Gentlemen, as you are the well-referred of your Roberts has recognized, to speak to the well-referred of your Roberts. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I think it's still morning. I want to start by saying, frankly, to everyone in this room to all Georgians, our families, our small businesses, healthcare providers, anyone whose insurance premiums have continued to rise over the last few years. I understand your pain. My car insurance went up again a couple months ago. My homeowner's insurance has gone up every year. I run a small business, a boutique law firm, and all of the insurance policies that are required to run it. Those premiums continue to rise. It has taken a toll on all of us and I share your frustration. The proponents of this bill have spent millions of dollars praying on our stress and frustration telling us that this bill will reduce our rates, stabilize our rates, keep providers from leaving the state. It's simply not true. If it were, I'd be down here begging y'all to pass this bill, it would be against my own self-interest, not to. So let me tell you why it won't stop our pain. First, there isn't a single line in this bill that requires insurance providers to reduce premiums, to stabilize them, or even keep offering policies. Second, I asked every advocate for this bill, whether they could guarantee that it would do any of those things. And not a single one said yes. And third, I looked at the evidence in other states who have adopted similar legislation and whether rates came down or even stabilized. I bet you can guess the answer, not a one. In fact, Florida passed tort reform a couple of years ago and their rates have gone up by 30%. And their Republican speaker of the House has launched a fraud investigation into the information provided to their state legislature to prompt them to vote for similar tort reform that has increased, not decreased their citizens' pain. So what is true? I didn't know some of this. Did you know that Georgia ranks fourth in the nation for the number of fatalities involving any vehicle? We rank fourth in the nation for the number of fatalities involving commercial motor vehicles. And we rank first in the nation for violations of drugs and driving under the influence for commercial drivers. Despite these statistics, Georgia's insurance rates and insurance market are competitive. The cost of defending claims in Georgia for insurance companies is actually less than the national average. The insurance industry's own data shows that the average amount of total earned premiums used to defend Georgia claims brought by attorneys is only 3.3%, less than the national average of 3.7%. Georgia's defense costs are similarly less than the national average for commercial automobile liability and commercial general liability. And Georgia's insurance market is consistent with the comparison states in the US where the nationwide trend is that typically 10 companies constitute the vast majority of the total state market. We've also, over the last five years, had 21 seller groups that have entered Georgia in 21 that have exited. So bottom line, one coming, he comes in, another comes back. So the claim that they're all gonna leave doesn't pass muster. Now let's talk about what's true about our rising premiums. Insurance companies continue to increase preems on Georgia consumers despite consistently making staggering investment profits off their state-provided market. That's because their main revenue source isn't from us paying our premiums, we allow insurance companies to invest our premium money during what's called the float time. On average, automobile liability insurance claims take 15 months to resolve. While there is a five to 10-year lag in long-tail insurance liability lines like medical malpractice. So they invest our premiums in the market creating essentially two pots of money, the premium pot that they use to pay out losses and the investment pot. Georgia insurance companies have earned record profits by investing premiums during this float time. For example, in 2023, although insurance companies nationwide lost $12 billion in underwriting operations, the premium pot, they profited $90 billion in investment income. And in 2024, that industry has profit, has profits totaling $144 billion. Despite our rates going up, their shareholders and corporate executives are reaping profits at our expense. So this bill is asking us to abandon the victims, our constituents that have been wrongfully harmed. Many of them spoke at these hearings, reliving their tragic traumatic heart-wrenching experiences to beg employee that we do not pass this bill. SB68 will make Georgia's less safe and have less access to the courts. But there is nothing that guarantees your insurance rates are going to go down. So I'm pleading with you to vote no on SB68 and support our constituents. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. And ladies, yield to the well. Representative Murray Crawford just recognized to speak to the bill. Representative Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends of the day, I rise in full opposition of Senate Bill 68. Legislation that will be harmful to our most vulnerable constituents and citizens. Those who have experienced catastrophic injuries. Legislation that was drafted under the narratives that there are too many frivolous lawsuits. There are too many nuclear verdicts and that litigation increases insurance premiums. First, frivolous lawsuits can already be this missed under our current rules of civil procedure in those who bring frivolous lawsuits are sanctioned. Second, nuclear verdicts rarely, if ever occur. You heard a lot of testimony or proponents saying that nuclear verdicts occur to Walton and that verdicts don't match the facts. However, what you have not heard is from proponents of this bill explained to you that when an accident occurs, there is an opportunity for defense firms and insurance companies to settle claims within their policy limits. However, they usually prolong litigation and after prolonging litigation, which substantially harms the injured party, that case is brought to trial and after jurors here, the egregious facts of a particular case, they return with the verdict that mirrors the facts in evidence. But then even after a verdict is rendered, there is an opportunity for judges to overturn verdicts should the verdict not match the facts in record. So there's really no need for this legislation. Now, proponents of this bill have said that litigation increases insurance premiums, but I have never seen any evidence to substantiate those claims. There's no proof that litigation increases insurance premiums. But when asked, if we pass Senate Bill 68, whether or not insurance premiums with decrease, I've never heard a definitive answer. What I've heard is, well, you know, so the question that I have is, why are we attempting to pass legislation for a problem that we cannot prove exists? But then even if we agree that that problem does exist, we are about to pass legislation that will not fix the alleged problem. So I really don't understand the point, again, of this legislation. But there is proof that if we pass this legislation is going to interfere with our independent judiciary system. Earlier this session, a former member of this body and the current chief judge of our Supreme Court gave his state of the judiciary. And in his address, he said, and I quoted, that Georgia judges must ensure that equal rights are done for the rich and the poor, which promotes the importance of the rule of law in the independent judiciary that helps to build trust and confidence in our courts. Well, unfortunately, to the nearly 1,600 judges in this state that have been elected by our constituents, should this bill pass, it indicates that proponents don't think that the judges know what they're doing. Proponents don't think that the verdicts mirrored the facts that are in record. And so there's been a creation of a clause in this legislation that would automatically dictate that certain trials be bifurcated, meaning that attorneys and witnesses would have to testify and present multiple times throughout a trial, which is going to prolong trials and make our courts inefficient. No one wants this. This would be like on crossover day, we have intense speakers at 1130 to come and support a bill in this well, prolonging time. No one wants that. No one needs that. It's inefficient. Should we pass this bill with this automatic bifurcation? That's exactly what we would be doing. And ironically, every year, just as soon as I'm standing here, sure as I'm standing here, there's going to be legislation where people are proposing to add judges to their judicial circuits. And they're going to cite backlogs in their judicial circuits. Well, I'm here to tell you, if this bill passes, you're going to have to ask for more judges on your circuits. Because again, this bill would make our courts system less efficient and create more of a backlogs. But most importantly, this bill is going to harm everyday Georgians, allowing slum lords to go doing whatever they want to. They won't protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. Early in my career, I had an opportunity to represent a young lady who went on a blind date. And after going on a date, she decided to drop the young man off because he didn't have a car. She pulls into an apartment complex. And as soon as she pulls into the parking lot, she's shot at it. Yes, she's shot at it. Multiple people shot at her car. She got hit in her arm four times. And so she has to drive herself to the hospital. And once she gets to the hospital, she learns a few things. First, that hospital is going to have to be her home for the next four weeks. Next, she learns that her arm will forever be impaired. She will never have the full range of motion in her arm. So we sent a settlement letter to the insurance company into the apartment manager, asking that they settle within the policy limits. Of course, they said no. So we continue with litigation. What we learned, as we continue to litigate this case, is that the on-site property manager was sleeping with gang members within that community. And she allowed gang members to occupy vacant rooms at this apartment complex to grow their criminal enterprise. Tinnets told the on-site manager and told the owner of the apartment complex about this incredibly disgusting public nuisance and nothing was done. And so my former victim was injured because of that. That doesn't sound right. But what we learned is that there was so many apartment complexes that had the same criminal patterns. And so if we pass the bill in the way that it currently is, the young lady who I'm talking about would not have been able to receive full justice. Again, this bill is going to allow terrible slumlords in our state to continue to operate in a way that does not protect some of our constituents and some of our voters. But as opposed to holding slumlords accountable, the first thing that we're going to do is let's just kill all the attorneys. Let's kill all the lawyers because we don't like the litigation. But the problem is that a lot of the people that we represent their only way through justice is through an attorney that's going to fight for them in court. No one in this room is immune to a catastrophic injury. And I pray that nothing happens to anyone in this room. But should you leave this capital and are catastrophically injured because things happen, then you deserve justice. You deserve full justice and someone who can represent you to make sure that you are made whole after a crazy catastrophic incident. No constitutional right is more important or fundamental than the right of a trial by a jury. And serving on a jury is the only right that is required in our constitution and in our country. If we pass this bill, we are significantly endangering that right. I ask that you oppose Senate Bill 68, not because of your side of whether or not you like attorneys or insurance companies, but oppose Senate Bill 68 because the people that we represent can and will be catastrophically injured at some point, and they deserve full justice. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. And gentlemen, as yield of the will, our next speaker's representative park, Whit Park has recognized he speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, a few things. I've had the opportunity to serve in the whole subcommittee meetings that heard more than 10 hours of testimony on this piece of legislation. Now, while I am an attorney, I am not a trial attorney. And certainly as a native George and Bournemouth raise, I want to ensure that our business community and certainly our hospitals, our medical providers, that we are creating an environment here in the state of Georgia for them to thrive. But this bill is not it. And certainly, we cannot have the most vulnerable among us, injured Georgians, Georgians who have faced the most egregious crimes inflicted upon them to bear the burden that this bill would otherwise and pose on them. The other thing I've learned along the way is, ultimately, this is not a bill about big business and trial attorneys. This is a bill about whether or not Georgians and victims have access to justice. Who do trial lawyers represent? Again, they represent every day Georgians who need help, who need access to justice, which this bill would undermine and otherwise make more different. And so for those reasons, I urge all members of this legislature, of this chamber, to vote no to Senate bill 68, because it will hurt Georgians, especially our most vulnerable. Now, I want to do everything within our power to lower insurance premiums as well. But again, this bill will not accomplish that objective. We had our Georgian Insurance Commissioner come and testify in committee saying there is no guarantee that insurance rates will go down as a result of this legislation. We have also seen in other states that there is no causal effect with respect to this sort of legislation, this tort reform legislation, and lowering premiums of everyday hardworking Georgians, Florida being an outlier. And so again, as members of this body, we have an obligation to protect the people of Georgia to ensure that their rights are upheld, their access to justice preserved, and their health care needs met. This bill accomplishes none of those things. SB 68 would weaken protections for victims, make access to health care more difficult, and unfairly benefit big business at the expense of the people we serve. Now again, there was so much brave testimony from sex trafficking victims, from victims of crime, who spoke out against this bill because they understood that this would undermine their ability to recover and seek justice. This bill would provide a shield to criminals and property owners who turned a blind eye to suffering happening on their property. That's not the Georgia I want to live in, and that's certainly not the Georgia we should be building. Now with respect to health care, section 7 in particular, the collateral source rule and the amendments and modifications therein, that would deviate access to health care for uninsured and underinsured Georgians who already have a difficult time seeking access to health care. The provision also hurts doctors, patients, and Georgia taxpayers. SB 68 eliminates a crucial financing tool that allows doctors to treat patients who can't afford to pay upfront. Without access to those financial tools, doctors will be forced to reduce care, layoff staff, close their properties entirely or turn away patients. What is the effect of that legislation? It would force the elderly, the poor, the uninsured and underinsured into our emergency rooms that will further exacerbate all of the health care challenges that our state continues to face as a result of the failure and ongoing failure to expand access to health care for all Georgians, which is one of the primary factors that drives everyone's private premiums. If you have health insurance and your premiums are going up, it's important because of the failure of this body to ensure that all Georgians have access to health care. This bill undermines the very foundation of our civil justice system. It makes it harder for victims to seek justice and easier for wrongdoers to escape accountability. It weakens the right to a trial by jury, which has been a cornerstone of our democracy for centuries. A jury of our peers is the best safeguard. We have to ensure fairness in the legal system and SB68 chips away at that principle. So again, I know especially as we are heading toward the end of this legislative session, our focus may be short-sighted to a certain extent. Folks, certainly on the other side of the aisle and maybe some here and some on the second floor are positioning themselves to run for higher office. Folks may not be here. Those pushing this bill may not be here come next year, come 2027, come 2028. Let us think about the long-term consequences of this legislation that will undermine our civil justice system and make it harder for victims to obtain the justice that they deserve. And so with all that said, again, I urge all of my members on both sides of the aisle to please do the right thing, put Georgians first, especially the most vulnerable among us and vote no to Senate Bill 68. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative Sam Part, the gentleman's yielded the well. That concludes those speaking that are opposed to the bill. Now those in favor will have up to 30 minutes and we have one person signed up. That's Representative Chaz Cannon. Representative Chaz Cannon has recognized the speak in favor of the bill. Senate Bill 68. Representative Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues like many of you I've watched the debate on this issue from the sidelines. I've listened and learned a great bit from the many hours of testimony and I've learned a great bit from those who are deeply involved in this issue on both sides. Some of my very best friends in this chamber are trial lawyers. And some of them are in the insurance business. So there are certainly some personal feelings on this matter for me. And I've given this issue a great little thought. More than I expected I would, it's an important topic. I've tried to weigh my friendships on both sides against the best interest of the people in my district and our state. And after consideration of those interests arise today in support of Senate Bill 68. A pivotal piece of legislation designed to reform our state's tort system. Cretel lawsuit abuse and fostering environment for small businesses can thrive. This bill addresses the pressing need to balance the scales of justice. Ensuring fairness for both plaintiffs and defendants while stimulating economic growth across Georgia. Our current legal landscape has at times permitted excessive litigation and disproportionate jury awards, which in turn have driven up insurance premiums and operating costs for businesses, particularly our small enterprises. These escalating expenses often translate in higher prices for consumers and can stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is the backbone of our state's economy. Senate Bill 68 introduces several critical reforms by prohibiting attorneys from suggesting arbitrary figures for non-economic damages before all evidence is presented. We prevent undue influence on juries and promote impartial deliberations. Allowing the bifurcation of trials ensures that determinations of liability and assessments of damages are conducted separately, leading to more focused and fair proceedings. Furthermore, by aligning recoverable medical expenses with amounts actually paid or necessary for reasonable care, we eliminate the practice of inflating damages beyond actual costs. This not only ensures just compensation for plaintiffs, but also curbs the inflation of insurance.

premiums that burden our citizens and businesses alike. The bill also clarifies premises liability standards, requiring that property owners be proven aware of specific security risks they fail to address. This protects businesses from unjust lawsuits while maintaining accountability for genuine negligence. Additionally, permitting evidence of seatbelt usage in motor vehicle cases introduces a common sense approach to assessing contributory negligence, promoting personal responsibility and fairness. By enacting these reforms, we create a more predictable and equitable legal environment. This predictability is crucial for small businesses which often operate on very narrow margins and are disproportionately affected by the threat of costly litigation. Reducing frivolous lawsuits and exorbitant awards will stabilize insurance cost, enabling these businesses to invest in growth, create jobs and contribute more robustly to our state's economy. Colleagues Senate Bill 68 is not just a legal reform. It is an economic imperative. These strikes are necessary balance. Protecting the rights of individuals to seek redress while ensuring that our legal system is not exploited to the detriment of honest enterprise and consumer welfare. I urge you all to support this bill. I know it's personal for some folks, but it will foster a fair judicial system and I believe a more prosperous Georgia for all. Mr. Speaker, thank you. I yield the well. Thank you, Representative. General Giolder the well. That completes those speaking favor of SB 68 and those that oppose to SB 68. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Hearing none, the previous question is ordered. We'll now move on to our minority report. We have a minority report that will be up to 20 minutes and we have chairs timed that will be up to 20 minutes. We'll begin with our minority report. Representative Evans, are you going to allocate your time? I think you have another speaker as well. So I trust you to take care of that. Representative, State's Evans is recognized to bring us the minority report. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good afternoon colleagues. I rise in strong opposition to Senate Bill 68. And I want to talk a little bit. I want to try to address the why that we've heard a little bit about why we need this. And then I want to address the what that this bill actually is. First, the why. We've been told this is about insurance. We've been told this is about insurance companies losing money and they can't stay here and that's why they're raising premiums and something's got to be done. I sat through all these hearings, these subcommittee hearings and some of you all did too. You know who didn't come in the House? The insurance commissioner. You know who didn't come in the House? Not a single insurance company. Not a single one. You all've heard a lot about these cases, CVS and race track. You know who didn't come? CVS, race track. They were there. They're representatives. They were there. All of them were there. But they never spoke to us. They never let us ask them questions. Why? This is about insurance, but we didn't hear from insurance. Now I think that I've heard that some of you all have been told, well we're going to do insurance reform next year. Do this this year and we'll do insurance reform next year. This is about insurance. Why can't we do insurance now? And I want you to also thank ladies and gentlemen, you are smart. You're savvy. You've been here before. Remember the last time somebody told you we'll get to that next year. Just remember whether that happened or not. Some of this insurance emergency that we've been told about came out of a report that was done as a result of a bill that we did, the King Report, were relying on that for this alleged situation that we're in. This is from the front page of that report. The contractor he was contracted to do this. The contractor did not independently verify the insurers data and did not perform any verification procedures to determine the completeness of the data provided by the insurers. Therefore the contractor makes no representations, no representations regarding the accuracy and the integrity of the data and information submitted. And due to the requirements of the bill, this is also in the report. This analysis was completed under a compressed timeline. As a result, the analysis team was unable to correct some data anomalies which may have identified additional trends. That's what we're relying on here. Uncomplete data, not hearing from the insurance company. Now you've heard about how insurance companies are making money. Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, I don't begrudge anybody a profit. I am never going to begrudge them that. And I don't begrudge them coming down here and trying to save more. That's their job. Their job is to try to get more. Like your kids want more candy. I want more this and want more that. We sit in the seats of the parents, the lawmakers. It's our job to say no, to balance. And that's what this bill does not do. Now the fine representative carrying this bill talked a little bit about what it did. But it was a little fast. So I'm going to try to address a little bit. Number one, section one, anchoring. They told you that it's not right for these lawyers to get up there and try to put a dollar value on non-economic damages. And the jury should just decide that on their own. That's their role. Well, let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, here's what juries do. They make decisions in the enlightened consciousness of a jury. Enlightened means they have to be informed. Advocates advocate on both sides. And we've heard judges say the juries almost always get it right. They know that these are advocates. They can balance that and they make the right decisions. And when they don't, the judges have the ability already under our law to take that away from them. And take that verdict away. You heard all that section two does is just talk about when discovery begins. That's not all it does, ladies and gentlemen. It ensures, and I can say this without a shadow of a doubt, that good cases will languish. These motions to dismiss, so what's going to happen? This is a little wonky. So when you follow motion to dismiss right now, you get a state for 90 days. The judge doesn't decide the motion in 90 days to stay lifts. You can do discovery. You can get evidence. You can find documents. You can ask questions. This says that stay, that stay of discovery is going to last forever. Y'all, memories fade. Documents disappear. Year after year after year, these cases will languish. I want to talk about section six, negligent securities. Probably the biggest change in our law here. I asked corporations in these hearings, these small businesses. You're not asking us to take away liability for everything. No, that is not what we want. That's what this bill does. This is what this bill says. You could have, under this new section six, look at line 224, you got a much higher standard of saying you knew something was going to happen. This reasonable foreseeability is a really high standard now. And even if you meet that, even if you meet that really high standards, if the injury that is complained of is not about exploiting a specific physical condition of the premises, no liability. Even if you've met that increased standard, even if you've met this new threshold, what does that mean? That means no matter how much the owner knows about gang members on the property, the property owner that we heard about that was letting people have rooms, the gang people have rooms. No matter how many times you know there's been nightfights and gang rapes and gunfire, if it's not about a broken lock, a broken window, a security system that failed, a alarm system, no liability, even if you can prove they knew. None. Why would we do that? Now I appreciate that we have a car about in this section for victims of sex trafficking. That's good. But ladies and gentlemen, how do we pick and choose among victims? And the carrier of the bill said, some people are going to tell you that this picks and chooses among people. And he said, we'll just read the words on the page. You should read the words on the page. That's exactly what this bill does. Line 275. Sex trafficking victims treat it differently. Line 279. Breaches of contracts treat it differently. What about a rape victim? What about a victim of sexual assault in a slum apartment? What about those? How do you look? Those women in the eye. How do you look their mothers in the eye and say, we are going to treat you differently than a sexual assault victim who was a victim of sex trafficking? How do we do that? Why would we do that? To me, that is the most glaring reason to vote no, ladies and gentlemen. It acknowledges that this standard is too high. And we don't want these victims of sex trafficking left out in the cold. We don't want them to not be able to recover for their damages. Well, why wouldn't we want other victims of crime to be able to recover for their damages? Ask yourselves that, ladies and gentlemen. There's so much to say, but I'm going to close here. You know, anytime I have a big court hearing or a speech or a debate or something, y'all will have your playlist, your pump up list. I have mine too. Two main songs I listen to. They're very different. Brooks and Dunn, only in America. And Killer Mike never scared. Why only in America? Because that's my story, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know if you've listened to that song, but there's a line that says, it's about a bus driver and she's sitting in traffic and she's looking at a rear view mirror, looking at the future of our country. She says, one kid dreams of fame and fortune. And one kid helps pay the rent. That was me, ladies and gentlemen. I remember getting my first paycheck as a Salabara attendant at Shoneys and handing it to my mom because that's how we stayed where we were. I've never forgotten her because I've dreamed of fame and fortune, ladies and gentlemen, I've gotten it. But I will not forget that girl. She doesn't have lobbyists out there. She doesn't have a voice in every courtroom. She has to fight for every single thing she gets. And she can finally get in there and tell her story. We're going to tell her. No, sorry. Now why never scared? Because how could I be scared? If I've lived through that, and we've seen victims come down here and plead for us to not do this, to not shut the doors of justice on them. Do you know how hard that must be for them? If they can do that, if they can stand up, it is not hard for me. And I am never scared, and I hope you are never scared too, and I hope you will keep a voice for these victims. And please join me in voting no. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the majority of the time to Tony Miller. The lady as you were the well, Chair Miller, Chair Lady Miller is recognized. She speaks to the bill. Chair Lady Miller. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good afternoon colleagues. Much like my colleague who just left this well, I too grew up the child of a working poor family. And I don't really talk about myself personally. I'm a private person. But I grew up in the mean and cold streets of Cleveland, Ohio. With the sun don't shine, the land of ice and snow. I was raised by a single mother who went to work every single day of her life, barely taking days off. Only to be one paid check away from complete and utter disaster, I watched my mother battle evictions, repossessions, opportunities that passed her by. Wishing, as a child always does, that they could protect their mother. There's a reason why I'm telling you this. This was formative for me. It created my why in life. Because what my mother needed in those moments was an advocate, someone who could stand up for her. It became a formative core element of who I am as a person. It charted my course. It sent me to law school. Where I fell in love with the law. Its consistency, its stability, its sturdiness. It made a child who grew up with instability feel safe. Where there was a place that truth mattered. I became a child lawyer because I fundamentally believed that the courtroom is where everyday citizens, the Davids with only a slingshot, are on equal footing with the Goliaths. I learned that our jury trial system is fundamental to our founding. You all know this. Where legislators were studying, where students of history. We may know that the 12-person jury is a sacred thing with roots often traced to the Welsh king of Glau Morgan, who established jury trials in 725 AD, linking the judge and the jury to Jesus and the 12 disciples. And as such for us, a foundational premise of our union, indeed according to the founders of this great nation of ours, Thomas Jefferson, I consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution. John Adams, representative government and trial by jury are the hardened lungs of liberty. Without them we have no other fortification against being written like horses, fleeced like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed like the swine and the hounds. James Madison, trial by civil jury in cases, is as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existing rights of humans in nature. I want you to frame this discussion today, my colleagues, understanding what we are tinkering with. I want you to be aware of the fact that this is not just some bill. This is an attack on the very fundamental premise that makes this country what it is. You disrespecters, you accuse them of being confused, hoodwinked, run amuck, let us say, not in a divorce case where they decide which parent gets a child, not in a contract case between two big corporations where they have to decide complex accounting and whether or not some rule in our jurisprudence has been broken. Not in a murder case where a prosecutor will stand up and ask a jury in this date to send a man to die. Those jurors are okay. But somehow something happens to the 12 citizens who by nature of them being in that seat, they are voters, the same people who send you to this seat, something happens to them when it's a personal injury case. When someone has been killed in a civil case, they get all squirrely, they get confused about the law, they can't decipher what a lawyer says is reasonable or unreasonable, they can apply the law, they don't listen to judges and by the way those judges, many of whom appointed by Brian Kemp, we are asked to believe have created a hellhole of a justice system in this great state of Georgia. They are good men and women, they are learned jurors, they do their job under the hardest of circumstances, they don't have enough resources, but they dispense and administer justice every day in state courts and in federal courts from the north to the south of this state. When we come in here and allow them to be disparaged by some DC propaganda PR firm, it's outrageous. This tort reform sham, my brothers and sisters, is a well run orchestrated PR campaign. Make the time to researches, just Google tort reform. Since the 1990s they've been saying jackpot verdicts, juries out of control. Businesses are closing, doctors fleeing the state, every time the campaign is run the same way with the same talking points, the same manufactured crisis. Last year we were fine, we were lamenting the fact that we were the number one place to do business, but this year my god, we are crushed and overwhelmed by an emergency in our judicial system, it is a lie. It has been proven to be a lie. It has been debunked over and over and over again. Don't you let them do that to you. This bill is bad for the people. Now let's talk about who this bill hurts because I think we might go past this a little too quickly in all the jargon and the legal ease and if you can read that bill, my colleague, as a lawyer and tell me you understand it, you are probably destined for MENSA. It is one of the most poorly drafted bills I have ever seen as a lawyer, having spent my life interpreting and arguing and trying to understand the law. Now, this bill hurts the 92 year old elderly woman who died in her bed because she was devoured by fire ants. This bill hurts the four year old baby who went in for a random ton select to meet. His wound wasn't sutured properly and by the time he got to the driveway of his home, he bled to death in front of his mother and his brother and his sister. These are the people that backs upon whom this bill, these lies are being left. You're going to tell me it's okay if you're a 12 year old girl who has been sex trafficked. You can still go to court. Why? Because you have the pucleidical favor. You are the political group, does you? But a 12 year old who just got plain old rate. And the stairwell of an apartment complex knew they had a dangerous condition and failed to do anything while I'm sorry, my dear. The courthouse doors for you are closed. You want to tell me the father of a child whose family was the victim of a drunk driver who ran to the car his wife was driving. Mr. Speaker, I'm wrapping up. His wife's legs were broken in the front seat. They'd been hit by an impaired driver. The cars were on fire. He went to get his six year old baby out of the back seat. He picked her up and he picked up half of her torso. The other half still in the seat because she had misplaced the seat belt and wriggled out of the shoulder strap as children often do. That father you mean to tell me has to come in and tell you three times that he wrangled and held the last of his child split into. Why is it that these are the people upon whose backs any of this is being built? I ask you my brothers and sisters, vote no. My Democrats, I know. My Democrats, I know you are carrying some of you the weight of the world on your shoulder. You have been threatened, coerced, attempted, and you don't walk on water. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We'll move on to Chairman's time. Now, up to 20 minutes. Chairman of the Committee, Chairman Parrish, has recognized and speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I do not intend to take 20 minutes on this. I want to come to a little different approach to this. We're talking about Senate Bill 68. I want to say thank you to the Governor. I want to say thank you to the Speaker, to the members of this House, the members of the Rules Committee, and especially to our subcommittee on Rules that dealt with this. In my time that I've served here in this House, to the best of my knowledge, I can't remember a piece of legislation that had as much attention as this bill does. We sat through over 13 hours of hearing in our subcommittee. We heard from dozens of interested parties that talked to us about what their concerns were, what their interests were, and so forth. Chairman Levitt, Levitt had the patience to sit there and listen to make sure everyone who wanted to have something to say was heard. I can tell you that was done. They shared their concerns and they shared their suggestions and everybody had a chance to slate their case. Because of this process, the vetting changes were made to this legislation and the changes and suggestions that we heard in our committee meetings were the reason a lot of these changes were made and what they were made for. I believe this bill is a giant step forward in the right direction to do tort reform in this state. I'm going to be voting for it. I'm going to vote yes and I hope you will join me in voting yes. And Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield my time to Chairman Levitt and Whitbury Sheth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman, you will this time and recognize House will now recognize Representative Levitt. Speak to the representative. Representative Levitt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote for this version of Senate Bill 68. But before I talk about the bill, I want to thank the subcommittee for their service. We did hear a lot of testimony. It was very moving much of it. It was lengthy. The hearings took a long time. I know you all had other things to do this time of year and I appreciate your commitment to this endeavor. But I think it was very well worth it. We heard a lot. We learned a lot. We listened and despite what some have said this morning, we put what we heard in place in this bill. The substitute you're considering today has some meaningful changes. I don't mean to slight the work of our friends across the hall. We had an advantage in that we had we got to see here the debate over there first and think about it and then it came to us. So we had more time to deal with it. I don't believe we made any material changes but we did clarify the intent in ways that I think make the bill clearer and better and legislation is always good when it's clear. So I'm proud of the work we did. I'm proud of the hearings we held and I'm proud of the process we have applied. Now let's talk about the bill briefly. There are 10 sections to the bill. One of them is repealer and one of them is effective dates. You got eight substantive sections. One of them arguably does make some changes in the type of evidence you can hear that's relevant to prove and that's the premises section. So it does make some changes but I would submit to you that while I am sympathetic to any victim out there, I also want to be sympathetic to the people who run the businesses and own the property and are sometimes the defendants. They deserve fairness too. And I think what the bill tries to do is make things fair for them. For example, the voluntary dismissal right now plaintiff can dismiss just as the first witness is being sworn. I don't see how you can tell me that is fair to anybody. So we're changing and we're moving it back to 60 days after the answer is filed. Right now plaintiffs can talk about non-economic damages. This is things like pain and suffering. Anytime in trial they can also talk about economic damages anytime in trial. This bill just says, we'll wait until your jury argument to make that argument. Don't do it during the rest of the case. And when you argue make sure that your argument is rationally related to the evidence. So we're upset now that someone cannot make an irrational argument about how much money they should recover. Don't understand the outrage on that one. And you can still talk about economic damages all the way through the trial that you want to. And you can argue both in your opening and your concluding closing about economic damages. So I don't think we're really tipping the scales there and I would suggest you that's a fair rule that we currently have. We also have the provision on the state of discovery. That's already the law. There is already a limited state of discovery. Now this could result in that state being longer but there's already an existing exception in the statute that allows you to get discovery about the issues that the defendant is raising. So you can determine if that motion is valid or not and show that to the court. So while there is a state, it's not an absolute state. There are exceptions to it. And that's already the existing law and that's not being changed. As to the premises section. I think we all, well, it seems like we're telling much of our state not to believe their lying eyes when it comes to what's going on with respect to insurance rates and respect the liability. That particular error of the law, I think, has gotten due to the total of the circumstances test. It's difficult to plan. It's difficult to know what you need to do and you're going to be second guest if something happens. This simply places some boundaries and some borders on the kind of evidence that can be admitted and trial to prove that claim. It doesn't otherwise change the substance law but it does make changes.

because it does change the evidence that we come in. But I would submit to you that's trying to balance the interest there in a way that's more equitable to everybody and certainly fair to the people who need to know what they need to do. So I would submit to you the whole issue with insurance. I don't know if this will cause rates to change. I don't know if it will come down. I really don't. If you look at some other states, there is a correlation. Despite what's been said here, there have been reductions in rates in Florida. Now, I can't tell you that's a causal connection there. But I just don't think we can do nothing. I don't think we can sit on our hands and wait. People in our state are telling us they're having serious problems that we need to do something about. And I think based on at least correlations in other states, this will make some difference. Now, I would also say to the extent you're concerned about in regulating insurance companies, it's kind of difficult to crack down on them and then have them stay and compete with one another for your premium dollar. And to the extent you're concerned that we were being asked to wait to do insurance reform, we've already done it. The House Bill 1114, a year ago, has imposed some regulatory reforms on the insurance company so we can check on what they're doing and what they make and what they're earning. So that's already there. I'm all for some additional initiatives, but we have done that already. So I would encourage you to vote for this bill. I think to the extent we worry that we can't do anything we're putting ourselves in the position of Nero who fiddle while Rome burned. And we don't want to be in that position. So I would hope you will vote in favor of this bill and the Speaker, I would yield and rate my time to whipership. General Muziel to the well, whipership is recognized. He's speak to the bill for the final time allotted to the chair. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My intent here is to speak to some of the concerns of a raised with my colleagues and before I do that, let me say I have a great deal of respect for each and every member in his chamber. And the advocates that came to this well have very impassioned statements, but I feel the need to correct the record. First off, there's not one line in this bill, nowhere that does not allow a rate victim to bring a claim. Not one line in this bill does that, nowhere. It is disingenuous to say so. And I'll go as far to say that it does not allow that a victim of rape can never be made whole period. Once that line is crossed, a victim of rape cannot be made whole. No dollar amount, no judge, no jury, no advocate, no lawyer can ever make that woman whole. I don't think that it is a genuine statement to come in here and say that a rape victim cannot bring a claim under this bill. No one in this chamber would support a measure that does that. No one in this chamber would likewise support a measure that decreases access to justice. I mean, there's 50 billboards out there, call any one of those lawyers. They're going to give you access to justice. I promise for a small dollar, that's all it's going to take. And I'm a lawyer. And frankly, that is also a disingenuous statement to say that this is closing off access to justice. What this bill does, it is a civil procedure bill mainly in my mind. Civil procedure, how lawyers act in the courtroom. That's it. The same claims can be brought. Every claim can be brought. One of my colleagues mentioned that this tour form doesn't work. It didn't work in Florida. Simple Google search, February 5th, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantes announces rate reductions for Miami-Dade County auto insurance reduction statewide and 11 new companies entering Florida market. May 24th. Florida Home Insurance Premium is falling. May 24th. First downtrend in insurance rate filings in years. Now, it is a disingenuous to come in here and say that policy objectives can't affect insurance rates and insurance products. That's my friend's example about the property owner who was sleeping with the gangs. And he knew about the gangs being on the property. I will submit to you that has no place in this bill. That victim could bring a negligent hiring claim, a bicarious liability claim, and a negligent retention claim, none of which are in this bill, none of which are impacted by this bill. So that victim has access to justice. She has the ability to seek out a lawyer and get her day in court. And by the testimony I heard today, I expect that they won or will win. One of the remarks that was made in here was that there was access to health care. Access to health care will be reduced here. I have no, I have read this bill, reread it. I have read, had to read it four or five times because it is a dense bill. There is nothing in here that closes off one emergency room in this state. The hospitals that are supporting this bill, I don't think would be in very, in support of this bill if there was an emergency room closed in this state. And that's our primary access to health care. Everybody in this state of Georgia has access. The doctors have told me a number of times they don't turn away anyone. Access to health care is not impacted by this bill. One of my good friends said that advocates, lawyers should be able to argue anything in court, specifically saying that they're being constrained what they can argue in a courtroom. Well, I would submit to you that relating a professional baseball player salary to how much you want to get for a victim of a car accident has nothing to do at all, nothing to do at all, with that victim's harm. That's all we're saying. Bring rationally relatable measures. Don't talk about a G5, how much a G5 jet cost when you're talking about somebody has been rear-ended. That's the constraint. I think that's a reasonable constraint. My colleague says we should be able to argue anything. We should be able to argue and say that the Disney castle cost $100 million. So my client who was rear-ended should get $100 million. That is preposterous. I think that is a stretch. And I think this is a reasonable constraint. Just to say that, if you were going to say that my client was hit, my client should be able to recover the cost of their car, the cost of their injuries. We haven't limited that ability at all. Your economic, non-economic damage, special damages, punitive damage, have not limited them at all. Limited what you can say as a lawyer because you're trying to embed these numbers in these juries head. That's what we're doing here. There was testimony that our courtroom, this bill is going to continue to extend the length of trials. Well, friends, we are past that mark. Anybody that has been in court knows that our dockets are full. And there are. I have a case right now that I've been litigating for five years, five years. This is not going to push that any further. Not one bit further. What it will do, though, is require you to bring a meritorious claim. Bring a claim that's a real claim. Because you don't get to toss somebody up with a complaint, bring a claim, and then make your case, and then figure out if somebody is liable. You don't bring a meritorious case and then drag somebody through discovery for 18 months and then decide, well, we've made him spend 150 grand. Now we're just going to voluntary dismiss. That's happening, folks. One of my farmers in South Georgia had nothing to do with a case. It's been $100,000 answering interogatories, going to court and trying to tell everybody, I didn't have anything to do with this. Why are you suing me? This is going to make lawyers bring better cases. My colleague said that one of her pump up music is never scared. I'd be afraid to tell you what mine is. It's pretty out there. You know who's scared? Our family businesses are scared. Our family run farms are scared. One of my farmers says, I am scared to put the name of my farm on my dad going truck because somebody's going to run into me because they built these businesses, these family owned businesses their whole life. It takes one. It takes one piece of litigation to take everything away from them, everything. No more house, no more property, no more business, no more way to sustain a living for your children. This does one thing. This does one thing. It changes how lawyers act in the courtroom. That's it. We've litigated this quite frankly to death. I'm asking you, I'm employing you, and I'm begging you. Put something up that's going to help us. There's going to move the ball forward in the state of Georgia. This is not going to prevent victims of rape, victims of sexual assault, any victims from bringing any claims. There's nothing in this bill. This doesn't cut off access to civil justice for anyone. Please, please, please support this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, the well. General, as you order the well, that's that completes our presentation and discussion on the bill, both in favor of and those are opposed. I'm going to ask all members to please come to the chamber. Mr. Clerk, will you ring the bell so we have notice that we're getting ready to vote? Thank you, members, for your attention. Is any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Here in none, the committee's substitute is adopted. Is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall the this bill now pass? All in favor of the past year the bill. We'll vote yes. All those will pose. We'll vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? For what purpose is representing Williams rise, represent no Williams? Parliamentary inquiry. State inquiry. Is it not true that no person can be turned away from medical care in this state if there is an emergency or bad care in the hospital that accepts our Medicare? Is that not true? I think the gentleman knows what he speaks. His community certainly has a good health system. For what purpose is representing HEPNARISE? Very inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State inquiry. On one day September 30th, the leadership of this state converged on to Augusta Georgia to lend their support for Hurricane Helene victims. Is it not true that for the past 30 days at least daily, WRDW local news are tracking the following headlines? Home owners with policies are left feeling uninsured after Hurricane Helene are insured ripping off Georgia victims of Hurricane Helene and tips on how to navigate insurance appeals for Hurricane Helene victims. Is that not true, sir? I'm sure you had a long inquiry there. Thank you, sir. But I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks. Have all members voted down? For what purpose is represented Thomas rise? Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. State inquiry. Is it not true that this bill is focused on curving lawsuit abuse and making our businesses more, but I guess our economic engine here in the state of Georgia more desirable for investment? Sure, the gentleman knows of what he speaks. Have all members voted if so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? All in the past of Senate Bill 6868, the EAS are 91, the Nays are 82, this bill had received the requisite constitutional majority. Is there for pass for what purpose is represented by a check rise? Make a motion. State your motion. A motion that we immediately transmit to the Senate. Representing for check moves that Senate Bill 68 be immediately transmitted to the Senate. Is there objection? Gentlemen move, there is objection. Gentlemen move. Gentlemen move, yes. Gentlemen move. All right, let's vote it. All those in favor of immediate transmittal will vote yes, those opposed to immediate transmittal will vote no, Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines? All members vote it. If so, Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machines? All in the gentleman's motion, the EAS are of to immediately transmit the EAS are 94, the Nays are 77, the bill is passed and it's on the way to the Senate. We'll move on to afternoon orders.

One of them recognized their family if I could. But first, before they stand, we've got a lot of people, I guess they closed down Tyler Perry studios because a bunch of you guys are here, along with GPP and all of these other folks. If you're with the film industry at all that has brought all of this massive money to the state of Georgia, would you stand so we can recognize you, please? And of course, thank you.
