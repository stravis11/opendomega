We lost last night. Mr. Bruce was a kind soul. Did a great job and loved this house as well, as all of our doorkeepers do. But he certainly will be missed, and we'll have a photo of Mr. Bruce in a little while, so we'll speak more to that point. So a moment of silence for Mr. Bruce and certainly condolences to his family. If you'll join me in that. Good Lord, thank you for a good man, who cared about this house, cared about each and every member here. Thank you for his service to Georgia and to this Georgia House of Representatives. Bless his family. Lord, we ask that you would be with them and Lord give them the support they need if we will as well. If we're so asked in these days that come. Thank you, God. Amen. Be seated. Doorkeepers, will you please close the doors? As is our custom, we will begin our day with Scripture reading in prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 53rd House District, Chair Lady Deborah Silcox, representing Silcox. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Happy Cross-over Day. I am delighted to have my pastor, Dr. Richard Conwisher, this morning from Peachtree Presbyterian Church. Dr. Conwisher studied at Trinity University in San Antonio before completing his master's at Princeton Seminary and as doctorate from Fuller Theological Seminary. He's been honored to serve as a member of the Board of Trustees for all three of his higher educational institutions and he is currently on the Board of Directors for the historic Fox Theatre here in Atlanta. Richard and his wife Kelly met in graduate school. They fell in love debating theology and eating ice cream as a reward after an evening in the library. Kelly is the founder of Optep Consulting and is passionate about empowering momentum for organizations and noble causes. They have two adult children. One is as student at the University of Georgia and the other ten's Rich's Amor Modotronity University. Rich loves to read, swim, run, and if you really want a great story, ask him about his whole and one-in-golf sale. With that, Dr. Richard Conwisher. Thanks for being here, my pastor. Thank you, Deborah, Mr. Speaker. I thought I would encourage this morning with some ancient words from the Bible that sound like they were written yesterday. I thank my God every time I remember you, constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you, because of your sharing of the good news from the first day until now. That it's right for me to think this way about all of you because you sharing God's grace with me. Both of my struggles and the defense and the confirmation of the good news. It is right for me to think this way about all of you because you hold me in your heart. I'm confident of this. That the one who began a good work among you will see it to the finish line. And this is my prayer. That your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight to help you to determine what is best. And so if there's any encouragement in Christ, if there's any consolation from love, if there's any sharing in the Spirit, if there's any compassion, if there's any sympathy, then make my joy complete. To be of the same mind, to have the same love, to being in full accord and of one mind, to do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility to regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Let the same mind of God be in you. Not that I've already attained this, or I've already reached the goal, but I press on to make it my own, because God has made me his own. I do not consider that I've made it my own, but this one thing I do, for getting what lies behind, straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on to the call of the heavenly prize of what God's given to us. And so rejoice in the Lord always. I'll say it again, rejoice. Let your gentleness be evident to all. Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and intercession, with thanksgiving in your hearts, bring what you have before God, and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding. We'll stand guards at your hearts and your minds. And so finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there's anything that is of excellence, if there is anything that is worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing. The things that you have heard and seen, and learned, and received, and the God of peace, will be with you. Let us stand and pray. By your strength and by your spirit of God, will you pour yourself out upon your people?

Upon this assembly to be able to give them a joy that is beyond their knowing, a humility that strives towards service, and for the opportunity to forget what lies behind and to lean forward into a future with hope. Take away all of their fears and anxieties, leave them with gentleness of spirit and may your peace descend upon this chamber, particularly upon the Sims family to give us of a hope that can never be shaken. And so make this day productive, make it shorter than they expect it will be, and I offer this prayer, may it be so and may it be so. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. That was my last regards to God's ears. Well y'all heard the preacher, it's gonna be a short day, what could I say? Okay, door keepers you may unlock the doors, member, you may join the pastor in the south that in your room for a photo. Members, our doctor of the day is brought to us, they by representative Sheila Jones. Thank you representative Jones, Dr. Lajun Oliver. We'll, downstairs today if you need her, call on her. We appreciate you and let the doctor know, show her our appreciation for being here today. Certainly it's important to us. I'm for the morning and afternoon, once and after. Oh, I want to, since is day 28, we need two physicians working today. So we have one for the morning hours and one for the afternoon. Representative Jones has brought the morning hours and representative Matt Barton has, Dr. Max Parrott here, will be here for the afternoon order, afternoon time frame. I think the afternoon is, got a short end of the stick on that, when I don't know if he's going to stay with us till we complete our evening or not, but he, this says he will. So thanks to Representative Barton and Representative Jones for bringing our positions of the day, we appreciate their service.

If you lose your driver's license, you're more than likely going to have your job disrupted. And Representative Maynor and I worked with municipal court judges and the Department of Driver Services for months on this bill. This straightens out some convalued procedures on point. The Georgia Chamber and Metro Atlanta Chamber support this as do criminal justice reform advocates that had broad base support throughout judiciary non-civil.

That committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. The representative Rob Leveritt is recognized to present the bill. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, the House. House Bill 846 has a bill that grew out of a retired educator's meeting in my district one night when one of the members there told me that she retired and thought she would get so security and learned that she had not been paying in because most of the school districts do not participate in the so security system. They are legally allowed to opt out, which is perfectly fine. But her plight, let me think that we need to do a better job of notifying our school employees of what benefits they're entitled to and whether or not they are paying into social security and entitled to benefits under social security. So, that's all this bill seeks to do is require school districts to notify employees if they're paying in, if they're eligible and what other plans are available to them that might take the place of and supplant the absence of so security income after they retire. So it just requires the notice to be given every five years and a pun termination or separation from service so that folks are reminded periodically and can make appropriate plans for their retirement. And that's what the bill does. Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. Representative Bernal to your left has a question. Representative Bernal. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? Yes, ma'am. I yield. As a retired educator and also I'm from Detroit. So I received months, I mean yearly letters from Social Security. Let me know what my hours were. So was she given that same opportunity? So I knew when I retired that I had both. I don't know the answer to that question. I didn't quiz her on what other notices she had received. But I know that she was not aware. And according to GAE and PAGE, this is a concern of theirs as well. And they support the bill for that reason. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Let's see. This next question probably knows a little bit about what she speaks. I think he's been a career in education, Chairman Irwin, to your right is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman you? Yeah, to my 504 roommate, absolutely. Is it not true that George is one of only two states that were school systems either withholds Social Security or do not where we have that option in this state? Frankly, I was not aware of the other states' practice, but I'm sure the gentleman asking the question knows well of what he speaks. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, if there are no further questions, I will yield the well and ask for a favourable consideration of House Bill 846. I know we got a lot to do today. Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you for the bill. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Hears None, the previous question is ordered?

The 23rd to be entitled back to men chapter 24, title 33 of the official quoted Georgia annotated related to insurance generally. So, it's prohibit insurers from discriminating against certain health care facilities and providers. Mr. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Public Health. The Committee recommends a disbilled due pass by Committee's substitute. Chair Lady Ballinger, you're ready? Chair Lady Ballinger's recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we have a long calendar, so I'll make this very brief. This bill preserves the link between a provider, the patient, and the medication in the middle. It seeks to keep that a continuous and does it require, requires the option of getting medication from the provider, administering the medication. Health care providers are in network. It doesn't prohibit white bagging if that's the best for the patient and the provider. Conversation with the patient has decided that that's the best course of option. It does prohibit it and it only applies to providers who have a network contract with a health plan. With agreed upon pricing. So I know pricing was a concern, but this is within the contract and it would be agreed upon pricing. Mr. Speaker, that is the bill and I will stand for any questions. Lady has no questions. Thank you. I ask for your favorable support. Lady is yielded the well. Is any objection to the previous question being ordered, the chair has none. The previous question is ordered.

This bill, I refer to the committee, I want you to share that committee recommends a disbilled due pass by committee substitute. Representative Devon Sebaugh is recognized to present the bill. Representative Sebaugh. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise to present House Bill 1017, also referred to as the Squadra Reform Act. I want to thank Representative Matt Rees and Deborah Silcox, along with my friends Sam Olens, for the time and patience in helping draft this legislation. It has been a true team effort. What this bill does is amends the official code of Georgia so that the rightful and lawful owners of a property can expeditiously remove an intruder, also known as a squatter from their property. This bill is needed because for property owners in Georgia, squatters are occupying their property, presents a very difficult and expensive legal problem as the law currently stands. We have homeowners tied up in court for eight months to two years in some cases, trying to get these squatters removed from the property. Cases are backing up in Superior Court and the local sheriff's departments are backed up in issue, Ritz of Possession. We have real estate agents trying to sell a home but can't gain access to show it because of squatters taken possession. We have military members leaving for duty to serve this country and returning to find a squatter living in their home that is refusing to leave. Georgia property owners are suffering. They're suffering financially and some to the point of going bankrupt. Georgia has been ranked the number one place for squatters and that is not a ranking.

that we want. Colleagues House Bill 1017 sends a message to squatters. You are criminals, and you will be treated like criminals. If you commit the crime of squating, you will be arrested, charged with a crime, prosecuted, and promptly removed from the property. You will be fined, and you will pay for damages you caused, and you will spend time in jail. And if you want to play games by submitting fraudulent leases or rental agreements, we have something extra for you. You may be charged with a felony and sent to jail on separate charges. There are no more free homes available in Georgia. And if you are currently in a home that you don't belong, leave now. Colleagues, stand with me today and send a message to Georgia property owners who are victims of the crime of squating that we hear your cry for help, and we're going to do something about it today by voting yes on House Bill 1017. Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to answer a few questions. Gentlemen, has a couple of questions. Chair, let me seal Cox to your right all the way in the back. Has a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Isn't it true, Representative Seba, that this bill will help realtors all over our state to protect property owners, and their rights in that property, and help them correctly administer real estate transaction in the state. The lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. Representative Jasmine Clark to your left. Has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. So thank you very much for bringing this bill. I do think that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. But I know that there are some Georgians that have found themselves the victims of fraud. Where someone purports to own a property and executes a whole lease, and they move in literally thinking that they are moving in lawfully, how will those victims of fraud be affected by this law? Thank you, Philip. That's a good question. Thank you for that. It's a shame that there are a victim of fraud. And the courts will deal with that appropriately. But they're still squatting in someone else's home. And this bill will get them out of that home in a timely manner. So they would, does the gentleman further yield? Yes. So they would be arrested, even if they can show like, hey, I thought I was renting this place. They would still have to be arrested. They would, they would receive a rid of possession, and they would have their time in court. Thank you. Chairman Carpenter, to your right and the back of the room, has a question. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that this legislation will one protects my businesses across the straight state and also provide affordable housing for Georgians? Yes, that is true. Thank you for the question. You have a couple more if you don't we yield? Reps. Glaes to your left has a question. Reps. Glaes. Thank you for bringing this bill, representative Seaball. What I would like to ask you is, is it it not true that for the last year, my sister who lives out of state for one year has had to pay her mortgage, her utilities, and continue in Fulton County trying to get a squatter who is a criminal. Got there through fraudulent means, use tens of thousands of dollars to get that person out. And this bill helps to criminalize a person like that and to get the property back to the original owner. Yes, Representative, that is true. And I apologize that your family member had to go through that. But that is exactly what this bill is going to do. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen, yield?

In order to have their sentences vacated just like we've been we've been able to do for other survivors of human trafficking so this just clarifies that language to ensure those victims have the same rights is is other victims that the speakers the bill be happy to answer any questions. I have no questions. Thank you Mister Speaker. You know what's yielded the well is there an objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous questions ordered is there an objection to agreeing to the report the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill.

The gentleman from gentleman from Albert time. Remincentive lever it is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen House I encourage you to vote for House bill 1223 this morning. This is a bill that deals with the issue of soil amendments that is a program that has been around for about 50 years. It is managed and regulated by the Department of Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper has been a really good job of invigorating that program and making it more robust. This gives him another tool in his toolbox as we like to say. It is very very narrow it is very surgical it addresses an issue that has been somewhat prevalent in my district and in a lot of other areas in adjacent districts it is bipartisan legislation. It basically says that if you are subject to a consent order of EPD and there has been a notice of violation or a finding that there is soil contamination water ground water or surface water contamination due to this spreading of soil amendments and generally if you do it right there is none. But when you do it wrong you can do you can result in that contamination. If that has happened you cannot continue to spread amendments on that property until that violation or consent order is cleared. That is the limitation that is the scope of the bill and the speaker and I will stand for any questions. Gentlemen has no question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen since Rep. Collins was up here I want to recognize him for this quote I want to leave you with. It is a Billy Joe Shabler lyric. The devil made me do it the first time. Second time I have done it on my own.

Report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the past of House bill 1223 the yeas are 165 the nays are zero the bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Members I want to take a point of personal pride we have a lot of great young people that are there in this house today and I want to recognize the group from midtown high who are debate champions they've won several debates across our state and I want to tell them how proud we are how good is to have them on the house floor. Congratulations young people. Thanks for representing the manner for bringing them y'all could give this a bunch of pointers I'm sure about debating respectfully. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption of House bill 1231 1231 1231. The 21 to be entitled to amend code section 23519.2 the fiscal to Georgia and it's a related relating eligibility requirements for hope scholarship and award amount. This bill I refer to the committee on higher education that committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The objective of the bill is to recognize the bill represent the whole. Thank you Mr. Speaker it's my pleasure to present to you House bill 1231. The issue that this bill attempts to solve is some of our most motivated academically gifted students many of them will enter into graduate programs simultaneously with their bachelor's work. But do that there is an issue of whether or not they can use hope scholarship hours for that professional study or graduate work. As the statute now stands it can only be used for a bachelor's degree but we provide for up to 127 semester hours or 190 quarter hours. So what this bill would do is it would keep those same parameters however it would allow students that have extra credits to be able to use those towards advanced degree work. This happened to a constituent of mine she brought it to my attention and then of note the bill carves out anybody who's in dual enrollment. So you would get the 127 credits that you can use. So if you use it for dual enrollment and what happens now frequently is students will major in multiple undergraduate areas or they'll get multiple bachelor's degrees which they can do and they'll just graduate the same time. So this would just broaden the field so individuals that are in masters or professional work can use the credits and the final thing that I'll share is the amount of the credit would be for the undergraduate courses so anybody for whom this applied they would have to pay the difference between the graduate rate which is usually a little bit more expensive in the undergraduate rate but they would still be able to use the scholarship. I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. There's no questions. Thank you. He's yielded the will thanks for bringing the bill is there an objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered is there an objection to adopting the committee's substitute. Chair here's none the committee's substitute is adopted is any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill.

Thank you Mr. Speaker good morning colleagues House bill 12 83 for your consideration this bill is a straightforward bill that simply cleaning up a code section of definition in juvenile code that deals with class a designated felony is currently in the code aggravated assault and assault with the deadly weapon. In the definition is excludes a firearm as a deadly weapon so I'll just read the portion of the definition that we have a problem with is when used offensively against a person actually does not result in serious body and actually does result in serious body injury provided that such deadly weapons on a firearm so this bill just strikes provided that such a deadly weapon is not a firearm so there's no confusion as to what a deadly weapon is.

Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 10521052. House Bill 1052 by Representative Cannon in the 172nd and others to be entitled back to amend Code Section 4857.4, the fiscal code of Georgia annotated relating the bona fide conservation use property, residential transitional property, and application procedures. This bill emin for the Committee on Ways and Means, that committee recommends that this bill do pass by Committee substitute. Representative Chad Cannon is recognized to present the bill. Gentlemen, you are speaking to that little thing with that little knob or you'll be fine. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I bring a House Bill 1052, the purposes of this bill, to provide some flexibility in the Coova Statue for Non-Family Farm Entities, to give them the ability to rent land that is currently enrolled in Coova. Coova is a fairly restricted statute for agricultural land. If a Coova qualified family farm wanted to lease their land to a non-family farm entity, it would breach their covenant. This provides some flexibility for a non-family farm. That's the growing trend. You got two friends that own a farm, a partnership, an LLC, two shields and liability, an effort through an LLC, split equipment cost or input cost. If they did that because they're not a non-family, because they are not related by bloated marriage, they cannot rent land in Coova. This allows some flexibility. ACCG gave it a support. Appreciate the Georgia Agriculture Business Council bringing this bill and ask for your favorable consideration. I'll stay for any questions. I find the gentleman has no questions. I yield the will. Gentlemen, as yielded the will, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair Here's none, the previous question, is ordered, is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute, the Chair Here's None, the Committee's substitute, is adopted, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that Chair Here's None, the report of the Committee is agreed to shout this bill now pass. All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1052, the yeas are 166, the nays are two. This bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Because we're going to call one more bill before lunch, we'll break for lunch. So if there's something that we need to make an announcement about, then you need to make it known so we can call on you for announcements. So our members will be fully informed of what's next. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption of House Bill 1116 1116? House Bill 1116 by Representative Buckner, the 137th be titled Act Two Men, Article Two, Chapter Seven, Title 48, the physical to Georgia and Tederlain, the imposition rate computation, exemptions and credits relative to income taxes. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, that committee recommends a dispelled due pass by Committee substitute. Give the lady that will be in the will, your attention please, Representative Debbie Buckner, from Johnson City, Georgia is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1116 is a joint effort and I want to thank a couple of people first. Chairman Blackman was very gracious in working with us on this and it is a combination of Chairman Ron Stevens bill and one that I had. So it truly is a bipartisan bill and it is a bill that we have had a tax credit for historic rehabilitation for a number of years. It's been very successful. It's set up in such a way that I know some people that have been really nervous about tax credits and how many have gone through. This one has a lot of structure to it and we actually worked on reorganizing it some again this time but it is two parts. Part of the bill is for residential and part of it is for commercial but it is all for rehabilitation of older buildings. And once the buildings are designated as historic then there is a list of what is agreed upon between the person that is doing the rehab and the Department of Revenue about what would be available for the tax credit. Then the work is done and then the developer or the person we are doing the home will go back to DOR and they are ready for their tax credit and that is when they get the tax credit. The beauty of this plan is that the state is never out any money. They give the tax credit after the fact and also the beauty is that for the state of Georgia they get about $3.80 for every dollar the tax credit is a dollar to the $3.80 that they make on the development. The good thing about this one is the main thing we needed to do was extend the sunsets and so we have done that and we have also increased on some of the smaller commercial projects the caps because as we all know there are many more expenses with older buildings when you try to rehab them and those costs have gone up. Without interfering with lunch too much longer I will ask for your favourable consideration for extending the caps or increasing the caps and extending the sunsets and approving this build that I hope will help remove some light in some communities and encourage some rehab of old buildings and making them into new structures for us to use. With that Mr. Speaker I will yield for any questions. Lady has a question Chairman Blackman. But the Suner I will have a question. The lady you? Yes I do. Isn't it true that during our panel discussions that we found that this is not only in addition to you know what all you you mentioned one of the best tools we have to address light in communities across our state. It is indeed we have some neighbourhoods that were built for example after the World War 2. They are very found built homes but the neighbourhoods are becoming blighted or run down. This would be an opportunity for community to go in and rehab those houses and redevelop those communities and remove that light and make them flourish again. Thank you for your work on this bill. Thank you for your assistance for your question and I ask for your favourable consideration and if there are no more questions I will yield a will. You have another question. I will. Representative Ann Allen whisper to your right. How is the question? Does the General Lady yield? Yes I do. Isn't it true that I have many constituents who are watching this bill who have historic structures they want to fix up. It is a labour of love for a lot of homeowners but isn't it true that love doesn't actually pay the bills when you are fixing up an old house? That is exactly true. Thank you for bringing the bill. Thank you. With that I will call your attention to a letter on your desk from the hub chamber of commerce that you are very interested in this passage as well. Thank you very much. Lady has yielded the well. Is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? The chair has done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair has done. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair has done. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shout this bill now pass. All in favour of the passage of the bill. We will vote yes. All those opposed. We will vote no and the clerk. We will unlock the machine. Have all members voted for what purpose does leader Beverly rise? A pursuant to House rule 133 has to be excused from this vote. The gentleman has that right and the journal will so reflect for what purpose is chairman Carson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that Augusta used to be a capital city for the state of Georgia. I'm reflecting. It is. I was there but not that long ago. I think the lady is correct. But we appreciate the matter bringing this bill and we have many historical homes and buildings. In the former capital city and we appreciate the opportunity to benefit from the tax benefit of this bill. Thank you. I'm sure this will further benefit a very beautiful city. All members voted if so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House bill 1116, the yeas are 162 and nays are five. This bill will have received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We have a couple of announcements before we break for lunch. Chairman Corbett is recognized for an announcement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Georgia Hospital Association Center for Rule Health will be hosting a lunch over in the Ag Building where the rule caucus meets upon a German. Everybody come join us. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Chairman of the Rules Committee, Chairman Parrish, has an announcement. Let's see. Some things just don't change. You ask for it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
