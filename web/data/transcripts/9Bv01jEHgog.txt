TRANSCRIPT
----------
Jason Ridley. Does anybody sit next to you?
Mr. Leaders, there's a seat one seat down here.
Somebody like to sit here.
Chairman Meeks.
I feel like a Baptist preacher if there's a seat next to you,
slide over so somebody can get.
Chairman Tillery, I've never seen this room this full.
Well, I almost called you Senator Hatchett, they all come for you, Mr. Chairman.
I don't know about that.
Good morning.
I think we need to try that again.
Good morning.
Hey, everybody's awake.
All right.
Well, thank you all for being here.
The Lord blessed us.
He brought snow this weekend.
He's going to bring snow coming up.
So we fit us in the middle.
So thank you.
With that, I would like to invite Chairman Gerald Green, Dean Green, on his birthday and his
Forty-fourth Joint Appropriations Hearing to Open Us in Prayer.
Thank you, Mr. Leader, our great appropriations, Chair.
Let us pray, Almighty God, as we come before you today.
We come with humble hearts and grateful spirits as we gather in this place of public service.
We thank you for the opportunity to serve the people of the great state of Georgia, and
for the trust they have placed in us.
And as we begin these appropriation meetings, we ask for your wisdom, your guidance, and
your discernment.
Grant us clarity of mind and purity of purposes as we consider the resources entrusted to our
care. Help us to listen carefully, deliberate, thoughtfully, and act responsible. Always mindful
that every decision we make affects the lives of our citizens. Bless our governor and the
members of the Georgia General Assembly and all who serve in leadership capacities in
our state. Grant them courage, integrity, and spirit of cooperation. And may our discussions
to be marked by mutual respect,
civility, and a shared commitment to the common good.
Guide us to the wise stewards of the public trust.
Do act with fairness and compassion
and to seek solutions that strengthen our communities,
protect the vulnerable, and promote opportunity for all.
We ask your blessings upon the state of Georgia,
upon its people, and upon the work we begin here today.
May I actions honor you and serve the best interests
of those we represent.
And we ask all of this in the name of our Lord and Savior,
the Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
Thank you, Dean Green.
All right.
We got a full house.
So keep it to a little rumble, please.
Well, as you know, last year we didn't get to have these because of Mother Nature.
But luckily we are this year.
It's going to be a long three days, they're packed.
There may be times when we don't allow you to ask your question because we need to move on.
And I'll go ahead and apologize for that in advance.
But we got a lot to hear from a lot of people, a lot of very important people in the next
three days.
Senator Tillery, anything?
Well, first of all, welcome again to the joint hearings.
As Chairman Hatchett said, last year we did miss these because of snow.
Those of you who aren't involved in the leadership appropriations may not know this.
We alternate years.
The House plans one year, the Senate plans the subsequent year.
In this year, the House planned the meetings.
Thank you, Chairman Hatchett, Christine Dave,
for what the work y'all've already put into this.
Also remember, though, that this is not,
for those watching online,
this is not the only budget hearing that takes place.
Budget hearings will continue throughout the entire session
until we finally end on April 2nd.
We will be negotiating the budget,
negotiating with agencies all the way to the end.
So please don't think we're spending $40 billion
of your state taxpayer dollars
with just a five minute conversation.
That is absolutely not the case.
Committee hearings will happen afterwards.
The House will break up into their own committees.
The Senate will do their own.
This is not just a five minute decision made.
I'm honored.
This is my seventh year sitting here chairing the budget.
It is hard to believe that seven years have gone by that fast.
We are in a much different position
than we were the first time.
It was chairing the budget.
That was the middle of COVID, 2020.
when we were taking 15% out.
But the one thing that has not changed
is that every single dollar we spend
comes from somebody in our state's pocket.
And I want us to keep that at the forefront
when you're gonna hear a lot of good ideas
on how money should be spent.
But remember that you have to take it
out of a taxpayer's pocket to spend it in the first place.
So hope we'll keep that at the forefront
when we're going through these things over the next few days.
Chairman Hatchett, thanks again for the preparation.
You've done to get us here.
Thank you chairman tiller present protein walker if I was a senator I'd be getting
up and letting somebody have let them have your seat let you have their seat I
mean I'm just trying to prompt one of these good senators thank you for being
here I tried but we are awaiting our special guest so present for there is a
chair on the left side over here if you want to yeah you have to sit by
representative Dunahoo but but there is one over here on the left yes sir
You
You
You
You
Colleagues, it's my honor today to introduce someone to you that really needs no introduction,
but it's my first time to introduce him to the joint appropriations hearing in person
and not from Davos, ladies and gentlemen.
the 83rd Governor of the State of Georgia, the Honourable Brian Kemp.
Governor, floor is yours. I believe your mic is ready to go.
All right. Well, thank you so much, Chairman Hatchett. I appreciate the kind words,
chairman Tillery, members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee.
I am honored to be here with you in person this year to present my final two budget recommendations.
I also just want to take a moment as we start and thank you for allowing me to address
you virtually in previous years while Marty and I have been on economic development trips
and bring more jobs and investment to our state.
As you know last year we were in Germany at this time and met with some great leaders,
some companies that you all know, all of whom either already operate in Georgia or looking
that potential investments.
That includes Mayor's, who's one of our largest clients
at our port, largest SIP and company in the world
in terms of a marketing presence.
And as we continue to grow and reach capacity
at the Georgia Ports Authority,
conversations like that mean greater business
and job growth for our state.
In fact, port activity now supports over 650,000 full
full and part-time dobs across the Pete State, a 7% jump over just the last fiscal year,
which is pretty incredible.
In 2024, Chairman Hatchett mentioned that we were in Davos, and I remember that trip well,
the first one, especially because people were giving me a hard time for going over there,
especially some of my friends on our side of the aisle, and now we know President Trump's
going over there.
they're going to give him as hard a time as they did me. But we did have a great trip. In
2024, we met with GF casting, which then announced a few months later a project in August
to promise in 350 new jobs in a $184 million investment. The prior year, in our first trip
to Davos, we met with executives from Hyundai, LG, SK Group, and others. And I don't have
to tell you how big an impact there are various expansions and announcements have had on our
state and our hard work in people. Those trips had real impact on the communities and the people
that we serve just like the budgets that you work on in past. So again, I just really want to
thank you all for your partnership over the years and for sharing a strong commitment to responsible
strategic and measured approaches to the annual budget and also just thank you for indulging
me and letting present virtually it was worthwhile all those trips were but I am glad to be
here in person with you all this morning. These annual budgets requires discipline and respect
for the people that sent us here because every dollar we allocate is a dollar they earned
not the government.
As I said in my final state of the state address last week,
refusing to grow government, budgeting conservatively,
and paying off debt aren't flashy,
but they are the right thing to do by our constituents.
Georgia voters have again and again rewarded those who
hold spending in check by returning them to the gold done.
So it is not only right to be conservative in our approach.
It's not only the best thing for our state
and it's fiscal standing.
It's also quite honestly just good politics
and the results I think speak for themselves.
Our approach is maintained
toward us triple a credit rating,
saving tax payers and future generations,
millions of dollars in interest.
On top of this, it has allowed us to use cash
to finance projects throughout the state instead of debt,
saving tax payers and future appropriators
who will sit in your seats $3.3 billion in interest payments over the next 20 years.
It has allowed us to store up strategic reserves for the next economic downturn, ensuring
you all or future legislators won't be forced to cut critical services for Georgia's
win not if the next economic crisis hits.
And it's enabled us to put more toward education, health care and mental health resources than
ever before in our state's history. We've also been able to make historic investments in
infrastructure across Georgia, again because of our strategic and restrained budget approach.
That careful planning has allowed us to return money and reduce the tax burden on Georgia's
at a time when prices skyrocketed to 40-year highs. All told, we've now saved them $9.7 billion
through tax rebates, reductions, suspensions of the gas tax, and other measures, and that is with you all's help.
And again, with your help, we'll increase that amount even more.
All of these historic measures did not happen by chance, or they happened by choice.
We choose to live within our means, resist pressure to grow government, and use one-time funds for generational projects
through a once in a lifetime opportunity our revenue level gave us policies that
grow the economy instead of government are also why we've seen sustained job
creation, private investment and rising wages in Georgia. This year I'm asking
you to double down on that winning approach yet again further accelerating the
largest income tax cut in our state's history by 20 basis points. With this
This third acceleration we will deliver on the promise we made in 2022 to bring the
tax rate under 5 percent and we'll do it three full years ahead of schedule.
As you all know this will save hard work in Georgia's another $770 million every year.
And I again want to thank you all for your work in the past and ask for your partnership
again this year in record time as value partners that you are.
I'm also asking for your support in returning a fourth,
one-time tax rebate to families as they continue
to face affordability challenges
and the lingering high prices that came
with 40-year high inflation.
This will give a little over of a billion dollars
back to hard work in Georgia's for groceries,
help with the rent or car payment,
the ability to pay a little more on a credit card
or help with other needs.
With these latest measures added to those
from years prior, your hard work will now have given a total of $7.5 billion in targeted
one-time relief to the people of our state, and over $3.8 billion in permanent tax relief.
These tax measures are not in conflict with fiscal discipline, they're a product of
it.
That's a pretty good record for any legislator or governor if you ask me.
With that same discipline approach, the budgets before you continue to prioritize investments
that strengthen Georgia's economic foundation.
We are focused on building and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to support continued
growth and growth transportation and workforce development.
Georgia's roads, bridges, ports, rail connections, and airports are not just assets.
They are economic tools.
When they function efficiently, they reduce costs for both drivers and employees and employers,
shorten commutes and improve the quality of life for families in our state.
But to meet current demands and prepare for future growth, we need to make strategic investments
in that system.
Therefore, my amended budget includes more than $2.3 billion to further expand and improve
critical freight and commuter quarters.
additional support for local government for road maintenance and address
critical bridge repairs across the state. These investments bring the total
additional transportation investment during my administration to more than
$4.7 billion. That not not only benefits commuters and businesses it all it
also keeps Georgians around the state working. The only reason we're able to
to make such transformational investments
is because the unique position that we're in with our reserves.
That has allowed us to fund major projects
with one-time surplus funds rather than long-term debt.
Not only does that give us flexibility and out-ear budgets,
it also ensures today's infrastructure improvements
do not become tomorrow's financial burden.
In addition to transportation,
these budgets continue targeted investments in water,
sewer and energy infrastructure to support growing communities across the state and attracting
new employers.
These budgets include $33 million for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority's Water
and Sewer Funding Program for local governments, as well as $35 million to establish a new
natural gas infrastructure financing program.
This is a first of the kind in Georgia.
This program will help communities build infrastructure needed to support and expand key industries,
including our critical timber sector.
We all know how devastating Hurricane Helene was to this industry.
And now that damage was amplified by the closure of multiple paper mills in South East and
Southwest Georgia.
That's why this past year I convened a forestry task force to bring together state agencies,
academic institutions and industry leaders to help us tackle this issue.
My budget's fund items recommended by this task force so that we can further support this
major industry in our state as it continues to recover.
We will invest $660,000 into the Georgia grown wood program that the General Assembly
supported last year.
This will support economic development and media campaigns to market Georgia as a premier
destination for forest product manufacturing. This budget also includes $2.6 million to
construct a mass timber county unit facility for the Georgia Forestry Commission in Morgan
County. We have seen the private sector begin to embrace mass timber construction even
here in Atlanta and this will be a first of its kind construction for a state agency.
I can't think of a better agency to lead the way than the forestry commission which serves
protects our forest lands every day. Just since the last time I presented budget
recommendations to you, the great team of the Georgia Forestry Commission has
fought or helped contain over 4,000 wildfires. That is a 64% increase over the
five-year average, and yet of the 37.7 million acres in our state, those fires
just burned 26,000 acres. That's a testimony to how dedicated
to men and women who work for the Forestry Commission are and I want to
commend them for all the young men's work they've done during this current
fire season. That success is also a testament to your impact through previous
budgets. We knew following the devastation from Hurricane Helene with the
unprecedented amounts of timber now on the ground this fire season was
would be difficult.
That's why you helped us prepare by putting over $1.7 million
toward replacing forestry vehicles and firefighting equipment
in the FY2026 budget.
And over $4.7 million in the amended 25 budget
for a new fire suppression helicopter.
Given how effective the Forestry Commission has been,
you can see just how impressive the return on the investment
has also been.
And I want to, again, thank you all for your partnership
in securing those funds for the Forestry Commission.
Finally, my budget includes nearly $11 million
to establish the Georgia Forestry Innovation Initiative,
building on the research underway
through the ReWood Program at Georgia Tech's Renewable
Byproducts Institute.
These funds will be used to engineer, design, and test
new technologies to support the expansion
of our timber industry partners into new markets,
like automotive and pharmaceutical manufacturing.
This partnership will be a textbook example of how
the research in our USG laboratories
is directly supporting Georgia businesses.
I'm also proud to report that demand
for higher education opportunities in Georgia
is higher than ever.
That's why my fiscal year 2027 budget includes more
than $253 million to meet enrollment growth
both across our university and technical college systems.
But we also know too many students either don't attend
or fail to complete college because they can't afford it.
While others finish with debt that weighs them down
literally for decades.
The fiscal year 2027 budget includes an additional $58 million
to fully fund hope scholarships and grants
at the 100% factor rate.
We return the program to, again, with you all's help.
You'll be glad to know that because of that good work,
last year, hope programs helped nearly
a quarter million students attend post-secondary institutions.
I also want to thank you again for your partnership
in eliminating the special institution fee for students
in 2022, further reducing the cost of higher education
our state and keeping college within reach for hard work and families. Last week as you
remember I announced yet again yet another and perhaps more historic measure we will work
on together to make college more affordable and accessible to Georgia students. My amended
budget includes a $325 million dollar endowment to expand the dream scholarship. The first
needs based aid program of its kind and Georgia history. This investment has a goal of leveraging
an additional $1.2 billion in private funding to create in the coming years a permanent sustainable
source of need based aid for thousands of future Georgia students. This structure matters a great
deal when it comes to our budgets because using one-time funds for an endowment rather than creating
a recurring obligation expands access while also maintaining long-term stability.
The return on that investment will be higher college completion rates, a more skilled
workforce and reduce student debt which will benefit the entire state's economy.
With your help over the years we have also invested $100 million in capital maintenance projects,
so our higher ed schools are worthy of the students that attend them.
The amended budget provides another $88 million for MRR needs across our USG and TCSG
campuses.
These investments help meet outstanding infrastructure needs without having to raise
tuition.
We're also giving an additional $3 million to the technical college system for a new college
and career academy.
This year we're also focusing on connecting and graduating students with job creators.
without a good job, there's not much return on even a quality education.
That is why my budget invests $14 million in cutting-edge, in a cutting-edge career navigator
application that will help students and job creators find available positions and provide
a clearer pathway for economic mobility.
Just like the cost-cutting measures and tax rate reductions we pass, the investments
This we made in education, workforce, and economic development will help hard work in
Georgia's with affordability because the best way to fight through high prices is to
have a good job with good wages and good benefits.
These are investments that will pay dividends not just for years, but I believe for generations.
As we continue to build on Georgia's fiscal and workforce infrastructure, we're also
protecting the foundations of our financial stability. Together we have
invested more than $4.1 billion in the last three fiscal years in capital
construction and maintenance needs by using surplus funds rather than new debt.
As I said earlier that decision will save future generations billions in
interest payments while also saving them on deferred maintenance costs. As a
As a result, our debt ratio is the lowest it's been since we first began issuing bonds
over a half a century ago.
In addition to this historic accomplishment, you've also helped us eliminate the outstanding
unfunded liability for state retiree health benefits, reducing it from over 2.1 billion
to zero.
Thanks to those efforts, we will save more than $240 million annually in health costs
beginning this upcoming fiscal year.
We're using those savings to invest in additional $200 million into the Teacher State Health
Benefit Plan to keep them on solid financial footing.
Even while making these unprecedented investments, we have kept our rainy day fun full and preserved
undecidinated reserves so we can properly respond to whatever unknown challenging challenges
the future brings.
I'll close by reiterating what we've all accomplished and more was done by choice, not by chance.
As I pass this recommendation on the U.M. confident that we can build, continue to build on this
great partnership that has served our state and its people so well.
also would be remiss if I didn't mention the greatest first lady in the country is with
us this morning Marty Kemp.
It has been an honor for us to serve this great state and it's also been an honor to serve
with you all, and I know that the work of your committees affects every agency, every community,
and every family in our state. Like Georgia families budgeting around their kitchen tables,
we have a we have to plan based on what we actually earned today, not what we hope to earn tomorrow.
Together we'll continue the good work we began years ago, lowering the tax burden on hard work
Georgia's strategically invested in our state's future and keep
in Georgia the best state to live, work, and raise a family.
I wish you all your best and your work will look forward to working with you,
and I hope you have a great rest of the day and budget hearings.
Thank you. God bless you.
Governor, thank you and First Lady Marty Kemp for the service you've given this state
for the past seven years and a little while longer, you're not done yet, but it does not
go lost on me that you wore that green tie today, thank you.
all right well I guess we get down to business now thank you and first up is
Dr. Robert Bushman our State Economist. Good morning everyone thanks for all of
y'all being here packed room well as you heard I'm Bob Bushman State
economist here to talk to you today about Georgia's economic and revenue outlook.
Thank you Chairman Hatchett and Chairman Tillery for inviting me to speak today.
It's good to be back after getting sort of snowed out last year.
I didn't see any snow, but I think some people up in North Georgia might have.
Georgia might have. My presentation today will follow this rough outline, hopefully with
time for Q&A at the end. First, a state revenue update and a review of structural and economic
contributors to recent revenue trends. Second, a review of U.S. and Georgia macroeconomic
performance measures. Third, the outlook and the risks and finally a look at the revenue forecast.
I'll start with a recap of fiscal 2025 performance compared to 24 as well as a year-to-date
fiscal 26 results. As you can see, fiscal 25 personal income tax collections grew by 1.3 percent
despite tax rate cuts from a top rate of 5.75 in the first half of fiscal 24 to 5.19 flat rate
effective the second half for the full second half of fiscal 25. For the first half of the current
fiscal year personal income tax collections are up 2.6%. Even though tax rates are 3.7% lower
than a year earlier.
Corporate income taxes were down 9.9% in fiscal 25
and 4.4% year to date this year.
Somewhat larger declines than can be explained solely
by rate cuts.
Sales tax gains have slowed in part due to declining inflation
while gains in motor fuels in fiscal 25 and year to date this year
are mostly explained by the shorter suspension of
motifuels taxes in fiscal 25 than the year before,
and no suspension so far this year.
Without the suspensions, the gains would have been marginal,
1% or less.
People are just burning less gas.
One item that stands out in the year, date numbers is the 93%
gain in insurance premium taxes.
most of the reported gain is the result of an extraordinary refund paid in
September 2024 so adjusting for that however you'd still see a 15% gain
year-to-date in insurance premium taxes and a 14% gain in fiscal 2025. Stronger
insurance premium tax revenue growth is due in large part to high
inflation in insurance premiums, particularly in fiscal 2025. Total taxes in the
year-to-date comparison are up 3.3% and improvement over fiscal 2025 growth,
but total general funds revenues grew more slowly, only 1.6% mostly due to 28
percent lower interest earnings as interest rates came down and about two
billion dollars of undezonated surplus balances were drawn down for one-time
items. For a quick review of longer-term revenue trends, this graph shows tax
revenues by major tax types since physical 2020, starting at the base with
personal and corporate income taxes, followed by sales, motor fuels, TABT, etc.
Over five years state revenues have grown cumulatively by $9 billion or
about 36%. But it's important to note that 94% of that growth, about 8.4 billion, came
in just two years, physical 2021 and 22. The state's three largest revenue sources,
personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes, grew by 8.1 billion over the five
years, accounting for 90% of total growth. Other taxes, performances varied, especially
the motor fuels tax, given the suspensions over the last four years, and as the figure
makes clear, total tax revenues have been essentially flat since 2022. In spite of motor
fuel tax suspensions and substantial income tax cuts, the first of which took effect starting
in the second half of physical 24 and the second a year later.
Taking a closer look at the main driver of income tax performance, this graph shows what's
been happening with Georgia and U.S. personal income since the first quarter of 2020 just
before a pandemic job losses hit wage income.
These data are seasonally adjusted, adjusted for inflation and indexed to 100 in the first
period so you can see cumulative growth over time.
First the solid lines show total personal income, including from employment, from dividends,
interest and rents, and from transfer payments, Georgia and Orange and the nation in blue.
The dotted lines show only the wage and salary component of total personal income.
Those are the lines you should focus on wage and salary income.
wage and salary income is up 8.6% cumulatively over the entire period, while Georgia is
up 12%.
With most of the outperformance coming in calendar year 2022, growth continued through
the first half of calendar year 25, the latest state data available, but Georgia underperformed
slightly on wage and salary income over the last four quarters, though it did beat
U.S. growth in total personal income, 3.1% to 2.6%.
Wage and salary income is really the main driver of personal income tax revenue growth
over the medium to longer term, so let's take a deeper dive into that, our biggest revenue
source.
This graph shows both withholding and total net collections on an annual basis since 2015.
Taxes on wage and salary income are collected generally through withholding.
And historically, withholding collections have been approximately equal to total income
tax collections on average each year.
That change starting in fiscal 2021, and dramatically so in the following two years.
For fiscal 2022, the gap between the orange and blue lines represents an extra 3.9 billion
of net collections over and above withholding.
more about two-thirds of the $5.9 billion gain in total income tax collections from fiscal
2020 to 2022. These nonwithholding payments come primarily from estimated and final tax
payments, less refunds, and except for refunds are generally related to income earned from
a business from self-employment or from investments, including capital gains income. A big part
Part of the $3.9 billion positive gap in fiscal 2022 was tax on capital gains.
I'll show you my estimates of that on the next slide.
The gap has mostly disappeared again more recently, though part of the reason is the implementation
of entity level filing by business pass-throughs.
Between one and $1.5 billion of tax payments from pass-through entities shifted from personal
to corporate income tax in fiscal 2023 and 2024.
Finally, withholding collections have benefited from continuing wage and salary income growth,
though that has leveled out in the last two years in part due to tax cuts.
So far this year withholding collections are up 0.4% year to year, while the total again
is up 2.6 percent, so the gap is widening a little bit again.
I've shown most of you all this before, so I'll try and be quick on this.
The table shows capital gains data reported from two sources, an optimized Department of
revenue administrative tax return data covering E filers and IRS tabulations of returns that
were filed from a Georgia address, so excluding non-residents and anyone who moved out of the
state by the time they filed their federal return. From these data, we calculate the amount
of tax that would be owed on these gains, assuming the top statutory rate for that year.
year 2021 was a great year for gains, as you can see, producing an estimated $3.1 billion
in tax that would have generally been seen as revenue for the state in fiscal 2022.
That fell nearly in half in tax year 2022, and again by a quarter in 2023, mostly impacting
and fiscal 23 and 24 respectively.
The graph below the table shows the distribution
of those gains realized across returns
with less than $100,000 in reported gains
to those reporting more than 25 million in capital gains.
As you can see, that top group reporting very large gains
is also quite volatile, but you can also
see that tax year 2022 was a big year for capital gains
all sizes and that the biggest reversal in tax years 2022 and 23 was in the
largest gains category which fell by 84% over the two years. We don't know yet
how much we've reported in tax year 2024. It'll take a little while to get
that and a long time to get 20.25.
Income growth contributes to state revenue growth in another way through the sales tax,
sustained growth of ordinary personal income, income from a job or a business or from dividends,
interest and pensions is the main driver of sales tax revenue growth over the long term.
one-time transfer payments or investment windfalls are less likely to affect taxable consumption
near term in aggregate sense.
Nominal personal income growth in Georgia, excluding transfer payments, averaged about
6.1 percent per year over the last five and a quarter years, while sales tax revenue
grew by 8.7 percent per year on average from fiscal 2020 to 25.
So what explains the faster growth of sales taxes than income?
Part of it was initially was spending the pandemic assistance payments, but that effect
pretty much dissipated a couple of years ago.
The other big factor has been the mix of consumption spending, beginning with the pandemic consumption
shifted from services to goods, goods in red, services in green in this graph.
The data are for the U.S. because state-level consumption spending data only comes out
annually with quite a lag.
But the picture has been much the same in Georgia through the latest state data available.
As you know, goods are generally taxed in Georgia while most services are not.
So the shift boosted sales tax revenue growth for the first two to three years after COVID
hit.
The shift back toward services since 2022 has been a drag on sales tax revenue growth in
fiscal 23 through 25.
But the mix of goods and services consumed has returned to the pre-pandemic mix.
So that drag on sales tax collections should be over.
And as you can see from the blue line on the graph, personal income less transfer payments,
incomes have not kept up with prices.
This is the affordability issue in a picture.
So to summarize the main contributors to trends in the largest revenue sources, nominal
wage and salary income growth has slowed but continues to support withholding collections
despite the tax rate cuts.
First half, fiscal 2025 saw 36 basis points
or 6.3% lower tax rates, then year earlier,
while withholding fell by 3.6%,
implying year-to-year wage income growth of around 2.9%.
First half of fiscal 26 saw an additional 20 basis point
for 3.7% lower tax rate, while withholding grew by 0.4%
implying year-to-year wage income growth of nearly 4.3%.
The boost to sales tax revenues from spending
of excess pandemic savings and the consumption shift
from services to goods is over.
The inflation boost to sales tax revenue persists
but a lower rate, year-to-date fiscal 2026 sales tax growth of 2.1% is lower than inflation
of 2.8% year-to-year suggesting slower real spending on taxable goods.
Now, let's look at a few other broad measures of current economic conditions and performance
over the last year to set up for the 26-27 outlook.
First up, unemployment, national unemployment rose to 4.5 percent in November and then
back to 4.4 in December from 4.1 a year earlier, while Georgia, I mean, while, has been out
performing on this measure for almost six years now, we're at 3.5% as of November, so we're
down a tenth of a point in the last year and we're six tenths below the national reading
for December. Low unemployment is good for consumer confidence, obviously, supporting
taxable consumption and puts upward pressure on wages contributing to taxable income growth.
Since February 2020, Georgia non-farm employment has grown by 6.7% cumulatively versus 4.7 nationally
through November.
But for both the state and the nation job growth stalled in 2025, Georgia gaining about
3,200 jobs over the year, well, at least through November, or about 0.1%.
The U.S., meanwhile gained 584,000 through December, or about 0.4%.
Most of the weakness has come in recent months, the U.S. lost 117,000 jobs in three months
through November before gaining 50 back in preliminary December estimates.
Georgia is estimated to have lost about 7,000 jobs in September through November.
Employment leads to growing output from businesses, which brings us to the broadest measure of
economic performance GDP or more specifically real GDP adjusted for inflation.
The headline result is that Georgia and US real GDP, shown here indexed to 104, the first
quarter of 2020, have both grown by 14.8 percent on a cumulative basis from the start of
this very short pandemic recession.
outperformed the nation through the end of 2022, lagged briefly in the first quarter
of 2023 as roughly tracked national growth since then. Both George and the nation took
another dip in the first quarter of 2025, but both have rebounded since.
to inflation. I've probably seen this before, so I'll try not to spend too much time on
it. This graph shows the inflation surge that prompted the Fed to raise rates a couple
of years ago, 11 times in 17 months. Headline inflation peaked at 9% year-to-year in June
of 2022, far above Fed targets, but came back down to 2.4% by September 2024. Unfortunately,
the decline stalled there until inflation began rising again last June. Both headline and
course CPI inflation rose to just over 3% year to year in September, the last reading
before the government shut down. Reports for November and December were a little bit lower,
But there are also gaps in the survey data, so we'll wait and see how January looks.
The green line shows inflation in goods prices, which kicked off the inflation rise in 2021,
and peaked at 12.5% year-over-year in February of 2022 before falling dramatically and spending
all of 2024 in negative territory, falling prices.
This turned positive again since last April reaching 1.5% year-to-year in August and September.
The grocery component of that reached 2.7% year-to-year inflation in September and ended
the year at 2.4% year-to-year.
Services inflation, which accelerated while goods inflation was easing peaks three years
ago and has declined since reaching 3.6% in September and 3.3% last month.
Monetary tightening that brought inflation down from 9% to 2.4% in two and a quarter of
years ended in September 2024 and the resulting disinflation has stopped as well.
So here's a picture of the Fed policy rate over the last decade, the target Fed funds
rate up or in lower bounds.
A year ago, we had seen the long pause of the top come to an end with three rate cuts
as inflation eased, but that was followed by another nine-month pause because with unemployment
still low and disinflation-stalled, forecasters worried about tariff-induced rise in inflation.
Tariff effects on prices take time to work through to consumer prices, especially when
anticipation of large tariff hikes led to a surge of imports to build inventories before
the tariffs took effect. With the tariffs filing in place studies from the St. Louis
Fed, Moody's, and others have estimated that tariffs added as much as 0.7 percentage
points to U.S. inflation by late last year. In other words, if not for the tariff hikes
last year, December's inflation reading likely would have been close to the Fed's 2% target
instead of 2.7%. Nevertheless, with the labor market softening, the FOMC soft fit to
cut Fed funds three more times a quarter point each in the last three meetings of last year.
Since the December meeting, the consensus among Fed Watchers has been for another pause.
As of this morning, Fed Fund's futures markets are predicting the next rate cut won't come
until the first meeting under a new Fed Chair in June, with a second cut likely later in
the year probably December.
That would bring us to a target range of 3 to 3.25%.
So at the December meeting, the FOMC decided to pause so-called quantitative tightening,
reducing the Fed balance sheet holdings of longer-term treasury and mortgage securities.
Instead, the Fed plans to purchase $40 billion per month of short-term treasury's
T-bills in what they label reserve management instead of quantitative easing.
Personally, as an economist, I worry that's a distinction without a difference.
and that those smaller than the quantitative easing of the last cycle, this policy together
with further rate cuts and new tariff threats will keep inflation at elevated levels for
a while longer.
Now to some other indicators of where we may be headed, first with a few positives.
This graph shows the Fed's so-called financial soundness indicator for banks.
Banks tier one capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets.
As you can see, bank capital ratios are quite strong.
Banks have been building their capital relative to assets since the disaster of the Great
Recession and have continued to do so since the pandemic.
Consumer financial health is also strong.
Household debt service burdens shown here in blue have risen from pandemic lows when
many households pay down debts with their stimulus checks, but remain at levels last
seen in the late 1990s.
household debt as a percent of GDP in red here has also been declining since the Great
Recession and resumed its decline after the pandemic bringing this measure back to 1999
levels. Consumer loan delinquency rates for both credit cards and mortgages also remain
historically low as due delinquency rates for business loans. So the consumer is still
and good shape financially, and banks are an excellent shape.
Good conditions for avoiding the financial crisis should the economy weaken again.
Can I stop you there and ask the question first?
Yes, please.
Help me understand this.
If I'm reading those lines correctly, you've got household debt,
percentage of income increasing.
You've got household debt as a percentage of GDP decreasing.
The blue line is principal and interest payments on debt, okay, so so they're adding in the interest and that's why it's so much higher
So I'm trying to look at the side here is it saying are you saying that 12% of someone of the average family's income is going to pay the
Interest in the debt right now or is it the 75% which percent matches me that service burden is the left scale
That is a percent of
So the GDP is the right scale so the GDP and the denominator is not personal income
but GDP. So the GDP increasing is what's causing the percentage of household
debts of a client as it relates to GDP. Oh yeah that helps yeah certainly the
average family. But the deserves burden has also gone up because interest rates
have risen. Right. So while we're seeing that red line go down in the microcosm of
a family they're feeling it still. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. But still at
That historically low levels, oh no, as it relates to 2020, maybe?
No, I didn't want to make the graph go back to 40 years ago, but it's basically 1990s levels.
So what would be the average percent of household debt and interest that you normally see around
20% of their home income, because you said if we go back to 1990s, I'm just looking
out the edge over here where the red line is at 14 or 15%. If we went back to you're saying
it's historically low even though it's at 11 and a half, 12% now, what would it be if we
pulled that back and looked over the past 40 years? It would still look low. So the 1990s
were basically, most of the 90s were probably closer to the late teens there in the graph.
There were a few years where it was down closer to 11% like we are now.
And in some of this was anecdotal, I'm not sensing that families are feeling that.
I sense that they're feeling that they're actually under more pressure right now.
I didn't know if the data is showing opposite or the data agrees with the family.
It's less so dead burdens than prices on everything being high.
I'm not putting it on their credit card yet.
We'll see that soon.
Yeah, I mean credit card is included in that household debt number.
It's just not the only thing included there.
This may get a little more toward the affordability question.
This graph, the first thing that, on my list of things to worry about, is shows interest rate
on mortgages, 30-year mortgages, and auto loans, 60-month auto loans.
So as you can see these, they rose quickly in 2022 as the Fed tightened and peaked late
2023, come down a little bit but are still at levels comparable to 2007 and so still relatively
high. Certainly higher than many of us grew accustomed to in the last decade and
the half prior to 2022. High interest rates on mortgages and other consumer
loans are restraining demand. In the case of mortgages, locking homeowners with
3% and 4% mortgages into their current homes. These rates are unlikely to be
coming down much for the time being.
In fact, longer-term treasury rates have been rising lately.
As I noted before, job growth has slowed
and since September turned negative.
In fact, the rate of new hiring by businesses
or total hires as a percent of existing employees.
Over the last 18 months has been at the lowest level
since 2013, reluctance by businesses to hire suggests fewer opportunities to change jobs
for better pay, and that those between jobs will remain unemployed or entering the workforce
will remain unemployed for longer dragging on consumer confidence.
Consumers also still feel squeezed by inflation.
have not really kept up for the average worker, so consumer sentiment is weak. The University
of Michigan consumer sentiment index shown here is sitting at levels typically associated
with recessions. Anything that pushes inflation higher again is likely to make matters worse
for the average consumer.
Well, I lost my notes for this page.
Oh, you're there.
Other issues include business confidence with the conference boards, CO survey finding
that most COs are expecting higher inflation and a slowing economy, also known as stagflation.
64% are expecting that.
On the jobs front again, we still don't have a good idea what impact AI will have on employment.
Some observers suggest that that's been a factor in the job slowdown in the last year.
But like most economists, I think in the long run, the impact will be higher productivity
overall and thus rising incomes.
But there will be some pain in some job classifications for a while.
We also see rising political instability in the world and also here at home.
And finally, we still face risks from trade due to high tariffs, increasing pass-through
of tariff costs to consumers, and just in the last few days, new tariff threats.
Since last January, the net effect of all of the tariff impositions by executive order
And the negotiated rollbacks of some of them
has been an increase in the US average effective tariff rate
on imports coming into the country from 2.4% to 18%
as of October.
The bulk of the cost of these tariffs
fall on US consumers and businesses,
depending on how much cost businesses are willing to absorb
to avoid losing sales over the short term.
Moody's estimates that as of August, 29% of the cost
of these tariffs have been passed on to consumers, 53% have been absorbed by US businesses
harming their profits and only 18% was being absorbed by foreign producers again to avoid losing
sales over the short term. The hit to profitability for US businesses has been blamed for record
business bankruptcies through three quarters of 2025. As time passes, businesses
both domestic and foreign have to pass more of the cost onto consumers to
remain profitable, so we'll see continuing upward pressure on consumer
prices. As time passes, I'm sorry, we also face risk of retaliatory trade
policies or in some cases just to refusal by foreign merchants and consumers to
by or stock US goods.
Large exporting states like Georgia are the ones harmed
the most by that.
Remember we're the 12th largest export state
with exports representing 6.1% of state GDP.
Trade volume through Georgia ports has grown 8.5% per year
since 2003 and reached $250 billion in value in 2024.
We don't have 2025 data for George exports or port activity,
but through November, total U.S. trade is down 5.6%
from the same months in 2024,
with imports down 4.9% and exports falling 7.3%.
So exports are falling faster than imports.
So, summarize the outlook and put it in the context of revenues.
We have a slow down, no recession yet, but slow real GP growth, slow job growth, continued
higher inflation because of tariffs and monetary easing, modest nominal income growth, keeping
Personal income tax collections, flat, even after rate cuts,
slow real income growth, so weak consumer sentiment,
and slower sales tax growth.
Business costs rising, bankruptcies at record levels,
suggesting slower profit growth, and lower corporate
income tax collections after the rate cuts.
We also have lower short-term interest rates
smaller projected balances and undecidated surpluses so interest earnings will continue
to decline for the state.
All of which brings us to the revenue budget, which is conservative as it should be, but
not overly so.
We're projecting a 1.2 percent decline in general fund revenues for the amended fiscal year.
But that puts General Fund revenues 2.2 percent above the original fiscal 2025 budget and
already reflects the 20 basis point rate cut the governor has proposed bringing and corporate
income tax rates down to 4.99 percent starting this year.
That rate cut has only a part year effect on the 26 revenue number taking about 40 basis
points off of the growth rate for the full year. The reason it's so small this year is that
by the time it's enacted and begins reducing withholding an estimated tax payments only a month or
two will be left in the fiscal year. So the effect gets mostly pushed into fiscal 2027,
keeping budgeted general fund revenue growth at a negative 0.4 percent for next year.
Normal growth should resume after that as long-run projections reported in the back of the
budget book show physical 2028 is expected to see about 4 percent general fund revenue growth.
And with that, I will welcome any questions.
I think it would have been a little bit long though.
You got a couple of Dr. Blussman.
First one we'll go, Representative Ridley.
Thank you.
In the book, I've got different glasses, I can't see right now, thank you, it's 393.
It talks about job growth in 2025 and through the first four months of 2025, 2026, it says
the strongest was healthcare, social assistance, it's followed by a local government.
What would your thoughts be on that?
If jobs are starting to follow in manufacturing and other jobs like that, but they're
to produce a more subsidized job.
What's your opinion on economic outlook for jobs?
I'm not sure I follow the question you did.
Well, I'm asking that in the job growth in the book right here,
it's talking about this year that the most job growth
was in healthcare, social assistance, and local government.
Yeah.
Why we lost jobs in manufacturing and other ones.
Usually when you say that, what's your thoughts on when
Do you start seeing more subsidized, low government jobs or government subsidized jobs increasing?
Well, the important point there is the contrast with manufacturing and jobs like that.
The decline in manufacturing jobs is not unique to Georgia, it's been a national trend over the last year.
I mean, I would, like I said, consumer spending particularly for, you know, middle and lower
income households have been slow, so, you know, other than, you know, wealthier households
continuing to purchase that's going to be a drag on producing goods.
Teraf's trade policies have impacted manufacturing.
Like I said, exports year to date through November are down 7.3%, so manufacturers are not
winning.
Okay.
Thank you.
Senator Lucas, is that to you, this got your book good?
Let me ask you, of course, what is your projection of federal funds that we know
I'm to get that we won't get this company? The division directors within
OPB have looked very closely at that and addressed in the budget. Any
you know, critical needs that are likely not to be funded by the federal government
and deciding where we need to backfill, that would be a better question for the different
agency heads as they come through and talk about their budgets.
Well, the reason I ask that question, if we don't get to money, we're going to have to
make it up. And that comes from the amount of money that we have in our reserve.
Well, no, no, no. The critical spending needs where the funds from the federal
government are expected to disappear have been addressed in the budget. I just
can't point you to specific items because, frankly, I'm not an expenditure
side guy. The division directors within OPB and the agency has themselves
be the ones that would be able to answer those questions. It's not in our general fund
revenues, the transfers from the federal government, but general fund revenues have been budgeted
to backfill where the needs were considered critical by the different agencies and the
the governor's office in LPB.
All right, y'all got to mash your buttons
or not mash your buttons.
So y'all are trying to fake me, you know,
represent a fraud.
May I see my time to Senator Payne?
Thank you, Representative.
I swear I am on this committee.
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Bruce
And we've had a lot of discussions for many years
about the notion of lowering the income tax,
eliminating it possibly.
And these discussions, as I'm sure,
your well aware, have ratcheted up over the course
of the last year as all of us search for ways
to make life more affordable for families that feel pinched.
I recall that in a prior position,
you had publicly shared your views
that that would not be a good idea,
that it was an unrealistic talking point
that would almost certainly lead to a massive increase
in the state sales tax.
My question for you is would that still be your view?
And if it's not that you could explain to us
a little bit more why your views would have changed
as we grapple with this issue?
Well, I have no position on the recommendations
of the committee.
If you're asking me as an economist, I think what the governor has been doing in lowering
income tax rates slowly over time as we were able to evaluate how much of our surplus
were structural surpluses is the better way to go.
If you can identify different tax preferences, large tax preferences, tax credits that may
or may not be working, you all recently received another batch of tax incentive evaluations.
So as you all look at those and decide maybe this one should be cut back or that one should
be cut back or this one eliminated, using the revenue gains from that once it's done
to continue to lower rates, I think would be a wonderful thing, reduces the, well, that's
really the supply side approach to tax cuts is a broader base, lower marginal rates,
same revenue.
Thank you.
President, President Walker, Zitchie.
Thank you, Ms. Chairman.
Dr. Bushman, you talked about our low unemployment rate
really historic low.
And I think you said 3.5% and the nation is 4.4% something
like that.
So we're doing really good there.
I have read though that our workforce participation rate continues to decline, especially with
young men.
Do you have any data on that and any thoughts as to why that might be the case?
I did look at that quickly when I was thinking about what to put in here and what to not
put in here, but I don't recall any specifics about the labor force participation rate.
I don't know that the labor force overall has not been growing all that quickly.
So that's, you know, lack of labor force growth is going to make it difficult to add jobs
in the economy.
But unemployment is still low, so people who are already here and in the labor force
Sir, you know, all but three and a half percent of them are doing pretty well.
Would you send me whatever data you have on the labor force participation?
Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Chairman, can I ask one more question?
Sir.
Going back to your slide on the FY26 withholding, I think it was.
you said withholding was up 4% no point 4 okay thank you I forget now yeah
the slide said point 4 and I thank you said 4% I just wondered which was yeah
it's point 4 so it's flat more or less flat on the F526 withholding
We do have at least one more question.
Sorry.
Chairman Carpenter.
Thank you, Chairman.
So real quick, because you're painting a picture and I need an explanation.
So you're saying the bank's balance sheets are great.
Consumer balance sheets are great.
Unemployment is low.
But yet, consumer sentiment is down to the lowest since the 60s.
What is, can we attribute that to social media?
What's driving that sentiment when all other factors
are pointing to things are in pretty good shape
if everybody would just take a deep breath?
Well, I suppose that social media is at least partly
to blame for, you know, people just generally being
uncomfortable about the direction of the country.
for me either side, but I think the real problem is that incomes for
motion-Americans have not really kept up with inflation over the recent years,
have not really caught back to higher prices.
So would it be fair to say if inflation, if we can get our hands around inflation
and continue to drive it down,
then things should be on the up for folks,
for opportunity, for investment, et cetera.
All else the same.
All else the same.
Yeah.
All right, thank you, Dr. Wiesman.
Thank you.
We're going to move on to Commissioner of Economic Development,
Pat Wilson.
Do you want that picture right away or do you want to call for it?
All right, if you're leaving, please hurry up and leave so we can get going.
We're already 15 minutes behind and turn the volume down a little bit, please.
Thank you for being here today and not in Davos well, thank you for allowing us to be here today and not in Davos. It's cold over there.
People might throw things at you today, but be careful.
A little closer than usual.
All right, four years.
Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery, members of the Appropriations Committee, and Dean Green,
Happy Birthday.
Y'all, thank you for today, thank you for your time, thank you for what you do for the
people of Georgia in creating a budget that is conservative,
that has the ideals of the people of Georgia,
and really the focus that we need in order
to continue to be successful.
And I want to start by talking a little bit
about last year.
And I know we just heard from our good friend, the economist.
And it seems to be the most predicted recession
in the history of the United States,
but if you look at the numbers,
and anecdotally, the things that we see
on the ground across the state of Georgia,
we are in a very healthy state.
We've got a healthy economy.
We have some amazing things going on,
and what is fantastic about what we're doing
and what we're seeing is that it's happening
in every corner of the state.
We'll touch on a few numbers from last year first.
Tourism, an amazing year in tourism.
82 billion dollar impact for the tourism industry
has on the economy of the state of Georgia.
174 million visitors came to the state last year.
Trade for the fourth year in a row,
given all the global headwinds and everything
we see geopolitically, for the fourth year in a row,
we broke our record on exports out of the state of Georgia.
$53.1 billion in exports coming out of Georgia.
Our global commerce team, 23,000 new jobs
that we announced last year,
that we broke our record in investment,
$26.3 billion of a new investment to the state.
Our centers of innovation work with 441 small businesses
last year.
That's another record for businesses served, film.
And while the industry, I'm sure we've all heard,
the industry is down overall nationwide.
We had the most successful series,
wrap in Georgia last year, and that was Stranger Things.
And y'all may have seen it is literally everywhere.
They hired 3,700 Georgians last year
for 890 days of filming with a payroll,
just of local Georgia crew,
a payroll of $298 million.
And y'all know payroll is not something
that necessarily goes right into the bank.
That's somebody's little league fees,
that's your mortgage, that's your car payment.
That is all over the state of Georgia.
And then finally, our Georgia Council for the Arts,
we administered 363 grants last year.
But what I love the most is it went to 151 different counties.
That is a statewide impact.
and that's something that we're very proud of.
But what I want to take a quick look back on,
and I love following Governor Kemp this morning,
the his administration, when we walk out
of his administration, we're gonna say
that the previous decade in the state of Georgia
was the most successful, most prosperous decade
in the history of the state when it comes to job growth,
economic diversity, growing our manufacturing base,
and the numbers prove it.
But what's amazing, and in his state of the state,
he talked about this, this is just our department.
This is not count organic growth that has happened
in the state.
We've announced 219,000 new jobs in the state of Georgia
in his seven years.
118 billion dollars of new investment in his seven years.
years. And what is amazing about that is 64% of those jobs went to the state outside of
Metro Atlanta. 74% of the investment was outside of Metro Atlanta. That's pretty amazing.
And that's just what we touched. That does not count, again, all the organic growth that's
happening right here in the state. And so while we can say thanks, it really is everybody
this room, you guys have been a part of that story. And I've had the benefit of now working for
three governors. I have worked with multiple speakers and General Assembly members. It's a
partnership and it's a partnership that this state has benefited from because we've made the
state of Georgia the best place in the nation to do business together. You guys have supported
great public policy. You've budgeted fiscally well, you've managed us through
crisis and I've lived through the recession and then the and then COVID we've
watched all that happen and this partnership between the General Assembly and
the governor's office has really made Georgia the success story that is today.
So this is just a way to say thank you to you guys for being great partners and
we look forward to where we're going to go in the future.
So onto the governor's amended budget, the new budget, the big budget is not, there's
nothing really for us to talk about there because it is exactly the same as last year.
But the amended budget is exciting because the governor made an ad to our marketing for
the first time in a very long time.
And so if you look in section 429 under our departmental administration, the governor
added $3 million to promote Georgia tourism, update agency marketing materials, and enhance
business recruitment efforts.
So as many of you know, this is an unprecedented opportunity year for us to make an impression
on people coming to the state of Georgia.
The General Assembly and the Governor have worked to support the FIFA World Cup, which
is coming to Georgia this summer.
And this addition to our budget is a way that we can maximize that effort and make sure
number one that people who come to Georgia want to come back.
That we show them the diversity, the amazing assets that this state has, that we bring
the 158 other counties into Atlanta
to help them market themselves so that when people
have a great time here, they wanna come back
and they wanna spend money.
And so the money for in the amended budget will go toward
what I think is an amazing idea from our friends
of the Georgia World Congress Center
to create an activation at the World Congress Center
where we will basically create a trade show
to highlight the state of Georgia.
So if you have a captive audience,
and it is July in Georgia, and it is hot,
and people need a break, they need air conditioning,
they need a water, or a beer, or something,
we're gonna create a space for them
in the World Congress Center,
so that they can come and stop,
and know why we've got you captive,
Let me show you a little bit about our state parks.
Let me show you a little bit about Providence Canyon.
Have you seen Smith Goldwoods?
Let me show you a little bit about the Golden Isles.
Have you seen Tubing in Delanaga?
There's so many amazing things in this state
that we can highlight, and we want you to come back
and experience it after you've had a great time
watching a match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
And so this is a little bit,
This is a trade show concept that we're talking about
putting on in the World Congress Center.
And Kevin and the team are going to give the state,
give us the space free of charge,
because nobody can be in it.
It's inside the security perimeter.
Only people who are there for the match can participate.
And then we will invite communities to set up a booth,
to have an activation, Georgia businesses to come
and participate if you're ASW and you want to have a cocktail
or if you're a Georgia beer company from Valdasin,
you want to put a beer stand there.
We're trying to figure out ways
that we can highlight the great assets of the state of Georgia.
Put them right here, make it easy for people to experience
and do that in a way where all the counties
can participate if they want to.
And so the only buy-in from the counties
is what you want to put in that space.
And so we're excited about that opportunity
This money will allow us to do that in support of the counties.
The other things that we are expecting that we would spend that on our website upgrades,
we have got to do a better job of marketing our assets and our communities on our website,
make it easy to find, easy to search, so that all of the things that we are doing here
are also findable on the website, and then finally business recruitment.
advantage of this year and looking at who are the companies that are going to be
coming and participating in the World Cup, how can we grab them, how can we get
their attention, and how can we focus on sewing Georgia, continuing to sell
Georgia. And so just a little context there on this ad in the budget. We went
back and looked at previous years' budgets. So 2008 was the first year when I
I worked for Sonny Perdue that I presented a budget to the General Assembly with him and
we worked on getting that budget passed.
At the department in 2008 that year, our budget was $38 million.
Our marketing budget was a large percentage of that.
It was $17.9 million in 2008.
2026 our department budget is 32 million dollars and our marketing budget is 8 million dollars and so if you look at the the difference there
We've gone through a recession. We've gone through COVID. There were cuts. There were needy cuts the mark the dot the the office is overall the department is smaller
We have fewer people
But I'd still think it's the best bang for your buck and stay government
And so this $3 million will allow us to really come back and do some things in this unprecedented
year to really highlight the state and grab folks and bring them back to Georgia.
There's a second ad in our budget that I wanted to point out too.
In the under-tourism, the governor added $110,000 that goes to the Georgia Humanities to really
focus on the America 250th anniversary. And so this is an amazing year. I vaguely
remember 1976, mainly remember it from my grandfather, my great-grandfather
giving me silver dollars with the commemorative backing. But this is an
amazing opportunity for us to share what America means. And us is one of the
13 original colonies capturing to us that are coming to to to events celebrating the 250th.
And so one of the things that we have the governor did and we partnered with is working with
Georgia Humanities and the Georgia Historical Society to really highlight the 250th. And Todd
Gross has done an amazing job with the Historical Society. The Mary Warn is our executive director
of the Georgia Humanities. She married you a year in now, a little over a year in.
Humanities does a terrific job of selling who we are as Georgians, capturing that and
giving it back to whether it's students or whether it's everyday Georgians to highlight
what makes us unique about being a Georgian. And so we're all the three entities are on the
Georgia America 250 commission that was put together by the governor and we are working
together to focus on pushing out all the content that your communities are doing to highlight
the 250th and we're very excited about that that $110,000 I think will be very impactful
to help us do that and so with that chairman that's really all I have in my budget and
happy to take any questions. Thank you, Commissioner Wilson. We got a great
story to tell in the state, a great story to celebrate about our country this
year. Chairman Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner, thank you for being
here today and the great work the department has done all across our state and
continue work that we will do over the coming years. With a 3 million in the
amended budget is I think you answered it but would that specifically go to the
promotion of broker? Not all of it but yeah part of that will and so chairman
what we envision is you know that that money in several different
tranches one is ad campaigns drive time drive time locations I mean we have to
spend it this year and so we have to really push it out but you know this is
not because it's not an every year ad it is something that we need to be
impactful quick and so yes a lot of it will go toward that but not all of it
thank you sir and mr. Chairman one additional question and thank you for the
comment you made about what y'all were working toward to bring communities
from around our state to Atlanta to interact those that were here for the
games, as you know, over the past several meetings that we've had, we've expressed
interest in making sure that all of Georgia benefits from the World Cup games being
here.
And you briefly mentioned America 250 and humanities being brought in to kind of be a part
of that.
Are there any other specific plans that have been made at least at this point as we begin
the 250th celebration?
Mary, do you want to talk a little bit about it?
Thank you so much.
So I will highlight a couple of the programs that we are working on.
It is our 50-50 year at Georgie Manny's, which is very exciting.
So as we approach the 250th anniversary, we're uniquely positioned to roll out programming
across the state.
So the first thing we're focusing on is America 250 grants.
We've gotten state funding for most of the time that we've been in existence and we're
We're very agile pushing that money out to local communities.
We are also starting this year, a new America 250 legacy program called The Georgia Circuit,
which is a speaker's bureau where communities, local libraries, museums can have speakers,
historians, artists, etc. come to their communities.
And another big initiative we have is a museum on Main Street, which specifically addresses
rural and small communities, and we bring a national level exhibit that is grounded in
the American Revolution to those communities.
And we also have 15,000 students every year participate in National History Day, Georgia.
And this year, the focus is revolution, reaction, and reform in history.
So we're really excited to get young students interested in this moment in time.
Thank you, ma'am.
And thank you, Commissioner, and the great work that you're doing as we continue to bring
some great, uh, great events to our state. Thank you, Chair.
So there's five lights blinking and I will request everyone. Don't tell a story,
ask a question. And if the respondent can answer the question quickly,
Chairman Hubsteadler. Thank you. And thank you Commissioner Wilson for your work around the
state, particularly in my district. As you probably know, last April, I'd
ordered a study on the data center exemption, which the audits had UGA
do. And it shows this year that we're going to give out about 625 million
with potentially a lot of local property tax revenue, but very little
state revenue. But my question is, I'm hearing that they're also getting the
manufacturing credit and the high-tech computer equipment credit. My
question is, are you aware of this or what extent that would be?
Chairman, I'm not aware of that and I think, you know, our friends at the Department of Revenue could probably answer it better.
We generally do not work data center projects because they are coming to Georgia.
We kind of send them to the utilities.
Thank you.
Representative Heagley.
Wasn't it was Don Zella?
Sorry.
I know it's gonna be Buckner.
Sorry.
I'm trying to figure out who's called on apologize.
Well, first of all, I want to say hooray for a family marketing Georgia having a background
in marketing.
I know how much we need that and I get so tired of being in the Columbus market hearing
about Robert Jones golf courses.
But I do have a little beef.
I did hope that there will be some marketing done
other than the great work that's being done
by the Georgia Historical Society about America 250.
America 250 is this year.
It's not something we should have been planning
three years ago when it was first brought up.
And I'm just hoping that we'll do a better job
because South Carolina is doing a much better job
than Georgia on the celebrations of America 250.
Well, that's what this $110,000 is going to go toward.
And we'll make use of some of the other funding
that we get out of the amended budget for that as well.
But thank you for that.
It's very important.
And we're 100% behind that effort
and we'll definitely be picking things up this year.
Very quickly.
Senator Harbson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Wilson, for your input.
I was wondering to thank, first of all,
I just like to say the marketing budget seemed to be really low because of the job you have to do all of the greater
traction across the state of Georgia, especially in Columbus, Georgia, the longest urban rapids spring
awful house and the mommy and the house and things like that. So I just wanted to make you for doing that particular work and the
strange to things that success is great.
But I wanted to say one thing, the $298 million
is that a level of figure we get in compared to other years?
Is that going down, coming up in a mask embedded
in the context of, I'm saying some people have moved off
shore way from Georgia.
Can you expand on that?
On the film industry?
So that 298 million was specific to Stranger Things.
And so that is just, and so that is a record
for any show that is filmed in the state of Georgia.
But that show wrapped, and so now we'll move on
to the next show.
But if you look at film spending overall,
our hot point was $4.4 billion, which was in 2023.
And so this year, I believe we're at $2.4 billion.
So there was a significant drop.
But I think what you're seeing is a reset in the industry.
And it's not that they're going back to California.
They're not going to New York.
It's that it's cheaper to film in Canada and the UK
because of the teamsters contract that really
has raised the cost of filming in the United States,
but really specifically in Georgia.
And so we are going to see a reset
where Georgia becomes, I think, the hub of shows,
and we'll see more and more shows like stranger things
that come, and the impact of a show is massive.
You know, we still see people going all over the state to, you know, to experience
stranger things, going to Rome to, you know, the Vecna's house.
You know, there's a lot of stuff lingering impact from shows.
And so, while it's down, it's still significantly more than it's been, you know, for years and
years.
Well, thank you very much.
I certainly would invite you to come down and shoot those rapids.
I've done it.
It's fantastic.
Yeah.
I understand your answer to Senator Hubsteader that you do not support incentives for data centers
across Georgia.
No, it's just that we don't work the projects and so I don't know what they're leveraging
to come to Georgia.
do you support a moratorium on granting data senate permits given the tension around
issues? Well, you know, we are a, we are not a policy making agency and so we just live
within the rules that the governor and general assembly set and so, you know, as long as
it's a community wants them and as long as, as long as they want to be in Georgia, then
and it's hard for us to say no.
Representative Synez, thank you Mr. Truman.
Can we share a appreciate knowing the innovative ways
we're spending tourism dollars now?
Does the department have any figures on where we rank
in terms of total tourism dollars
among our other neighbors, states and the South?
And what the second part of that would be,
what investment we get back from those dollars?
Sure, we can pull that for you.
It's really a hard, it's hard to compare apples to apples
when it comes to tourism.
And we have community spending at a level
that is different than many of our states,
like Savannah's a great example.
Columbus is a great example.
Some of the shining stars in tourism,
they spend a huge amount of money too.
And so we were able to leverage that together
and we worked together.
And that's kind of what we were trying to do here,
is leverage our communities as well,
and we work together.
So many times when you look at just state spending
and tourism, the number of what's low,
but if you look at us with our partners,
it is very comparable to many of our surrounding states.
Okay guys, we gotta try to stay on schedule.
Commissioner, thanks.
I don't know, I wanna make sure I understood two things.
did you say how many what was our tourism number 140 million the number of
folks who visited 74 million people and that we do cat in the folks coming
through heart store that number right yes that's about a hundred million
of those right 117 around the state we got about 70 60 other million yeah
depending on you know yes rough yeah and then the three million you talked
about for transportation we got it in admin would there be a problem or not
transportation. Sorry, that's the next guy. Tourism. Would there be a problem with
that admin money moving to tourism since it's for tourism? Well, it's not all
for tourism and keeping it admin gives us flexibility to do website
utilization and also as the governor put in their business recruitment too.
So it wouldn't go to tourism. All three men. It's not all three million is
for tourism but the majority is for tourism but you know there are things like
and as Chairman Biggs mentioned are there things that will live on one of the
things that will is revamping the website and continuing to make that website
better. Those things work for all divisions and so that's why I've
been in administrative administration gives us more flexibility on where
that can go and how we can use it. We can give you a very detailed breakdown
down with some of the things we're looking at, Chairman.
Thanks.
Thank you.
On the other side of the question.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Commissioner McMurray, DOT.
See, I just don't think I envision a world where we give another remark to the rest of the world.
What does that thing mean?
All right, we've got to keep moving, folks.
Turn to Rumble now, please.
Commission McMurray.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for this opportunity to present the amended FY 26 and 27 budget recommendations
on behalf of G.Dott.
Certainly want to acknowledge our board state transportation board chairman Jamie Bosel
from the 10th Congressional Districts here, came all the way from Athens, Georgia this
morning.
Thank you.
As I was preparing for this presentation, a quote came to mind, one of my favorite quotes
about leadership, and it says of leadership, one must first acknowledge his or her reality.
So with that, I want to share some realities as it relates to transportation in the budget.
You've heard from the governor, the economist, and Pat Wilson now about some of the great
economic successes of the state in sort of where we are.
I want to pull that together as it relates to transportation and talk about some of those
realities.
In fact, Pat should have used this slide.
I stole it right off his website showing the great economic success we've had.
How does that relate to transportation?
Well, every economic success of a new business relies on the transportation network.
And this slide does not even include Hyundai or Vivian and some of the other advanced manufacturing
that's going on across this entire state like Pat talked about how much work, how much
new work is being created outside of Atlanta.
Well, listen, every one of those businesses relies on a road, a rail, an airport, a seaport
or a now inland port as well, or they may cross multiple modes, so you can see that economic
development and transportation are joined at the hip.
Another reality we must acknowledge is Georgia's growing.
In fact, Georgia Chambers predicts about 2.5 million more people by the year 2050, and
to give you some perspective of that who's been to Houston metro area.
That's the equivalent of dropping Houston, Texas metro area into the state of Georgia in
the next 24 years.
In that population growth is going to happen all across the state, but very specifically
in sort of the northeast metro, sort of the 4575-75 corridor, when more population becomes
more demands on our transportation system.
Another reality we need to acknowledge.
The business growth, especially with manufacturing and ag business growth, and you talked about
the governor, talked about the investment in our timber industry, which is critical to
this state, becomes freight growth because we all like to buy stuff, have it on our doorstep
in the morning, and best I can check, we all like to eat well too, and I'm cognizant
of the hours it relates to eating.
This chart shows 2015 to 2050, the left side shows the increased and tonnage of freight
that's moved on roads and railways and Georgia.
The simple math is freight tonnish almost doubles
from 2015 to 2050.
I say I'll call that having double vision.
If you see a truck today by 2050,
there'll be two trucks there.
The chart on the right gives you the cost of congestion
because of without significant investment in our roadways
and that number of more than doubles.
And it's broken down by agribusiness,
distribution, and manufacturing.
So you can see the inputs of not investing
has a negative impact on the bottom line.
And again, these charts were developed
before Hyundai and Rivian were even done or underway.
So our planning director is working to update
our freight charts and we'll get more information,
but you can see the significance.
Let me share another reality with you.
And this is a little bit deep.
I understand the economists you've already had
of full day of economy and economic inputs,
but this one really tells to tell.
This is the national highway construction cost index.
The red line is the 50 states actual bid prices
over the last few years, starting in 2020,
going through calendar year 2024.
And that's indexed to other things,
such as CPI, which is the green line.
We all talk about CPI as an indicator, right?
We all understand CPI, but I think you can see
the red line is outpacing CPI.
The employment cost index is the yellow dash lines
sort of to the bottom there.
And again, the last one is the blue line,
which is the producer price index,
which is really indicator,
show and cover industries like manufacturing, mining
and agriculture, and it's always a good leading indicator.
So the national reality is here
that the cost of construction is,
the increased cost is outpaced all those things.
So it's sort of an interesting thing.
I've showed this slide many times,
and the trend has, this data goes through 2024.
The trend is ticking down just a little bit,
but it's not coming down fast at all.
Now this is national information.
Let me drive this home closer to us here in Georgia
and show you from 2021 to FY 2025,
what the cost to do in business have become.
You can see that resurfacing a two-lane road
has increased by 51% and that's now about 251,000 miles
for a two lane road.
This number is for just one lane.
You can see that urban widening and widening
of a road in a rural area from a two lane to a four lane
has almost double, both 90% to 99% cost increase
over those four physical years.
Replacing our bridges, 93% cost increase
for the bridge projects.
And I want you to remember that data point
because I'm gonna come back to it in a minute.
And the bottom table really just shows you
what some of the commodities are
that make the bigger projects
and what those cost increases are.
Asphalt up about 60% aggregate gravel if you will,
62% gargrel, metal, 35%
and the beans necessary to do a bridge
is about 45% increase.
So that's the reality that we've faced here in Georgia.
And now we've taken our state budget
for the last, back to 2020, and indexed it to that national highway construction cost
index line to see how is Georgia keeping pace with these increase cost and the difference
tells the story, right?
We all know that.
We've all experienced in our personal life.
And the reality are that the cost are outpaced in the revenues.
And that's at the state level, and guess what?
At the federal level too.
In fact, with the federal continuing resolution budgets that we have, there is absolutely
We know we increase in federal budget for the last two years and looks like we're headed
to another continuing resolution for transportation.
Hopefully this week or next week about Congress, but we expect that investment to be flat.
Now what does all this really mean?
It means as we plan projects, projects get delayed because unlike Washington, we do have to
live in physical constraint.
And so our state transportation improvement plan, which is our four-year physically constrained
program are so impacted. When costs go up, you basically deliver a project that's physically
constraint, you have to move a project to the next year. And when you move it into the
next year, like the graphic shows, it pushes another project out and another project gets
cascaded into another year. So, projects gets cascaded into the future. And we never
like having to tell any of you that your project has now been moved out, because I'm pretty
sure that in each of your districts, that's the number one project. And I've got to
fill in that your number one project is probably more important than your
colleague in another district's number one project. At least that's what
you'll tell me, okay? So we understand the pain of that when that happens, but
that's the reality we have. But listen, I'm here to give you some good news. The
reality of what Governor Kim has done in the leadership of this committee and
and our other subcommittees on appropriations.
Over the last two years has made a big
and marked difference for Georgia.
In fact, to make Georgia's last better.
And I want to acknowledge that reality
with you and show you what that looks like.
So we went back to the same National Highway
Construction Cost Index, the blue line,
to show you what the inflationary reality has been.
But when we go back to amend it 24 and amend it 25,
with a 1.5 billion additional state general funds
twenty four in the additional billion dollars in the minute twenty five. You can see what
that's done. That's right sized us to get ahead of that inflation area impact. Now that
doesn't mean we go back and we solved all our problems but it means that we are now
gaining ground instead of continuing to lose ground and that really has been important
for us to move projects ahead. So let me remind you how we views those dollars. Going
back to amended 24 and 25, a big investment in airport aid at 98 million dollars, about
half of that is to do a replacement airport in Griffin, that we would have lost federal
aviation administration money if we did not have the money in that budget year and then
to address airports all around the state. The 250 million each year in local roads administration
has been huge. I have had no city or county complain whatsoever about getting that additional
money. That you have either. Freight program, $500 million in each year. I'm
gonna take a little bit deeper dive into freight in a minute. Capital
construction, $593 million in the minute, 24. Again, because projects cost more
and we were in physical constraint, we were pushing projects out. In fact, we
were able to advance 44 projects. Bring them ahead. 25 projects we were brought
ahead because there was not funding for it. And we created and started 19 other
projects that we would not have the money to start on that you know that need
to be done without it. Basically those 25 projects we were able to advance we
brought them up 40 project years. So if a project moved up two years we called
that two project years. So those 25 projects advanced 40 project years. In just
the inflationary cost range by accelerating those projects save 75 million to
300 million because we could do them now and not later with inflation where
inflation as cost. Capital maintenance, again, I showed you that maintenance cost,
repaving had increased by about 51 percent. Again, $50 million to help drive toward getting
that better. And last but not least, let me just say thank you again for last year for
the Hurricane Debbie and Hurricane Helene funding. That $200 million was vital that we could
again, contract and use our crews to clean up from that devastating storms.
Just a note, a footnote this is we've got less than $50 million reimbursement from FEMA
so far.
So we'll keep you posted on as those reimbursements come in.
Now let me show you how we put that money to work because that is tremendous investment
that you've chose to make and amend it 24 and 25.
We can see that 100% of our capital maintenance money has been expense.
This means this money has been paid out to contractors and vendors.
construction and we're about 69 percent of that money going out the door for work being
done.
And then the last two are amended 24 and 25 for freight.
I remind you that we did not have a state freight program until a couple years ago and
we certainly appreciate both the House and Senate Transportation Committees for bringing
that forward and you passing that.
And so we created a new program that we stood up and we have advanced 24 projects for
that $500 million in each year.
Now you can see that expenditure is a little slow, but that's because we didn't even have
that program and we started projects and moving projects forward that otherwise we would
not have.
And let me show you where the big three are that consume about $725 million of those
dollars.
One is the wide 916.
By the way, these next three projects all would be under contract this calendar year,
so we're very excited.
It's about $516, $520 million from 24 and 25 funds to widen 31 miles of I-16 up to the
Hyundai Meta Plant.
We know there's 23% trucks on that.
That's a high number by the way, 23% trucks on their states are very high number and we
know that widening I-16 will reduce delay by about 56%.
We're going to do this very innovative, we're going to let the contractors bid as far as
the money will go.
Instead of telling them to build A to B, we're going to say here's how much money can
and you build C to D to E and we'll bid that this summer.
Again, I-95, widening I-95 in Savannah
from I-16 to South Carolina.
South Carolina is widening to eight lanes right now.
We will take 95 to eight lanes as well.
That's about $74, $75 million investment,
again, bids this year.
And lastly, state route 96,
which will complete the last nine miles
of a 25 mile corridor that goes from I-75
over to I-16 there in Houston and Twix County.
We plan to bid this project in June
and we'll complete that four-lane crossing south of making.
There's not a lot of east-west freight corridor connectivity
south of making and this project does that.
So that will consume the remaining amount
of those prior year appropriations
and we're very excited to get that out.
But building on amended 24 and building on amended 25,
I am so grateful and thankful for the governor
making a recommendation of a historic $2.3 billion
of state general fund strategic investment in our budget.
So let's take a look about what those items are.
The first is $100 million to address rural bridge projects
that support agribusiness in the timber industry
across our state.
These funds will be used to address those rural bridges
that are ready to be bid, but we didn't have the money.
Remember that 91% or 93% cost increase in bridges
over the last five years.
So we are working on bridges that they're stacking up,
if you will, that we would not be able to advance
otherwise without this $100 million.
Now give you a data point.
The average bridge cross is about $6.8 million.
So some smaller rural bridges or less,
but the average is about $6.8 million.
Next, let's move over to state route 316,
that 40-some odd mile corridor from Gwinnett County,
I-85 all the way to Athens, Georgia,
University Parkway.
Traffic on that varies anywhere from about 30,000
to up to 108,000 vehicles per day,
with about 12% trucks.
Now, the thing about 316 that you all know
is there's a lot of crashes.
In fact, about 1,300 crashes per year.
In fact, six of the intersections on state route 316
are in our top 50 highest crash locations in the state
and three more crack at the top 100.
That's not the list you want to be on.
The other thing we see is when the crashes happen,
are very severe. In fact, four intersections have higher crash severity than anywhere else
in the state, and one of them is almost double their severity index, which is not a good
thing. Listen, if you've driven 316 lately, you can see that we have 18 intersections being
converted to either interchanges overpasses or a better access point along the way, but
this $200 million to Governor put in the budget is absolutely vital for us to be able to
to work toward addressing the remaining 13 intersections
that need to be addressed to complete that corridor.
So we're very excited and thankful that this corridor
ultimately can be converted to very similar
to like an interstator or freeway top experience
to get you back and forth from Atlanta
to Athens along the University of Parkway.
Next, again, for GMA and ACCG, a home run,
another $250 million, which basically is
double the local maintenance improvement grant money.
Again, we have been using this.
The cities and counties have been using this primarily
for resurfacing because of that data point I told you.
They're able to basically continue to resurface
their programs across the state for cities and counties.
The other thing we've been committed to
is get these dollars out quickly.
So we do this through electronic application process
and the cities and counties since our list,
we get the money out very quickly.
We want to make sure that these dollars
be in deployed across the state. Next is a big project. Has anybody ever experienced
express lanes on ICME 5 South and Henry County going the wrong way for you? Yes, okay.
All right, we'll move to the next slide. No, I'm just kidding. No, I'm just kidding.
Yeah. Chair McCarpner, I wonder how can you be wrong every time? Because I flipped the
coin and I'm not very lucky. But listen, post-panned different traffic patterns really change.
In the middle of the day, there's no longer a trough where traffic patterns dip down
and pick back up in the afternoon.
They build in the morning, they just keep building all through the day, really change things
around.
Listen, almost 200,000 vehicles per day, 20 to 25 percent trucks, you know it, you see
it.
Everybody experiences his corridor.
This segment of I-75, in fact, rate at the 12th most congested freight bottleneck in
the nation.
Another list we don't want to be on, you know it, you experience.
So currently, like I say, how can you be wrong half the time?
Well, 45 to 50% of the time, you can't get the traffic
in the direction it needs to go.
So what our plan is, is we take, instead of two lanes
reversible, you'll have two lanes in both directions
along that corridor in Clayton and Henry County.
So there's always going in the right direction for you.
We know by doing that, that 70% more people can utilize
the lanes or 70% more people can travel through that
in corridor, whether you're using the lanes or not,
because it becomes less congested.
Mr. Commissioner.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
How far south are you going with that?
I'm assuming Dublin would be a good answer.
Oh, great.
All the way to making would be nice.
Do we know how far south we can take it?
So yeah, thank you for that question.
Let me tell you what this money does,
because that is an important aspect of what we can do.
Is this money is a big number.
This would be real candid.
It's a big number.
This money's going to basically help us design it,
do the permitting, we have to buy property,
and goes toward construction.
So we will be working with SIRTA, the toll authority,
this is in payments to SIRTA,
so we'll work with the toll authority
to figure out how do we optimize these dollars,
because you will need more dollars than this
to actually build the entire project.
And what we want to do is make it go as far south as we can
and we'll look at limits on both the north and the south side,
But this dollars gives us the ability to basically leverage these dollars to go further.
And that's what our intent is to do.
We know we know where traffic stops down at Bill Gardner Parkway on 155 coming in.
And we know that you're stuck getting going south as well.
But these dollars are absolutely critical.
I'd say it's the minimum amount too that's necessary to give us confidence that we can advance this project.
So let me get into the budget now.
And I know it's, I'm trying to get you way back on schedule.
We're going to jump into the actual budget now that I just want to hit those again.
I thank Big Thanks for Governor for the State General Funds to do some amazing things for Georgia.
Here's just the overall look at Amendit 26.
So Amendit's book page 39.
Basically, it's a true up-and-ex size tax.
It calls the 26 Amendits based on the 25 actual collections.
So it was collected in 25's, appropriate at 26.
that's been trued up, $71.7 million,
and you can see the $2.3 billion in state general funds
I've talked about.
I always like to show this slide.
This shows where the money goes.
Where is this money being investment?
Well, obviously the payments to SIRTA
is the express lane project that I just talked about
at Louver 1.8 and all the end payments to SIRTA.
Capital projects, again, 34% routine maintenance,
11%, and then you see general operations
about 6% on down the line.
But I just want to show you where that money goes.
Let's jump into the budget itself.
If you look at page 361, you'll see
there are major changes in the budget.
Let me say this too.
Let me say a thank you for the governor
putting in the $2,000 one-time pace supplement
to our employees.
We had a lot of dedicated employees working
in the wee hours of Saturday night into Sunday morning
so that you could be here today.
We clear all that snow out just amazingly.
Thanks for the sun.
I would appreciate that.
You can see that our bond debt's going down a little bit,
which is good.
I just want to highlight the capital construction.
That shows the $200 million for $316 added
into capital construction, plus about $37 million of X size.
So we took the X size, that additional X size,
and the mended, put it into capital construction.
State general, excuse me, in capital maintenance,
you can see $100 million for the bridge replacements
that I talked about, shown up there in capital maintenance
as well.
On the next slide, I'll just jump into these,
highlight a few things, which is on page 362,
the L-MIG increase, about $7 million again,
add it to L-MIG because of the increase in exercise
to our budget.
You can see the $250 million of local roads
and administration that I talked about.
And then really important is routine maintenance.
Again, the men and women out in G.DOT
taking care of our roadways and road size
and our contractors that we do.
We add at $21 million to that,
to again deal with increased cost
and maintenance contracting and just increased material cost.
And also that has about 4.3 million of the state
one time funding for employees of $2,000 supplement in there.
So you can see what that increase is.
And of course lastly, as the big one is the 1.796 million
and additional funding for the payments to serve
for the 75 South Express lane.
Let me jump into 2027 very quickly.
This is tab-tabilized on page 41, it's basically the excise as the estimate of where collections
are forecast to go at 2.6 billion.
Transportation trust fees, trust fund fees are based on 25 actual appropriations, so
that's getting rectified, so what was appropriate at last year being brought into the mended
budget, which added 15.5 million.
transit trust fund fees, those are those rideshare car service fees, at $3.8 million ad based
on collections and FY25. The reduction in state general funds or a combination of the
several things, but part of that is a little bit of reduction in diesel locomotive excise
tax, but it recommends a total increase of $148.2 million to the base budget for a grand
total of $2.946 billion. Again, this slide shows where is the money being used. Very similar.
Obviously, the payments to SIRD will not go down because the 75 South Express lanes are not in
there, but you can see 53 percent of the budget is in the capital programs. 20 percent's in maintenance,
10.5 percent's in general obligations and 10 percent's L-mig, but just showing you where the money's
going. Very quickly, if you turn over to page 363, I'm just going to highlight two things. Capital
construction. The increased X size, we put 112 million into, excuse me, increased 112
million and X size was 98.7 million to the capital construction program and then 14.5 for
additional cost increases as well. And then at the very bottom, you can see the rail.
I can show you that again, a little bit of the diesel tax on locomotive diesel reduced.
Now all the negatives on this chart are mainly due to the reduction in state health benefit
rate changes, so I'm not going through all that.
If you see a deduction, that's usually where it's tied to.
And all those deductions were put back in the capital construction.
On the next slide, just again, Elmig got the increase there to be 10% of exercise collection.
If you go to page 366, you can see routine maintenance, again, $33.5 million at it for
the increase cost just trying to take care of doing the business and I just want to highlight
traffic management 4.4 million dollar increase that's dealing with increase cost that we have
had last year or in the current budget year there was a 2.3 million dollar decrease for the
state health benefit plan but also we've experienced our contracting for our TMC when you call
five one one those are all contracting employees and so that has gone up as
well as our ITS it's a camera signs technology just like your cell phone bill
and cable bill keeps going up our costs go up on those things too we lose a lot
of technology to keep people moving so in conclusion I just want to thank the
governor for his budget proposal that absolutely moves Georgia forward for us
to remain our number one state to do business as transportation so
vitally imported to our business of Georgia. I really appreciate your support of
the State General Fund over the last two budget years. I wanted to demonstrate
where those dollars are being used and that the dollars are absolutely being
used that are making lives better for all Georgians no matter where they live.
This is across all of Georgia and I just want to pledge to you is that through
this budget you can count on G.Dot to get it done. So with that I'll be glad to
entertain any questions or comments and oh the last thing is to quote I love
this quote because you you make this possible. The future is not something we
enter, the future is something we create. So thank you for giving us the ability
to create the future that all Georgians want. Thank you so much.
The longer you talk, the more light it started blinking.
Chairman Ron Stevens, is that you? Okay, Mr. Chairman's askers.
We're sharing Mr. Chairman. If I may, I'd like to take a moment members to recognize
Commissioner on what we know that he does a great job every day, especially this upcoming weekend with the storm coming in
Of how good a job he does
He has been selected chairman of ash toe, which is the American Association of state highway transportation officials
For this upcoming year and besides that just been a great honor. He'll be looking at the state
Response to the federal budget that's coming down and Russell. We just want to thank you for what you've done for George and in that recognition
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thanks, sir.
Chairman Hickman.
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.
Great report.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
But we're a big fan of peach bass when we're going the right way.
So, with the new lanes, will they also have the peach bass going with it?
with and is that a big revenue generation or should a big
revenue generation for our state of peach bad?
So yes, you will continue to be able to use peach passes as
we deploy this project and the revenue will be something
that we actually model and look at is how do we work to
finance the project.
So that is you try to let those revenues offset your cost.
And so we try to use the less public dollars as possible
for those lanes.
So but this was in the budget of sort of the bare minimum
to help us offset the cost which will be much higher than
the 1.796 billion. Yes sir. Chairman Hockins.
I've got two quick questions. One, you know, we were told as the price of oil went up, price
of asphalt went up. Now that price of oil is coming down, are we going to see slower
increases in asphalt? I think petroleum products drive asphalt. We actually have seen
process come down some but not probably at the rate that we might have thought but then
you look at the other components the aggregate which is 60 about 60% increase laborers increased
all these other components so we have seen that we have seen that come down in fact some
of my FY 24 numbers were higher than my FY 25 numbers so we have seen a small retreat
but we haven't seen it go back to 2020 year numbers.
And number two, Hall County is proud of you and there's a Hall County son.
The question is, how soon are you getting the signs up on 985 to get out of the left-hand lane?
Mr. Chairman, I moved even further north into Hall County and I have observed your same headaches.
We'll try to work on that.
Thank you.
I just need to remind everybody that we have to take members questions of the committee
chairman LaHoodett.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Commission appreciate the great report on how thorough it was and informative.
I've got a question about related to the federal government shutdown and where there
were some concerns raised at some recent board meetings about potential laps in funding.
How do you handle that?
Yeah, thank you.
So, interestingly enough, at the federal level, the federal gas tax allows money to continue
to flow.
The challenge is, though, they're only appropriate on a continual resolution.
You get one daily pro-rata share of your money, and so it's hard to run a business to develop
projects.
If you get one three sixty-fifth of your funding when you only get a month or two weeks
continue in resolution, so the good news is the money keeps flowing so we can pay contractors
and vendors for what they've done. The challenge becomes is how do we advance another federal
project when there's not the guarantee that you're going to get that federal money to reimburse
them. So that's the balancing act we have. The federal government lets you do an IOU with
them. And we take advantage of that so we can try to keep projects moving because we don't
want to slow things down. But at some point we have to, the IOU as we pay it forward with
our state funds and then as soon as there's quote real federal money we reimburs
ourselves. So we can't get ahead of our skis and we don't want to put ourselves
in jeopardy by fronting the federal budget too far. So that's always the
peril we're in at this time of year and we watch it closely. Matter of fact I've
got a meeting this afternoon to talk about that very thing is what this next
month and the next month look like for letting with federal projects. Hopefully
they'll get a continuing resolution passed for the entire budget year this
week or next before the end of the month, which gives us certainty.
I appreciate you being prepared for that and one more quick question related to the express
lane.
I was a beneficiary this morning driving on from out Austin, hitting the Northbound express
lane.
It worked great.
So I think that's been a tremendous success.
How would you compare the original peach pass on I-75, the funding that that required to
the funding for this expansion and any key differences
between the two products.
Yeah, so it was originally funded through GDOT
and there was a small bond sold for that project
way back then through the total authority.
And when that's been how long it's been in existence,
but that was probably a couple hundred million dollar
project back then, there may be 500 million I'm guessing.
But now obviously with this cost increase
that we've seen in our last five years historic,
basically double in processing,
so it's a lot more than it was back then.
But in then again, when that was put in place,
traffic patterns where everybody went into Atlanta
in the morning and out in the afternoon,
and we didn't have this thing in the middle of the day
that we were all experiencing now,
which is not gonna go away.
Thank you.
We'll be right back.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I wanna also reiterate what Chairman Jasper said.
It is just a pleasure to serve with such a gentleman like yourself.
I'm always worried that DC is going to scoop you up and take you out.
So I hope that that never comes.
But my question is, you and I have had conversations about this.
I'm very happy about the Governor's proposal to put in the extra lanes there coming through
Henry County.
In 4 a.m., there's not a bunch of traffic, but what there is a lot of at 4 a.m.
is semis parked along the medium.
And I know you've talked about some solutions for that.
Do we have any plans to maybe put in some more
rest areas for that?
Because to me, it just seems like a recipe for disaster
when you got 60, I mean, literally 60, 100 trucks parked
along the medium in and out of exits.
And they're sleeping there because they
have nowhere to park. Thank you for that. That's a recognition of all the freight
tunnish just being moved through Georgia and culminates right here in
Metro Atlanta. So we are working at our rest areas, visitor centers and
waste stations to increase parking in the land that we own. So we have projects
underway. I think at every visitor center, rest area and waste station is in
design at this point and will continue to build, did those and build those as we
We're using a combination of state and federal funding to try to address that.
And it's still going to be hard to address that need as we continue to grow.
A private sector needs to help solve that issue for sure.
But we've got to try to make it safe.
And as like I said, there's stacked up.
And the later the night or the earlier in the morning, the freight volumes,
like I said, were 20 to 25 percent on I-75.
But at 4am, they're probably about 80 to 90 percent on 75.
What are y'all doing at 4 a.m. on the interest anyway?
Representative Glaze, last question.
Early bird.
Thank you so much, Commissioner.
I'm at 85, exit 61.
You're now making sure that we can get through there and the soccer headquarters is accessible.
We appreciate you.
The question is, are there any state or local projects that have been put on hold or
stop because of the infrastructure grant.
So in Georgia, in the US, a federal infrastructure grant,
the answer is yes, the stitch project
over the downtown connector was one of those grants
that got held up.
There's a belt line project that has moved forward.
It got held up a little bit, but it's moving forward.
But those are the two, excuse me, there's a third one.
There's also a trail in South Fulton Trail there.
I think that is, got, did not meet the requirement
of the federal government.
Those are all federal decisions
were not involved in those.
Would there be any kind of back-filling then
for those projects, or would they be looked at
from the state level?
We probably don't have a budget program
that sort of fits those, but there are some other federal
budget programs that could be that you could use
other fund sources for.
We can talk offline about some of those, yeah.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you commissioner thank you I gave you some propaganda please look at it's
very helpful a lot of helpful information to hear about how the money gets spent
and our transparency thank you mr. Chairman next up is Commissioner Raive
Culture and Tyler Harper
You
All right, y'all, let's try to get this done and get the Commissioner Harper to see
how short he can make his presentation so we can get lunch.
All right.
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate the levity and definitely appreciate the fact that we still have the opportunity
to have those particular jokes.
I apologize I didn't bring my stool today.
It is still on the Senate floor.
I no longer have it anymore.
But hopefully what I lack in stature, Mr. Chairman,
over the last couple of years,
we've been able to make up for our efforts together
to ensure that our number one industry
continues to be successful.
And that's what we're here to talk about today.
But to Chairman Tiller, he said that we didn't budget
for our stool.
Amen. I appreciate that actually. So Chairman Hatchett, Chairman Tillery, members of the
Appropriations Committee, members of the General Assembly, it is an honor to be here today
to talk about what we have going on at the Department of Agriculture and our budget request
and things that are happening in our number one industry. As many of you know, the state
of agriculture across the country is in pretty tough times right now. So it's critical
that we have agency and an agency that can continue to help through those difficult times.
And that's the role that we have at the Department of Agriculture and Insuring that our agricultural
industry is successful every single day and I realize that I'm the last one before lunch
but how appropriate to talk about agriculture than right before lunch.
And that's what we're here to do today.
So just a brief overview, as all they all know, agriculture is our number one industry.
I don't have to tell you that.
For the number one state and a number of different commodities, we do phenomenally well.
We grow almost 200 commodities in our state.
But in addition to being the number one industry at the department, we do a lot of other things,
like we weigh the lottery balls.
Most people don't know that we do that.
We inspect gas pumps and structural pest control companies and entities.
There's a lot that we do as an agency that ties back to the success of our number one industry.
As I said, our number and industry can't be successful if the agency that oversees it
isn't successful as well and working together over the last couple of years we've been able
to work toward that goal and continue to allow our agency to have the resources it needs
to be successful.
We have a little over about 570 employees in the Department of Agriculture over 22 different
divisions and programs whenever you talk about the number of programs that number gets
significantly larger. We have over 70 different licenses that we issue as an agency to the tune of over 88,000 licensed entities.
Our funding split is about 80-20 between federal and state dollars. And in addition to the four program areas, we have at the Department of Agriculture of Marketing Administration, Consumer Protection, and now the Rural Center.
There are 23 different other entities
that flow through the department of agriculture.
So there's a lot of pass-through funding
that goes through us to other entities through our budget.
And so we have about 23 attached agencies
at the department of agriculture.
Talking about one of those four program areas,
working with y'all last year, the role center was moved
from the university system of Georgia
to the department of agriculture.
That was official on July 1st.
That really didn't become officially official
and fully integrated under the department
until January 1st.
There's a lot that goes into that with employee movements
on calendar years versus fiscal years.
But all of the role center is now completely integrated
in the department of agriculture.
It was a smooth transition between us
and the university system of Georgia.
Many of you know we have a new executive director there now
named Charlie Five Ash, who has hit the ground running.
with the other employees at the rural center in ensuring that we're doing the job that
we are tasked to do. That is working in rural communities across our state on things like
health care and education and workforce and how working with the ag sector in those communities
we can ensure that that particular community can be successful because if we don't have
quality access to health care education and workforce the number one industry in those
rural communities can't be successful which is agriculture and that's what we believe
the rural center does every single day, and we're going to continue to move forward with
that mission.
There, just to give you another point, the rural center is now completely housed in
department-provided facilities at our lab in Tifton, Georgia.
We were able to move some space around there with the federal state and provide some lab
space for them.
Something I know that is on the top of mind of a lot of people.
The governor talked about Hurricane Helene this morning in his comments.
I want to briefly give you an update there really quick.
The Georgia Development Authority, as many of you know, falls one of those entities that
falls under the Department of Agriculture.
Thanks to your help, we were able to secure significant funding to ensure that our farmers
and farm families were able to get on their feet.
As of the end of this month, we will completely close out the GDA loan program.
We will have issued 488 loans for a total of 164,583,723 dollars that are going to farm
families significantly impacted.
$15 million of that was funds that GDA brought to the table from safety 21, from the previous
hurricane, and we were able to add to the $150 million pot you gave us.
Forestry obviously has the 135 million.
I know director Sabo is gonna speak more directly to that
and his presentation to you on Thursday
as to where the status of that is.
It is a partnership between GDA,
the Development Authority and Georgia Forestry Commission
and they've taken the lead on that
and I will let him discuss that.
In regards to the block grant,
as many of you know, we announced in October
that Georgia will be receiving over $531 million
in block grant funds to help farmers, producers,
Ranchers and Timberland owners across our state
continue to recover from Hurricane Helene.
We are in final review with USDA.
Matter of fact, I talked to the Secretary's office this morning,
and they gave me confidence that it is moving
through the OGC review process quickly.
But as soon as they give us the green light,
we will be rolling fast.
I feel very optimistic that we are very close to that.
But at the department, we have already set up everything
we need to get rolling.
We already have the application ready to go.
We have a website that's already live,
farmrecovery.com.
That's what this is a snapshot from.
We have already put together FAQs that's already public
for farmers, for every single commodity that is covered
by the block grant.
So you can go ahead and have the documentation you need
prepared ready to go once that application period opens.
This is significantly different than Hurricane Michael.
We couldn't use that plan because this process
was significantly different.
It was different in many, many ways.
It was in some cases the inverse
of the way the process worked with Hurricane Michael
and how that block grant worked.
But we are covering more commodities, more producers
than any other state that has a block grant.
I've been told that directly by USDA
and I think that is something that we as a state
should be proud of.
We are covering more people, more producers,
more commodities than anybody else
through our block grant program.
But we have got everything ready to go.
Our banking structures in place, and we have hired a retired USDA
FSA employee who is running the program for us,
and we have hired a number of other retired USDA employees
who are very familiar with USDA programs and programming.
They are experts in this field, which is why we brought them
on board, and they will be the ones that will help us execute
this block grant and get this funding out to our producers
as quickly as possible.
If you want to find out more, obviously farmrecovery.com
is the website, and that's where we're encouraging folks
to go.
As many of you know, we also have the Farmland Conservation
Council an update on that really quick.
This time last year was when all of the council members
were appointed by the various entities
that were appointing those particular positions.
That had to be done before we could really go to work.
Once that council was put in place,
we hit the ground running.
Working with the council to get rules and regulations set up those or went through the entire
60-day process like it has to go through at the end of September.
That was completed.
We began working on the application.
The application is now with the council.
They are supposed to be getting that comment back to us on their review comments on the
application.
Once the council approves the application, that application will go live to begin protecting
farmland in the great state of Georgia.
And we look forward to doing that and appreciate our partnership in doing that as well.
As y'all know, we've been dealing with a lot of high-path even influenza over the last
couple of years.
Just this week, last week, we had our, what we consider the fourth detection of a commercial
poultry flock in our state.
And it was in Walker County.
Our team immediately went to work.
We activated our emergency operation center, the Department of Agriculture immediately.
less than 12 hours, we had the site completely locked down in every farm and the quarantine zone
completely quarantined, to ensure that the virus would not spread any further than where
it was.
Y'all know poultry is in Georgia, it's our number one ad commodity, over a third of Georgia
agriculture's poultry.
We're the number one poultry state in the nation, so it is significant issue for us that
we face every single day.
And I want to say thank you to the members of the General Assembly.
This year you appropriated $450,000 to the department to help us get the resources we need to be as best prepared as possible.
But to kind of put it in perspective, in fiscal year 25, HPA, I cost the department of agriculture over $300,000 to respond.
A lot of that was due to our significant hands on response in those particular cases.
Because not every poultry integrator and every company that we work with has the same resources and tools to respond to those particular events.
Thankfully for us, the last two responses, those integrators and those companies have additional resources they've been able to bring to the table, so it's not cost the department as much to respond, but still at the height of this response in Walker County as an example, we had over 70 people deployed in response stage P.A.I.
That includes department employees as well as private employees and others, so it is a huge, huge response.
There's a lot that goes into this.
But in Georgia, we've done a really good job.
200 million birds affected nationwide,
only 500,000 in our state.
I think that goes to show the work that we've done as an agency,
the work that industry has done in bio-security,
to help ensure that we keep this out of the state of Georgia.
We still got a lot of work to do, but it's not going away.
Just in the last 30 days, 29 states,
67 flocks over 1.84 million birds have been impacted
by HPAI in the last 30 days alone.
We know this is going to be a continued effort
that we've got to work on together,
and we appreciate our work in doing that
and appreciate your help in helping us ensure
that we're able to respond as quickly as possible.
I'm going to briefly mention this.
The yellowlegged hornet is something
we're still dealing with just to put it in perspective.
This is a dashboard we have at the Department of Agriculture.
We've done 92,500 inspections looking for this thing
over the last two and a half years.
It is a threat to our honeybee, as you know.
But this takes resources away from other things
that our staff normally does on a day-to-day basis.
Now we have the cotton jassad.
We also have the spotted lantern flower.
Those are other things that have come to fruition
in the last two years that the department
has a responsibility to respond to
to protect our agricultural and our industry
and our food security in our state.
Some of this, we get offset funding
from the federal government in response,
but it doesn't cover our entire cost.
So especially when you talk about taking employees
off of their normal day-to-day job
to respond to these incidences,
it increases our workload as an agency.
And it's definitely something we continue to respond to.
Briefly on the hemp program,
I know this is something we've been working on
over the last couple of years.
This is a snapshot of our dashboard
that we have on our hemp program too,
that we have at the Department of Agriculture,
which since we really have been locking down
on ensuring that this is taken care of,
our team has done over 1,100 inspections.
We found over 1,200 violations.
Those violations range in a lot of different ways,
but to give you an idea,
the number one violation we find is lack of certificate
of analysis, we find lack of warning labels,
and we also find that they're still trying to sell stuff
that looks like food or candy,
which is something we're taking a hard stance against.
Just to put it in perspective, we've done those over 1100 inspections with five people
They've been really hitting the ground run and hard. We have two license coordinators
Thanks to your help that are working on getting those 8,000 license
Issued that's brought in over two million dollars in revenue to the state now we know where these entities are and we can regulate them of
Those 1200 violations 54 of them have been referred to our law enforcement division for criminal investigation
investigation. Actually 81 of them have been referred for criminal investigation.
27 of those have been related to under 21 issues where we have done undercover
stings and found issues across the state and we have been locking people up and
taking people to jail for doing things that they shouldn't be doing. We've been
doing that in conjunction with local law enforcement, other 50, the other 54
or different other criminal investigations ranging from selling things that
they shouldn't be selling and calling it him. We've been doing a lot of that
work. We get about a little over a million dollars to operate our hemp program and like I said,
it brings in a little over two million dollars in revenue to the state. Obviously, we're working
with the resources that we have, but appreciate your help as we continue working together to keep
this out of the hands of folks that don't need it and allow it to be a successful program at the same
time. The Gate Trust Fund or the Georgia Ag Trust Fund, we primarily use this and I'll brief over
over this really fast.
We have center, every year we're required to send a report
to this OPB, the House and Senate budget offices
on the funding and how we allocate that funding
through the trust fund.
That report is available to anybody that wants a copy.
If you would like a copy, I think we have a few with us.
If you would like a copy, please see Catherine Russell
on our policy team.
She can make sure you get a copy of this report.
I would encourage you to get it.
It is a, I think it's a great report.
I think it really details out the work we've been doing
the farmers markets and the work we've been doing elsewhere across the state but just to put it
in perspective our farmers market bring in over a billion dollars a year and produce sales in the
state of Georgia, a billion dollars a year. That is a lot of activity and so our farmers markets
are important to our state and we use this funding in addition to the other funding that you have
helped us with to help upkeep our markets but it's not a lot of money here it's only a couple
a million a year. And that doesn't go very far when you're talking about significant amounts
of issues and maintenance that are required to help us upkeep our markets. Alright, moving
into the budget. The governor's budget is, I'm just going to be very brief here. He provided
us some significant investments and we're very appreciative of the governor and our work
together and ensuring that our agency continues to be successful. Some of this I'll mention
in just a second, but these are some things that we ask for, and the governor helped provide
some of that funding for us.
An inspection software for food safety, a million dollars when it comes to our employee retention
programs, but also some shortfalls that we have, I'll talk about that in just a second,
some cost of living adjustments, among and including the $2,000 supplement that he mentioned
in his state of the state, we are appreciative of that.
I'm gonna really get into more of this in just a second,
but the governor included a lot of the funding
that we have asked for,
but we really appreciate our work with him
to ensure that our employees and our agency
has the resources it needs to do its job.
Obviously, he up the Georgia Grown Wood program
that we've been proud to partner
with the Georgia Forestry Commission on
as a direct partnership through the department
and the commission, and obviously we're working
to through that to promote Georgia Grown Wood,
and find ways to recruit companies to our state
to help us continue to allow our forestry sector
to be successful.
It's taken some significant hits in the last year,
significant hits.
And we've got to work together to ensure forestry is successful
and we're proud to be part of that partnership
and continue to work with the Forestry Commission
and others to promote our forestry sector
and what we're doing.
This is the governor's FY25 budget recommendations.
Again, additional funding for software
that we asked for some adjustments related to colas
and other things where we found where we had some shortfalls
and in addition to that, making some adjustments
in the budget related to other things
that were put in the budget last year.
Obviously, the center's budget continues to be the same.
Our capital projects in the budget, the governor included,
were vehicle replacement funding for the lab at the farmer's market as well as the final
recommissioning funding that we need for our Tifton laboratory in Tifton.
We would appreciate your help in keeping that funding from the governor in the budget,
but in addition to keeping that funding in the budget, we do have some additional needs.
I will start obviously with the vehicle funding that the governor included.
As I have mentioned to y'all every year, at the Department of Agriculture we have significant
turnover when it comes to our vehicles. We are just trying to catch up. When I
walked in the door, the department, we had an over three and a half million dollar
need and vehicles alone. We all have helped us whittle that down. But our agency
just like any other state agency that utilizes vehicles, we have a constant
yearly need for that. We would appreciate your help in funding that and our
work together to help us continue to fund that need year in and year out. In
in many cases, this is our employee's office,
is that vehicle.
Because that is how they do the job
that we ask them to do every single day.
In addition to that, the new lab
that we have talked about last year,
many of you know we had the food safety
and dairy lab was in the ag building across the street.
Times are different now.
Thanks to your help last year,
you included funding for design for a new lab
to go at the farmers market and forest park
here in Atlanta to help us meet our demand currently and also look toward the future.
The lab space here on Capitol Hill just was not meeting that need.
We were having to send samples out of state to be taken care of because we didn't have
the space to do them here.
And you can imagine if we ever had an outbreak or a huge concern, that timing is of the essence.
And it's critical that we have the resources in our labs to be able to do the job.
We have a lab footprint in Tifton.
I would love to take you all there if you're ever interested
and show you what we do in Tifton.
In Tifton has space to serve as a backup to the lab here
in Atlanta.
The lab in Atlanta mainly houses our food and dairy
divisions.
The lab in Tifton houses things like fuels
and metrology, seed feed fertilizer, those things.
Our Tifton lab can serve as a backup.
Unfortunately, Atlanta in its current capacity cannot.
We are currently using space at Georgia Tech
to the tune of over $1.1 million a year in rent,
so it is costing us significantly as an agency.
So we would appreciate your help in helping us build
the lab and the space that we need to operate as an agency.
Our estimates are 34 million.
I've been working with just Vic, or we have as an agency,
for construction.
I understand that they are not complete
with their finalization right now.
But in our conversation, they have led me to believe
that our number based on the need
that we have shared with them is the number
to continue to pursue.
And so we're asking for, in addition to the governor's
25 million, we would appreciate the additional nine
to complete the construction amount needed
for our farmer's market lab.
And we would be happy to dig into that if needed
is to exactly what all of that covers.
In response to operational needs that we have,
the governor funded about two and a half million
of our three point, a little over $3.8 million ask.
That's everything from computers to software needs
that we have as an agency.
A lot of those software needs are critical for us.
We're trying to define new ways to enhance
our inspection systems to be more efficient
and more effective as an agency.
So that funding is critical.
So we look forward to working with you
to hopefully obtaining the additional amounts
of that funding we need,
especially for our software program.
In addition to that, as an agency,
we have completely been significantly impacted.
During the last year, the Biden administration,
we saw a $1.1 million cut in federal funding
to our agency.
That is a significant hit to us.
And it is caused significant issues,
obviously, for our budget.
And because those programs still have to continue,
We got to find ways to fund those.
So we're asking for your assistance
in helping us address those issues
and continue on to find ways to help fund the needs we have.
We also are asking for funding to help cover
the shortfall of the coal as in the pay raises
that the General Assembly provided our agency.
That was not enough funding to cover our entire agency
and cover the need that we have as an agency.
We are still trying to find and sure
that those employees are covered.
In same way when it comes to federal funding,
Whenever we do pay raises, I have employees that are funded 50% state, 50% federal.
We still cover those employees pay raise, but and work with the feds to hopefully get
a reimbursement increase so we can cover that portion of their salary.
Unfortunately in my three years, I have asked every year, we continue to ask every year,
we have yet to get the reimbursement from the feds to cover that portion of the pay raise.
So we are covering that internally in our own budget and finding ways to do that.
And so it makes it difficult for us as an agency, as operational costs continue to increase.
And as you try to find those ways to cover those costs for those employees that deserve
that funding, it puts a strain on your budget.
So that's why we're asking for this operational funding increase to give us the resources
we need to provide our agency, the tools it needs to do, the job that we are asked to do
every single day, and help us take care of our people and our employees and with your
help we can do just that. Finally I'll hit on this really quick to put it in
perspective. Since I walked in the door in 2023 we have seen a 33% increase in
licensed entities in our state 33% and that same time period we have increased
our employment by around 12%. It was about 500 when I walked in the door we're
about 570 now we still have about 80 or so vacancies. Even though we've
increased employee count by about 12% employee workload has increased by almost 14% because
of the number of entities that we have to oversee regulate and inspect. So just because we've
increased the amount of people that we have on our payroll doesn't necessarily mean
that we have gotten more efficient. We have actually increased the workload on our people
and I think it's important for us to work together to continue to address that. In that
That same time period, just in the last 12 months, we have declined a license application
for 22 meat processing facilities in our state because we don't have the staffing necessary
to provide the individuals needed for those entities to operate.
That means that's 22 businesses that aren't operating, that aren't employing Georgians,
that aren't paying taxes, that aren't providing access to farmers and producers to get their
product to market.
As an agency, we have a responsibility that we're providing that access for our farmers
and producers every single day in protecting this food supply and everything that we do
as an agency.
And so we have a lot of work to do in our work together to ensure that we're providing
that resourcefulness to our state.
We continue to see an increase in violations, matter of fact over a 30% increase in violations
in food safety.
We have seen a 45% increase in violations in our companion animal division, and I want
to thank our companion animal team and our law enforcement team that have worked together
to address animal abuse in our state in significant ways.
And I will point out one thing because it's a typo.
But we did 15,000 inspections on 113,000 pumps last year in our fuel and measures division.
So it takes us almost two years to inspect the gas pumps in this state because we have
almost 200,000 in the state of Georgia and as y'all know as you travel this
state, there are new gas stations going up every single day. That means more
resources that we have to deploy to ensure that our agency is successful. So
working together, working with you, we can ensure that our number one industry is
successful. We can ensure that agriculture continues to be top of mind. We can
ensure that the businesses and entities that are regulated by us at the
Department of Agriculture are able to do their job every single day and
providing the food, fiber and shelter we rely on and I appreciate our work
together in doing just that and I look forward to our conversations over the
next 90 days or so. 40 days 40s at 40 nights and 90 or 90 days and 40 nights or
90 nights and 40 days whatever it is as we work together to do just that so
thank y'all for giving me an opportunity to give you a brief update and
an overview on the department, our funding, and our needs as an agency to continue to do
the job that we've been asked to do every single day.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Harper.
Two questions.
Chair Lady Taylor.
Okay.
Chairman Meeks.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And, Mr. Commissioner, thank you for the great work that you were doing and your department
and employees are certainly no lack of work to be done in our agriculture industry and
challenges that we have ahead so thank you for what you were doing. Two quick
questions, one on your employment retention within the Consumer Protection
Division. What kind of turnover rate do you have within that division?
Mr. Chairman, I will tell you I will get you an exact number because I will
rather give you an exact number than tell you where we are but I will say
this, though, that said we had about 120 or 30 vacancies when I walked in the door.
We have lost a number of employees, we have gained employees, and in that time period in
the three years I've been commissioner, we've whittled that down to about 75 or 80.
So we're making progress, we're making headway, we're going the right way because of your
help in giving us significant pay raise and salary increases for our employees and helping
us ensure that we're paying the people the boots on the ground. So we're heading in the right direction,
but unfortunately we're not getting there quick enough to keep up with the workload that our
agency has and any continued efforts to help us ensure that we're able to do that would be
appreciative, but we can get you an exact number on that. Thank you, Commissioner. And lastly,
with the lab down at the land of farmers market, we hope that that's going to be a mass timber
project built out of timber produced here in Georgia. And then lastly, would the
reimbursement from the Feds understanding that pay raises is one thing, but
would the other agreements that we have working with the Feds are reimbursements
coming in a timely manner to the department? Some of those reimbursements actually
to your point, Mr. Chairman, some of those reimbursements we've actually
completely lost as I mentioned just a second ago in some in our food safety and
our meat inspection program. Some of those have been delayed, but for the most
part, we have been able to get, I believe, most of the funding that we, that I have not
spoken to directly in the presentation today, we're able to, we've been able to receive
that particular funding, but we get funding from a variety of sources, EPA, FDA, USDA, so
there's a lot of different areas and agencies that we deal with as an agency in the federal
funding that we receive, but other than the specific areas I pointed out, meet inspection
and food safety where we have lost funding or not been getting reimbursed as appropriately.
The funding has been coming to our agency in a timely manner.
Obviously, this shutdown affected us a little bit, but we were able to overcome that.
But we're in a, when it comes to those other areas, we have been getting the funding as
required, but we still have some shortfalls in a number of other areas.
Well, thank you, Commissioner.
I look forward to working with you to address the many issues we have, including the short
fall that we have and being able to issue license for people to do business the number
one state in the country.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Buckner.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for all that you did for agriculture and Georgia.
On page 393 of our budget, there is a report that Georgia Economic Report and it mentions
a couple of times.
Representative, you hold the mic to your mouth.
It talks about non-farm payrolls in Georgia,
but there's no mention of farm payrolls anywhere
that I can find in that Georgia economic report.
What's the picture of farm payrolls in Georgia?
Representative Buckner, I would have
to get that information back to you.
Obviously, this Friday is the agricultural forecast, which
the University of Georgia will be rolling out
a lot of that economics.
I will tell you, there are about 40,000 farms in the state
Georgia average farm size of about 250 acres across our state about 95% of our
farms in Georgia are family-owned operations. I think that's something for us as a
state to be proud of but when it comes to specific payroll and how much is
of own farm payroll. I don't have that off the top of my head but we can work on
getting that number to you. Yes ma'am. Chairman Eccles. Last question. You
You're going to ask.
It's my head.
It's all.
Oh.
It was you.
Mike.
It was you.
Mike.
Okay.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I thank you.
Probably, but on behalf of the people of Walker County, thank you.
And your staff for what you did up there last week.
It gave a lot of producers and agricultural people their confidence that you address situation.
You handled it right.
And I just want to tell you thank you, public.
Representative Cameron, I appreciate that.
that our team is still up there working on going.
They'll be working through this cold weather.
We're obviously watching the winter weather
that's happening later this week.
So keep our employees and others in your prayers
and your thoughts because they're out there braving that
to address this issue.
But thank you for your comments.
All right, last question.
Thank you, Commissioner Harper.
So we're gonna come back, we're gonna have lunch.
We're gonna come back at one hotel.
We're going to come back 15 minutes after what the agenda says, we're going to come back at 1.30, 1.30, so everything will be put back 15 minutes here for just one second.
