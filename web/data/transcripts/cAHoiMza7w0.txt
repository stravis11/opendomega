TRANSCRIPT
----------
If everybody will take your seat, please.
If you're not a member of appropriations, I ask if you don't mind step backwards just
so we can count and make sure we have a quorum.
Okay, we do have a quorum.
Representative Burns, do you mind leading us in invocation?
Please Father, we're grateful for today.
We're grateful for opportunities and challenges.
Be with us now as we consider the business
of our great state and make sure that we do the things
that are pleasing in your sight.
Christ, name my pray.
Amen.
Appreciate all you've in here.
Thank you, Chairman Burns.
Our first bill will be House Bill 6-11.
Representative Bush said, if you want to step up
to the podium, you can take it.
You can go from there, floor jurors.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
House Bill 6-11 is billed at this committee.
already passed, but as with any lawyer bill, if you get several lawyers involved, there's
a question about how the words should be on the sheet of paper. So this is just the
substitute that accomplishes the same exact thing. It's just reworded and the House
Post 611, what it does is it requires that any settlement agreement or any proceeds
from a settlement agreement shall be appropriated after June 1, 2023 by the General Assembly.
As you recall, we've had many settlements with the state of Georgia and they've been
appropriate or allocated outside some of them, the appropriating power of the General Assembly.
This would assure that those appropriating powers that are in the Constitution remain
with the General Assembly going forward from June 1, 2023 on into whenever the General Assembly
takes action again. That's the essence of the bill. Mr. Chairman, thanks again for working
with me on this bill and helping me to make sure these words read correctly. And the parties
that are interested in this are General Assembly, of course, and then the AG's office. And
There is currently some ongoing litigation settlement negotiations happening for a second
round of opioids.
If you recall last year we had the first round of opioids settlements.
This would, all the parties are in agreement of this language, is the language that would
best serve moving forward.
Thank you, Representative.
Making sure that I'm correct, the parties involved in this bill are at peace with it.
would preserve settlements that are made before this day and would require anything in the future
to come to the General Assembly. Is that correct?
That is correct. Currently with the second round of opioid litigation, the time is of
the essence and the last round of opioid settlement, the General Assembly is taking
no part in appropriating those funds. All those funds go directly to trust, both regionally
and state trust that are appropriated outside of the General Assembly.
What this bill, what we've been able to do is strike a deal with the parties involved
to say that of the state portion that is coming to the state in the settlement agreement,
in the settlement agreement moving forward in this second round.
The state portion, 65% of the, excuse me, 75% goes to the state of that 75%, 40% goes to a regional spin, which will go to a trust.
That's the other remaining 60%.
The General Assembly will appropriate and those parties involve the AG, General Assembly, and the locals are all in accordance with this.
After this, however, all dollars shall be appropriated
by the General Assembly.
All right, thanks for your explanation, Chairman Veach.
If it's proper time, I'd like to make a motion.
It's proper.
All right, I'd like to make a motion HB611 do pass.
There's a motion that HB611 passed by substitute.
I think it's LC432837S.
Is that the correct one, representative?
Yes, sir.
All right, there's motion and second.
Any further discussion?
All those in favor, please say aye.
Opposed, no.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Got one other bill on the calendar day, a little cleanup bill.
It's going to be House Bill 19.
Not committee substitute.
Speaker Burns was busy, so I think I'll present it for him.
I do laugh.
House Bill 19, what you have a four-year green front, is the Senate
Appropriations Committee Substitute to House Bill 19. Let me just run you through it generally. We'll talk about a few other specifics and see if you have any questions.
This is the FY24 budget. Remember it's a $32.4 billion proposal.
It supports law and order. It protects our families, supports our children, and
figuratively and literally gives them hope.
The big picture I think it's fair to say is that the Senate version more closely reflects
the governor's version than the House, but that's not to say we didn't pick up the nuggets
of wisdom from the House where we could.
Areas where we more closely reflect the governor's budget, we were able to replace funding
pulled from Medicaid, we were able to replace and add to the reinsurance program supported
by the governor at the office of Commissioner of Insurance.
We were able to return hope to 100% funding for students with a V average, which was a proposal
by the governor, and we were able to support the governor's $2,000 raise for all state-funded
employees.
Let me walk you through a few of the details just in policy areas.
In health, in Medicaid, ABD, we restored utilization cost cuts in ABD low income Medicaid and
peach care.
We allowed for the reimbursement of OTAs, that's occupational therapy assistance, and physical
therapy assistance, providing services for Medicaid members, receiving children's intervention
services, CIS, another abbreviation for Medicaid, and creating parity with our surrounding
states. In the state health benefit plan, we shored up the state health benefit plan
to a tune of $1 billion. We talked about this during the amended phase too. At DHS, we
worked with our friends at DHS, DCH, and with the Office of Health Strategies to begin
plan to address a structural deficit at our child carrying institutions in our state
and allow for better placements and care for children with more federal support for foster
care maintenance payments while funding the current cost of this deficit for a six month
period. At DPH we matched the house and actually doubled funds for reimbursement rates in
the baby's can't wait program to help support early intervention for infants and toddlers
special needs. Also at DCH we continued our support for
hoteling and ending that practice with a $5 million ad there. As of this
minute we have 14 children who are in state care who are sitting in an
emergency room. That is not their best care. It's not the highest and best use of
our funds and we are going to continue to pound that point with our state
contractors so that they can remove these children from an ER where they are not
getting care so a place where they can get the care they need because their lives
literally depend on it. At Behavioral Health the Senate version supports over
$40 million to address mental health staffing facility needs and others. We
held the line with the House on increases to our home and community-based
service providers and the Senate budget also funds now 500 now-comp waivers
which was a position point championed by the Senator from the 56th and the
Senator from the 40th in a bipartisan fashion and was probably the one item that
I received more letters on from you members than any other singular item. In
education at the K-12 level, for the second year in the row the Senate's
version supports a position that allows for no austerity in the QBE formula and
and teachers receive a $2,000 salary raise.
This budget also makes significant progress towards screening
of all adult of all children from kindergarten to third grade
for dyslexia.
You'll remember as the senator from the 42nd has told us
many times that we passed SB 48 with an end date
for making sure we screened all children by third grade
by FY25.
The Senate committee version you have before you now fully
funds that measure one year early and support
screening, dyslexia screening for all children from
kindergarten to third grade.
The Senate version also provides not just support for the
Council on Literacy champion by the Senator from the
fourth, but operation funding and a directive to work
pursuant to Senate Bill 211 and monies to support that
endeavor at over a million dollars.
We believe that literacy is important, SB 48 and SB 211
don't we believe dovetail to make sure we have an educated and competent workforce for
all the jobs that the governor is so eloquently bringing to Georgia.
At higher education the Senate's budget returns to the governor's position as I told you
supporting a 100% factor rate for prior to your tuition for the hope grant and for the
hope scholarships for public schools. At public libraries the Senate version also supports
another nickel raise to take the book allowance, as we commonly call it, to $0.70 per capita
for a total of $7.7 million.
The Senate's budget also recognizes that certain TCSG fields cost more, and it provides additional
funds to TCSG to recognize the high cost of delivering CDL and nursing programs, which
are both careers which are desperately needed and in demand.
We funded the aviation side of that last year.
The Senate's budget supports conservative budgeting as well by requesting our Board of Regents utilize carried forward funds to support their teaching formula and
conserve valuable state dollars at a time of significant financial turmoil and uncertainty.
We also expect continued discussions with the governor's office and the house concerning the funding of state buildings.
There are a couple of planning ads in this budget and we want to make sure that if we're adding planning dollars that we're able to support the buildings that would
followed behind those planning dollar additions.
In public safety, the Senate's committee version
supports technological and data management upgrades
at our courts.
It supports a $6,000 increase for state troopers, capital
police, DNR rangers, and our GBI folks.
We weren't trying to single anyone out
and make them seem more important than the others,
but we want to recognize the hard work
and the duties, increased duties we have placed
on these individuals, particularly over the past two years.
We were able to fund this by reducing our funding towards troopers schools.
And it's logical and sincere in the reason we did this.
We believe that keeping our experienced law enforcement matters, and there is a learning
curve when we bring more troopers on.
We don't get to create state dollars in this budget.
So we were able to take a portion of the $11 million that we annually use to support
trooper schools and use that for the pay raises.
Now those pay raises, $11 million is not enough to cover everyone.
So we did have to pick and choose and we chose to focus on those whose job duties increased
the most we feel over the past two years.
The Senate version of the budget also funds a cold case unit at the GBI, various scientists
position for the crime labs and bonds to improve the crime lab, the GBI crime lab in
Macon, which we know has been championed by the senator from the 26th.
In economic development, the state budget creates a program to improve natural gas
access in rural communities, acknowledging because of the governor's incredible success
on broadband, natural gas is becoming this generation's broadband issue.
We used to talk about could we provide cell service to each community, then we talked
about could we provide broadband to each community, because of the extreme success of the
governor and this body, we've almost done that.
And natural gas is becoming the next titan of utilities that we're going to have to tackle.
We also support our growing EV industry by transitioning certain unfilled positions at
regional economic development projects that haven't been filled yet to other regional
economic development projects in other areas of the state.
At the Department of Ag, we funded the Department of Ag's needs and forced soul amendment rules.
We also increased COLA's at Department of Natural Resources for Game Wardens, as I mentioned,
and then back over to Ag, we supported funding for blueberry, citrus, and peach positions.
There are other areas of the budget where we were able to add as well.
Our statewide independent living council, they have a wait list of about 700 individuals.
By moving and not funding certain positions that have not yet been filled by pulling
back those funds, we were able to clear the 700 person wait list at the statewide independent
living council.
We were also able to make a commitment to reduce state liabilities by committing $5 million
for a continued reduction of state workers' comp liabilities at DOAS.
The Senate's budget also provides a one-time benefit of $26.75 million for eligible state
retirees and recognizes that ERS coales are now being pre-funded by employer contributions.
We were able to increase funds to the Georgia Food Bank program, which has been championed
by many, including the Senator from the 44th.
I asked, but certainly not least, one of the other items I want to point out is that
the Senate version of this Senate committee version proposes that we recognize $11 million
for transit in project areas outside of Atlanta.
It's a novel idea.
Our Commissioner of Department of Transportation has championed this.
We send out DHS vehicles to move people for non-emergent reasons.
We also have Department of Transportation vehicles that we use for non-emergent regions.
We also do that through other various DHS agencies.
The Department of Transportation has come up with a plan by looking at other models that
it's, I would call it Uber-esque in its essence of saying, hey, if we're already running
in this vehicle there, why aren't we double track overing with another agency to do the
same thing? Why didn't we not just try to grab two people with the same ride? And we've
put $11 million towards that project outside of the metro area.
Talk to you a lot about the ads. Well, where do we get these funds? We don't get to create
dollars and the Senate doesn't have its own printing press. The credit for this goes
to our staff. We have a staff of eight at the Senate budget office that's headed by Brent
church well, but there's more than that. You know Austin, Courtney, Lindsey, Martha
Grace, Mary, Sonny, Caitlin, Carly, and Noah, and then of course Miss Angela and Abby
who work directly in our office. They spent hours combing state budgets to figure out who'd
already been hired, who had not been hired, where we could, what funds have been it-spended,
what funds were surplus to help create the dollars that you see to fund the projects
that you specifically asked for for you and your districts here. And I want to give them
around of applause until then thank you for all their work.
And there's other areas that we had to find savings too, you know, we can't just find
all the savings based upon positions not yet hired.
So we didn't agree with a few house ads.
We also were able to find some FMAP changes, the Senate going last is able to have the
most updated information on FMAP and we were able to create a few savings there.
As I already told you, we trued up the dollars of hired and unfilled positions.
We used conservative budgeting at our largest agencies and pointed them sometimes to other
funds.
We held the house's reduction at airport aid and we provided the same percentage to
reduction for railroads.
We pulled funds that were committed to the criminal data exchange program due to legislative
changes in governance and plan to put those back when that legislative change in governance
is complete.
We also reduced funds for program expenditures like the Georgia Coordinating Center which
now has run its time and the Georgia Cyber Center which made a commitment to us early
on that after several years they will be able to support them cell phone rents and we're
now going to move them to that part of their budget.
as well as a reduction at Georgia Public Television
based on testimony and current requests.
We also reduced the testing budget.
Why did we do that?
Well, it's a recognition of this body's continued reduction
of testing requirements on our students and teachers.
And if we're gonna reduce those requirements,
then the budget should commiserately follow.
The budget before you now is one that, again,
I feel promotes safety for our state.
It gives our students hope the pun is intended.
And it makes sure that our state is in a position
to weather storms that may come over the next 12 or 24 months.
As we see those clouds that were gray,
get darker and darker on the horizon.
I appreciate the governor and his insight and forethought
into the plan and the conservative values
that it represented before it ever even
came to our body for consideration.
Appreciate the staff at OPB who have been open to answer any questions that we've had in this process.
And I know the hours and months of work that they've put in.
And also want to commend and thank Christine Murdoch at House Budget Office and
Chairman Matt Hatchet, who have been open to this process as we've ran as fast as we possibly could.
You know that normally it takes 16 days for the Senate to work through our eight committee process and
make sure we've trueed everything up.
We have a little slogan, we say, two weeks, two days.
And that's how long it takes from the day the House
hands it to us the day we can roll it out in this committee.
We were handed the budget on March 10th.
That would mean March 26th would be the quickest we can do it.
Because of your hard work and the hard work of our staff
and our friends who've helped us along the way at OPB and the
House Budget Office, we've been able to do that five days
faster or 33% faster than we've ever done it before.
And again, that's a tribute to you
and it's a tribute to our staff
who probably are just about functioning
at the level of exhaustion.
Thank you again for the letters you wrote.
We've tried to work them in.
I think you'll see them reflected
if you have specific project requests.
I'm happy to talk to you about them offline,
but I've seen many of you've already turned to the bonds
and know what you're looking at to begin with.
So if there are no further questions,
I'll take a motion.
Motion by Senator Dugan, is there a second?
Second by Senator Gaines, any further discussion or questions?
Okay, all those in favor of the Senate
appropriations committee substitute,
House Bill 19 as presented, please say aye.
Opposed, no.
Thank you so much, I've got to have a great afternoon.
