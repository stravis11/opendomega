TRANSCRIPT
----------
The hour for convening haven't arrived, all members, all members please come to the floor and take your seats, all members, go ahead and ring the bell, Mr. Clerk, if you would.
All members please come to the floor, take your seats, we're going to have the roll call.
All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber.
Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machines?
Members, I need your attention.
All members voted.
It's the green button.
Doorkyper, she's been here before.
I think.
All members voted.
Ms. Clerk, will you lock the machines?
Members of you all stand with me.
I have an announcement we need to make.
Many of you, along with myself,
serve with our dear friend,
former chairman Bill Himmry.
And y'all know Bill has been ill for some time now.
Just got word, Katie, thank you.
That Bill passed this morning.
As you know, it's easy to say he's in a better place, but I know Bill was ready for whatever
the good Lord had prepared for him, where it was here, as he inspired many of us with
his writings and with his life and his counsel.
I just learned I did not know this.
Obviously, we'll keep that family in our prayer and give thanks for Bill Himbrick, but his
sister, Orgra, and to say that right, also works in a clerks office.
So she's a part of this family as well.
So let's keep that entire family and give thanks for a life we'll lived.
So if you will, bow with me for a moment of prayer.
God, thank you for good people.
for those who inspire us to do better, to be our best, to treat our neighbor with kindness and
fairness. Lord, let those life lessons inspire us all. Lord, will you know that we'll lift up that
family? We know you will hold them in your hands, Lord, and give them comfort and peace, and the
prayers that will come from these folks here in this room, as they remember a friend, a former
colleague. We just give you thanks for the life of Bill Humbering. Thank you members.
As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain
after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country.
Our chaplain this morning,
enjoyed meeting he and his family,
will be introduced by the lady from the 82nd House District,
Chair Lady Karen Matthew.
Chair Lady Matthew.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, colleagues.
It's such a pleasure to have family here today.
We don't always get to enjoy the families of our pastors.
So I'm very blessed to have Rebecca Angke and Kayla.
She's a fourth grader and her first time to the Capitol.
And she got to see the animals down in the rotunda.
And I also have a good friend of my former state senator,
Mitch Sebaugh, he lives in my district now.
And I'm so blessed and honored to have you here today, Senator.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Pastor, for coming and being with us today.
Pastor Durvin is originally from Albany.
My seatmate will enjoy that.
Stephen grew up in a broken home.
Where church attendance really wasn't a priority.
My community, my district, has a rich, rich history
history of Christendom. And I'm so proud of that and I'm proud to have Pastor Steven with us.
As a teenager, he came to faith in Christ as soon as he sensed God's call to ministry.
He married his high school sweetheart, Rebecca. And together, God has blessed them with five children,
Cade, Cole, Cason, Carrington, and Cailer, all with a C.
Stephen has served in full-time ministry for over two decades,
finally leading churches to Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida.
He is passionate about teaching God's word in a way that connects people to Christ
and believes the local church is God's plan A for reaching the world.
With a heart for sharing the gospel, making disciples, and equipping others to do the
same, Stephen leads with conviction, humility, and deep love for the church.
He holds a master in divinity from Liberty University, Baptist Theological Seminar, and
Steven has been the pastor of Oak Hill Church in Williamson, Georgia for over eight years.
So please enjoy his word this morning.
Good morning.
As a lifelong Georgian growing up, driving through downtown Atlanta to get to mineral bluff
to see my grandparents, I would have never dreamed that I would have been in this building.
So thank you for being here.
I know probably it's probably against some of your wills.
So we'll try to get through this together.
I want to thank first speaker Burns for allowing me
to be here, speaker protein, Jones, leader of frustration,
leader Hugley and Chairwoman Matthew.
I thank you so much for allowing me to be here this morning.
In Mark chapter 10, we read where Jesus is foretelling
his death.
He's walking with his disciples.
And in the back, James and John are making plans.
They are working and networking to try to see where they can be.
Jesus overhears their comments as they come up and they say,
can we ask you a question?
Can we sit next to you?
They won't honor, they won't prestige, they won't recognition.
And Jesus responds in Mark 10, 45 in a most peculiar way
when he says, for even the Son of Man came not to be served,
but to serve, and he gave his life as a ransom for many.
There's a lot that preachers and politicians have in common,
and I know that probably some of the people that vote for you
and some of the people that attend my church would agree.
We both speak for a living, and we hope that people will listen.
We shake a lot of hands and attend more meetings
than we care to attend.
We get criticized by people that have never done our job
a day in their life.
Can I get amen?
We're expected to have all the answers for problems that are bigger than ourselves, but
the biggest thing that we have in common is not the microphones that we stand behind,
but rather the motivation for why we do it.
At some point, you and I decided that we wanted to give our lives or a portion of our lives
to serve people, because people matter, and we know that the way up is down.
Jesus tells us if we wanted to be great in this world, that we should serve.
leadership is measured by service. He says to give his life, Mark 10.45, Jesus' greatest act of
service happened without applause, without headlines, and without votes. And oftentimes for all of us,
the most meaningful service is unseen. It's uncelebrated. It's unappreciated. And because of the
late nights that I know that are coming from many of you, it also is inconvenient. The God sees
those late nights. He sees those tough decisions and the quiet sacrifices that you make and those that
never make the news. And as a Georgian, I want to tell you that I'm grateful for what you do in
making our state a better place. We see that service also happens when no one is applauding.
Leadership's not about position. It's not about our title or influence. It's about a responsibility
to care for people and to care for people well.
So whether it's the pulpit or in the capital,
leadership means asking this,
who am I responsible for today?
The goal of service is the good of others,
not the glory of self.
And while James and John were jockeying for position
or doing everything they can to ensure
that they would have a seat at the table
when perhaps the best seat next to their savior,
oftentimes we find out that Jesus,
that we read in the Word of God at the Last Supper,
when he took a towel that should have been
where he was being served,
he lowered it and tied it around his waist
and washed the feet of those that he sent an example for,
that they would serve.
He came as a ransom for many.
Jesus served with others in mind, not of himself.
He gave of himself to the very end.
And when service is our goal,
the beautiful thing of service is that unity becomes possible
even when we disagree, and I'm sure there's never any disagreement in this room.
You can disagree strongly, and oftentimes that happens both in this building and the
building that I call my church home, but you can still serve and love, honorably, when
the focus is on the people.
Different colleagues, different convictions, but the same definition of greatness, all of
us are called to serve. In my prayer for you, and I pray that your prayer is for me, that
God would give us the strength to keep serving well, especially when it's difficult. Can we
pray together? Father, I thank you for these men and women that are filling this room. Father,
you know every one of their needs, but there's nothing that you don't know. Father, I pray that
you would protect their children, their grandchildren,
their marriages.
Father, I pray that you would keep them far from evil
and alert to sin, that they would choose you,
that they would know that you made them for purpose
and on purpose.
And the Father, I pray that you would walk with them
in the days ahead, that you would give them wisdom
as they make decisions that will impact their families
and every family in our state.
Father, I pray for the family of Bill Embry
in his passing.
I pray that Father, you would be nearer
than you've ever been before,
that they would sent you, that they would love you
and know that they're loved by you.
It's in the name of Jesus, I pray.
Amen.
Would you join me for the Pledge of Allegiance?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America in the victory of the people
which is sentenced for the nation of the power of God.
If it is all with liberty and the best of our all.
Perfect.
Thank you, Brunstini.
Stay right there door keep as you may unlock the doors members you may join brother
Stephen out in the south any room and give show your appreciation thanks for

It is keeping Georgia while day, and I'm not speaking on that, but on that theme,
I am proud to welcome and celebrate the winners of our now annual State Park and
Historic Cites Art Contest, which Senator Halpern and I co-created and first launched last year with our
State's Department of Natural Resources.
We created this initiative specifically to celebrate two things.
One, if you don't know, Georgia has 48 beautiful state parks and 15 historic sites.
And two, we have some really talented youth.
This year we got nearly 250 submissions from high schoolers all over the state.
And today we welcome our top 10, which sitting on the jury I have to say was not particularly
easy to get down to.
If they are here, I ask them to rise.
Not sure I see them.
I think they're over in the Senate, but we still want to recognize them.
And if you want to see that we have all the top art work featured in the South Wing starting
at 1 p.m. today and reception, celebrating the winners at 230, go out and see our beautiful
state parks and historic sites.
Put your real thanks not only to Senator Halpern but also DNR and especially Austin,
Sir and Commissioner Rabin, we congratulate all the winners and participants and I yield
the well.
Thank you representative.
Liam, good job, Judge.
I want to go see what kind of job you did, so I'll go check them out.
That's all good.
We appreciate those folks participating.
A representative Willis.
Representative Inga Willis.
And a friend.
You got friends coming okay?
I do.
Hi friends.

We're representing Kendrick.
Thank you.
Are you sure?
Good to know if I need a friend.
Are you sure she's your friend?
I think she is.
my friend and my sister. Good morning, colleagues. 118 years ago on the campus at the Howard University,
something incredible occurred. In the midst of lynching rates being in at all time high,
an African-American attendance rates in college being in at all time low, 16 scholars, 16
Black women, one in particular.
I had a photo of Etsy.
You didn't get it.
Ethel Hedgeman had a vision, a vision fair,
that Black women should be able to assemble as sisters.
And the first and finest Black sisterhood on record
was founded, Alpha Cabo Alpha Sorority Incorporated.
January 15, 1908, on the campus of Howard University,
118 years later, we continue to serve globally together.
in our communities as well as in yours.
I'd also like to recognize our Madam Leader,
who has received the esteemed distinction
of Golden Soul World, which represents 50 years
of service and sisterhood.
And so on today, wish an Alpha Kappa Alpha woman
in your life happy founders day.
And please know, if it's unfamiliar to you,
each organization in a divine nine continues to work together
in education and health care for voting rights.
to be on the front line of change
for the black community,
for the betterment of this world and beyond.
Thank you, Alpha Kappa Alpha,
and thank you, sweet 16 founders.
Have a great day.
Thank you, Representative Willis and friends.
Representative Santos is recognized for a morning order.
You have some folks coming with you.
College, join Representative Santos.

Today is Georgia Flex Day at the Capitol.
Flex stands for foundational leadership and entrepreneur experience.
They teach high school students valuable business skills.
And then the students go on to create real businesses,
provide real products, and make real money.
It began in 2020 in Fitzgerald and was the brain child
of Melissa Dark and her team
at the Fitzgerald-Binhill Chamber.
Melissa is joining us.
Melissa, if you want to, you can stay in and let everybody see.
I knew when I met her, I wanted to be her friend
because she is so involved in her community
and cares so much for young people.
Six years later, they flex is a 20 site serving
22 counties teaching high school students,
business sense.
And today, 100 students and their leaders are here
to learn about the legislative process.
So please help me welcome the Flex Program, Georgia Flex,
to the House.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
That's pretty cool, Flex.
Thanks for being here, and thanks for recognizing.
That completes our morning orders.
Members, I'm going to let you, if we all will,
for just a few minutes, we're going to welcome the Senate.
I think at nine, 10, excuse me, 10, 45.
So if you need to 10 to something for just for a minute
before they're here, which you best get in your seat
because they may hijack your seat.
You aren't careful, so it'd be a good thing
to be in your seat.
I also stand in these.
