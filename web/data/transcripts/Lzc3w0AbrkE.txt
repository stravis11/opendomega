Kelly.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning.
>> I have the honor and pleasure this
morning of introducing the Reverend
George Wilcox Brown III.
Also happens to be my first cousin.
His father and my mother were brother
and sister and grew up in with their
other two siblings in Griffin, Georgia.
And as the only boy in my family will
was a brother I never had. And I think
we got a picture of him somewhere here.
So I'm the one on the left, cool and
collected, and he's on the one on the
right, you know, acting a fool.
And he still does that today a good bit.
So um born only seven days apart. Um
March 31st, March 23rd, we spent our
youth terrorizing my sister. Um hunting,
fishing on the farm. Every weekend we
could spend together. We tried to over
holidays. great childhood and I was his
best man in his wedding a few years
back. But he was born and raised in
Griffin, spent his high school years in
Virginia, uh attended the University of
the South at Swany and Yale Divinity
School. He was a Thomas J. Watson fellow
and spent a year living with Christian
monks in Europe, Africa, and the South
Pacific.
He was ordained a priest in the
Episcopal Dasis of Georgia in 2006. He
served for 12 years in Dallas, Texas and
has been a priest at All Saints
Episcopal Church in Thomasville, Georgia
since 2018. He's published a book on
theology and conservation, worked for
several years as a consultant in the
area of marine fisheries policy at both
the state and federal levels. He's an
avid hunter and outdoorsman and
fisherman. He's married to Kate. They
have two children, George Tucker and
Stella May, and an English cocker named
General Borgar. His great great great
great-grandfather James Epinger was a
member of this body, George House, from
1837 to 1841. Friends, I give you the
Reverend Will Brown.
Good morning. This is uh biggest church
I've ever been in, I think. Uh it's an
honor to be here and thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and thank you, cousin
representative.
Uh some of you know uh Representative
Cannon got his start in field artillery.
Uh and it's fair to say I think that he
really got his start when we were kids
and we used to shoot each other with BB
guns and bottle rockets and that went on
until he shot me in the eye one day and
then our parents put a quick halt to
that. But I think that's how he got his
start in artillery. That's probably how
I got my start as a man of peace.
Firm believer in peace now. It's one of
the few things I have in common with
Saddam Hussein's army as I've been shot
at by Colonel Cannon.
On a serious note, I want to uh
acknowledge everybody here who served in
our military and our law enforcement and
emergency services. All the people here
who willingly have put themselves
between us and the things, the powers in
the world that would do us harm. I never
served myself, but I've told my wife I'm
a veteran of a thousand psychic wars.
And that's a good place to start with
what I want to say to you today in
brief. We are at war. If you look at the
news, I think you'll intuitively know
what I'm talking about. We are at war.
It's a spiritual war. And we, I think,
reflexively think that spiritual means
nebulous and sort of unreal. But in
fact, the opposite is the case. And
lately, it's kind of starting to break
out into the material order and not
least into the domain of our politics.
My dear legislators,
in a certain sense, you are on the front
lines of this war. And I want to distill
a little bit of wisdom from God's word
for you this morning.
First, St. Paul said, "We're fighting
for an immortal crown." Which means the
stakes in this world, in this war. The
stakes are eternal stakes.
Secondly, our enemies are not who we
think they are. We fight not against
flesh and blood, not against people, but
against principalities, against powers,
against the world rulers of this present
darkness, against spiritual wickedness
in high places.
We're fighting against three things. A
corrupt and deathbound world system,
against Satan, and against the lusts of
our own flesh.
In his great work, which some of you
have probably read, the Gulag
archipilago,
Alexander Sultaniten contemplated how
Russia in his day became such a
totalitarian hellscape and he came to
this conclusion. He said, "Grdually, it
was disclosed to me that the line
separating good and evil passes not
where we think, not between nations and
states, not between classes of people or
races, or even between political
parties. But the line separating good
and evil runs through the middle of
every human heart.
We all have the potential to do good or
to do evil.
Three, that puts your work as
legislators into a pretty important
light.
Our Georgia Constitution says that our
government exists to perpetuate the
principles of free government, to ensure
justice to all, to preserve peace, to
promote the interest and happiness of
the citizen and of the family, to
transmit to posterity the enjoyment of
liberty. That's a pretty good
distillation of the principles of
liberal government everywhere. But
here's the thing. In 1798, John Adams
wrote to the Massachusetts militia. His
words are as apt or more apt perhaps
today than they were in 1798.
said this, "We have no government armed
with power capable of contending with
human passions unbridled by morality and
religion. Our constitution, and this
applies to our Georgia Constitution as
well as to our federal constitution, our
constitution was made only for a moral
and religious people, and it is entirely
inadequate for the government of any
other.
That means that your work as a
legislature is hard and I think it's
going to get harder as time goes on. But
it's also crucially important.
And it means your work has to begin in
your own heart and in your own home with
your own family and your own
relationships with other people.
And only with such a beginning, only
with such a grounding, will your work in
this place be a radiant blessing to your
constituents and to the rest of our
state and to our nation as God intends
it for to be.
If you'll bow your heads, I want to pray
for you.
Stand if you're able.
Almighty God, fountain of all wisdom,
your statutes are good and gracious, and
your law is truth. We thank you for the
state of Georgia, our home. You've given
this good land to us for our heritage.
We humbly ask you that we may always
prove ourselves a people mindful of your
favor and glad to do your will. Bless
our state with honorable industry, sound
learning, and pure manners. Save us from
violence, discord, and confusion, from
pride, and arrogance, and from every
evil way. Defend our liberties and
fashion into one united people the
multitudes whom sin, Satan, and
self-interest would seek to divide.
Guide and bless this house. endo its
members with the spirit of wisdom
together with the Senate and with our
governor and especially today we pray
for the judiciary
all of whom we the citizens have
entrusted with the authority of
government. Grant that this body may
obtain may ordain for our governance
only such things as please you to the
glory of your name and the welfare of
our people. Grant that there may be
justice and peace throughout Georgia and
that through obedience to your law we
may show forth your praise among the
states of our nation and among the
nations of the earth. In the time of
prosperity fill our hearts with
gratitude and in the day of trouble
suffer not our trust in you to falter.
All of which we ask through Jesus Christ
your son our Lord. Amen.
If you'll remain standing and join me in
the pledge. I pledge allegiance
for all.
Doorkeepers, you may unlock the doors.
Now, that was that. You didn't you
didn't even the score with him when he
talked about that photo of you as
babies. But I can look at these two and
I know who won the battles when they
were growing up though. Don't y'all
know? No doubt. Brother Will, thank you
for those words. They are inspiration to
us. We appreciate you being here. You
may join Brother Will in the South Annie

here. U Chairlady Taylor.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I'll try to
do this as quick as possible. Um, we
know we have some families from the
coast that are visiting us today and
some of their loved ones were part of a
a tragedy that took place 55 years ago.
Since the ground beneath Woodbine,
Georgia shook with a force that could be
felt for 50 miles. But for those in
Camden County, the trimmers didn't just
shake the earth. They shatter families,
silenced a generation of mothers, and
left a scar on our state's history. On
February 3rd of 1971, theo Chemical
Corporation building one M132 wasn't
just a factory. It was a place where
dreams were being built. At a time when
opportunities were scarce, hundreds of
local residents,
primarily black women, went to work each
and every day. But at 10:53 a.m., a
spark in a curing room turned the
building into a furnace. The fire was
swift and the explosion took 29 lives.
And Mr. Speaker, if I can have everyone
to stand as we remember these heroes and
shurros,
uh, Georgians that died on February 3rd,
1971. If I may just call their name.

And it is my honor to present you today
the Justice of the Supreme Court, the
Honorable Nails Peterson.
Lieutenant Governor Jones, Speaker
Burns, President Prom Walker, Speaker
Prom Jones, members of the General
Assembly,
Presiding Justice Warren, and my fellow
justices, Chief Judge Brown and my
friends on the Court of Appeals, other
judges and fellow Georgians.
Every year, the governor reports on the
state of the state, and that report
always includes the announcement of
significant policy proposals and budget
priorities. The subjects of that speech
are critical to your work as
legislators.
This speech is different. Unlike the
governor, the courts have no formal role
in the legislative process.
Sometimes chief justices use this as a
time to brag on the good work of Georgia
courts or talk about promising judicial
branch policy initiatives. And I'll do
some of that because there's a lot of
great work to tell you about.
But today, I principally want to talk to
you about what the judicial system is
for and to remind us all of the role we
must each play to support and defend the
rule of law.
Central to the rule of law is the idea
that no person is above the law's
requirements or beneath its protections.
It's the idea that law applies equally
to everyone and the courts apply it
impartially and independently.
And today I can proudly report that the
state of Georgia's judiciary is strong
because Georgia's commitment to the rule
of law is strong.
The state of our judiciary will remain
strong only so long as we remain
committed to the rule of law. The rule
of law has always required defending and
today is no exception. The judicial oath
calls Georgia judges to do equal rights
for the poor and the rich. In other
words, for the weak and the powerful. Of
course, the rule of law is rarely tested
when the powerful or the popular win in
court. Results that go the other way can
sometimes be a different matter. The
rule of law has always been fragile
because by its very nature, it requires
the strong and the rich to accept
results in favor of the weak and the
poor. It requires popular majorities of
all kinds to accept outcomes in favor of
small unpopular minority groups. It
requires the most powerful of all, the
government, to accept and obey limits on
government power.
This rule of law that we enjoy as
Americans has rarely happened throughout
human history. What we have had in this
country for 250 years, as imperfect as
it has been, especially here in the
South, is so rare. And yet, we often
take it for granted. If we are to
continue to enjoy the many blessings
that flow from the rule of law, we
cannot continue taking it for granted.
Each of us, all of us must do our part,
whatever that may be, to defend the rule
of law. A critical part is this. When
you hear about judicial decisions whose
outcomes you don't like, don't
reflexively question the court's
legitimacy. It's okay to disagree, even
to protest. But the rule of law will not
survive when the legitimacy of judicial
decisions and those who make them is
routinely questioned every time there's
an unpopular outcome.
And here I should add a word on what the
rule of law is not. The rule of law is
not rule by judges.
The law's constraints fall most strongly
on judges. If we push against those
constraints, we ourselves undermine the
rule of law. We must not stray out of
our limited scope of deciding the cases
before us according to the text of the
law that other people make.
Judges talk about the rule of law all
the time, but it's also critical for the
legislature.
Neither of our branches has the
authority or the ability to exercise
force. That function is reserved for the
executive. Instead, the work product of
both of our branches is just our words.
Judicial branch words come in a jury's
verdict or in a written judicial
opinion. We expect that these mere words
will control the outcome of criminal
prosecutions, decide which parent gets
custody of their child, resolve matters
with millions of dollars at stake, and
everything in between, one case at a
time.
Legislative words work a little
differently. One of you puts words on a
page, and after a lot of work, the rest
of you press red or green buttons. And
with enough green buttons, those words
reshape Georgia law for everyone.
The words on the pages of both branches,
although they operate differently, share
this in common. The rule of law is the
only thing that give any of our words
power.
Without the rule of law, you are all
wasting your time and we judges and
robes are just playing a strange game of
dress up.
This state capital is a building for
policymaking and sometimes even
politics. Policymaking and politics are
team sports. But judges don't play for a
team. We wear robes, not jerseys.
Except, I suppose, for the occasional
Saturday in the fall.
But the rule of law depends on judges
following the law impartially and
independently.
One key opportunity you have this
session to strengthen healthy judicial
independence and impartiality is by
passing House Resolution 251 sponsored
by Representative Kimberly New. This
constitutional amendment would end the
partisan election of probate judges.
Last year, you passed House Bill 426,
also sponsored by Representative New and
by Senator Rick Williams, which ended
the partisan election of magistrate
judges, and we thank you for that.
Taking this final step with HR 251 will
ensure that all elected Georgia judges
are elected solely on a nonpartisan
basis.
Judges must be impartial and we must
also conduct ourselves in such a way as
to be perceived as impartial.
Requiring any of us to publicly and
formally align ourselves with a
political party can only undermine the
public's perception of the judiciary is
impartial.
I am grateful to former governors Roy
Barnes and Nathan Deal for recognizing
this truth and for jointly endorsing
this constitutional amendment.
Another important step that we are
grateful you took last year was
reforming Georgia's judicial
compensation system. Representative Rob
Leverett and Senator Bo Hatchet carried
House Bills 85 and 86, which modernized
an archaic and splintered system of
compensating Georgia's statewide and
superior court judges. And Chairman Matt
Hatchet and Chairman Blake Tillery
oversaw the funding of this system
consistent with the new model. We are
grateful to you all and we look forward
to this new model strengthening the
judiciary over time.
And what better way to transition from
judicial compensation than to talk about
how hard your courts are working. And we
are. Annually collected statewide trial
court data is not without limitations,
but I'd like to highlight case filing
increases in a few specific circuits
around the state. For example, in the
South Georgia circuit between Albenny
and the Florida border, case filings
increased nearly 44% between 2023 and
2024.
Ne just next door in Dicab cases have
increased 17% during the same time
period. And in the Chattahuchi Judicial
Circuit, which includes Columbus,
they've gone up 14%.
And we know that trial courts are
working hard across the state because
appellet court case loads have gone up
year-over-year. The Supreme Court's
direct appeal case load has gone up 25%.
The Court of Appeals direct appeal case
load in the same time period has gone up
24%.
Because trial courts have to decide a
case before an appellet court ever sees
it. Our appellet trend suggests that the
trial court's workload and output has
been trending upward over time.
Now, while deciding cases is the core
function of the judiciary, there's only
so much we can say about that. Judicial
ethics rules prohibit us from talking
about specific cases. So, our public
focus is often instead on judicial
policy initiatives. And I'm about to
shift my focus to some of those. But I
want to preface that shift with the
acknowledgement that our work deciding
cases is the critical work that courts
do. And all the policy stuff is
significant only to the extent that it
enables and improves our work of
deciding cases.
In recent years, we have worked to
improve the quality and reliability of
data related to juvenile courts and
foster care, an area of great importance
and interest to our branches. And I hope
you are seeing in the data that you
receive uh those results. Our court
improvement program in partnership with
the Department of Family and Children
Services is piloting a new model
intended to reduce the time from removal
to reunification for Georgia children in
foster care. This joint project is
operating in Cobb Dab Fulton and Gwynet
and we hope will provide lessons and
opportunities for expansion.
Additionally, the juvenile courts in
Athens, Clark, Gwinet, and Troop
counties are serving as pilot sites for
Georgia Thrive, Georgia's new infant
toddler court program. The product of
the work of many partners across the
health care, child welfare, legal, and
public policy communities. This
multi-year initiative seeks to address
the unique needs and opportunities
related to children from birth to age
three who find themselves in our
juvenile courts
through obviously no fault of their own.
We are grateful that legislators
regularly lend their time to our branch
on on initiatives like this in the
interest of helping improve the
administration of justice.
And with that service in mind, I want to
take this opportunity to publicly extend
the condolences of the judicial branch
on the passing of a remarkable woman who
committed her time to serving on our
court's committee on justice for
children and was a tireless voice for
young Georgians, Representative Mandy
Ballinger.
Her
life of service has left a legacy that
will echo for generations.
We have recently concluded two important
study committees in the judicial branch.
The first is the Judicial Council Ad Hoc
Committee on Artificial Intelligence in
the Courts, led by Justice Andrew
Pinson, Vice Chief Judge Elizabeth Goil,
and Superior Court Judge Steve Kelly. As
AI's power and reach continues to
advance rapidly, we all have to keep up.
And AI poses both risk and opportunity
for the judicial system. On the risk
side, the most publicized problems are
likely the least significant.
You may have heard stories about lawyers
filing briefs that are AI generated that
cite non-existent cases because the AI
tool invented them. That has happened
here in Georgia. It shouldn't. And the
lawyers that have have done it expose
themselves to serious discipline under
existing rules. But the risk that kind
of misconduct poses the system is
relatively minimal as long as judges
read the cases that are cited in their
briefs. The more significant risks that
we know about anyway are things like
fabricated evidence. AI's capacity to
generate false recordings or images
presents a serious challenge to the
court systems historic approach to
authenticating evidence. We don't yet
have answers to these problems, but we
continue to work on them. AI may also
offer opportunities. As a reminder, a
core part of the rule of law is that no
one is beneath the law's protections,
but in 2023,
over 420,000
Georgia civil cases involved at least
one party without a lawyer.
That's over one-third of the civil cases
in Georgia's superior state, probate,
and magistrate courts. And while
Georgia's Constitution guarantees the
right to represent yourself in court,
it's a safe bet that most of those
420,000 unrepresented parties lacked a
lawyer because they couldn't afford one.
And in some counties, even if you can
afford a lawyer, there may not be one to
hire. 54 Georgia counties have 10 or
fewer attorneys and eight counties, up
from seven last year, have no lawyers at
all. The rule of law cannot be available
only to those with access to lawyers.
And as AI tools,
I agree,
and as AI tools improve, it may be that
AI has a role to play in closing that
gap. But we're not waiting for AI to
solve this problem for us. The second
study committee that recently completed
its work is the Supreme Court Study
Committee on Legal Regulatory Reform,
led by Justice Carla Wong McMillan and
Presiding Judge Steve Dillard. It's easy
to look at the problem of unrepresented
litigants and decide that the government
should just throw money at it. That is
not what this committee did.
The Georgia Constitution vests the
exclusive authority for regulating the
practice of law in the Supreme Court and
we do that through the state bar, an arm
of the court. This committee studied our
regulation of the practice of law to
determine whether restrictions and
limitations
on that we have imposed on non- lawyers
assisting with legal issues might be
making this problem worse.
The committee recommended that the court
consider a pilot project in which we
permit trained non- lawyers to perform
certain limited legal tasks.
Other states have been experimenting
with similar models and we have the
opportunity to use what worked for them
and to avoid what didn't. As we evaluate
this recommendation, I am hopeful that
our creativity in lifting regulatory
limitations may be a useful tool in
closing the justice gap and ensuring
that no Georgian is beneath the law's
protections.
And just as the rule of law requires
that all people enjoy the law's
protections, it also requires that we
protect judges from those who would do
them harm because of their rulings.
Threats against judges have received
national attention the last several
years. Just a couple weeks ago, an
Indiana judge and his wife were shot
through their front door by a criminal
defendant with a pending case in front
of him. And the US Marshall Service
reports more than 560 threats against
federal judges during FY2025 alone.
Georgia, on the other hand, has never
had a process for tracking threats
against Georgia judges comprehensively,
thanks to the great work of the Judicial
Council Standing Committee on Security
Led by Justice Shan Ellen Lrua and
presiding judge Brian Rickman and
supported by strategic investments that
you have made. We are working toward
such a process. And even with the
existing limitations, we have already
tracked 35 threats against 30 justices
and judges since late 2024,
resulting in nine arrests.
This year, we will look to build on the
progress that we have already made. As I
mentioned in greater detail several
weeks ago to the joint appropriations
committees, the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals budget requests seek a
modest increase for funding for a joint
effort to enhance judicial security that
if funded will pay dividends across the
state. I thank each of you for the
support that you have given us in
improving judicial security and I ask
that you continue to make it a priority
given all of these challenges. Why do
Georgia judges persist in the hard work
of making the rule of law real for
Georgians?
I think the answer is the same answer
for you members of the General Assembly.
You too face threats to your security.
You too face all sorts of challenges in
your community through your service.
Both judges and legislators face a lot
of the same challenges. We are all in
this together
and we all face those challenges headon
because we care about our communities.
We care about the people we serve. We
care about doing the right thing. And
above all, we are committed to
fulfilling our oaths.
Your oath is a bit different from our
oath because our roles are different.
The judicial oath promises independence
and impartiality.
In contrast, the legislative oath
promises the exercise of judgment in the
service of the interests and prosperity
of the state. But despite these
differences, both the legislative and
judicial oaths are rooted in the promise
to uphold the Constitution of the State
of Georgia and the Constitution of the
United States. When we take these oaths,
we make a promise to our communities. We
make a promise to those who elected us.
We make a promise to our families. And
for many of us, we also make a promise
to God.
This aspect of the oath as a promise to
God has shaped the history of our legal
system.
In fact, in colonial England and for
most of our history as a state, criminal
defendants were prohibited from
testifying under oath, lest in their
desire for a quiddle, they brought upon
themselves divine judgment. Georgia was
the last state in the Union to change
that rule. We didn't change it until
1962.
In the Catholic tradition, St. Thomas
Moore is the patron saint of lawyers.
But he wasn't just a lawyer. He also
served as speaker of the House of
Commons
and then Lord Chancellor of England
under Henry VIII. He's a great example
of both judges and legislators to
emulate. He ultimately gave his life to
avoid breaking his oath. His commitment
to keep that promise to God is reflected
no matter the cost is reflected in his
last words which characterized himself
as the king's good servant and God's
first. That's pretty good. But of
course, as we like to remind our British
friends every July 4th and especially
during this 250th anniversary of
American independence here in the United
States, we don't have a king. As the
Constitution makes clear here, the
people are sovereign.
And so as
And so as you return to your legislative
business and we return to our judicial
business, let us all commit to keep our
oes to the Constitution and the rule of
law it embodies. If we do, we will truly
be the people's good servants as we seek
to be God's first. Thank you. May God
bless each of you, our great state of
Georgia and the United States of
America.
Thank you, Jess Peterson.
Thoroughly enjoyed that. We greatly
appreciate that and we greatly
appreciate all the judiciary members
here. Uh and thank you all for your
service and dedication to the state of
Georgia.

Okay, members, we um we'll move on

the member in the well, Representative
Jackson recognized for an afternoon
order.
>> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
My moment of black history is one of our
own, Julian Bond. He used to sit right
over there where Representative Edna
Jackson sits today. I am a product of
the civil rights movement. I was born
into a story that was written in in the
fires of resilience. On January 10th,
1966
one day before I would enter this world,
the Georgia General Assembly uh did not
allow for Junior Bond to be seated. Uh
they refused to seat him because he had
the audacity to follow his conscience.
Uh they call his descent unpatriotic,
but Junior Bond knew the truth. Uh
there's a famous picture that's on the
fourth floor um that recognized this
very thing. But Junior Bond said, "True
patriotism is demanding that your
country live up to its own promise." And
while he fought for his seat, he didn't
just give the opportunity for him to not
be seated. He picked up his pen. He
organized. He understood that the
struggle for civil rights in Georgia was
tied to the struggle for human dignity
across the globe. But nearly 100 years
prior to that, September 1868, Henry
McNeel Turner, another moment of black
history, stood before the same Georgia
general, Georgia legislature and protest
his expulsion of black representatives.
In closing, here we are in 2026, 60
years later since Bond was denied, 158
years since Turner was expelled. And yet
we continue this fight to be heard, to
be seen, and to be uh recognized. My
birth date, Mr. Speaker, was not a
coincidence. It was a commission. And I
don't just admire Junior Bond's legacy,
but I embrace it every time. time I
refuse to be silenced, I am honoring the
man who was told no so one day I can
continue to say yes. And with that, I
yield the well.
>> Thank you, Representative.
Representative
Ali,
