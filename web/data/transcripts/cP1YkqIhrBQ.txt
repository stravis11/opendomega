TRANSCRIPT
----------
The Senate debates about which pink works best and tonight's show will continue with
that theme.
Good evening and welcome to Lawmakers. It's Legislative Day 31. I'm Donald
Aurean Atlanta. During the 40 days of the Georgia General Assembly,
legislators deal with serious issues that sometimes lead to heated debates,
tense discourse, and an uncomfortable atmosphere. Despite that, they actually share
a lot of mutual respect. Regardless of their political differences,
there are also plenty of lighthearted moments with good nature teasing between both sides of the aisle.
That's why tonight we're switching gears a bit and having some fun with legislation
and more under the gold dome.
We'll discuss some fascinating bills aimed at giving Georgia official designations for
everything from color greens to a state heritage horse.
There's a lot of spirit behind these proposals.
And later, we'll talk with the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Maya Prabhu,
who for several years has come up with the best dressed lawmakers list.
One of the winners joins us.
On a more serious note, we'll discuss legislation that's an outgrowth
of Fulton County's trial against rapper Young Thug.
First, Capitol correspondent Sarah Callis tells us how each chamber
is now looking at bills passed across the hall.
Hi, Donna. Today at the Capitol, the Senate approved new hunting attire
and the House debated a familiar issue.
In the Senate, two bills came to the floor.
HB81 is an initiative that would form a compact with a minimum of seven other states
to allow school psychologists to work in any of those states by allowing
equivalent licensing. We are an
desperate native school psychologist. There's a shortage like we see in a lot of
our workforce areas and this bill will help with our
workforce shortage in that area. The bill was passed 48 to 2
and HB 167 if losing your orange hunting vest when you want to go hunting has
as you're seeing red, relax.
Think pink.
No longer will you be required
to wear only a fluorescent orange vest,
but fluorescent pink, 500 square inches of fluorescent pink
will be sufficient.
HB 167 does not limit the use of fluorescent pink
to females.
Gentlemen like my friend, the country lawyer
from the 42nd who's very comfortable in pink
and his manhood, he'll be able to wear that
to the great outdoors as well.
But there seemed to be some questions
as to which pink was best.
Are you aware that there's 240 different shades
of pink I now I am?
And is there a specific shade in this bill
that we're gonna recognize as the official pink
of Georgia Hunters?
It's fluorescent pink, that's what we've addressed.
I've gotten several calls from my district about pink.
is pink and pink, is that the same color?
And would that be recognized?
Senator, I live about two miles from your district.
And the higher we get an elevation there,
the longer the draw on the color.
So red is red and pink is pink.
Despite some humorous filibustering by Democrats,
it was passed unanimously.
In the house, issues concerning the city of Mulberry
were up for debate once again.
SB 139 would allow the city to annex certain parcels of land and surrounding unincorporated
Gwyneth.
This type of bad fate, this type of gridlock, and the refusal to provide the constituents
that I represent would call them and other members will represent from receiving the
services that they are entitled to that they pay for what their property taxes is unacceptable
and it does warrant action by the General Assembly when things get this bad.
But Democrats representing Gwinnett County oppose the expansion.
Well annexation impacts every single citizen of Gwinnett County. It impacts every single
legislator who represents and is a member of the Gwinnett delegation because it is county money
that is otherwise being taken away.
The bill passed 96 to 74 along party lines.
The house then moved on to another Mulberry related bill,
SB 138, which dealt with Gwyneth Sovereign Immunity and access to county services.
The bill does include a waiver of Sovereign Immunity and circumstances where Gwyneth County
fails to comply with law as to how Mulberry is to be treated just for this transition period.
But once again, Democrats said no.
I would not call it more, baby, because I would call it FreeBerry.
You all heard my colleague, FreeBerry, because they want everything free.
They are looking for everything free.
They're looking for free police service.
They're looking for free EMS, free lawyers.
I mean, everything is free.
That bill also passed along party lines.
In the afternoon, the House took up a bill dealing with health risks of some pesticides.
SB-144 would prevent pesticide manufacturers from being held liable for failing to disclose
health risks, other than what is required from the FDA.
The bill garnered strong pushback from Democrats, who say it allows companies to put consumers
lives at risk.
I refuse to be used by a corporation as a shield for the consequences of their actions.
In fact, just yesterday, in the past 24 hours, because the point of this bill is it says,
you know what, the standard that we are going to go by is the federal one.
And what this body is trying to do is try to use federal government inefficiencies to
say, we've done our due diligence.
But no, we haven't.
The EPA within the past 24 hours not only has announced almost 1,300 layoffs, but in addition
has announced multiple deregulations related to our air, to our water, to the things that
we need every single day. But Republicans say farmers need access to as much
technology as possible. We have to have food in this country. It's a national
security. You think egg prices went up. You wait till we can't get food in this
country. When our production starts going down, the oil population is going up.
You better hold on to your wallet. The bail passed 101 to 58. Also today
The Asian American and Pacific Islander caucus held a press event to mark the fourth anniversary of the Atlanta spot shootings.
This is a moment that leaves us with profound sadness and anger,
but it is also a moment that demands our unity, our compassion, and our resolve.
To the families and loved ones of the victims,
your loss has been our community's loss.
I hope we continue to remember to stand on the side of love, respect, and dignity for all.
Donna, with nine days left in the session, we're still waiting for the Senate's
tour reform bills to make their way to the House floor. As you know, that's
Governor Cap's top legislative priority this session. That's my Capitol report.
Thanks, Sarah. The full and county DA's prosecution of rapper Young Thug and other members of Young Thug
The Glyph YSL became the longest and most expensive trial in Georgia history.
It accused the defendants of operating a criminal enterprise under Georgia's Rico, or Racketeer
Influence Corrupt Organization Act.
Part of the prosecution's evidence came from Song lyrics, a move that upset many and
the creative arts community.
From the beginning, they blasted prosecutors for going after artistic expression.
In November of 2022, artists and industry leaders took out a full page ad in the Atlanta
and the New York Times called Art on Trial,
Protect Black Art.
One of the creatives unhappy with the prosecution
actually joins us.
She's Grammy-nominated songwriter
and Democratic representative, Inga Willis of Atlanta,
and she's on the House Creative Arts
and Entertainment Committee.
Thanks for coming on Lawmakers.
Always.
Have love having you on.
So to give the audience some background on you,
your connection to this issue, you co-wrote,
you know what's up for Donnell Jones,
And you also did the lyrics for Anthony Hamilton's song,
twisted on Carlos Santana's record.
Yes, yes.
Originally a record written for Al Green.
Yeah, no kidding.
In the music business, you know,
you don't always land the record in the moment.
Sometimes years later it'll come back.
So with that particular record,
I was asked to bring in someone who sounded like Al Green
and there was an aspiring artist,
living in a basement apartment next door to me in Harlem,
named Anthony Hamilton.
No.
I offered him $20.
and a pack of ramen noodles to come and sing a record for me
and he did gladly and about three years later.
It made it on a Carlos Santana's album
and he called me from the airport on his way to Italy.
So that's a part of my background, but yes.
That's so cool and you worked with TLC
and that was my professional introduction
to the music business.
I was through Lisa Lopez and TLC.
So this is personal for you.
So what were your first thoughts
when you heard about this trial with Young Thud?
It's, we live in a country of polar opposites sometimes.
And especially in the seasons, there's so many hypocrisy.
So it gave me pause to hear people
tout freedom of speech every chance they get,
and then closing on artistic expression as just that.
And so I'm a principled woman.
It was just a hypocrisy of such.
You can't scream free speech for one thing,
and then art is life, life is art, you know,
artistic expression should be protected
by the First Amendment.
Okay.
You assigned on the HB214,
which is actually Representative Eric Bell's bill.
It is.
And as the main sponsor,
but deals with making artistic expression,
even beyond lyrics, not just the lyrics,
in admissible at trial.
Explain what that would actually do.
Well, through my lens, again,
It was just extremely principled for me.
And this was not a new concept.
This is something that had been talked about
legislative seasons before.
And Representative Bell has come in and done an excellent job
at bringing it to the forefront.
It also talked to Representative Casey Carpenter
about it as well.
And so if we're going to have energy for free speech,
I want us to keep that same energy
for the artistic community.
If there has been a crime committed,
bring forth evidence and such and let the process be what it may be.
But when it comes to artistic expression,
it should be protected by the First Amendment.
It was just that simple for me.
I've written for all types of artists.
I've done hip-hop, I've done R&B, I've done rock music,
I've done political speeches, I'm a writer.
And so when it comes to the written word and the protection
of the protection of artistic expression,
I'm serious about that.
The Harlem Renaissance was an artistic movement.
Difficult conversations were had because of this artistry.
And I believe that these artists have the same rights
to that same protection.
You guys had a hard time pushing this through.
It didn't get a hearing.
It's still out there.
So next year, I expect maybe you're
going to fight a little bit more for it?
Absolutely.
And I think this is my second year coming to see you
when we were pushing for that statewide music office as well.
So sometimes the legislation doesn't stick the landing,
doesn't get the hearing, doesn't become law.
But it doesn't mean we won't bring it back again
the next year.
these are things that we will continue to fight for
and want to make people aware of the issues.
And you're getting that information out there.
And you're going to stick around for our next segment.
So thanks for doing that.
Because coming up, we're going to talk about
the best dress lawmakers list that came out
in the Atlanta Journal Constitution today.
The A.J.C.'s Maya Prabhu will tell us who won
and why coming up.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the state capital during the session and year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen.
I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman.
People wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it by acknowledging our own worth.
Oh please, don't continue.
Understanding the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
This is amazing.
No, I'm excited now.
Pompeii is a battle against time.
You think I'm joking, but look at this, it really happened.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
The history teaches us to honor the past.
When you look back, they're like, wow, that was pretty special.
This is something that's actually altering the course of history.
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
Welcome back to Lawmakers, I'm Donna Lowry.
If you're a Lawmakers regular, you may remember our interviews recently with representatives
Casey Carpenter and Rick Towson.
And our discussion about their interesting yet quirky bills.
Carpenter's bill makes core bread the official state bread of Georgia.
And Townsend's bill makes Brunswick stew the official state stew.
Well, they're not the only lawmakers with unconventional legislation.
I talked with four other lawmakers who authored bills that are a little more on the fun side.
Marsh tacky horses along the coast, they go all the way from like sleep marries all the
way up to South Carolina, North Carolina, and then down into Florida as well.
We've got a Videlia queen in there, Videlia onion queen, and I hopefully be the next
I like green flea.
One must wear at least 500 square inches of fluorescent orange.
If you're hunting in certain situations,
this bill just simply adds fluorescent pink to that
so that you would have an option.
I was approached by the native plant society
in my district to bring this bill.
And they are interested in promoting us,
everyone planning native plants in Georgia
because it has so many benefits.
You got HB466, the marsh tacky horse
as the official Georgia Heritage Horse.
And I know that heritage horse breed is important.
Tell us about it.
OK.
The horse tanky horse came over with the Spanish
about five to 600 years ago.
And they were used in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War.
Then they did Americans used them for every day war.
They're a smaller horse, about 14 hands tall,
which is about 55 to 60 inches.
So they're pretty durable.
And the hooves are bigger.
So the way they picked up the marsh thing is that they don't get stuck in the mud because
they're closer bigger.
And they can navigate where a bigger horse would get bogged down.
So that's why they were used to log.
And the Gologici people used to, and they used them for every day work.
They could plow a garden or they could ride them to go hunting.
So they were very durable horses.
You know, the population is diminished in the south,
it's about 2,000 left, and about 200 in Georgia.
And the people are starting to worry
that they're going to just totally go out of existence.
And so if they lose the horse, we also lose the history.
And that's a big part of me that we teach children.
This horse was threatened through our history
in Georgia for the last several hundred years,
and why it's important.
So that's why we went ahead and did the bill to help some folks.
And that brings awareness to the people
who tried to increase the populations.
It's a beautiful horse, but it's like the marsh horse
and tacky tacky is an only English word for common.
So what it is, it's a common marsh horse.
What it is.
And it was used, like I say, by people,
Francis Meary and the Swamp Fox in the Revolution War,
he wrote a marsh tacky horse in the troops in Civil War
in the south, they used marsh tacky horses.
This is what they had.
In color greens as the officials say greens
and pot liquor as the official dipping sauce
for the state bread,
which if representative Casey Carpenter gets his way,
it will be cornbread.
Where did you come up with this?
Well, everybody knows I'm a foodie, one and two.
When I heard that there was something called cornbread
as the official bread of Georgia,
and there was a legal argument on the floor
of where they should be cornbread
or where they should be biscuits, ooh.
I could not be outdone.
I was not going to let these guys outdo me,
even though his cornbread is the best cornbread I have ever had.
But I started thinking, you know,
collard greens has so many medicinal purposes.
A lot of people don't know what potlicker is.
And it's called P-O-T-L-I-K-K-A.
That's it. Well, back in the slavery days,
I had a press release out and I wanted to tell people how serious this was.
So back in Africa, when they started growing the greens there, they started cooking them and they came over to America and they were planting them here.
Not only did other ethnic groups have them, the Mexicans were using colic greens, they loved them, the aristocrats in London were using them.
It wasn't until slavery was almost at its end that the Anglo-Saxons here in America found out what we've all raised now
That Colleagues are good and so as they started back and away from the fried chicken
They were starting to eat and drink more of the Colleagues in its pot liquor and as they got sick during the winter months
They always stop how that froze it up put it up and they would drink it as you know, a tonne
So, collage greens have several medicinal purposes, and I would hope that we would get this
bill passed, and that the next medicinal purpose for collage greens is to help the state
of Georgia, not only in its notoriety, but the agriculture here as well.
It didn't pass out this house this year, but you're going to, you're sticking with this.
I'm going to stick with it.
I do believe it will bolster some agricultural content here in Georgia, and we'll start
to see more farmers playing in
collar greens. People will come
from all over once they pass
through. They'll grab a peach,
they'll grab an onion and they'll
grab a handful of collar greens.
Absolutely will. And then on that,
no, hopefully, we'll be able to
put some money in the budget for
collar green growing farmers here
in the state of Georgia.
This bill was brought to me last
year. A young lady in Goodnet
County, a high schooler, loves
a hunt with her brothers, but she didn't like orange. So she did her research and found
that other states allow fluorescent pink as well as orange. So the idea was presented to
me and I thought well I had an interest in hunting so I decided I'd run with it and it's
been a it didn't make it through Senate rules last year so I reintroduced it this year.
chairman brass asked if the color was going to scare turkeys right I answer
that the best I could I don't know I don't think turkeys are scared of our
colors I think there's just trying to find their next meal and stay as hidden as
possible but why would Norge scare them huh yeah pink was gonna do you know
exactly let's talk about Senator Rhett who said if it's hot pink should we
drop it like it's hot. I didn't really know what to do with that question.
Yes, if it's hot pink, should we drop it like it's hot?
Ooh, but you wouldn't want to drop it like it's hot while you're hunting.
Well, you demonstrate what that means.
This is something you feel passionate about because this young woman came to you.
Yes, so I'm a former middle school teacher and what I want is for young people to
being engaged in the process. And so when I found out that this was the idea of a high
schooler, not because of an assignment that she had to complete, but just her peer
interest in this, that is what it tracked me to this bill. And through some research
that we did last year, we actually found out that fluorescent pink is more visible to
some people who suffer with colorblindness
than for us at orange.
So that actually made it a more important thing for me
as well because we certainly do want safety for our hunters
and anybody who's accompanying them
when they're out on a hunt.
So I think this is a good option for multiple reasons.
We also know the states where it's been adopted
that hunting license sales have gone up.
So that would always be a good thing
for Department of Natural Resources.
we want to get more people outside enjoying nature.
Each before 44 to designate April of each year
as Georgia Native American plant month.
What's that all about?
You know, I had some constituents actually,
their members of the Native Plant Society
reached out to me and say, you know,
we're interested in this.
We're going to promote Native plants,
particularly with Hurricane Helene coming to Georgia
and with all the invasive species
that have been introduced to the state because of the storm.
You know, we now have armadillos in the state.
We have this awful hornet that the agricultural commissioners
been trying to get rid of.
There's a lot of invasive species that were never there before.
And so I went to them and they talked to me.
And I said, yeah, I think this is a great idea
to promote native plants because they grow the best.
They provide habitats for animals and plants
to, it's pretty good animals to live in.
And it's just, it's better for our ecology
and Georgia to plant native plants.
So the main thing is education.
So what do you want people to know every April?
They need to plant native plants as they get out
and start to prepare their gardens
and their beds for the spring.
And how do you find that out?
Which ones are native?
I don't know.
You can look it up.
Anybody can Google it.
But all the ones that you see the most
have like Azaleas, Bengois, those beautiful flowers
that you see on the master's tournament,
all of those are native to Georgia.
How are you feeling about your bill
dealing with Native American plants in the Senate?
Yeah, I'm feeling good.
And Senator Rick Williams is carrying an identical bill, and he's interested in this as
well.
And he's from Millageville, so middle Georgia, so they're interested in it, and I'm just
hoping we're going to not have forest fires and have been drought and plant more native
plants.
Now most of those bills passed out of the house before crossover day, the color greens
and potlica bill did not move, but representative Angela Morris plans to keep up her fight to
be the color greens queen.
We're going to change gears now
and talk about something else fun.
Join us, joining us is the AJC's government
and politics reporter Maya Prabhu
to give us the scoop on the release
of our much anticipated list
of the best dress lawmakers in 2025.
And also back with us is representative
Eagle Willis of Atlanta, who's on the list.
Welcome, thanks for coming.
So you started this in 2019.
And so it's been six years since you've been doing it,
except for 2020.
Were you going to show some of the winners beginning
with 20, we're gonna show some of the winners
beginning in 2019?
What made you start it?
Honestly, it was a couple of things.
One, I'm sitting in these chambers
and walking the hallways every day
and a lot of things are very heavy.
And I noticed Senator Elena Parent
had on something that was really nice.
This is back in 2019.
I was like, oh, this is her and then.
Yeah, I'm like, oh, this is a beautiful,
I was like, oh, I love your dress.
And then the next day I was like, oh, I love your shoes.
And the next day I was like, oh, I love your coat.
And I was like, I need to start this list.
And so that's really what it is.
It's become kind of a moment of levity for us
at the Capitol because things can be tense.
Like you've been saying this whole show,
like things can be tense, things can be heavy.
And so this gives us something
to kind of just be lighthearted about.
And people have really wanted to be on this list
or want to recommend people, right?
Yes, yes.
I have had lawmakers text me, say, where are you?
I think they want to give me a scoop.
And then I get there and they just model for me.
And I'm like, oh, OK, you have on a nice outfit today.
OK, thank you.
And then, yeah, I have people who are constantly
making recommendations and telling me
who needs to be on the list every year.
OK, so let's get to 2025.
and talk about who's on the 2025 list.
And let's begin with representative Willis.
Why was she chosen?
I'm gonna see her picture in a second, too.
She had to be.
So she's, she's, obviously.
So she has been on the list before a few years ago,
and then last year I kind of did a best of the best bracket,
which she also won.
And then up until this year I wasn't letting people
be on the list more than once.
But it's been, like you said, a while since I started.
And, you know, it was time to bring some people back.
So that's why you saw, you'll see a lane
apparent on the list this year.
And there was no way I couldn't have Brett Willis on.
Next representative, Charlie Spurred of Woodstock.
Yes.
So it was the same thing.
You know, I said to her a couple of times,
I was like, you were very on trend.
She had on a vegan leather pleated skirt.
I was like, look at you.
Like, so that's how I started paying attention
to her outfits, and I love that dress that she wore.
Next, Park Cannon of Atlanta.
Park Cannon.
What I love about Park Cannon is that she takes risks.
They don't always land, but I do appreciate someone
who takes risks when they are getting dressed.
OK.
Representative Katie Dempsey of Rome.
Katie Dempsey is just...
I don't know how to explain it, but she's just classic.
Exactly.
She is just classic.
She just always is always dressed impeccably
and her, and she's, you know, a petite woman,
her clothes fit great.
And she just, you can tell that she takes a lot of care
into that.
Okay, next to the Senate, representative Drew Eccles-Ovolto.
Drew Eccles, he, like his wife before him,
he replaced his wife in the Senate.
She was on the list in her first year
and it's his first year and he's on the list as well.
He loves clothes and loves to talk to him
We got how much he loves clothes.
Okay, we're gonna go through the next one's a little faster,
so we get everybody in.
Mitchell Horner of Ringgold.
And then Senator Harold Jones,
the second of Augusta.
Senator Rashon Kemp of Atlanta,
Senator Lane Apparent, you mentioned too, so.
Yes, so Senator Jones and Representative Horner,
three-piece suits often.
People love that we're trying to bring them back.
Alana parent just always looks wonderful.
And Rashon kept started lobbying me
when he was standing in the line to qualify
to run her office, so yeah.
We don't have a lot of time,
but I need you to tell me how you feel about this
twice now.
Or three times.
Three times, that's right, we're on the bracket.
I'm honored.
Like, I come from women who take pride in their appearance.
So my father's the best dress man I've ever seen.
And it's truly just the uniform
as I was sharing with Maya.
Each day I'm like, what's what uniform am I putting on today?
And I just, you fashion as a way of communicating
before you speak a word.
I love that.
So it, it gives me, it helps me bring more pride
to my work to put the effort into it.
And it does, and my others to do this.
And her list does bring levity to the, and we need so.
Okay, we'll run out of time,
but thank you both for being here today.
Thank you.
That does it for lawmakers today.
The legislature is off tomorrow and Monday,
and so are we.
We'll be back on Tuesday with a breakdown
What's in the state budget?
Good night.
You
