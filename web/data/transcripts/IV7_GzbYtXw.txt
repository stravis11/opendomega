TRANSCRIPT
----------
When Marty Kemp became Georgia's first lady in 2019, she knew where she wanted to make
a difference in the state.
When I spoke to her recently, the mother of three girls told me that her interest in
fighting human trafficking began before her husband was elected governor.
We went to the Atlantic station where they were having a press conference, pretty much
just talking about human trafficking.
We had 72 school buses, which represented the 3600 kids
that were taken into trafficking every year in Georgia.
And I was like, that cannot happen, that can't be.
We've been traveling, campaigning around the state
for two and a half years.
And I've never heard anything about this.
Started learning more about it.
The team brought it to me.
We formed the Grace Commission, which
brought all the experts to the table, law enforcement,
nonprofit, businesses, corporations,
and just really talked about it.
What is, what's going on?
What is everybody doing?
What do we need to do?
And it needed to have more education and awareness.
And we needed to have harsher penalties.
And we have done that.
Explain the, what the acronym, Greece is.
So it's Georgians for Refuge Action Compassion and Education.
So we have now Grace's Place, which is a facility
that entakes where we have survivors come
and get the wraparound services that they need.
So that's been an operation for a year.
And I pretty much want that,
would love to have that facility be a model for the country
because it has everything that they need.
And so that, that would be very helpful
for other states to take that on.
So we're hopefully going to build our third facility
before he gets out of office,
which I'd like to see, you know, five or six.
Unfortunately, they're needed,
but it's also getting the survivors,
the help that they need, that they deserve.
One of the things that surprised me
was how pervasive this is.
we tend to think that it is a mid to Atlanta problem.
Right, but it's not, right?
It is not.
And then I remember, I think the statistic they gave me
back in, maybe we talked about in 21 was, you know,
it was in 140 or 147 of 159 counties.
And I said from the beginning, it's in 159 counties.
We just don't know how to recognize it.
So we have also taught law enforcement.
We have a training that's just 30 minutes.
It's on the website of the Governor's Office
under the First Lady Grace Commission.
And it just shows you the things to look for
and what to recognize.
It's 30 minutes in your everyday life,
if you're out shopping,
go into the airport, traveling, whatever it is.
If you see something, say something, if you're wrong,
that's okay.
You call law enforcement and you're wrong.
That's fine, but what if you save some lives life?
I mean, what if you can call
and get that individual out of harm's way?
It would be fabulous.
How many people do you estimate you've
trained over the last few years?
Well, I wanted to have the training back
And I guess we did that back in 2020 or 21
to really encourage, not mandate or make people take it,
but encourage people to take it for all state employees.
And I think there's 83,000 state employees
and the agencies took that home
and did have their individual employer employees take it.
So I mean, that right there, but I know,
I mean, I have people come up to me all the time
and say, how can I help?
How can I get involved?
And I have to take the training.
And they do.
And I've had, I encourage them to tell their people
that they worship with, that they work with.
Just take it, it's 30 minutes.
And it's the education and awareness that you really have.
You've been able to bring to light for so many people.
I know that must be something you're proud of.
Well, I am proud of it.
I have people come up and talk to me about it all the time.
And I'm really glad.
It's an ugly topic.
Nobody wants to talk about it, and I completely understand that.
But I like to take on topics that are, you know,
that people don't want to talk about.
I'm not afraid of that uglyness,
because these individuals, you know,
have had a very tough childhood life,
and they deserve somebody standing up and fighting for them.
And I'm going to do that, and I've told them that.
I've had survivors come to the Grace Commission meetings,
And at the end, we have open public comments.
And I had a couple of them come down
and really write me over the calls
and tell me I didn't know what I was talking about.
And I said, you know, you're exactly right, I don't.
I don't know the hell that you have been through.
But I am here to help you.
And if I only help one person,
if we only help one person, it's worth it to me.
But you can sit at this table,
you can sit on the Grace Commission
and give us your input.
And they were a huge part of the vacature bill.
We had them come in and talk to our policy team,
and they were a huge part of that.
And they said, you know, nobody's ever asked us.
Nobody has ever asked how we thought.
And I'm like, how could we not learn from,
you know, we can learn so much from them?
If they're willing to talk about it,
now if they don't want to talk about it,
I completely understand.
But I had a group of them come to lunch at the mansion.
And we sat there and talked with some other
non-profit organizations.
It was very eye-opening to me.
and it was very tough.
And Brian came home that night and he said,
are you okay?
And I said, no, this is an ugly topic.
But we're gonna, it's not gonna knock me down.
We're gonna talk about it and we're gonna,
we're gonna get these people.
They put them in jail for a long time.
I'm sure it's been tough to take it all in.
Right.
You know, it's tough to talk to them in a hug them
and just feel for them that, you know,
people don't understand in their everyday life
that they're going on what's actually going on in their life.
It's just really, really tough and just really ugly.
I think the best thing is you said they came to you
because they know that you're involved in this topic.
That has made it easier, right?
I think so, I feel like people,
like when I travel around the state with Brian,
which people make fun of me for traveling everywhere,
but I feel like people feel like they can come up
and ask me things and they can also share things with me
that they may not feel as comfortable going to talk to him
about even though he's very approachable, I think.
But they feel like they can come speak to me about issues.
And we've had everything from making your CDL license,
taking it away for good if you're caught using your truck
as a human trafficking tool to entice young girls.
But that takes it away for life.
I mean, it's not just a slap on the hand.
We mean business here.
And I want people to know that, as Brian said,
and stay at the state, if you mess with our children,
coming after you. You've hit all levels from the truck drivers you mentioned to helping the girls
going after the pimps. Absolutely. And anybody that profits, you know the hotel clerk that is
at the front desk, they're seeing everything that's going on. So they need to know that they
can be a part of our team, not a part of that team. And if they are a part of that team,
they can get sued as well. And there is a lawsuit right now that is because of our bill.
and this young individual was trafficked in 2014.
So we're going back and trying to help them,
you know, get some compensation.
They have nothing when they come out.
They don't even barely have the clothes on their back.
So we wanna try to help them in any way possible.
And that was one thing that was very important
was not only having the harsher penalties,
but not forgetting about these victims once they get out.
We need to take care of them.
They deserve that.
And so we've tried to do that.
Is there something you're most proud of?
all of this. I think just people being aware and feeling like they can talk about it. You know,
we've had the utility companies, we've had the beer and wholesales, they want to put stickers on
their car. I mean, everybody is is joined together and want to be a part of the team to try to
help these victims because I think a lot of people felt like, oh, that doesn't that doesn't apply
to me. That's that hadn't happened. That doesn't that's not going to happen to me. Well, it can
it can happen to anybody. It does not have a hall pass at all.
So, you know, with our big busy airports, we have a PSA there,
that the mayor and Representative Bayes,
Moore, Brian and I, and Tyler Perry, all joined together and talking about it.
So it's a, you know, nonpartisan issue that we are all coming together.
And like I said, the legislators have passed it unanimously.
So they are all on board. So that's very good.
Is there more that you want to see done?
You know, I would like to see more facilities. I would like to see individuals get helped
more and just have, you know, there's businesses that have come forward that want to help,
you know, have employment for them. So just talking about that more, but having the facilities
to have them heal. And just, they need to feel safe. And I want them to feel safe and know
that there is an outlet. There's an option to this. And we're coming after the perpetrators.
coming after the bad people. We're going to put them away for a long time. I mean, the attorney general's
office has rescued almost 200 victims. I mean, that's great. 200 victims that are out of that
life. That makes me proud. The first lady says the amended budget, the governor assigned recently,
adds another $1.2 million to the human trafficking prosecution unit. She says they're so busy,
they requested another prosecutor.
I want to thank her for that interview.
But the first lady is not finished trying to change laws
to stop human trafficking.
Coming up, we'll talk with legislators from both sides of the aisle
about the bills she's pushing now.
We'll hear from a Republican senator
and from the House Democratic Representative Stacey Evans.
This is Lawmakers on GPB.
