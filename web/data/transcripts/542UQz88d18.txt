TRANSCRIPT
----------
I will advocate for good-paying jobs that tap into our state's talent, ensure safe
working conditions and protect secure benefits.
I look forward to working with my colleagues, legislators, and communities to advance this
mission, strengthening Georgia's position as the number one state for business and the
best place to live, work, and raise a family.
Governor Kemp introduced the state's new Commissioner of Labor today, Barbara Rivera-Holmes.
Holmes takes over from Bruce Thompson, who passed away last November.
Good evening and welcome to Lawmakers.
I've done a Lowry in Atlanta.
We'll learn more about the new Labor Commissioner in a moment.
This day 32 of the Georgia General Assembly, the action during the 40-day legislative session
determines what happens in your life for months and years to come.
From your child's school to the roads and bridges you drive, to the safety of your home and
the type of healthcare you receive, decisions made at the Capitol, shape it all.
Much of it is determined by how billions of dollars are spent.
money that comes into the state budget from taxes through your income, sales tax, gas
tax, and the corporate world. It's why tonight we're going to focus on money, especially given
that passing a budget is the only thing the Georgia Constitution requires the General Assembly
to do each year. To break down the details, the budget chairman from the House and Senate
join the show. But first, it's time for an overview of the day at the Capitol from Correspondent
Sarah Callis.
Hi, Donna. Today at the Capitol, Governor Camp announced the new Labor Commissioner
and the Senate debated a controversial resolution.
The Senate passed three bills and four resolutions today. House Bill 89 would allow the Maternal
Mortality Review Committee to acquire psychiatric and medical records related to the Maternal
mortality cases in the state.
What this bill is is an effort to try to lower the rate at which people are passing
away after they give birth.
HB 223 would provide tax relief for timber farmers who suffered economic losses from
Hurricane Helene.
This bill will allow payments made to producers from USDA block grants and crop loss payments
related to storm damage to be exempt from state income tax.
bills were easily passed, House Resolution 32, and its enabling law, HB 90, would allow
farmers to double the amount of farmland that they can own and receive lower tax rates
on.
This legislation will allow farmers in one name to own up to 4,000 acres, just trying
to look at our code up to date with the family farm, family farm to bring over the years.
The bill and resolution were easily passed, but now we'll have to be approved by voters
to change the state's constitution regarding the increase.
More controversial were two Senate resolutions praising Republican politicians.
Senate Resolution 245 recognized former Georgia U.S. Representative and current Secretary
of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.
Collins, it's the first Iraqi war veteran to serve as Secretary of the Veterans Affairs.
His vision for veterans' care is rooted in his life as a military veteran ensuring world
class care for our American heroes." While some Democrats supported the resolution,
others said that Collins complicity and reducing federal workers from the agency could not be overlooked.
Unfortunately, Secretary Collins has decided that he is a card-carrying member of the Doge crew,
that he is on board with 80,000 cuts, at least 25% of the VA's workforce's veterans.
So, it's the jobs at the VA, but it's also the services
that veterans receive.
That resolution was passed.
And a similar resolution, SR 246,
commending President Donald Trump was
debated for over an hour.
It is highly fitting that this resolution
be presented to you guys today.
And I hope that this body will join me
and commend these pro-American policies.
and we come in, President Donald Trump, who has gained the confidence of millions and millions
of American voters and workers. Democrats push back again, wondering why the need for a
commendation to a sitting president. The only time that a resolution like this was passed
in 2017 when this body did the exact same thing when Trump was the first time.
And when matched up against presidents in my lifetime, both
did him and Republican.
I don't see the need for the work that is for him to have any type of
acknowledgement or recognition.
We've actually fired him during his last presidency.
They also called the resolution political pandering.
The majority thinks that they have to continue been the need to
to the president, in order to get favor or preserve funding in Georgia or get
endorsement in next year's elections or whatever the motivation is. As
expected, the resolution passed along party line 31 to 18. Also today,
Governor Brian Kemp appointed Barbara Rivera Holmes as the state's new
commissioner of labor. Holmes replaces Bruce Thompson, who passed away last year
from Pinkriotic Cancer.
In the House, members gave final approval to Senate Bill 55, which would require
companies to pay Georgians with intellectual disabilities minimum wage. Under
current law they can be paid as little as 22 cents per hour. We have eight of
those programs out of 60 or so still functioning in the state of Georgia. This
bill would do away with those programs and or have them adapt. They have two
years with federal assistance helping them go from what they're paying now which
most is about the lowest I think is $2 an hour and help them get up to the federal minimum
wage of 750. That's what the program does. It's about dignity and fairness and making
sure that people with disabilities are paid at least what we consider the bare minimum
wage for all other workers. They also passed SB6, which would allow strips that test if
drugs have been contaminated with fentanyl or another substance to be sold to the public.
would also exclude those strips from the drug paraphernalia classification.
Anything we can to print desks as long as somebody is alive, we have a chance of helping
them overcome an addiction.
When they're dead, there is no hope.
The bill passed unanimously and now heads to Governor Kim's desk to be signed into
law.
Tomorrow the committees will work to pass legislation.
The House and Senate will convene again on Thursday.
That's my Capitol report.
Donna.
Thanks, Sarah. The rest of the show we're going to spend talking about Georgia budgets,
what spending is taking place now, and what lawmakers are discussing for the fiscal year that
begins on July 1st. Georgia's budget is not just about numbers, it's about those dollars,
who how they will be spent, and how they will affect the everyday lives of 11 million
Georgia's. Joining the show is Senate Appropriations Chairman, Republican Senator,
like Tillerie of Vidalia. He's also Vice Chair of Government Oversight and State
Institutions and Properties. Both of those committees, he became Approach
Appropriations Chair in 2020. Also with us is House Appropriations Chairman,
Republican Representative Matt Patchett of Dublin. He's been the Governor's floor leader,
Majority caucus chairman and the majority caucus with I want to thank you both for coming on lawmakers for this annual budget show
Right to be here. Yeah glad to be here. Well, let's let's get right to it chairman Tillery
I have you do this every year. Can you explain the budget process starting with where it begins and while you're talking we have some of the information up on the screen
We start in the fall with the governor's office of planning a budget.
We begin working through numbers there.
The governor sends out a revenue estimate, but he sends out a planning target for the
agencies.
They bring back those numbers and the governor's office uses that to prepare a budget that
they will present to legislators in January.
After the governor makes his proposal, Hatchet gets it first and picks it up and runs there.
the house will pass their budget.
Sometimes by crossover day, we pick on them about that,
but the budget's not subject to crossover.
And then the Senate will pick it up thereafter
and then it goes to conference where we try to work
with each other and then of course with the governor's office
to make decisions that hopefully are the best
for the 11 million Georgians you've already referenced.
Yeah, and so right now we're at the stage
where it is with the Senate.
So I know you guys are working on it.
I want to get back to the governor's revenue estimate
and so for briefly talking about an idea
where the money is coming from.
So here's a breakdown of the amended 2025 budget
from the House Budget and Research Office.
A good chunk comes from individual income taxes
around 38% and then there's sales taxes at 22%
more than 8% from corporate taxes.
Then as you can see on the screen,
the percentages for fees,
One designated surplus and motor vehicle or fuel taxes, and the amount from the lottery
comes in at about 3.9 percent.
In between, there's that other category, which is, I guess, everything else then.
But Chairman Hatchett, earlier in the month, the House passed HB 111 to reduce Georgia's
income tax rate from 5.39 percent to 5.19 percent retroactive to the beginning of the current
tax year. So explain what that all means for tax payers.
So that's it's a two tenths of a percent cut and that equates to around somewhere that
I don't know that the actual number is somewhere between eight hundred and nine million dollars
that will stay in your pockets. It will not be submitted to the state government for us
to spend so that's that's how that will work and I think it will probably go to the governor's
desk and get signed. Okay then well Sherman Tillery back to you each year the general assembly
deals with the two budgets I mentioned earlier they amended budget to add money to the current
spending plan and the one for the upcoming fiscal year and Governor Brian Kim just signed that
that amended budget that'll go through June 30th,
it's about $40.5 billion.
One of the things it offers is Hurricane Helene Relief,
and I know that for you personally,
and your community, because of the storm,
it hit hard there.
This is important, so we're going to show
some pictures you sent and then talk a little bit
about what the Hurricane Helene Relief
and the amended budget is all about.
It's been a long time since we've had a lot of
things that we've been trying to do.
Right, I hit Chairman Hatchett's district
pretty hard as well of anywhere that existed in
Georgia between about Val Dosta and Augusta
felt the the wrath of that storm.
We obviously are thoughts and prayers go out
to our friends in Pauline County who had
similar storms this weekend.
The package for relief includes a variety of
measures aimed at first of all just getting
houses, roofing materials, I mean gas stations that blew over and then of course
timber. The timber in my area, Chairman Hatchett's area, Senator Russ
Goodman's area, Senator Max Burns's area, Billy Hickman, it is still
leaning and that's a concern because we know if the the lean of those trees is
over a certain percentage, I think it's 35% than the trees are gonna be dead, 80%
of the time those trees are gonna be dead within 12 months. So we have more to
to clean up. Just my little county of tombs county is one of the smaller geographic counties.
The bill for picking up on the state and local rideaways already has a clip $65 million.
So multiply that out across the other counties that were impacted, roughly 100 counties.
You see how that cost is going to be significant and severe.
Also in my area in Chairman Hatchett's area, you had a lot of folks who had there, we'll call them
timber 401ks. They had their retirement tied up in timber. That timber is gone. And timber
is a little different than crops, of course. You can till under crops and plant them the next
year. It's not easy. I don't want to diminish the loss to someone who just lost crops.
But if you lost timber, that's a 20-year investment, not just a one-year investment.
So the time to recover is going to be significant. And so the funds that went in this year's
budget, it started out with a governor's plan of around 615 million. Those monies went to about
200 million to DOT to just replace street signs and stoplights that had
blown over that many of them. You had a hundred million dollars that also went
in for the governor's suspension of the motor fuel tax during that time
period. We needed to backfill that revenue. And then so that's 300 million
out the door. You had 200 extra million that was put into the LARP program.
Local road assistance projects. Again, remember how much infrastructure was
destroyed during this time. About 25 is million to the end the Senate put
towards folks who were not timber people or local governments necessarily, and the house
was very kind to come along and say that that was a very good ad and to jump on that with
us.
Those folks are still having blue tarps on their roof even this past weekend, so a lot
of repair to be done, even though we now sit roughly six months away from the storm.
A whole lot to do and really thankful for our colleagues for jumping in and trying
to help.
I know a lot of people across Georgia are just grateful for this money that is coming in.
Chairman Hatch, dealing with the amended budget still, a billion dollars for another
round of state income tax rebates for Georgia. Let's talk about that.
Yeah, the rebate is $500 for an individual. No, married couple, $250 for an individual.
It's what we've done in the past. So keep an eye out in your bank accounts.
and sometimes people get checks and it's a rebate,
it's a refund, so you have to have paid that much
to get it back.
We get a lot of calls, I didn't get my check and all that.
Don, if I could, I'd like to touch on the hurricane
relief a little bit, if that's okay.
Go ahead.
No, it was $850 million worth of relief
that we put out there and $150 million
in loans to farmers, $135 million to assist with timber.
But I can't stress enough for those not living in the area.
If you have not gone to see how much that hurricane changed
Georgia, you hear the term generational change.
And it is.
I mean, it, like Chairman Tilbury said,
the people whose retirement was in trees is now gone.
and just the employees in the industries,
the loggers, the truckers,
all the people that were needed to support that industry
that now are wondering what they're gonna do.
So it's had a huge impact on our state
and on our part of the state.
There'll be something we'll be talking about
for years and years to come.
So I appreciate what you guys have done.
But we're just getting started
because we're going to continue with our special budget show.
Well, I just want to say, just for everyone's information,
this is House Bill 68, not Senate Bill 68.
There's a big difference.
So we'll find out what that means,
and we'll dig into the budget for the next fiscal year
When we return, you're watching Low Makers on GPB.
Georgia Farm Bureau, a grassroots organization
dedicated to preserving Georgia agriculture.
Farm Bureau advocates for all Georgia farmers
at the state capital during the session and year round.
Georgia Farm Bureau, the voice of Georgia Farmers.
I'm a queen, I don't fear anyone.
This was a woman, people wanted to follow.
You are an important part of our work.
You're stronger than you know.
Saddle my horse immediately.
She's a female trailblazer.
We did it by acknowledging our own worth.
Help please.
Don't continue.
Come on.
Understanding the past gives a sense of the future.
This is the first time that anyone has seen this in 2000 years.
Oh, oh.
Oh, it's not the biggest happening.
So, hurry up, we're devil nudes.
Okay.
This is amazing.
No, I'm excited now.
Pompeii is a battle against time
You think I'm joking, but look at this it really happened
Don't let anybody tell you who you are
History teaches us to honor the past
When you look back they're like wow, that was pretty special
This is something that's actually altering the course of history
You're charged with keeping these stories alive.
-♪ I don't know where to get you.
Welcome back, lawmakers. I'm Donna Lowry.
We're continuing with our special budget show
with two of the most sought-after people at the Capitol,
the pair who lead the discussions on state spending.
The budget chairman, Representative Matt Hatchett
and Senator Blake Tillery, who are joining the show
right now from the state Capitol, we appreciate.
You both of you sticking with us.
Now we've talked about the amended 2025 budget,
also known as the baby budget.
Now we're going to talk about the big budget
for fiscal year 2026.
And Chairman Hatchett, it's known as the big budget,
but as you pointed out when you presented in the house,
it's actually smaller than the amended budget this year.
Can you explain the difference?
So yes, the amended budget we come back every year
and true up the expenses that we know are coming
and the expenses and Medicaid, expenses in K-12 education
because we always have an increase there.
So that's what we do in the little budget amended budget.
But the amended budget this year,
I think, was right around $4 billion.
So the 26 budget that we passed out of the house,
$37.7 billion, is an increase over the 25.
The first budget we did in 25, I think it's around $4 billion increased to maybe 3.5.
I had really studied up on my fiscal year 25 notes, but 26 is what we were just passed
out of the House and the Senate is considering it now.
Okay.
Well, I'm going to spend more time with you, of course, because, of course, could we
just point it out that you passed the House past its version in Chairman Hillary and the
Senator working on theirs right now.
And as you said, Chairman Hatchett,
the biggest winners in that House budget
are education and prison.
So let's start with education, A12.
What's in that group?
K through 12, you know, it's all of our high schools,
middle schools, elementary schools, the enrollment.
Enrollment was up slightly,
but I think there was like a $500 million increase
in the expense with our schools,
a large adjustment for the year over the year.
And the big, the other big part was a presence.
We put $345 million into the amended budget
into our Department of Corrections.
Our recommendation for 26 puts another $250 million
in corrections.
So it's a huge investment in our prison systems.
and I think they're essential,
it's essential for our safety,
it's essential for our workers at the prisons,
and it's essential for the safety of the prisoners.
Yeah, I wanna get into that a little more in a moment.
I wanna stick with the education budget
because it allocates $62 million
for a new program called Student Support Services.
You've called it an umbrella program.
So what exactly does that entail?
So, it's $10 million for, or $28 million for mental health workers and our counselors
in our schools.
It's, you know, however, the school system would like to use that money.
It's a grant, $20,000 per school.
They could contract with telehealth to do consults at schools that could contract with
mental health providers.
And I know one of the things I said, mental health goes hand in hand with school security
and the mental health of our units here.
There's $5 million for an additional portion of mental health at the schools.
another 25 million, I think for four day school security threat program, you may have
to refresh my memory on the rest of that Donna.
Sorry.
No, all of that is good.
And I don't know how you guys keep all those numbers in your head anyhow.
I really don't have such admiration for that.
I want to continue.
You get back to the budget part on corrections.
You mentioned the $250 million in new spending.
And part of that is for pay raises to hire more than 700 guards.
How great is the need to shore up the workforce in Georgia's correctional system?
You know, Donna, I don't think I can stress enough how great that need is.
We've been so far we're seeing a successful increase in those that are applying and those
that are staying.
We've given them pay raises, we've helped, helped the number, having more corrections officers
at the prisons actually helps for the safety and it helps people feel more secure in the
job that they're doing and we have been at a certain officer to inmate ratio and we
We are recommending that we reduce that ratio to one officer for 11 inmates and that in
itself cost more money because you should have more staff, but so far we're seeing a success
at retaining and hiring new officers and we don't want that momentum to stop.
That's part of the reason of the situation we're in now because during COVID we lost so
many corrections officers that are prisons and then that therefore led to some of the
demise of the actual facilities and so there's kind of you got to have both the improvement
at facility and more officers there to make sure the investment you're doing or making
in the facilities will stay in it and it's going to you got to have a both.
Yeah, and I know that this has been something
the governor is pushing for to do better
when it comes to the Georgia's
correctional facilities.
Chairman Telleria, I know you're still working
on your budget, but can you give us any idea
of some of the Senate budget priorities?
Sure, we finished up the subcommittee today,
so we will start tomorrow morning coming through things
probably through this weekend to try to align our budget
and our priorities with the houses
to come out with the Senate's budget proposal,
probably by the end of next week.
One of the things that we know we're gonna address
is the promised scholarship.
It was a reduction on the house side.
It was done based on mathematical reasons,
based upon uptake that you saw in other states.
Their number wasn't flawed.
It was just picked by some prognostication done
by other states.
We believe in Georgia that the uptake
is gonna be a little bit higher.
So you're gonna see us probably move
to replace some of those funds.
probably all of those funds,
at least on the Senate side as we enter into the debate.
And then there's also some questions about
the House laid out a proposal
that was different from the governors
and we're gonna have to make an internal decision
which path we wanna follow.
That will lead us to make other decisions related
to the budget, but back on the education portion,
remember education makes up 53% of the dollar spent
at the state level.
So 53 cents of every dollar you send to Atlanta
comes back to the local area
in some form or fashion related to education.
One of the things that the Senate has looked at
is seen that we've seen a 65% increase
in central office and admin spending
during that time period.
So while we've increased things like 100 million
to help out with people transportation,
we've also increased school safety funding,
a roughly $70,000 per school now.
We've seen that since we've also passed the bills
that allow local school systems to opt out
of the funding mechanisms that QBA funds.
In other words, they can use their funding
and a lot more a fashion that doesn't tie them back
to the title 20 rules.
We've seen the jump in admin and central office spending
outpace the jump that we would have rather seen
in the classroom.
So those areas, I think, is where you'll probably see our focus
particularly on the promised scholarship
and then picking who's gonna be our more aligned partner
as we move forward,
whether it be the house's position
or the governor's position.
Those are the big things we have to decide this week.
Okay, I know Chairman Hatchet,
we don't have a lot of time,
but can you briefly talk about the bond package
that's part of the house budget a little bit?
Why are you going that route?
So we chose to bond $321 million of capital expenditures
dollars of capital expenditures that were previously being paid for in cash to
free up some money for us to do the education spending like I mentioned to
backfill the need in corrections DHS community supervision the different
departments and some other priorities in the house. Okay. Chairman Tillery is the
Senate going to have a bond package? Remains to be determined again we're
waiting to see what the position is of the senators as it relates to the
governor's proposal and the House proposal. If we were to take the House's
proposal then there's a bucket that we're going to need to fill on the
promised scholarship. If we were to take the governor's proposal then there's a
bucket that we're going to need to fill on the bond package. So there's still a
whole lot of work to done that work left to do. I think I would probably chair
Manhattan would agree with me that this might be one of those bills that gets
done last this year. I don't I don't think we get done early this time. Right
down to the wire on Steini Die.
Chairman Hatchett, as always,
we have the show around St. Patrick's Day.
How was it in Dublin yesterday?
I got to get that in real quick.
Good?
So we had a great weekend.
Friday, Saturday, even Thursday.
We had a great, the weather was beautiful.
And we had a great time.
Great 60th anniversary of our St. Patrick's Festival.
That's great.
Well, I want to thank you both for coming on the show.
It's always wonderful to find out what's in our budget.
But for us, that does it today for lawmakers.
We'll be back on Thursday for an in-depth conversation
with Georgia's First Lady Marty Kemp,
and she'll talk about our fight against human trafficking.
Have a good night.
