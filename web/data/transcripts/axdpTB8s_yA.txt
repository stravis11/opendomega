representative Carpenter friends of this house it is my honor to introduce my friend pastor Stan Lester Stan is the lead pastor of crosspoint church and is an avid fan of Georgia Southern football

this privilege and this honor of sharing with this amazing group today thank you representative Carpenter for your passionate and your consistent leadership representing the people of our area and to each of you that serve thank you for all that you do for the great state of Georgia to our guests here today thank you for being here in the late 1800s William Astor and his wife were traveling on a stormy night as they were traveling it got so dangerous that they stopped to spend the night at a simple small hotel they walked in they were met by a receptionist the receptionist said to them we have no rooms tonight Astor and his wife looked and said sir we're in a very dangerous place and we need to spend the night he said sir we have no rooms contacted the hotels in the area and all of them were empty as well one more final plea from William as he said to the receptionist sir do you have anything as he started to leave the receptionist looked at him and said sir I have a room it's a private room it's my room I'm working third shift tonight and you're welcome to use that room if you would like it it's simple there's not much to it but you can have it William his wife took the room that night they cleaned it up took the bags the next morning the storm had passed as they were walking out he saw the receptionist standing there finishing up his shift he looked at him and he said young man it's not enough to manage or to be a receptionist at this hotel he said you should be running the best hotel in the United States of America I'm going to build that hotel when I build that hotel I'm going to make you the CEO two years later the receptionist got a letter in the mail with a ticket to New York City also in that letter was also in that envelope was a letter inviting him to meet William in New York City when the man arrived William found him and took him to a large hotel and pointed at it and said this is what I built for you he looked at it he said I'm confused he said I told you you were going to manage the best hotel in America the receptionist said I'm still confused he took him in and he showed him a door that said CEO he said this is your office the next time you're in New York City take a walk down Park Avenue stop at 301 Park Avenue and look up and you'll see the Waldof Historia built by William Waldof Aster if you walk in you'll see some history you'll see read some things about the first CEO or receptionist named George Charles Bolt a man who became CEO because on a rainy night he served someone that needed to be served Bolt became the CEO because he understood what it meant to be a servant many of you share the same faith that I share and on this week of passions this holy week we are headed toward a moment when we're going to celebrate a resurrected king it's a time when we're going to recognize one that has changed our life and you can say a lot of things about Jesus you can call him a great leader a great revolutionary a mighty man but maybe at the top of the list of the things that we would say about Jesus is he was a servant on the week of passions as he was headed into Jerusalem he's going in to be betrayed by close followers be rejected by his own people be executed on a cross a mom with two sons turned scripture into a moment where it looks like election year as she goes and she says to Jesus would you allow my two sons to sit on your right and your left she says I know you like Matthew and I know you like Simon Peter but what about James and John and Jesus says to her he says anybody can sit in the place of greatness in the kingdom if you want to be great in the kingdom you have to be a servant the story of Charles Bolden William Aster reminds us that great servants always do the humble thing people who are the greatest servants are the ones who humble themselves and serve with the heart of willing humility it's often the unnoticed thing it's often the trivial thing that others don't recognize sometimes it's the thing that should have been done but hasn't been done but it's always the humble thing it's the thing that marks the life of Jesus Christ it's the thing that made him the revolutionary that he was and that he is Jesus is celebrating the Passover and in the evening he gets up and he takes a towel and he wraps it around him and he serves those that are following him and while everyone is attempting to climb to the top Jesus kneels down and he picks up a towel and he serves maybe the missing trade of leadership in America is humility humility says I need God humility says we need one another humility says we need people that aren't like us humility says we need people that think differently than us it's pride that says we don't need one another great servants are not only humble great servants do the necessary thing we become better when we find a need and meet it when we find a hurt and heal it when we find a problem and solve it in Mark chapter 10 the Bible says of Jesus that he didn't come to be served but he come to serve and to give his life a ransom for many was it difficult yes was it painful without question was it heartbreaking no doubt was it necessary absolutely it was what made the receptionist that night say to William Astor I'll serve you I'll give you my room it's what made Astor say to the receptionist two years later this is where you're going to serve now Charles Plum was a US fighter pilot in the Vietnam war he completed 75 missions and 75 flights after 75 flights he was shot down over enemy territory in Vietnam and was a Vietnam prisoner of war for six years after six years he was released one day when he got back home he saw a man that walked up to him and he said said to him sir your plum aren't you he said yes I am he said I know you Plum was confused and he said how do you know me and he began to talk to him about what he did he said you you flew fighter jets in Vietnam he said yeah I'm more confused now than I was before he said you flew them off the Kitty Hawk you you were shot down in Vietnam and you spent six years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam Plum said that's correct how do you know this the guy paused and looked at him and he said because sir I was the one that packed your parachute Plum looked at him and he said well if you hadn't done a good job I wouldn't be here today Charles Plums went around the country and shared motivational speeches and talks and he ended every time with this question who's parachute are you packing we said here today because we're servants we said here today because we serve the people that has sent us here the greatest thing that we can do is be humble and be people who understand that being president the moment is important because great leaders also do the difficult thing one of my favorite Dr. King quotes is this on some positions cowardice ask the question is it expedient and then expedience comes along and ask the question is it politic and then vanity ask the question is it popular and then conscience asks the question is it right there comes a time when we must take the position that it's neither safe their politic nor popular but he must do what he must do because conscience tells him it's the right thing to do a leadership axiom says the right thing is always the right thing and as great leaders as great servants that's what we do we do the right thing as leaders were called to do the right thing not because it's easy or fun or exciting but because it's right sometimes will be misunderstood at times will be misrepresented and sometimes will be underappreciated talk about the holy week in the week of passion that leads to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and then ultimately his resurrection he bruises it this way who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he's now sat down at the right hand of the father today as you do the work of the people stay humble do the difficult thing do the right thing because the right things always the right thing and that's what servants do would you stand with me let's pray together Father I thank you on this day for the men and women that sit on this floor I thank you for their service I thank you for their heart for the people I thank you for their commitment to spend time and energy and effort to do the right thing and so as they go about the day I pray that they would have the voice of your Holy Spirit the wisdom of the Father the fellowship of one another the God they would do the right thing even when it's a difficult thing even when it may be a tough thing I pray God that you would give them grace favor and blessing and God I thank you for the leadership that's represented in this room today and I declare your favor your grace and your blessing over them in Jesus name let's share in the place.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Thank you.

We want everyone to be respected when they bring their morning order but you have a conversation on the floor now you need to finish it in the any room. If you have a seat on the floor now's the time for you to sit in that seat. We have a very very special invite resolution. We know we talk often here as we recognize our heroic public safety personnel and our first responders that we mention when danger occurs they run to the danger as we all go the other way to avoid the danger. I will tell you when everyday Georgians young people see their fellow man in trouble and peril at death door and they endanger their own lives to take up the mantle to be heroes. And we have some heroes in our midst today and it makes me very proud to say I'm a Georgian and I'm proud of the citizens of this state as I'm proud of y'all. So with that I'm going to recognize represent the Houston games he's going to bring us a resolution that will honor some heroic actions some young ladies and they're with us today. We're honored for them to be here represent games my heroes if you'll come up as well. Well thank you Mr. Speaker this is such an incredible these five young women just incredible heroes and many of you probably seen I printed out the Atlanta Journal Constitution article from that was published yesterday. But these five young women did to save the lives of three people in Burke County they were on their way down to St. Patrick's Day in Savannah. If I have freshman at the University of Georgia they were on their way down to St. Patrick's Day and I'll read their names and then I know the clerk has a resolution will present it to him but I first want to read off their names Caitlin Ionachi Clark Jones Jane McCartle Molly McCullum and Ellen were caught. These five women in the article you can read where the mom a mom was traveling went off into a creek and these these women they noticed basically a white dust and they turned her car around dove right into the water they helped the mom get an eight year old out of the vehicle there was also a four year old in the vehicle they couldn't even see the four year old was stuck in the vehicle they worked with the mom does when I get the four year old out of the vehicle took several minutes ultimately got the four year old out and performed CPR saved the young person's life. It's amazing. These five women are heroes I've certainly never been proud of the University of Georgia never been proud to represent Athens and I just want to say thank you all I know that Clark is going to speak but speaker wanted to have the clerk read this resolution before she does so House resolution 1583 House resolution 1583 by Representative Gaines the 120th week hour 121st roads 124th Friday 122nd Frazier 126 and others a resolution recognizing and commending Jane McCartle Molly McCollum Ellen or Clark Clark Jones and Caitlin Ionucci and for other purposes.

One of the last poems he wrote if I must die is on your desks and several of his good friends are with us up in the gallery. During his teachings of renowned playwrights such as Shakespeare professor Allerier helped his students grow and shatter the prejudices they had to they grew up with. Our mutual friend, Yusef Allerier, a student of professor Allerier, a student of professor Allerier told me Rafat told us to be critical thinkers and to think globally, having the English language be accessible and available to many people regardless of their social background after it was exclusive to the elites in the rich. I invite you to join me for a moment of silence and honoring Rafat Allerier's love and passion for mentoring a generation of Palestinian writers inspiring them to write their stories.

Senate Bill 212 by Senator Burns, the 23rd, go to the 51st Anderson, the 24th and others being titled act to amend chapter 9 and title 15. The fish go to Georgia and Tate related, probate courts and title 21 of the fish go to Georgia and Tate related elections respectively.

If you have conversations please take them to the anti-rim. If you have a chair please find it. Gentlemen will continue. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise today to present Senate Bill 212 Rules Committee substitute LC473067S which aims to remove the elections from the jurisdiction of the probate judges. As we know our probate judges have a lot of vital functions that they serve for our counties each of us including issuing marriage certificates, hearing traffic cases, hearing violations of our game and fish laws and also managing the estates and the probate process for all of us should a loved one pass away. What we're doing now is simply removing the elections from the jurisdiction of their agency. 143 counties are already operating under elections boards. 16 are currently operating where your probate judges run your elections and we're simply going to create a uniformed system across our state to put these other 16 on par with the rest of 143. I'll be glad to answer your question. You have a question? I'll be glad to yield. Chair recognizes representative who you lead for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Is the gentleman you? I would always yield to my friend and former AirND Block Colley. Just a point of clarification will this change affect any of the elections that are going to occur this year? Thank you for that question. None of these elections would be impacted because the changes wouldn't go into effect until January of 2025. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Draper for a question to your front. Thank you Madam Proton. Does the gentleman yield? Bigly ideal. First of all, I just want to thank you for this bill. I think it's an excellent bill, excellent policy and we put too much burden on our probate judges and administering elections is just too much. So I thank you very much for this bill. My question is about the composition of the boards of elections that come from this bill. My question is about the composition of the boards of elections as a result of this bill. It's my understanding that after a certain period of time there is a process for how those election boards will be composed. My question to you is by local legislation can those then be changed later? Yes, there is. There is a procedure that will be put in place for those 16 to begin the process going for 2024. They have to have those appointments no later than December 15th of 2024 and then will take office January 1st, 2025. But then we could come back in as we do through local legislation. Any of those 16 counties could come in through local legislation should they like to and change the composition. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Gentlemen has one more question from representative Dean Green. I would be glad to yield to the dean. Thank you so much. Does the gentleman yield? I will be glad to yield. The legislation before is right now the probate judges in my area are the ones that really will benefit by this. Most of the individuals are from my district that would benefit from this. And I want to thank you for working on this and bringing it forth and the many people that offer their suggestions and work with us to make it a good bill. It has been a collaborative effort but no one is a stronger advocate for their probate judges and their district in general than you Dean. And so I appreciate your support with this. My no speaker, I will yield the wealth this time and ask for the body's favoral consideration. Gentlemen has yielded the wealth. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? Chair here is none of the rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the past of the bill? Chair here is none of the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the past of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the past of the bill the yeas were 162, the nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 9797? Senate bill 97, Senate of Anitabart of the 31st, Alvers of the 56th and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 3, title 38. The official go to Georgia and Tate were laying here emergency management. This bill I refer to the committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Collins is recognized to present Senate bill 97. Chairman Collins. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House I bring before you the substitute to Senate bill 97. This bill originally started out as something else and we changed it in the House Public Safety Committee to deal with ghost tags around the metro Atlanta area and some of the more popular cities of our state. We have a terrible time with street racing, speeding and these organizers of these events where people do burn outs and they video them. So this deals with legislation that would prohibit the obstruction of a license plate or tag if you will of vehicles in our state. There's a graduated penalty system there. If you're convicted one two or three four times you have bad actors all across this state that are utilizing this deception to hide the identity of who owns the car and who the car is registered to. The back portion of this bill Mr. Speaker it deals with some of the issues that we've been having with school cameras the speeding and school zones the automatic license plate readers. What this does is it clarifies that in order for those school cameras to be utilized they have to have the flashing lights the signage that can only be utilized to reduce the speed for an hour before the tardy bell an hour after the tardy bell an hour before the dismissal bell and an hour after the dismissal bell. It also addresses in the section eight of this piece of legislation it deals with the amount of revenue that local governments can use to offset their budget through speeding fines and those types of things where speed traps are concerned at lowers from 35 to 30 percent. It also exempts the super speeders that violate the school camera and reduce speed or a smooth zone reduce speed through camera usage. Mr. Speaker that's pretty much the genesis of the bill. I'll be glad to stand for any questions if not I'll be glad to yield the well and ask for the body's favorable consideration. Gentlemen you have a couple of questions. Just a couple Mr. Speaker. Okay representative Gladney to your left has a question. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield? Yes I yield. Is it not true that as the former motor vehicle registration director I often had advised motorists that putting a sign on their vehicle or anywhere in their vehicle that said tack applied for was unlawful. This legislation in the event that it was caught on camera would also make it where they could be ticketed for this is that not correct? Not necessarily no no no not not with the ticket the ticket the camera legislation is not a part of the ghost tag legislation. Does the gentleman further yield? Yes I do. So in the event that it that there is any violation with the license plate if the registration is no longer valid because it is expired. If it is captured on camera can the motorists be ticketed for having an expired registration in license plate? The license plate issue that would have to be issued by a public safety member of law enforcement that does not deal with the with the camera legislation at all. That's separate. Thank you sir. Yes ma'am. Representative Gillette to your right in the back. Thank you Mr. General. To my friend from Paulton County I absolutely do. Appreciate this bill while I'm not a fan of the cameras in general. I am very appreciative that we're restricting the use of them so that they can only be about safety and not about revenue generation for for localities. So thank you for this bill. I too agree with my friend and thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker I'd like to yield the well at this time and ask for the body's favorable consideration to the substitute to Senate bill 97. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. There was a minority report. The minority report is waived. We have the current version of the bill. I thank help with that. Is there any objection to the adopting the committee's substitute that chair here is none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill that chair here is none. Report of the committee is agreed to. Now this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. All members voted if so. Clerk will unlock the machine. All the passage of Senate bill 97, the yeas are 169. Then there is one. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk will you read the caption to Senate bill 399, 399? Senate bill 399 will senate records the 49th. Albers the 56th and others to be entitled back to amend chapter 4, title 20 of the fiscal to Georgia and tentatively in the vocational, technical and adult education this bill having heard the committee on higher education. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. The gentleman from up in Gainesville representing Matt Dubnick is recognized to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, the House of bringing Senate bill 399. This is a bill that passed the Senate 53 to nothing. This bill encourages the commissioner of TCSG and the Chancellor of USG to coordinate their efforts to expand credit transfer opportunities between the two systems. The need for this came out of a Senate Workforce Study Committee last year. The goal is to figure out and provide more opportunities for TCSG students to identify four year degree.

Programs for which some or all of their credits would transfer and the long-term goal is to enhance that two plus two program Which if your member is where a student can get a two-year technical school degree and have those transfer if they were to pursue a Bachelor's degree in an additional two years Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. I'll be happy to stand for any questions Gentlemen has no questions like a misspeaker asked for your favorable consideration of Senate bill 399 The gentleman is yielded the well is there any objections to the previous question being ordered that chair Here's none the previous question is ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute?

Speaker members of the House. I'll bring before you today Senate bill 132 This is a rules substitute that we have Basically what we're doing with Senate bill 132 we're placing a three-year moratorium on the EPD except in any new applications for surface mining That utilizes drag lines for mining heavy mineral sands That's basically what the bill does, but why I'm here. I want to you know answer some questions It's been brought up by some articles. It's been written over the past few weeks and months To start with the There's an article ran About a month and a half ago that's about some petitions that had been signed by Some people in my district and they they handed me a folder with 500 Signatures in it so I thought I'd go through them and look at them and it's very interesting some of the names on there I got Donald Trump Trump towers his address and baby huge Uh emails the Trumpinator and then Joe Biden signed it but didn't put the address on email. He probably forgot Uh It gets better. He signed the next page Joe Biden. He probably forget and but he did put White House on this one So it came back to him so No, sir and then I ate US fishing wildlife employee quoted in several of the articles Talking about how the trail ridge was formed hydrological boundary Of the swamp and only problem with that The US fishing wildlife Their comprehensive conservation plan on page 22 Says why that theory is traditional and most popular is probably incorrect Uh several Times in arculate it refers to the the mining draining the swamp uh Water level's talking about the different ones at twin pines did the paid to do the studies But what I look at is what the people are not getting paid said Dr. Z Wang Professional hydrologist and manager of the water supply program for the watershed protection branch uh Georgia EPD noted in a November 19th 2022 memo to his colleagues the EPD water supply program hydrologist geologist Modeler's sterley review twin pines information in the gree It addressed critical issues raised through the programs review permit submissions This is the Chris said water loss from this uh Sufisial aquifer and form of sea pigeon to the mining pit will not have a significant impact on the swamp And then the other findings that the water supply program model showed the impact of the swamp and the st Mary's river was drawing 1.44 million gallons of water per day From the Feridian aquifer even in the worst weather conditions is de minimus Two minor to merit consideration And then Thomas McGill with the us EPA wetland and streams protection branch chief confirmed the findings in a 2022 memo Basically just confirmed said the prediction that the proposed project is not anticipated to affect groundwater levels in the swamp That's the EPA and EPD Both agree and in z Wang and z Wang He is the same hydrologist as one two Supreme court decisions With the water wars against Florida and Alabama same hydrologist he knows what he's doing uh In a draft december 7th 2022 In a draft menor remember random the hydrology impact of 1.44 million gallons of water withdrawal From the Feridian aquifer has been analyzing a rather conservative way What he's doing he if he placed it if he's drawing the whole 1.44 million gallons Straight from the swamp and he said even if which is which is extreme they're not doing that it comes from the aquifer He said we have modeled that impact in this loss of water concluded that the water level in the swamp will have an impact of roughly 5 millimeters At the worst time so no impact in the swamp uh In several of the articles there's a leading environmental scientist that works for uj It's not uj's opinion, but he's quoted in several articles. So I I thought I'd look him up And some of his Facebook post uh He seems to be a frequent Critic of many Republicans on Facebook including governor kemp Who uh on august 24th 20 21 States of ls u just instituted a vaccine requirement for students and football fans 8 scc schools have masked mandates uj has neither Because our governor believes stupidity is the path to reelection So you know, I just put on record. I don't think our governor was stupid I think he's the history has proved him to be a genius in his handling of the covid epidemic Uh several false emails that went out Uh one went out they they all love if you look at the uh Address are coming from it's from the soft edge Dot com And one of them came from one of the county commissioners wives Who signed a resolution in favor of twin pints of the mining down there for long as the epd or epa said it wasn't home to swamp so anyway anyways, I call this the uh The Commissioner and this went to laugh and so they sent out false emails Here is a copy of the resolution that the commissioners signed In the article said they could reach one county commissioner, but it couldn't reach the others If they had changed their minds trust me, they would have called me Uh In the article it says titanium dioxide is only thing their mining is used for uh paint pigma switch Which is true? It is used for the pigma than white paint But it's also the other medical metal that the rare earth element they are mining is zirconium Is and the fenced part of the space the department of navy uses that in nuclear fuel rods and several other uh applications Uh in for national defense. It's critical matter fact. It's such a high grade zirconium This mined in that area down on trail ridge that the defense department specifies There's a conium from from that area Uh When presented the first bill that did this uh 1338 there was a minority report file And there's some questions there that I would Uh, like to answer it said it applies broadly to the entire state Which is uh not not correct It only specifies drag line mining of heavy mental sands that only affects one company Said second to build does not impact twin pines demonstration mine You know that was true Uh, but guess what the other bill that was out there house bill 71 did not affect it either so That that wasn't an issue there third and there's no requirement for anyone to collect data concerning to drag line uh surface mining In committee the the uh DNR uh The director of EPD stated that in the application process for the permit there is daily weekly monthly Uh Data the program that has to be filled out data is collected and turned in so there is data being collected and turned in The fourth issue that said they had a with the timeline on the judicial review which is no longer in this bill I didn't want to mention that that's that's the difference between 1338 and what you have before you today Uh, I did have a letter from the office of administrative hearings Let's say it was a pleasure speaking in this from February 23rd Said as discussed we have reviewed house bill 1338 and osu is happy to comply with the proposed a Judication deadline. They had no trouble with the deadline Uh Finally, you know, there's uh There's a great article In a in a book you've got Last year The council on state governments the vital role of rare earth elements in the 21st century economies It takes an average of 16 and a half years to permit a new mind before the first Mineral can be extracted If the United States wants to decrease its reliance on foreign sources Strangible but need but need to be developed and share critical minerals are extracted safely and responsibly You know, we can keep our head in the sand or we continue to rely on nations that are not friendly to us Or we can work with the EPD and let them do their job And that's what s b132 does it gives the EPD three years to collect data and Monitor the demonstration mind to make sure this not going harm the swamp in any way. So I'm going to ask that you vote favorably and First has to be 132 Any any questions? I will Gentlemen has a couple questions. I'll do my Representative you all over to your left extreme left by almost behind you To your extreme left, mr. Chairman does the gentleman in the yield Yeah, I do I'd like you to please answer a question that my constituents ask me How is it that a bill that has over 92 co-sponsors cannot get a hearing in a committee in the Georgia House My constituents want to know the answer to that question. Well, if you remember you did have a hearing in the house last year I'm speaking about house bill 71 that it was not allowed an opportunity for vote. Am I correct about that? It did have a hearing in committee last year. Yes ma'am, but it was not allowed a Opportunity for vote. Am I correct sir? I believe that is correct. Thank you You General you owe for another question. Yes, sir About cheerleaders Smith she may know something about this Is recognized for a question? General yield I do to my chairman. Is it not true that this moratorium has the purpose of quieting things down if People are not familiar with the moratorium. Is it not true? The apparent would send a child to each corner of while things can quiet down During this period of time is it not true that there will be ample research done And further is it not true that last year was not the appropriate time for the vote several signers on the bill Asked me to withhold their names, which was not done. Is that not true? And is not true? It's a committee process that works very well in the Georgia House and with respect to all parties involved I've never heard one time is it not true? That anyone wishes to harm the Okinawa. It's a treasure for all of us And thank you for making this possible for us to slow things down and to give everyone a chance to research and look into what's going on Thank you the lady knows what she speaks. Thank you. Are you the well? I'm speaking Gentlemen is you to the well We do have a speaker in favor of the bill representing Debbie Buckner Representative Buckner is recognized speaking favor of SB 132 Give the lady your attention please Thank you, Mr. Speaker My great grandfather had a quote and he said you know sometimes when things get difficult Sometimes when you're not real sure what's going on and why you'll scratch your head and it won't itch Well my head's been scratched a lot this morning because it's not itching But um the truth of the matter is it is what the chair lady just said we all do love the Okinawa We all do realize that it is an incredible resource to our state We all know that it needs protection And Many of us feel like putting a mind anywhere within range of that swamp is the wrong thing to do We are afraid of what it will do to the groundwater. We are afraid of what it will do to them many very special and unique flowers and Wildlife and even things I don't like like snakes and reptiles and alligators But those are unique to that area and important to that very unique ecosystem and we are concerned The fact that we've not been able to Feel like sometimes we were heard in the way that we want to protect this swamp makes this vote difficult The fact that we have not been able to say Know to a company that has a terrible track record in other states Makes me feel uncomfortable But those lawyers that are in the room know more than I do and we've got to lay the groundwork to do this in a way that is fair and equitable Even though we have all those concerns All This bill does now According to what I understand is that it puts a moratorium on any more permits It does not put a moratorium on the company that we're worried about is permit They'll still be going through a very slow arduous part process of having to study What's going what they want to do what they hope to do and the EPD will have to analyze that But it's all we got There is nothing else anywhere as many things has had been dropped in the house in the senate as many things Has been suggested that we do this is the only thing on the next of the last day of the session That's out there that will slow it down give us an opportunity to try to figure out something else within the next three that years to save the swamp So although I'm not really in love with this bill and I'm not ever going to be for the mining No offense to the author and the residents there This is the only thing we can do right now to save the swamp It's the only option So I urge you to vote for this No one that we are not getting the best But we're getting something good maybe that will help us take care of the swamp With that mr.

Speaker does the lady yield yes, sir Thank you for your comments You mentioned trite record What do you feel like the trap record is of our environmental protection division Georgia on permitting? Do you feel like it has a good trap record? Well, I do think that they have had some challenges sometimes of the things that I haven't always agreed with But we do have a new EPD director that has been an agency person for a number of years and He knows there's an awful lot of people watching this one So I feel confident that they'll go through the process as required by the law and by the rules and regs that they have Thank you I feel like lady has a question right in front of from the whip Representative barchett Wip barchett Thank you mr. Speaker does generally yield yes Is it not true that My district in large part encompasses the yokey finoki swan? Yes Very good is it not true that The author of the bill the chairman that presented the bill also his portion of His district is is the swamp Yes, is it not true that he and I are both advocates for the swamp I believe that to be true very good is it not true that the area that we're protecting is outside the delineation of the swamp That's you're talking about the no It wait wait wait wait are you talking about the part that we're talking about that needs permits is outside of the swamp It is outside the swamp it is it's adjacent to it so it's outside the line that the protecting line of the swamp is that true?

Senate Bill 517 by Senator Robertson, 29 to be entitled to amend Article 2, Chapter 3, Title 16. The office bill to Georgia annotated related justification and excuse under defenses to criminal prosecutions. Ms. Bill, I refer to the committee on judiciary. Now in civil act committee recommends this bill do pass. Representative Devon Sebaugh is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to present Senate Bill 517. This legislation allows law enforcement officers who lawfully and reasonably employ the use of force in the performance of their duties to seek immunity from criminal prosecution is currently outlined in Georgia code. This bill clarifies that officers have no obligation to retreat from using reasonable force to make an arrest and should not be held legally liable to the individual against whom the force was justified when making the law for arrest. And I want to emphasize this legislation does not extend or enhance immunity for police officers, nor does it serve to endorse the use of force indiscriminately. It simply enables officers to petition the court for immunity and a preacher on motion when faced with a civil action related to a justified use of force during an arrest. Even if the sole reason for their justified force was to make an arrest. I will again emphasize that officers who use unlawful or excessive force would not be entitled to immunity under this bill. That is the bill, Mr. Speaker. If there are no questions, I will yield the well. Gentlemen, have no questions. He's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here's done? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair here's no other report. The committee is agreed to.

If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of Senate Bill 517, the yeas are 149, the nays are 18. This bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority, is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate Bill 497-497? Senate Bill 497 by Senator Hickman of the Fourth Albright is the 56th Beech of the 21st and others to be entitled back to the men's chapter 4, Title 20, the EFJ Georgia Annotated Related in the Vocational Technical and Adult Education. So it's to redesign the high-demand career initiatives program as a high-demand apprenticeship program. This bill I'm referring to committee on higher education. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Suhong is recognized to present the bill representing home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. SB 497 redesignates the high-demand career initiatives of the technical college system to high-demand apprenticeship. Essentially, this is a program where an employer can get apprentices and currently they can have up to 5 and they will receive $10,000 per apprentice if they finish the program. In this bill, what we're changing is increasing the number of apprentices that an employer can have to 10. And we are decreasing the amount that the employer will receive down to 5,000 per apprentice. And so therefore, there's no budget or funding differences. Further, it's going to create a public service apprenticeship program which will help with state and local government field careers. This is a request from the technical college system based on employers that are wanting more skilled workers and this will help to create qualified skilled workers. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield to any questions. You have a question from Representative Stetson to your left and the back. Representative Stetson. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General Lay to yield? I do. Isn't that true that when this bill was brought to our committee that I shared with the committee the importance of acknowledging the funeral industry or indeed of apprentice as well? Is that not true? I believe I remember that. Further question? Sure. Is it not further true that I hope that in the future there will be some more discussion and possible legislation similar to this that will include the funeral industry because of the fact that the funeral industry does require a apprenticeship program. And there are so many hours. Of course, there's more hours for an apprenticeship to become a funeral director in the state than it is to be a nurse in the state. Is that not true? Thank you. Thank you for your work on this legislation. Sure. Lady Eale for another question. Yes. Representative Draper is recognized right to your left on the center aisle. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the General Lay to yield? I do. Thank you for this bill. I appreciate the apprenticeship program to create more skilled labor in Georgia. Do you have a sense for how long it would take somebody to be trained to become skilled labor? The program usually is for a year. But I think the employer actually, or actually, I'm sorry, I'm going to rephrase that. The amount of the number of apprentices that you can have that is per year and the amount that you receive is per year. But I think it just depends on the different skills and the hours that they will go through depending on the employer. And the employer will submit those hours and what they've done in order to qualify to receive this incentive. Does the General Lay to yield for a follow-up question? I do. So would it be at least a year before through this bill we would create additional skilled labor for businesses in Georgia? Correct. So anybody that is in the program currently, so that will end in 2024 and this will start in 2025. Thank you. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield well and I'm asked for your favorable vote. Thank you. Ladies, you're to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered that Chair here is none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the Committee's substitute? Chair here is none. The Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the Committee which was favorable to the passing of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the Committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passing of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted. All members voted this so. You go vote. You let it out of your committee. I figured you needed to vote on it. All members now voted. I have so the clerk will unlock the machine. On the pass of the Senate bill 497, the yeas are 171, the nays 1, this bill, having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to Senate bill 83, 83? Senate bill 83 by Senator Jackson, the 41st, strictly the 17th, Jones, the 22nd, and Karpatrick, the 32nd, be entitled to amend Article 7 of the 5 of the Title 16. The official go to Georgia and Tate relating to stalking so it's devised the eligibility for restraining orders. This bill I have referred to the Committee on Judiciary Non-Civil Act Committee recommends this bill do pass by Committee's substitute. Chairman Rob Leveritt is recognized to present the bill. Representative Leveritt. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I present to you Senate bill 83. I want to thank Senator Jackson for allowing us to use her bill for this important piece of legislation. The bill that I am presenting you today does not have anything to do with stalking or stalking orders. It's a very different topic. It has to do with bad faith claims asserted and motor vehicle accidents claims that are asserted against an insurance company. This is an issue that is one that a small community of people are aware of but that has very broad application to all of us if we have car insurance. So it involves a way for a claimant to try to recover in situations from a defendant or through the insurance company in excess of what the limits are through the bad faith claims which are recognized in law. But what a small group of attorneys are doing is they are sending a demand for limits with conditions that are unreasonable and overly burdensome and can't possibly comply with and then using that as a basis for arguing that the requests for limits pay was rejected and that's a further basis for a bad faith claim. So I know this is exciting stuff but it does affect what we pay in premiums and it affects what insurance companies have to pay out in excess of what they've contracted to pay. These are where they would have to pay in excess of their limits. So the purpose of this bill amends an existing code section, 9-11-67.1 which has been used in the past to try to address the issue but it hasn't quite tampered it down because people are very creative and they come up with ways to pay. But this is trying to finally provide clarity so that these offers to settle these kinds of claims from a motor vehicle accident don't get abused as the way I've just discussed. The bill clarifies how the insurance company would accept the offer. It sets out what the essential elements of the offer are and provides that as long as those essential elements are accepted then any failure to comply with other non-material terms like your check can't have any commas in it or the payment has to be delivered in cash to my office at 1235 on a Saturday. Those sorts of things could not give rise to any bad faith claims. So this tries to address that issue, protect insurance companies from extra contractual liability and these claims for bad pay to pay where they really do try to pay and they offer to pay their full limits but don't comply with all these other unreasonable conditions. I want to thank the speaker for his leadership on this issue. He directed the parties to work on this and this bill reflects a negotiated resolution of these issues between members of GTLA and their leadership and the defense bar. And I want to thank them because they have worked so hard on this all session long trying to come up with a resolution which is reflected you in Senate Bill 83. So this is an effort to try to ensure that the insurance industry is protected but yet there is still liability if they truly do exercise bad faith but it tries to prevent people from trying to manufacture it unfairly against them. So again many thanks to the parties for working on this and the speaker for his leadership and I want to thank Senator Jackson again for allowing us to use this bill as a vehicle. This is very important legislation and this is not something that we felt we could wait until next year on. It's important to all of us that these issues be resolved. I'm just speaker I'll be glad to stand for any questions. You do have a question representative Reese to your left and the back has a question. Thank you. Mr. Speaker does the gentleman you. Yes sir. Thank you sir for breaking this bill isn't it true that what this bill is really doing is giving us clarity and and precise instructions as attorneys is what needs to be in this document so that all parties are on the same page and everyone's clear exactly what's happening with the settlement which is what you should want. There shouldn't be any ambiguity in those type situations. I should let you do my well presentation former sir thank you. I'm excited at sometimes. I love it when lawyers get along. Gentlemen has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen I ask your favorable consideration of Senate bill 83. Thank you.
