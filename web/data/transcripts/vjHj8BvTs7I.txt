Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. Doorkeepers will please close the doors and keep them closed. We will move forward through the session. Legislative day 20 has arrived. We will begin the day-to-day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 136th House District Representative Carolyn Hugley. Good morning. To Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I am pleased to introduce our chaplain of the day. Our chaplain hails from Columbus, Georgia. He is the son of the late Reverend Dr. J. H. Flakes, Jr. and Mrs. Robina Flakes. He is married to the lovely Jacqueline Denise Flakes and she is not with us this morning because she is an educator and she is busy taking care of the children. They are parents of two children, Brian and Kevin. Reverend Flakes grew up in Columbus, Georgia and he attended the schools there. He is a graduate of Tuskegee University for his Bachelor of Science degree. He has a Master of Divinity degree from the International Interdynamonational Theological Center of Morehouse School of Religion. He has a Master's degree from the University of Iowa and he also has his Doctor of Ministry from Mercer University, McAfee School of Theology. Mr. Flakes was a football player in his youth and in 2011 he was inducted into the Tuskegee University Athletic Hall of Fame. He has a lot of other accolades but there are some gentlemen in the House that can appreciate the fact that he is a member of Kappa Alpha Scyte fraternity. He is very involved in our community and he does a number of things and I will just mention a couple of them for you. He serves as the first vice president of the Congress of Christian Education for the State of Georgia. He is the moderator of the Mount Cavalry Association and he is the convener of a group called a call to talk where he brings in people from throughout the community to reason together to discuss problems in the community and come up with workable solutions. He serves as a faculty member of the Sanjay School Publishing Board for the National Baptist Convention USA Incorporated. He is the pastor of the Forest Street Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus where his father, the late Reverend Dr. J. H. Freak's junior was the pastor for some 50 years. Reverend Dr. J. H. Freak's the third is a sound teacher. He is a preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He is a servant of God and I am so very pleased to call him my friend. Please welcome our Chaplain of the Day Reverend Dr. J. H. Freak's the third. Good morning to Speaker Rausten, to the distinguished members of this house. And I want to say thank you to Representative Hugh Glee for the kind introduction and I want to thank her for the invitation as well and for you accepting and allowing me to come to stand before you this morning. The inspiration for today, people the world overspent an estimate 98.2 billion dollars on chocolate in 2016. The number is staggering, isn't it? Yet at the same time, not all the numbers really was surprising. Chocolate after all tastes delicious and we enjoy consuming it. So the world rejoiced collectively when the sweet treat was found to have significant health benefits as well. It is promoted that chocolate contains flavonoids that help safeguard the body against aging and heart disease. Never has a prescription for health been so well received or obeyed in moderation, of course. Solomon suggested there's another sweet worthy of your investment, wisdom. He in Proverbs 24 verse 13 recommended his son to eat honey for he said it is good. And he also compared it, it's sweetness to wisdom. The person who feeds on God's wisdom in scripture find it not only sweet to the soul but beneficial for training and teaching it, equipping you for every good work you will need to accomplish in life to face the challenges, face the difficulties, the hard times day to day and even in this session. Wisdom is what allows you to make smart choices as representatives and understand the world around you. And it's worth investing in and sharing with those you love as well as respect. Where's Solomon wish to do for his son? We feel good about feasting on God's wisdom in the Bible. It's a sweet treat that we can enjoy without limit. In fact, we're encouraged to do so. I just come today, I come this morning to encourage you to take a moment and thank God for the sweetness of his scriptures. Wisdom. Let us pray. No God, we give your thanks and give you thanks for giving us another day. We come thanking you once again that we, your children, can come before you and ask guidance for the men and the women of this house of representatives. We welcome your presence. We welcome your provision of peace. We welcome your protection and we welcome your wisdom in this place during this session. May these devoted and dedicated public servants, ears and hearts be open to listen to the hopes and the needs to those whom they represent. Please keep all who work in this house and in this capital, in good health, that they might faithfully fulfill the great responsibility given them in their service to the work of our great state. Bless them this day. Bless them every day. And may all that is done be for your greater honor, for your glory and for your praise. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus the Christ, amen. Please join with me the Pledge of Allegiance. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan, the Chair of the Committee on Information and Audits.

Through research.

Collaboration and training, the Innovation Center serves as a critical resource for our rural communities. And with its continued effort, the Center will be able to help our communities with issues like maternal mortality, mental and behavioral health and community-based care.

It's my privilege today to introduce Dr. Brad Bushnell. He's from a very special place in Georgia Athens but he calls Rome home. I'm actually doing this on behalf of Representative Mitchell Skoggins because Brad lives just barely in his district but he is my great friend as well and Mitchell had something that is keeping him away this morning. Dr. Bushnell as I said is from Athens. He received his undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt and his doctorate in medicine from the Medical College of Georgia in 2003. He performed his residency in orthopedic surgery at UNC Chapel Hill. He also pursued an MBA in business in 2014 from Auburn. He is currently the chairman of the Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine at the Harman Clinic in Rome, Georgia and serves as the lead team physician for our own Rome Braves. He is the assistant clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at MCG and on the board of directors locally for our Boys and Girls Club of Northwest Georgia, the board of trustees for Barry College, and is a reserve sheriff's deputy and SWAT medical officer in Rome and Floyd County. He and his wife Kimberly have two wonderful children, Boe and Sarah Beth. He is not only a healer, I know all the knees and joints that he is repaired in Rome and around but he is also a true public servant with a great heart. My friend Brad Bushnell. I want to thank you all for letting me be your doctor of the day today. I hope I see zero of you downstairs. I recently got to be the shaperone for my son's middle school field trip to Washington, DC and as we were getting up there near the Capitol, one of the kids in the group asked, what's the difference between this Capitol and the gold one that we have back home in Georgia? And I said, well, back home we actually get things done. So thank you all for your service. Yeah, we'll clap for that one. Thank you for being a model of while we all disagree on things sometimes for getting it done and for showing our kids that this is how governments supposed to work. Thank you for this honor and y'all have a great day. House will remain at order. House will remain at order. We are about to recognize some very special and distinguished guests.

He was first a man of God, husband, father, brother, deacon, school board member for 24 years, community band leader. He served in the Covington Police Force for 45 years as well as been the longest employee of the city of Covington. He was assistant chief of police for the Covington Police Department from 1997 to 2016 when he retired. After his retirement, he served as a reserved deputy and then elevated to deputy for the Newton County Sheriff's Office.

Our life has been changed forever. Nothing will ever be the same, but however, something changed for the good and that is our family's vision. You see, we just saw him as dad or loving dad or loving husband, but I'll return to saw something different. He dedicated his life to law enforcement, to the school board, to the community which he lived. Now, our vision has grown with his vision and we see what he sees. It is our lifelong mission now through the newly formed Auburn James Turner Foundation to continue to work in the community, to continue to work in schools to help our teachers and our students and the community which he lives in. So we thank you this day for this honor and he will never be forgotten.

Chair recognizes representative Stovall for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, fellow House members. In celebration of Black History Month, it is an honor for us to recognize today the Yerubah tribe of Africa. The Yerubah tribe is one of the largest and oldest African ethnic groups in Nigeria. Their population is 45 million people worldwide. They also live in the Republic of Benin, Northern Togo and Europe. Due to the transatlantic slave trade, many Europeers were enslaved in parts of the USA, Cuba, Brazil, other Portuguese countries and the Caribbean. Their artifacts, worship, singing, and electrifying dance, only exemplifies as unique rich culture and traditions. No matter where you meet a Yerubah, you know instantly they are proud of their heritage and culture, which was handed down from their ancestors. There is so much to say about the Yerubah, so to hear and see for yourself, you invited to join us on Saturday, February 29th at the Riverdale Town Center. This event will harness unity and appreciation between the African Dots for African Americans while at the same time exposing Georgians to this tribe. I am joined today by Oba King Shola, a Kim Remesy of the Office of Arrhyde of Georgia, Dr. Babs on the Bon Jo, out of Remes Samuel, Emmanuel Addemmo, and Benjamin Falotti. Members will you help me to welcome the Yerubah tribe that who are here with us in the gallery, Y'all please stand. Now we will hear remarks from the Oba. I can't roll, go bully. Good morning, Speaker. Thank you for having me. Thank you representative Stover. What I want I just to say, she already said that. So I'd like to thank you all. And please do not forget to come on Saturday at the Riverdale Center. Thank you for having us. The chair has just gotten word from that Chairman Gerald Green's surgery has been completed very successfully. And yeah, we need some good news. And I think he's already planning to be back with us next week, but he's had a tough week so far. So keep him in your thoughts and prayers. The clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 1201. House Resolution 1201, my resident, Bevin's of the 83rd card of the 92nd, hence the 86th. Oliver the 82nd, Stevenson the 90th and others. A resolution honoring Ed McBrayer for his 29 years of service at the Path Foundation and celebrating the 20 year anniversary of the DeCab County Master Trail Plan and for other purposes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues. I am so excited to be here with you today to honor my friend and one of my civic heroes, Ed McBrayer, Executive Director of the Path Foundation for 29 years and also to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of the Cab County's Master Plan for multi-use trails. With us today, in addition to Ed, please help me welcome his husband of four years and partner of 26 years, Wendell York, Leona Levitan, DeCab County CEO from 1993 to 2000. Gil Waldorf, DeCab Commissioner from 1992 to 2006. Pete Pellegrini, who co-founded the Path Foundation with Ed. And Representative Vernon Jones, are you up here now? Because he was the CEO of the Cab County from 2001 to 2008 and he was the one responsible for authorizing the Green Space Bond Package that funded the trails. We also want to acknowledge Kelly Jordan, Kelly, are you up in the gallery? Yes, thank you because he helped, he co-founded the Radio Mountain Alliance in Decab that worked with Ed and Path to build over 30 miles of trails. And we also want to acknowledge Jim Cox Kennedy, who raised critical private money to match public funds. He could not be with us today. So I want to honor all of them for their vision 20 years ago, for our future, for taking the risk and approving this plan for trails that we all benefit from today. My connection with Ed was over 20 years ago. David and I love to cycle and I'd be out there with our kids and the Silver Comet Trail was built and we would load up our bikes on the back of the minivan and want to go out to the trail. And I was, we loved that, but we were frustrated, we couldn't bike in our own community. So when I heard about this master plan for trails, that's when I got involved as a citizen, as my first citizen activist type thing and we worked on a local trail, a local segment, that didn't work out, but we are here to celebrate the, the 40, over 40 miles of trails into cabin, over 250 miles of trails throughout the great state of Georgia. So on your desks, you can see some of the different trails in Ed's bio. And I want to just read out loud a few lines of this resolution that talk about the power of trails. So whereas trails are used for walking, riding, skating, or rollerblading, they're on their, they are on their way to a healthier lifestyle. Thousands of people use trails from dawn to dusk every day. When more people are outside and keeping eyes on neighborhoods, perpetrators are less likely to commit crimes. Also, property values next to trails are valued higher than nearby properties, as trails preserve open space and create because he's of neighborhoods. So it's absolutely appropriate that we should acknowledge

which the accomplishments of the Path Foundation and Ed McBrayer and please help me congratulate Ed on this. Thank you. Mr. Speaker and Representative Evans, thank you for this recognition. In 29 years at Path we built over 290 miles of trails throughout the state. So St. Simon's Trail to see Island, the Carrollton Greenbelt, Newden, Lagrange, we built them all over the state. And we couldn't have done it without lots of help because my staff who's all sitting up there comprised of three full-time people and three part-time people. Could y'all all stand? Like Becky said, we are a nonprofit agency funded by the Woodruff Foundation, James M. Cox Jr. Foundation and a very generous philanthropic community throughout the state. So I'm just honored to be recognized. Ms. Levitan over here recognized the value of trails back when nobody else did. She actually helped me shovel the first, shovel full of dirt in the first trail we ever built into Calb County. It was 90 degrees, she tells me. I don't remember that part, but anyway, happy Thursday to everybody and thank you for the recognition. you Clirk will read the caption to House Resolution 1096. House Resolution 1096 by Representative Clark of the Hundred and Eighth Hutchinson of the Hundred and Sevenhth and Gamble of the Fifteenth. A resolution recognizing and commending lower Ross, the American School Counselor Association's 2020 School Counselor of the Year and for other purposes. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for an invite resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and good morning colleagues. It is my honor and pleasure to have the opportunity to introduce Laura Ross. Laura Ross is a school counselor at Five Forks Middle School in Lawrenceville and Gwyneth County. Ms. Ross has dedicated her life's work and career toward building relationships with students and helping them realize their full potential. It is this work and dedication that has earned her the distinguished honor of being awarded the American School Counselor Association 2020 School Counselor of the Year and that is National School Counselor of the Year. So out of all the states Georgia is representing. So ladies and gentlemen, I would like to allow Ms. Ross to give you all a few words. Good morning. Thank you Representative Clark for inviting me to speak today. Thank you Speaker Ralston, Speaker Pro Tim Jones, Majority Leader Burns, Minority Leader Tramble and the members of the Georgia House of Representatives. I thank you for allowing me to speak about my passion today of school counseling and on behalf of Georgia School Counselors and added thank you for including us in the educator pay raises. My purpose as a school counselor is to connect with my students so I can connect them to their education. We oftentimes hear about the school to present pipeline while I began my counseling career in a men's correctional facility. What I learned from the men on my caseload about their lack of connection to school and their feeling as though they did not belong in school is what propelled me to become a school counselor. We are uniquely trained educators in a school building who are perfectly poised to help create these connections for our students. School counselors do this by creating proactive student focused data informed comprehensive programs that support all students in their academic success, social emotional development and their post secondary exploration and readiness. We do not work in isolation but with administrators teachers, paraproes, parents, community members and district leaders to collaborate and consult through the well being of our students. In order for school counselors to be effective and to do this work so that our positive impact can reach all students, we have to focus on improving two numbers. The first is the school counselor to student ratio. The American School Counsel Association recommends 250 students to one counselor. The Georgia School Counsel Association has asked for a ratio of 450 to one and while that number was approved it is yet to be fully funded, leaving some of my fellow school counselors with caseloads as large as over 1000 students to one counselor. The lower our caseload the bigger that impact school counselors can make with their students. The second number is our use of time. School counselors need the ability to use our time to be school counselors to apply our knowledge and skills to support our students. The American and Georgia School Counsel Association recommends spending 80% of our time either in direct or indirect service of our students directly serving our students or indirectly serving those who support our students consulting with teachers and parents and administrators. I believe the way that we get to improving these numbers is by having a more universal understanding of what school counselors do. One of the ways Georgia can grow that understanding is by updating the state board will on school counselors to reflect the current role we fulfill in schools. This will allow more school counselors to have comprehensive programs that will increase the number of our work ready graduates because our comprehensive school counseling framework perfectly aligns with the employability skills framework. Thank you for continuing to support school counselors in Georgia which in turn supports the academic success, social emotional development and post secondary readiness of all our Georgia students. Thank you. Thank you. We are going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 838. House Bill 838 by Representative Hitchens, 161st and others to be titled an act to amend Code Section 245, 510 and Article 8, Chapter 2, Title 35, the fiscal and Georgia annotated relating to privileged communications between law enforcement officers and peer counselors. This bill haven't referred to the Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Hitchens to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in behalf of Health Bill 838. This year's proverbial simple bill. It actually clears up some language that was in the bill that I passed about three years ago which refers to the creation of the Office of Public Safety Officer Support. Legislative Councils notify us that about four places in this bill it talks about public safety officer support that it refers to individuals. The bill actually provided mental health services and support for law enforcement officers, firemen, EMTs, 911 operators and correctional officers. So what they're saying is that we may disenfranchise the firemen, DMTs, 911 operators if we leave the word officer in there. So all this bill does is strike officer in four different places. But be glad to accept any question, Mr. Speaker. You do not have any questions. I yield the will. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of House bill 838 will vote aye those opposed to vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines. If you are if your machine didn't work come down here and record your vote. On the passage of House bill 838 the eyes are 147 the nasa zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 846. I remember in the forward of the 174th, Harold 106, Carson 46 and others being tautled and act to amend. Title 48 if it's going to George Antony relating to revenue and taxation. So it's to provide that interest paid on refunds of overpayments of taxes and past due taxes shall be equal to the bank prime loan rate. This bill ever inferred committee on ways and means. The committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes chairman Corbett to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House I bring before you house bill 846 House bill 846 deals with the direct pay permit program. The purpose behind the direct pay permit program is to increase the accuracy and tax reporting by businesses that make substantial purchases of items whose taxability at the time of purchase is unknown. Basically if an item is used in the manufacturing process it is not taxable. But if it's used in a part of the plants a shipping it would be taxable and the manufacturer is in the best position to determine the taxability of an item. And in doing so allowing them to do this we place a significant responsibility and accountability on that direct pay permit holder. We passed house bill 93 and 2017 almost identical bill to house bill 846 once 67 to zero. We made just a few changes in that bill at request of ACCG, GMA and the manufacturers and what we've done we set the refund interest and assessment at prime instead of prime plus three. A request of the department we allow a political subdivision they can elect to pay that refund paid an equal installments over and up to the equal amount of months as was covered by the claim. We also clarify that interest will not start accruing on that until the tax payer files for a refund. And the fourth thing we do is we codify this in code. Like I said, GMA, ACCG, GMA, the manufacturers. Everybody is supported this. This is a compromise they've all come up with. They're all in support of it and I would ask for this house's favorable consideration of house bill 846 legislation which will further enhance Georgia's reputation as a business friendly state and encourages investment and job creation. And that accompanies that investment. I appreciate everybody's favor consideration and I will stand for any questions, Mr. Speaker. You have some questions if you care to yield. I will take a couple chair recognizes representative Bentley to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's a gentleman. You do to my friend. Yes sir, is it not true that this bill will not affect the funeral industry and is it also true that the funeral directors will be at the state capital on tomorrow? The lady knows of what she speaks and is it not further true that every member of this house has asked to wear black in honor of the funeral directors that will be here tomorrow? And again, the lady knows of what she speaks. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I think I'll yield the well and ask for everybody's favor consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? Chair here is none. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is none. The rules committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of House Bill 846? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. The pピw have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 846, the eyes are 148th and the nays are three.

Members of the House today, I present to you House Bill 808. This bill addresses the additional time needed to repair vehicles due to increases in the amount of recalms, parts supply stocks, and a number of associated factors. This measure simply adds 15 additional days to the current 30 days, bringing the total to 45 days. Will that for the owner owner be required to remit for TAB tax?
