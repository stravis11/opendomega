you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you ی so much, Mr. Speaker, representative Thomas, everyone gathered today. I keep hearing that today is truly an important day. You know, there are a lot of people inside and outside of this building that are praying harder than they've ever prayed before, hoping that their bill can somehow make it to the other side of the chamber. Well, I've got some good news. And though my authorities as Chaplain does not grant me the authority to Dean Bills' past, but I've got even better news, because I know of someone who has experience in crossing over. You see, I am reminded of Mark 435 when Jesus left the crowd behind as he crossed over to the other side to pray. Come on, now y'all know the story when Jesus was traveling to the other side and the storm broke out. You see, all too often, even in our own lives, we refuse to leave the crowd and to go to the other side. But you see, each of us, we must follow the steps of our Savior to go to the other side. Perhaps it's to take a tough vote, which may not be popular, but yet somehow we know in the depths of our soul, that's the right thing to do. You see, in order for us to continue to move our state forward and to remain as the best state in the nation, we're going to need some people who are ruling to cross over party lines, to cross over political ideologies and to forsake the status quo so that we can continue to march forward toward a better tomorrow. Look, I know it's not easy, it's not going to be popular, nor is it going to be comfortable, which is why it is so important that we lean into the immovable passage of Galatians 6 9 which states, let us not be weary in well doing. For at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we faint not. You know, I know each of us are familiar with seasons and for those of us who are close to the field of agriculture. We know all too well, there's a time and a season for everything. A season to sow, a season to grow, and a season to harvest. You know, there could be said that there are lies similarities between politics and agriculture, for example, when each of you first won your elections, that was a time of triumph and happiness. And now that we're nearly midway through the session, I'm sure a few of you may have helped your bumps and bruises along the way. But even now, several iconic leaders that once graced these hallways and this chamber with their presence, they are now held closely in our minds and in our spirits. And so that's why it's so important that we lean into Galatians 6 9 because while our time on this planet may be finite, the fruits of our labor will continue on. That's why we work, while we churn and while we wrestle, we must remember to not become weary and well doing. Let us not be weary when your committee chair may call that early committee hearing because you know there may be a young child that's counting on you to show up and to speak on their behalf. Let us not be weary as we've seemingly held our 10th TeleTon Hall of the Year because you know there may just be a younger version of you waiting on the other line waiting to be inspired. Let us not be weary when we are called to sometimes go against the grain to ruffle a few political feathers in this political sphere. All because of that burning desire that led you to this chamber, it's trying to break out. The idea that you wrestled with, you know it might just be so crazy that it just might work. Ladies and gentlemen, you have been equipped and prepared for this journey. You have been chosen for such a time as this. And my prayer for us today is that we do not give up, that we do not relint. And I know at times it will seem impossible. It's going to seem hard, but do not worry. Our scripture tells us that joy comes within the morning and we will reap a harvest if we faint not. So to those of you that are hoping to get your bill to the other side of the chamber and perhaps all the way to the governor's desk, I wish you well. But let us be confident in this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. So let us move forward and love caring for one another, taking care of our neighbor, even if they do not think like us, even if they do not look like us. Let us move forward with love and with grace. Will you pray with me? Father right now I pray for every heartbeat under the sound of my voice. I pray for these leaders and ask that you search their hearts and give them the wisdom, give them the discernment, the power, the zeal, the fervor, and the ability to recognize and implement your will. Father I pray for their families and for this great state. Father I ask that you place a hedge or protection around us and that you bless our elected leaders, that you bless our farmers and that you bless every person throughout our great state and throughout our entire world. Father we thank you for giving us the gift of today for that is why it is called the present. We ask of all these things in Jesus name we pray. Amen? Amen. Congratulations to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God and the invisible with liberty and justice for all. Pastor we appreciate not just your service to us here this morning but your service to your fellow man and agriculture and that was a great devotion. Thank you so much.

year to in a four year program one needs to be 70% complete to be eligible for for the aid in a two year program 45% it doesn't make sense if you think about it if you're in a two year program in doing this aid annually to think about somebody being 70 or 80% finished after one year if it's a two year program so I ask your support to help us improve this also online 29 will have additional funds budgeted this year so we're moving the total award up to 3,500 but still no more than 2,500 at a time I have a list I'll be happy to share it with anyone about the subscription if you will the usage deployment of this capital so for four million dollars of the 10 million had been to have been deployed and it will be deployed the remaining of that would be deployed this year before the end of the fiscal year in June so ladies and gentlemen if there are no questions I ask for your continued support of this important program to help Georgia students get across the finish line and become higher wage earners in our state gentlemen you owe four questions I will have one yes the lady from the 89th representative Becky Evans has a question to your left thank you mr. Speaker does the gentleman yield absolutely yes I just want to confirm what you just said so you said four million out of the 10 million has been spent and the remaining will be deployed so that means that the other six million will be given out there there's enough demand for that that this remaining amount will be given out we it's impossible to know exactly represent Evans but what we do know is it for two year programs tcsg which was a large target of this most of their programs are certificates our programs that are two years or less and they had a really hard time using it with the 80% number so we think that will increase the use substantially so I can't tell you that all six million that's left will be deployed that this is numbers as of the 22nd of February 2023 I'm told another 400,000 has gone out since then so it is our job to make people eligible and in financial authorities at each college and university technical school take those criteria and determine and allocate that to the students so we hope it will be put to use thank you gentlemen has no further questions thank you mr. Speaker I yield the well and ask for the House favor consideration at hb 249 the author has yielded the well is there any objection to the previous question being ordered is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair here's known the committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill chair here's none the report the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine have all members voted have all members voted if so the clerk will

Locked the machine on the pasture of the bill. The A's were 168. The NA's won. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, if you'll read the caption to House Bill 458. 458. I represent a purple of 169th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 23, title 2 of the fiscal to Georgia annotator related hemp farming. So is to provide for intent. Ms. Bill, I'm referring to the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Parkle has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So now's the time that you wake up and you heard hemp and you see representative Parkle in the well and you think, and what in the world? If you recall, I was one of three no votes on the inaugural hemp bill by my good friend, Chairman John Corbett, two years ago, three years ago now. You might ask, why do you have the hemp bill? CBD and hemp related derived products are not adequately regulated in the state of Georgia. Listen to this, a 10-year-old can legally purchase a 100-mg THC gummy in the state of Georgia and it is legal right now. There is no database or record of how many stores sell hemp products where they're made and what is actually in it. There's a recent Journal of American Medical Association study that found that 76% of the hemp products tested were inaccurately labeled. 76% were wrong. The language in this bill is meant to provide consumer protections. Think guardrails. It does it in two primary ways. One, all consumable products, hemp products must have a QR code on the packaging that shows the results of a full panel certificate of analysis by an independent accredited agency, a laboratory. And secondly, it prevents the purchase of consumable hemp products by anyone under the age of 21, including signage. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker. I ask about yes. Gentlemen, you have four questions. I'm sorry. Yes, sir. Let's see. Representative Ridley from the sixth House District, to your extreme right, has a question if you're yielded. Yes, sir. I will. It's my friend Yield. Yes, sir. The truth that the Agriculture Department and the Agriculture Committee is in favor of this bill. And someone is mistakenly handing out cards outside that said that they're against it and has the Georgia groan logo on it, which is against trademark rules. I think the gentleman knows what he speaks. Thanks, sir. You hear for one more question? Yes, sir. I was friend from the coast. Yes, sir. Representative G观ard to your extreme left over here has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. the gentleman you? Yes, sir. Is it not true that I am a regional member of the study committee and was also on that bill? If the gentleman's so state, I'm absolutely sure he knows what he's talking about. Is the gentleman further you? Yes, sir. Is it also not true that I am one of the unofficial members of the hemp caucus of the Georgia General Assembly and believe firmly in the product and went to a business this weekend and the hemp was not legitimized? If the gentleman's so state. Excellent bill. Thank you so much for this bill. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well. Asked you to vote yes on this one. The gentleman's yielded the well. I thought we were going to identify the members of the hemp caucus. I was getting a little nervous on that deal. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair here is none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill. Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? We will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Do you have a question to call in the name? From what purpose does RIPZENY FRIE rise? Any ways? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the yeas were 169, the nays 2. The bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, if you are ready to caption to House Bill 462. House Bill 462, by rose, in a balance of the 23rd and others to be entitled to amend chapter 11 and title 15, the official code of Georgia annotated relating to juvenile code so to enact the Raise the Age Act. This bill I refer to the committee on juvenile justice, that committee recommends a dispelled do pass by committee substitute. Chairman Valenger is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue that I have worked on for several several years. It's been percolating around this house. This house actually passed it out, I think, either last year or the year before. But it's been around for a really long time, and it's been very much vetted by all the agencies here in this state. The first part of the bill just deals with the implementation committee. The second part of the bill just goes through and basically strikes 17 and puts in 18. What this bill would do at its heart are 17 year olds in the state of Georgia do not go to juvenile court, they go to state or superior court. They're adjudicated just like adults. Anybody who's ever known a 17 year old knows how far from adulthood that 17 year old really is. Even if you've just been 17. So that's basically what this bill does. This bill also has another key provision in it. A couple of key provisions that I want to go over with you. This bill, unlike a lot of bills, has a kill switch in it. The kill switch means that this bill will not go into effect unless everything is ready for the bill to go into effect and it is fully funded by the state. This bill is a state fully intends to take on every expense and everything that will entail the implementation of raising this age for juvenile court to include 17 year olds. Second part of this bill, second key thing about this bill is that it does not include any gang offenses. Our prosecutors and law enforcement were very concerned about gang offenders so we excluded them from the bill. So any 17 year old that's charged with a gang offense will still go as an adult. And the third thing is it's for first time offenders only. So if this is a person that's kind of been through the wheel and has been through juvenile court several times, they will not get another bite at the apple. The whole point of 17 year olds being adjudicated in juvenile court has to do with a rehabilitative model that they have, has to do with some of the privacy conventions that are allowed in juvenile court that are not afforded in state or superior court. And it has to do with just maintaining them on that kind of straight narrow path. 92% of first time offenders who are adjudicated in juvenile court will never see a criminal court rim again because of that rehabilitative and they're certainly not being branded as a offender so to speak. Law enforcement has two, I've whittled their concerns down to two. The first is they don't like the name of the implementation committee. They would rather it be something else. I don't know the committee has to do with implementing the policy of 17 year olds in juvenile court. So I don't really know what else to name the committee but they don't like the name of the committee. And their second concern is the Department of Juvenile Justice Resources. Now those Department of Juvenile Justice testified in a full committee hearing of juvenile justice that they felt with a time and the necessary resources being provided that they would be able to accommodate the 17 year olds that would be coming into their system. So they have no problem with it. However they are officially neutral on the bill. They should be. They're an executive branch agency. It's not they should not have influence policy. We are the policy making body for the state of Georgia. Not the executive branch but we are the policy making body and we should be those arbiters that basically instruct them on what policies to enforce and how to enforce those. There are a couple of myths about the bill. One being that 17 year olds are evil. They're going to go into our juvenile court system and they're going to corrupt the 15 year olds. They're going to lead those 13, 14 year olds down a dangerous path if they were to be incarcerated with those folks. Now how is it a good thing to incarcerate a 17 year old with a 50 year old? I don't know how that's a good thing but yet a 17 year old with a 16 year old is a bad thing. If anybody can explain that to me please ring in. I'll be happy to take any comments. But if anybody could explain that to me I would really appreciate it. Now there's another myth that's been going around saying that this will allow our 17 year olds to get away. They're going to skate. They're not going to be properly punished as they should be. Ladies and gentlemen the bad acts that they commit they're called 440 cases after the Senate bill that enacted this which put all those very violent offenses into one category and their original jurisdiction is superior court. Those cases are tried this way right now. After my bill passes they will be treated the exact same way. There's no deviation. There's no change. There's no nothing. So these offenders are certainly not going to be getting off by any stretch of the imagination. Those are the key highlights of the bill. I know there's a lot of misconceptions out there. I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you very much. Speaker I will yield for questions. You do have a question. Representative Kenner to your left. How's the question? Representative Kenner. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the lady yield? I do. Thank you for bringing this measure. I fully support it. Is there a timeline estimate on how long it will take to implement the age change? It is in the bill. So in other words if the funding is in place it will be implemented in January 1, 2025. However if the money is not in place then the bill will basically go dormant. We'll seek to find that funding and then we'll try again the next year. So basically that's the way the bill works. We have to have those important guardrails and funding in place before it goes into effect. One more question. The earliest is January 1 of 2025. Yes sir. Okay thank you. Thank you. The lady yield for another question to your left. Representative Jasmine Clark has a question to your left. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? Yes ma'am. I'm curious you mentioned that this bill will not apply to 17 year olds that are in gangs. But you also made it a point to say that 17 year olds in general are a lot more childlike than adult like. So is it do not think that 17 year olds that are recruited into gangs can be rehabilitated just like a 17 year old that commits a similar crime without a gang affiliation? I do think that 17 year olds are very much to be rehabilitated. Actually there's a juvenile court judging Cobb County, Judge Glennis who has a very, you know it's the first of its kind in the state but it's basically an alternative court for gang members to show those folks that there is a life outside of a gang and it's operated in the juvenile court there in Cobb County. It's a program I would like to see across the state. This was just one of those you know as you're making the sausage. This was one of those concessions that I made to law enforcement to assuage some of the concerns that they may have about the bill. So that's why that's in there. Well thank you I definitely agree with you that 17 year old gang members should have the option to go through juvenile court just like any other 17 year old that commits a crime. Thank you for taking my question. Yes ma'am. Lady has no further questions. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I urge your favorable consideration to this very important measure. The lady has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? The chair here's none. The committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here's none. Report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill? We'll vote yes. All those opposed. We'll vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The yeas were 145, the nays 22, the bill having received the requisite Constitution majority is therefore passed. Members if I can have your attention up here for just for a minute, I want to introduce you to one of the finest members ever served in this House of Representatives, not you all. You're a working progress. I can assure you of that. Chairman Tom Dixon, y'all make Tom welcome. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 498. House Bill 498. To be entitled, act to amend part three of Article 1 and Chapter 18 to Title 43, the Fisher should go to Georgia annotated, relating the licenses for funeral directors and embalmers so to change certain provisions related to the reinstatement of the lapse to the funeral director's license. This bill have been referred to the Committee on Small Business Development. That committee recommends this bill do pass. The gentleman from the 149th House District, Grypsett, Dady Mathis, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I bring to you House Bill 498. It's the real statement of a license, a few rutters and bombers that have lapsed. This bill was brought last year, passed through the House and the Senate, and even was signed, but we realize that that time it was just years going forward, not in the, in the Rears back to 10 years. So what we're trying to do now is just get it to where they can be reinstated with provisions. That's the bill, Mr. Speaker. I'd appreciate you. Yes, Vogue. The gentleman yield for one question. Yes, sir, are you? I bet it's going to be brief, too. Chair recognizes, Representative Bentley, in the back for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am, I do. Mr. Representative, is it not true that I support House Bill 498 and asking all members to please support this bill also? Is that not true? Yes, ma'am, it is, and I thank you very much. And thank you for your work on this legislation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. The gentleman has yielded the well, is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair has none. The previous question is ordered, is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill, the chair here's none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed, will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have all members voted if so? The clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill, the yeas were 172, the day zero, the bill having received the records that constitutional majority is therefore passed. Members, we're going to take up a bill now that was on Thursday's rules, calendar that was postponed until today. House bill 128, House bill 128 was on Thursday's calendar, postponed, and we'll take it up today. House bill 128, clerk will read the caption to House bill 128. House bill 128 by Representative Hong of the 103rd District to be entitled to amend titles 48 and 50, the fiscal to Georgia, and TATA relating to revenue and taxation and state government respectively, still survive for the representation of minority business enterprises and women owned businesses. This bill I've referred to the committee on state properties and community affairs, that committee recommends that this bill do pass. The governor floor leader, Representative Hong, is recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I present to you House bill 128 on behalf of the governor. What this bill will do is it will streamline the current state certification process for minority owned businesses. Currently, you have to get a federal certification before you get a state certification, but we will take out the federal certification and the Department of Administrative Services will take care of and set the eligibility for state certification process. We are also adding women owned businesses, as well as veteran owned businesses to this process. This is an optional process for these businesses, and this does come in after an executive order by the governor to look into the state contract procurement as well. Of course, the state agency will always look to the best value and low cost for our state when they are procuring state contracts. That is the bill, and I yield for any questions, Mr. Speaker. You do have some questions. Representative Bird right in front of you to your left, a little bit has a question. Representative Bird is recognized for a question. Thank you. Does the lady yield? I yield. Is it not true this excludes white males that are not veterans, and they would not be given the opportunity to have contracts on this bill? Is that not correct? If the lady so states. Representative Higley, to your left is recognized for a question. And Mr. Speaker, if I can just say one more thing on that, state certification process is for these groups. Again, state contract procurement is open to everybody. This is an optional process. It does make it more accessible. It does give these small businesses an opportunity to learn about the state contract procurement as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To your left, Representative Higley, is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman lay the yield? I do. Can you give us what you anticipate? The effect will be in terms of the number of small and minority businesses that will be able to come under this provision. What do you expect is going to happen? We don't have those numbers, obviously. So of course, again, we have a growing number of small businesses in our state. And that's what the report found. And we are at the number one state to do business. But not all these businesses will have to go through the state certification process in order to obtain a state contract. So we don't know which businesses will be willing to go through this process, or if they just want to go ahead and submit for state contract procurement. Representative Williams to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, will the lady yield? Yes, I do. Thank you for this bill. And as a sign of this bill, I think it is a step in the right direction. And it could possibly bring us a long way to more fairness in state contracts. And is it not further true? The last I check, white meals were doing pretty good with state contracts. I yield the well, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. The lady's wise beyond her years. That's no doubt about that. The lady as yielded the well, representative Jasmine Clark is recognized to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today first to say I am in support of what this bill does. I do believe that this is a step in the right direction. However, I did want to point out that while Georgia has quite a few minority owned businesses, especially black owned businesses right here in the Atlanta area, the number of those businesses that are actually getting state contracts is very, very small. And while I appreciate that this bill will increase the number of people that are now considered classified subcontractors, I worry, that by increasing the numerator or the number of businesses that get this, we will kind of, for lack of a better way of putting it, be cooking the books on how many minority businesses are actually getting state contracts. This bill is great for women owned businesses. This bill is great for veteran owned businesses. This bill actually does not do much to move the needle for the very large disparity that we see for black owned businesses getting these state contracts. So while I will be voting yes today, I want to acknowledge that we still have a lot of work to do to fix the gaps that we see when it comes to minority business enterprises getting state contracts. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well. Representative McCullum is recognized for question. But the lady yielded the well, so you have to do a polymany inquiry when we get to that point. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Representative, you will need to measure button again at one off my screen. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Chair, here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Chair, here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. For what purpose does representative McCullum rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say is it true that this bill would be good for as being an honorably served veteran that it would open up the gates for other veterans like me to use this program? I'm sure the gentleman knows what he speaks, and it sounds like a noble purpose to me. Thank you for the question. For what purpose does representative chairman Bonnar rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true as my colleague just alluded to that this bill would benefit all veterans regardless of race or gender? It's a gentleman so states I know he's read the bill and he believes that to be true. And we have many, many honorable veterans in Georgia and we welcome them here and appreciate their service. For what purpose does representative Thomas rise from the 21st? Mr. Speaker, pursuant rule 133 is a veteran business owner. I ask to be excused from this vote. The gentleman has that right, and the journal will so reflect. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of the bill, the A's were 160. The NA's three. The bill haven't received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Chair recognizes chairman Hatchet for a motion. Chair, I'm going to Hatchet. Take your time, chairman Hatchet. I see you coming. And I'm sure there's nobody in this house can stop you from getting to the west.

I'm certainly not going to try. The chairman had just recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that the House agree or adopt the conference committee report on House Bill 18. Did you mean to rush you there, Mr. Chairman? The more posture members of the House is this document has been on our desk for the required hour that's required by our House rules. So it does meet all requirements for us to take up this amended budget. Mr. Clerk, will you read the conference committee report? Committee of Conference on House Bill 18 recommends that both the House of Representatives and the Senate recede from their positions and that the attached committee of Conference Substitute to HB 18 be adopted for the House. Representative Hatchett to the 155th. Representative Jones, the 47th. Representative Astration to the 104th for the Senate. Senator Tillery of the 19th. Senator Kennedy of the 18th. Senator Gouche of the 51st. Chairman Hatchett is recognized to explain the Committee of Conference report for HB 18. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, when it said CCR, all I could think of was creating this clear water revival. So I just, I had a moment there. I guess I could say a senior moment maybe. So I know the day is going to be long, so I'm going to keep my remarks fairly brief. It's been a month since HB 18 was passed by this House. The final Conference Committee agreements that you see on your desk aren't that different from the original document that passed our House in February. The budget was placed on your desk at 915s, not long after we signed it. So I hope you've had time to review the agreements. Let me mention just a few of the highlights. I would be remiss not to begin with a few of the places where the House and Senate agreed not only with each other, but with the Governor. Full funding for QBE and the midterm adjustment. $35.7 million to the Governor's Rule Workforce Housing Initiative. $167.66 million for large economic development projects receiving REBA grants for Hyundai and Rivian. $92 million for reinsurance to help keep our health insurance premiums low. And $34.5 million for knee public safety radio network, estate patrol, and DNR. We also support two of the Governor's proposed tax relief measures in this document. This budget reflects $1.1 billion in the surplus state general funds repurposed as motor fuel funds to keep the Georgia Department of Transportation whole after a ten-month suspension of motor fuel taxes. Our new Conference Committee number of $950 million in the homeowners tax relief grant is less than the Governor's recommendation that our figure is based on projections and provides for the maximum exemption on the assessed home value allowed by the Constitution, which is $18,000. We appreciate the Senate working with us to support a $50 million infusion for the State Health Benefit Plan to phase in the employer contribution increase for non-certified employees. We also support the state health school systems ease into an increase rate over two-year period. And $26.7 million for a $500 one-time benefit payment for state retirees in ERS. This initiative was started by the House and added to by the Senate and the Conference Committee. This adjustment positively impacts 54,000 state retirees in their beneficiaries. We appreciate the Senate coming to the House position on the $105 million for the Medical College of Georgia Medical Record System to point $4 million for domestic violence shelter, security upgrades, no difference in dollars just we had to adjust the language. $300,000 for DPHDD, opioid settlement administration and $500,000 for space utilization assessment of our capital office and meeting requirement needs. We agree to the Senate enhancements to the House additions, a total of $8 million for the crime victims emergency fund. This fund provides compensation for expenses, loss of income or support to victims of violent crime. The House added $7.8 million for airport aid for projects throughout the state. And the Senate added funds to bring the total to $18.2 million and we agreed. The House Senate and the Conference Committee added money for rail upgrades for a final total of $9.6 million. With the House and the Senate added $5 million for a total of $10 million to address housing for youth with complex needs. Safety and security for our citizens inmates and guards was paramount to both chambers and the governor. With additional money added in each version for a total of $68.2 million in new funds added to the Department of Corrections for repairs, renovations, security and technology upgrades. We'd like to agree with the Senate adds of $3.5 million for nursing program expansion grants to meet our nursing demand. We know there's a need for nurses. We started this program in the last budget cycle and the applications far exceeded the funding. This allows for the grants to serve more nursing programs and students. $8.2 million to complete the World Congress Center escalator modernization as well as five capital projects in TCSG and regions brought forward from the 24 bond package to generate savings and debt service of $7.5 million. $5 million to match the $65 million for the Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Project, benefiting Southwest Georgia. There was never a disagreement on the dollar's only placement. The conference committee version places this funding in the Board of Regents. $3.2 million for the Department of Labor, Capital and Employee Recruitment and Retention needs. We wanted to support the new commissioner, but the request came too late in the house process. $50 million in state general funds and DOT to promote transparency in infrastructure needs for large economic development projects and to preserve motor fuel funds for construction and projects statewide. In closing, I'd like to note that this is no easy task to balance the revenue at hand with our needs statewide. There's a lot of input involved. I'd like to thank Senator Tillery and the Senate Budget and Evaluation Office. As well as our own staff led by Christine Murdoch in the House Budget and Research Office, I think they deserve a hand. I also like to thank the House of Proofreadations subcommittees for their leadership as well as the Governor's staff and OPP for their combined efforts and our spent perfecting the amended FY23 budget. There's a lot in this document that we all can be proud of and I ask for your favourable consideration of HB18. Gentlemen, you owe for a question. Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker. I have a question. Would you answer my question? Definitely. So is this your first budget that you are working on and how much? I can't see the water. How many bottles of water you have down there? Just a half. That's enough. Mr. Chairman, this is my first conference committee agreement report on a budget. You've done outstanding work. I know you've worked as the members of this House to know that you've worked extremely hard on this. You've covered many subjects that are important to this House and thank I certainly appreciate you working with the Senate but as we know this House leads and there were ideas and ideas that came from both sides of the aisle in this budget and I appreciate all the members working with you making their views known and certainly for helping perfect this document as we move forward. Now if you would yield for a real question, I'll recognize the whip park for our question. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Chairman Hatchett, for your hard work. I had two questions. Yes, sir. I'm just for the state health benefit plan. I appreciate the work of the House for originally appropriating $100 million to help phase in the burden on local governments but now that it's $50 million, could you speak to the impact that it can have on local governments? Well, the local governments would be the school systems. So we had wanted to put $100 million. The Senate came back at $33 million. We settled at $50 million. But in that, we did, and you'll see the language, we did propose still staggering the increase to your school systems, $250 for $24, $250 for $25, and then stating that by 26, we would still be at $15.80. But in the language also, we're asking the state health benefit plan to annually evaluate this so that we don't end up in this position in the future. Thank you, Chairman. Do you use it for one more question? Yes, sir. So for the learning loss grants, the governor had originally recommended $25 million, but it came back to zero. And I see that some of the federal funds would be used for this purpose, but will the state be appropriating any funds for learning loss, either in this budget or the 24 budget? Right now, it's not the position either with the Senate or House Comfories to do that, because there is so much federal money still out there has not been cleaned. And the superintendents that we have talked with have said, look, I've got all the money I need for that. So we actually took that $25 million and pushed it to $24 to give us some room in $24 funding because $24 is going to be tight. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Gentlemen, you owe for a question from one of your hard working chairs. Yes, sir, definitely. We'll represent Dubemick. Chairman Dubemick's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, the Chairman yielded. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, is it not true that you don't need a penny just to hang around, but if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down? I believe the gentleman to believe that true. Gentlemen, you owe for another question. Yes, sir. And that same area represented Bentley is recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gentlemen, you? Yes. From the lady from Taylor County? Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, thank you. And Mr. Chairman, is it not true that I'm looking forward to voting on this bill because we have students from making county school system that are here present watching us as we are doing our legislative duties here on today. Is that not true? I believe that the lady knows what she speaks. A lady from the 35th represent Campbell to your left has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, Chairman Hatchett, for all of your work. This is a question pertaining to the education budget, line item 24.11.2. Is it not true that the governor had originally requested $15 million to provide for reimbursable grants to paraprofessionals to earn, who are seeking to earn teaching certificates? And that this budget is reduced greatly by $10 million. And if that's accurate, can you share the rationale behind that reduction? Especially given our significant teacher shortages. We did, so we agree in concept with the governor on this, but there aren't as many people in that pipeline as the governor wants thought. And there are a lot of people in there that really, they don't want to go further. And also looking that you put the money in there, not all of us going to go immediately. So we did reduce the sum to let that occur over time to get money to spend other places. But we don't disagree with the concept. We just kind of might not agree with how much at this time. So. Gentlemen, a year for just a couple more? I will. Chairman DeLouch to your right has a question. Chairman DeLouch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, a year for a question. Yes, sir. Isn't it true that the mental health, particularly for military members and their families has been incredibly important both to me and the representative of our Williams and Liberty County. And we want to say thank you for agreeing to the Senate out of $750,000 for mental health clinic in hospital. Thank you. I do believe that had we received that request before we went to the floor. We probably would have added that into, but we agree with it. I appreciate those people for the work that they're doing for our veterans. Mr. Chairman, the lady from the 52nd representative Roberts just out in front of you to your left. Has a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does it the gentleman yield? Yes. Okay. I'm looking at the budget. And in the governors and on ours, we were going to appropriate $4 million to provide funds to replace equipment related to the voting machines. And then the Senate reduced it down to a million. Am I correct in seeing that it's now zero and can you tell me a little bit about how that happened? Yes, the Congress Committee in the Met and we, that was one of the issues that we really were having difficulty agreeing on. So we've, we've, we are looking at putting it in the 24th budget and possibly binding that. So. Thank you. Thank you. Work on that. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to know that the day is going to be long, the skittin' time, eatin' time for lunch. And I will. Mr. Chairman, would you take one more question. The dean of this house has a burning question. If you recommend I do that, I will. I recommend you hear from the dean. Spacely from the dean. Chairman, Gerald Green for question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To the gentleman in the well, Southwest Georgia thinks this particular, what you have done in this particular budget to help us down in Southwest Georgia, especially on the invasive species that we are finding in our lakes, you have been really, really helpful there. And thank you for helping us with the money to provide for a study for a rural hospital that we lost several years ago. Thank you so much to your work and the work of the committees here. Thank you. Thank you, Dean Green. We want to stop the Cuban bull rush. Thank you. I yield the well and ask for this body's favorable consideration of the conference committee report on HB18. The gentleman has yielded the well on the adoption of the conference committee report on HB18, all in favor of the adoption of the conference committee report will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? For what purpose is representative Holly rise? Probably many inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that for the way that Chairman Hatchett so eloquently was able to give his presentation and so calmly, he has inspired us to perhaps wear his footwear in the chamber? Well representative, that will be a decision for each and every member on the stylish footwear to try to emulate the chairman. What purpose does representative Roberts rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Isn't it true that I am extremely concerned about the removal of the money for our counties for replacement of election equipment because they are already dramatically underfunded, working at a deficit and this money was very important to them. Thank you. If the lady says- Is it not true? Sorry. If the lady says states, I'm sure she believes that to be accurate. One last parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does representative Williams, Mary Frances Williams rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State you inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that about the time work on this budget started, Chairman Hatchet learned of some severe cuts at the federal level to domestic violent shelters all over the state and he and his committee responded by giving immediate help to these shelters for badly needed funds to keep them open and serving people who need this help? I'm sure the lady knows of what she speaks and we all the members of this house do appreciate your involvement. That's why this is a bipartisan bill with lots of good ideas from both sides. Thank you for your help in informing the Chairman on those issues and appreciate the Chairman addressing them in this budget. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of the bill. The yeas are 172. The nays too. The bill haven't received the constitutional majority is therefore adopted. Chairman Hatchet is recognized for a motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move the conference committee report on House Bill 18 be immediately transmitted to the governor. Representative Hatchet moves to immediately transmit the conference committee report on House Bill 18 to the governor. Pursuit to Article 3, Section 5, paragraph 13 of the Constitution. The clerk will read the caption. The committee of conference on HB 18 recommends that both the House of Representatives and the Senate receive from their positions in the Attached Committee of Conference Substitute to HB 18 be adopted. On the gentleman's motion, that the House immediately transmit the conference committee report on HB 18 to the governor, all those in favor will vote yes. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the gentleman's motion for immediate transmissal of HB 18 to Yees or 174 to nay zero. And this House has voted to immediately transmit the conference committee report on House Bill 18 to the governor. Excellent work, Mr. Chairman and your staff. We appreciate your committee chairs. Thank you so much. Look forward to doing another one with you. Mr. Chairman, I was going to help you on that CCR, but I was stuck on the same thing you were. So, here we go.
