They are of convening having arrived all members will please report to their assigned seats. All members of the House will please report to their seats. Mr. Clerk would you ring the bell please. We are about to have the morning roll call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will unlock the machines. Doorkypers will please close the doors and keep them closed. Good morning. A beautiful day out there today. We will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 141st House District Representative Dale Washburn. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The ladies and gentlemen of the House is a pleasure for me today to introduce Dr. Tim McCory as our chaplain of the day. Dr. McCory is the lead pastor of Ingolside Baptist Church in Macon, where he has served for more than 31 years. Ingolside is a leading church among Georgia Baptist with a pre-pandemic attendance each Sunday of more than 2000 Washburns, and is a pace setter in missions, both locally, nationally and internationally. Dr. McCory is a summa cum laude graduate of Louisiana College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in religion in 1980. He also earned the Master of Divinity and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. Dr. McCory currently serves on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Southern Seminary, and previously served as both member and chaplain of the Board of Trustees of the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. Dr. McCory was born in Tuplo, Mississippi. He and his wife, Beverly Brown McCory, from Charlotte, North Carolina, will be married 34 years next month. I am honored for Dr. McCory to be my pastor, Adana, and I have been in his church for about 16 years now, I think. Dr. McCory's story to me is a very interesting one, and I'll only take a couple of minutes with this. Dr. McCory was headed toward a career in industrial engineering, and was doing an internship at Lockheed, and was well on the way to doing that. When he felt the call to a higher calling, and he felt called of God to enter the ministry, and so he changed his direction, and he did that. Dr. McCory has many skills. He is a visionary, he is a very great administrator, a great organizer, and God has used all of those talents in what he has done at Ingolstadt Baptist Church. When he came there, there were 1500 members approximately, and today there were over 5,000. One thing I've learned in my life, ladies and gentlemen, is that God's truth is always in season. Dr. McCory, with all of his other talents in the baptism of everything God has done to bless him, and use him in the successful ministry at Ingolstadt, he is always faithful to the truth. I am sure we will hear that truth from him today. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to introduce our Chaplain of the Day, Dr. Tim McCory. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the invitation to be Chaplain of the Day. It's an honor to be here with you, sir, and to serve you and this distinguished body in this significant role. And I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your service and devotion to the citizens of our great state. And Representative Washburn, let me say thanks to you for such kind words in that introduction. You know, I sort of wish my parents, who are both in heaven now, could have been here to hear those generous remarks. And Daddy would have enjoyed them, and my mother would have believed them. And so I want to say thank you, Dale. It's a privilege to be here with you today, and it's an honor to be your pastor and your friend. And now for everyone here this morning, may I pose just a handful of questions. And before we're done, may I offer a gift for you all? Here are the questions, just a handful. Number one, where do you turn? Where do you turn when you need refreshment and renewal for your soul? Number two, where do you turn when you need more wisdom and more insight than you currently possess? Number three, where do you turn when you need burdens lifted and a fresh infusion of energy and joy? Number four, where do you turn when you need sharper vision, the ability to seem more clearly and comprehensively, and the ability to envision a better tomorrow and the pathway to get there? And number five, finally, where do you turn when you're trying to discern what is true and what is right and what is best? In light of these questions, I want to encourage you to hear the words of Scripture with me from Psalm chapter 19, where the Bible says these words. The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean in during forever. The rules of the Lord are true and righteous all together. More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is your servant warned and then keeping them, there is great reward. Did you hear it? The Bible says that if you need revival for your soul, if you need wisdom for your mind, if you need new joy for your heart and new light for your eyes, the place to turn is to the Word of the Lord. So may I ask you about your habits this morning? Habits are important, are they not? In fact, one observer got it right when he said, we make our habits and then they make us, isn't that true? And so let me ask you about your habits today, especially just one habit. Have you yet developed the habit of turning every day to Scripture, to take it in, to meditate on it, to apply it to your own life, this precious truth of God's Word? More than once Jesus spoke directly to the importance of this habit. Do you remember in Matthew's Gospel where Jesus said, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God? It means that just as we need daily nourishment from physical food, we need daily nourishment of spiritual food. In John's Gospel, Jesus put it this way, you'll know at least some of these words. He said, if you abide in my word, you were truly my disciples, here it is, and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. Everyone has heard the latter part of those words of Jesus, but don't miss the predicate. Don't miss the premise. He says, if you abide in my word, you'll know this truth and the truth will set you free. So, may I ask again what about you? Have you developed the habit yet in your life of turning to Scripture every day? Do you allow God to mentor you from His Word? That's where my gift comes in. I want to offer to everyone listening today a free subscription to a mobile digital Bible engagement tool called the chapter of day. It will come right to your phone every morning at 5 o'clock. It will identify the chapter. It will have a hyperlink to the Bible page where the chapter will be read aloud to you if you like. And it will always have a few comments to help you understand and apply what you have read. You know, I've been a pastor for more than 30 years and I've rarely met anyone who hasn't said, oh, pastor, I would love to know the truth of God's Word and apply it to my life. But so many of us have found that difficult to develop and maintain. So, how do you get this tool? You can just pull out your phone right now and text the word chapter to 228-28. That's the word chapter to 228-28. Sign up and you can join literally thousands of Georgians in this journey through the Bible just a chapter a day. I want to say that I conclude this morning. No one will ever regret the time invested learning to listen for God's voice through the scripture each day. Because God has promised to use the truth of scripture to transform our lives for our good and for His great glory. Shall we pray together this morning? Let's stand. Father, we bow our heads before you today acknowledging that our hearts are sometimes dry and weary and we need renewal and revival and refreshment in our soul. Lord, we need more wisdom than we currently have, more light than we currently have, more joy than we sometimes have. And I thank you, Lord, that you've promised to meet us by your spirit through your Word to transform our hearts for our good and for your glory. And so, Lord, I want to pray that those who've already developed this habit would continue it with joy and those who've not yet made their way into your presence each day through your Word would begin to do so today. I thank you for every member of this August chamber for the work that they do. I pray you're rich blessings on them. I ask that you would open the windows of heaven and pour out on them every blessing that can come from your hand. Father, don't withhold any good thing from these members as they walk in obedience to you. And Lord, we offer this prayer with thanksgiving for your grace and your gospel that you so loved the world that you gave your son Jesus, whoever believes in him would not perish but have everlasting life. And it's with thanksgiving in our hearts that we do pray, Amen. And that would you join me in pledging allegiance to the flag attention salute pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Chair recognizes chairman Hogan, the chair of the committee on information and audits. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your committee on information and audits has read the journal of the previous legislative day and found it to be correct. And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, a woman visiting her husband in prison before leaving she tells the correctional officer you shouldn't make my husband work like that. He's exhausted. The officer laughed and said, are you kidding? He just eats and sleeps and stays in his sale. The wife replied, he just told me he's been digging up tunnel for months.

If you have signed up for a morning order, please make your way to the front of the chamber, Chair is going to ask that you limit your comments to not more than one minute each, and the Chair recognizes for a morning order, Chairman Allen Powell. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Just a minute, Mr. Chairman. There are times when we have these that I must insist that there be order and respect. This is such a time. If you are in the chamber, please take your seat. If you have a conversation, it's a matter of life and death, life or death, taking outside. Gentlemen, may proceed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House and to those that are listening. You know, today is not near as bright a day as we have seen in past years. On September the 3rd of last year, Captain Stan Elrod of the Northeast Georgia, the DNR district, was tragically killed by an impaired driver. And I just want to say just a few words about Stan as we commemorate his passing. Stan was one of those guys that was bigger than life. This is the same guy that you've seen for years, who was always up here during the legislative session, he and some of the DNR Rangers that were up here with FOP and some of those. But he was one of the guys that was just absolutely the most likable person you've ever seen. He was all business when it came to DNR business. But this man had the biggest heart of anybody you've ever seen. Went to work for DNR in 93, spent 27 years, worked his way up through the ranks. And he's a guy that did not just service for the state of Georgia, but for his fellow man. Stan and some others formed an organization under DNR. And this was outdoor. This was the outdoor, let me see if I can find this, I'm sorry. They formed outdoor dream foundation. And this was an organization that the Rangers put together for sick and terminally ill children. For those children who had desires to do what normal, healthy kids could do, whether it was going on a fishing trip or shooting deer or whatever it might been. And they put this together and they raised money to help these terminally ill and severely ill children. Folks, it doesn't get any better than that. Stan leaves a wife, Julie, and two sons Luke and Leva in the prime of his life. But what a great guy this was. I would like to invite every member of this house to come down and design a resolution honoring and commemorating Stan's life. I want to thank you so much. Chair's going to ask that members allow the other morning orders to be completed before you come down. Or better yet, you don't take that back to your desk. The resolution will be at Chairman Powell's desk. Chair recognizes Representative Jasmine Clark for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. Today I rise for today's moment in black history. I believe black history month is not only about those who have made history, but those who are making history. And I believe that we should give people their flowers while they can still smell them. So today I would like to highlight Dr. Kismikia Corbett. Dr. Corbett is a black immunologist and also the scientific lead of the vaccine research in the international community in the United States. The U.S. National Institutes of Health or NIH. Her expertise in research and Corona virus biology and vaccine development for the past six years were instrumental for the crucial part of the vaccine and treatment for Corona virus, the causative agent of Covid-19. She and her colleagues have been essential to the development of the Moderna mRNA vaccine, as well as the E.I.

And we should have over 200 Scouts sitting in the galleries today. The typical day for them is to do a Scab and Jair Hunt, Capitol Tours, and a Q&A with legislatures. Well, unfortunately, they're doing the same thing. And we're going to have a lot of things to do with the COVID-19 vaccine. We're going to have a lot of things to do with the COVID-19 in the first and the Q&A with legislatures. Well, unfortunately, they're doing it virtual because of the COVID-19. We all know that the Scout Oath is one of the most powerful oath that has been written. When you start with on my honor, I will do my best to God and my country. And following with the Scout Law, which what these young men and now women have, they're all helpful, friendly, cordious, kind, obedient, cheerful, thirsty, clean, and reverent. We want also to honor in celebrating, Black History Month with Mr. Harry Cooper of Group 92 from Kansas City, Missouri, that is believed to be the first Black Eagle Scout in the history of the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the highest rank in Scouting in September, 1920, with that Mr. Speaker, I deal the will. Thank you. Thank you, Ice. Chair recognizes Representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Good morning, colleagues. Today I bring to you 10-year-old Jackson. Jackson is a delightful boy who likes to play outside, riding his bike, learning about sharks, watching shark week movies, the Meg, and drawing, coloring, reading, and sharing his arts of work with others. He also likes to read two people, the books that he's reading at the time. Ladies and gentlemen, Jackson is one of the many children available today in the state of Georgia for adoption. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield the will. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In celebration of Black History Month, we would like to honor a matriarch of our community, Ms. Ada Lee. She was born in Welston, a small railroad community, that became Warner Robbins, graduated from Booktables, and she was born in Welston, a small railroad community that became one of Robbins, graduated from Booktables, and she was born in Welston, a small railroad community that became one of Robbins, graduated from Booker T. Washington High School, and the Fort Valley State University Culinary Program. She served in numerous ways over the years, as credited with forming the first Girl Scout troop for Black Girls in Houston County, directed the first Head Start Program in Warner Robbins, one of the original founders of the Houston County Chapter, the NAACP, was on the Georgia Council on Human Relations, a devout member of Warner Robbins CME Church, and we could go on and on. She was also the recipient of many honors and awards, including the Jacqueline and Kennedy O'Nassus Award, the title Miss Senior Warner Robbins, named as one of the 50 most influential women in Middle Georgia to mention a few. Warner Robbins has also appropriately named a park in her honor. Her legacy continues through her family and the many lives she touched. I know her grandson's best Gary, a standout on the Gridiron for Georgia Tech, her professional career came back home and serves our city and Warner Robbins City Councilman, Deren Lee, who probably sums up her greatness best. She spoke up for those who were overlooked. She was also a leader when it came to being an example of unity and working for unity in all the communities, regardless of your ethnic background, social, or economic status. Please join us in honoring the life and legacy of Miss Ada Lee. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Wade for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in recognition of a moment in black history to recognize a Georgian, one that my dad introduced me to. And his name is Clarence Thomas. Many of you know him. He is the associate or the apologize. He is currently the senior associate justice. The longest serving member of the Supreme Court with a tenure of now 29 years and 124 days as of today. He grew up in pinpoint Georgia about 11 miles from Savannah in Chatham County. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals, which is his pathway that took him to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court experts described Thomas's jurisprudence textualist stressing the original meaning of the United States Constitution and Statutes. He is also along with the fellow Justice Neil Gorsuch, known as an advocate of natural law. Many writers view Thomas as the court's most conservative member. He is also known for having gone over a decade without asking a question during oral arguments. And I'm certain that the speaker and many chairman in this house wish some of us would follow that same skill set. But my favorite quote, and I will finish with this. And I'd like you to listen to Philly if possible, given the time that we're in this day. A good argument deluded to avoid criticism is not nearly as good as the undeluted argument, because we best arrive at truth through a process of honest and vigorous debate. Arguments should not sneak around and sneak around in disguise as if dissent or somehow automatically sinister, for it is bravery that is required to secure freedom. Thank you very much and I appreciate it. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Matthews and Chairman Knight for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Shaw University is where he graduated from, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religion and Philosophy, and moved on to interdenominational theological center at Morehouse School, where he graduated in 1975. He has such an extensive, extensive resume. He has preached all over the United States, including Zambia. Today, we want to honor you, Dr. Lacey, and thank you for all you've done for Griffin, Georgia. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We are now going on to the Rules Calendar. Going on to the Rules Calendar, the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 292. House Bill 292, by Representative Williams. Of the 148th and others to be titled, and act to amend chapter 5 of the 48th, fiscal to Georgia, and tentatively, and add in the law of taxation to property. So it's to remove certain training requirements, for members of county boards of equalization. Let's be 11 for the Committee on Ways and Means, that Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Representative Noel Williams to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I rise, I've aided a scutth for you, House Bill 292. Our Superior Court clerks have requested this bill to be presented, and it will help with the Board of Equalizations. As you know, these are ones that hear our property tax appeals in our said counties. What this bill would do, in 2015, there was language that was added requiring an additional 20 hours of education for these members. And already these members, once they are appointed on these boards, they have a 40-hour task, and then each year they have eight hours of continued education. This bill would simply strike that 20 hours away, because as you know, a lot of these boards are on different committees all over their communities, and we just think this is too much time for them. And this was asked for us, came out of ways and means, and the Superior Court clerks have all over the state have been requesting this information for this bill. Thank you. You do have a question if you yield. Yes, or I'll yield. Chair recognizes Representative Huggley to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So what would these board members be left with in terms of their training requirement, once we take this away? Well, thank you for asking that, Representative. Once they are appointed to this committee, then they have a 40-hour class that they must complete. After that 40-hour class, each year they have an additional eight hours. And what this bill was saying was, after the three years, if they go for their second appointment by the Grand Jury, then they would have an additional 20 hours. And that's why they're saying, you know, this is just too much for these members. And it's just a burden for them. No further questions? Thank you. Please vote favorably on House Bill 292. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which is favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 292. The eyes are 165. The nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 455. House Bill 455, I'm going to borrow the hundred and third and others to be entitled back to the men chapter 2. The total 20 that fiscal go to Georgia, and it's going to be relating the elementary and secondary education. So it's the revise of provision relating to student transportation. This bill then refer to the committee on education and committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes Chairman Timothy Bard to present the bill. Good morning, colleagues. I have a great bill here for your consideration this morning. House Bill 455. This bill is an opt-in for local boards of education to allow alternate transportation of school children. Currently, we are the only state in the nation that requires by law that our children will be transported by yellow school bus. The state board of education would provide safety standards, and then the locals would also be able to add any safety standards that they felt necessary. This bill is not remit to replace the yellow school bus by any means, but merely a tool in the toolbox of our local boards to be able to do what best fits their needs. Again, it's not a mandate, and I'll stand for any questions. You do have a question if you care to yield. Yes, sir. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark up in the gallery to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? Yes, ma'am. So does this bill allow for local school boards to allow transportation in sedans and SUVs and things like that? Yes, ma'am. This is a great question. What we have in this bill is there is a maximum number of children that can be transported in a vehicle, but is completely left up to the locals to determine their own standards after the state sets the minimum standards. Okay, thank you. No further questions. Thank you, sir. Are you all the well? Please vote in favor of this. Your local school boards are going to love this. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none.

Wait, before you get into the bill representative, I chair has a few questions. Yes, sir. I came into your courtroom many, many times over the years didn't I? You did, sir. Was I always respectful? You were. Did I pay you proper deference as a judge? Yes, sir. You did. You call me your honor numerous times. Well, guess what? You're not a judge anymore. That's right. And I'm in your court. Excellent point. Gentlemen, may proceed. Thank you. House bill 306 is amending the Georgia business corporation code currently in that code. It does not expressly permit virtual or remote communication meetings for shareholders for corporations share corporations are required to have shareholder meetings annually. And when the COVID hit, the governor's emergency order set out a procedure and this pretty well follows that. So it updates our code. It modernizes it and allows for a fully virtual shareholder meeting or a partial over what we call a hybrid where it's in person and remote. So you'll for any questions. Looks like you do have a question. Do you yield? When we started talking about judges and courts, he got nervous so chair recognizes representative Ridley to your right. Oh, Lord. Is gentleman yield. I you. I just got one question. Do you think your predecessor would vote yes or no on this bill? I think it would be red. I Blake's off to good bail. I think we need to tell the people of the eight house district. This is a first in many, many, many years that they've had a member presenting a bill. Is this house? Oh, well, you had no further questions. Thank you. I appreciate your favor with consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered on house bill 306? The chair here's none.

For those that I knew, this is an annual resolution from our state properties commission and then from the state properties committee. And the state properties committee looks at all the conveniences and our committee then contacts each representative that would be affected by this resolution. Mr. Speaker, this was the first time in a long, long time we have had only three conveniences come out of the House committee. And House members, we will send this over to the Senate for their consideration and additions. And if any House member failed to get in this House resolution at this time, they have a chance in the Senate maybe. At any time, your committee on state properties stands ready to assist you on these matters of conveniences. And I ask for your feeble support for House resolution 142 with the Yes vote. Mr. Speaker, if there are no questions, I yield the well. You have no questions. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none.

Chair recognizes the chair of the committee, chairman green to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I bring you the substitute House resolution 143. The same thing is in regard to our easements from the state properties, and you will see listed in your bill there, those particular easements that are under consideration.

The bill 179 represent a camp, 130 first, and others to be entitled an act to amend Code Section 42. 86, if you go to Georgia annotated relating special license plates promoting or supporting certain worthy agencies. Agency funds are nonprofit corporations. This bill I refer to the committee on motor vehicles that committee recommends a disbill due pass by committee substitute. The representative camp. Oh, you're representative camp. You must have just got here and you already got a bill. Wow. That's amazing and good. Chair recognizes representative Beth Camp to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is a substitute for House bill 179 and it's near and dear to my heart for a number of reasons. First off, it recognizes a new tag for breast cancer awareness. All of us have been touched. We all most of us have lost a loved one. Unfortunately, two breast cancer. So I think it's important for all of us to make sure that funding exists for that. Also, the support our troops tags. My father and father-in-law are both veterans. And lastly, most of us have attended colleges or universities. And the proceeds from those car tags actually go to foundations within those organizations to help fund further education for those current students. So at this time. Okay. Do you yield for questions? Yes, sir. I do yield for questions. Thank you. You must not have done a very good job of explaining it. Chair recognizes representative Gamble for a question. He's in 341. He'll be on the screen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman lady yield? Yes, I yield. Is this your first bill? Yes, it is. Well, excellent. And congratulations on such a great bill because I know that the support our troops license plate is a part of this. And is it not true that since 2013 support our troops has attributed to close to $4 million and contributions that have ended up in Georgia installations in our state? Yes, representative Gamble. That is correct. The information I've received. Deem's information you're giving could be correct. Well, I thank you for this bill and enjoyed your presentation. Thank you. You have other questions. You continue to yield. Yes, sir. I yield. Chair recognizes chairman Fleming to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To the lady in the well, I support your bill. I like it. But as I look through it, even if we pass this bill in the Senate does, there is no date of enactment in the bill. Oh, that's a wonderful catch. That's kind of important. Maybe you should ask somebody about that. Well, that would okay. Thank you, ma'am. Yes, sir. I certainly will. Thank you very much. You want to see if somebody else has a catch? Yes, I just had a stroke of inspiration. I do believe the signature of the governor would be the date of enactment. I think that's a great question. I guess. Chair recognizes chairman Martin to your left for a question. Would the lady you? Yes, sir. I just wonder your new to the body. Isn't that true? Yes, sir. That is true. I just wondered when they asked you to carry this bill. Were you a prize that it's normally house tradition for the author of the bill to match the donation for the first thousand tax purchase? Were you familiar with that tradition? No, sir. I am not familiar with that tradition, but we can certainly pass around a plate or a hat. Chairman Fleming and I. That obligation. If I may wave the rule, Chairman Fleming, I would be the first people to donate to you on that. Thank you for doing this. Thank you very much. Do you continue to yield? Yes, sir. I continue to yield. Let's see. Chair recognizes your colleague in the gallery. Chairman Bershitt. So you're right for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the general lady yield? I do yield. Thank you for bringing this bill. I think this is a very important bill. I wanted it to lady would consider grabbing us a water and a coke on your way back up to the gallery. Chairman Bershitt, if that is the conclusion of your question, then yes, I will agree to those terms. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wish to yield the well. Good job.

What purpose does representative Beesmore rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that my bill is a parliamentary inquiry? I'm sorry, parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that House Bill 50 that is the cancer, all cancer, Lices plate bill was my bill and I thank the kind lady for bringing it forward. That's the lady's host dates. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 179. The eyes are 165. The nasor zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. I'm sorry, we got one more bill. How did I forget that one? Yesterday, House Bill 286 was postponed to the next legislative day. It is called at this time the clerk will read the caption to House Bill 286. The clerk will read the caption to House Bill 286 by the motion of Gaines, the 117th and others to be tunneled and act to amend chapter 8 of tunnel 36. The official to George Antoned relating the county police. So it's to restrict the ability of the county governing authorities to reduce funding for county police departments. This bill I refer to the committee on government affairs that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Gaines to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This this this more and I bring House Bill 286 before the body. We've seen in our state and in parts of our nation calls to defund the police and slash police budgets. And I believe and I hope this body will agree that doing so would put our most vulnerable at risk. Our state believes in and is champion criminal justice reform. But defunding the police is a dangerous idea that will harm those who most need protection and put victims at risk. Last year, Minneapolis slash funding for its police department. We've already seen them backtracking in recent days. And we won't make up for the crimes committed the lives lost and the damage done to that community and Athens and Atlanta. We've seen efforts to defund the police our bill will ensure that that never happens in our state and will protect Georgia families. This legislation sends a strong strong message that we support our law enforcement officers and that we will never defund the police here in Georgia. I'll briefly walk through the specifics of the bill. Essentially it prohibits cities and counties from cutting more than 5% of their police budgets. We've worked into the bill reasonable needs for reducing police spending like a loss of revenue greater than 5%. The need for one time large capital projects and other necessary exceptions. We work with city and county leaders across the state and law enforcement officers. And I've been really pleased by the support of local leaders in Georgia who back this bill. That's because we believe our law enforcement needs more funding to increase the pay of our police, to increase training for those who on the front lines. When a victim calls 911, we need quick response times. Defunding the police is a radical idea that will slow response times for victims and put our families and communities at risk. I'm proud this bill has the support of the police benevolent association. And I'm also proud that in my conversation with folks across this state, this isn't a partisan issue. I've received calls from Republicans, Democrats, people across the political spectrum and support of this measure. And local leaders in support of this measure again across the political spectrum and support of this bill. We cannot afford to defund the police. And I believe this bill today will send a very strong message that we won't allow that to happen here in Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer a few questions if there are any. You have some questions? Do you yield? I do. Chair recognizes Chairman Collins to your left for a question. Mr. General, do you? I do. Is it not true that one of the main goals of local government, as far as public safety goes, is to protect our local residents, those local people in those governments? Is that correct? Absolutely. I believe it's the most essential function of local government. And is it further or not true? We've heard a lot of discussion in the committee that this bill, no way, restricts local governments from allocating money for mental health issues and making sure that they're taking care of the mentally deprived in their communities. That correct? Absolutely. I think both you and I would agree we should increase funding for mental health initiatives across our state. And the General Assembly has done that in recent years. Okay. I think this is a great bill. We appreciate you bringing it to us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you further yield? I will for a couple more. Chair recognizes Chairman Hogan up in the gallery for a question. Is it General Maniel? I will. Did not the Brunswick News run an editorial in support of your bill? I believe they did. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you further yield? I'll yield for two more. Chair recognizes representative Dempsey or Chairman Dempsey to your right for a question. Does the General Maniel? As a former Rome City Commissioner, challenged with making sure that city was strong and safe, is it not true as is already been stated that that safety is one of the most important concerns of our police forces? Absolutely. And I think again, that's the most important function of our local government to keep our community safe. And I think this measure will be a significant step towards achieving that. Does the General Maniel further yield? I will. Not only ensuring safety, but one of the greatest challenges that our local police forces face is recruiting and retention of officers, and that stability and pay will help them. Absolutely. Like you say, I think when you need to increase the pay of our law enforcement officers, increase funding for training and, you know, taking money away from law enforcement is not the answer. Thank you for this measure. Thank you. Do you further yield for a couple of questions? I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes Chairman Hitchens. Do you write for a question? I do. It's not true that I have pretty extensive knowledge in the law enforcement matters, pay, recruitment, professionalism, and that the state of Georgia through the years has been significant for amount of money on our state law enforcement agencies to promote professionalism, education, and just good stewardship of the law enforcement profession throughout the state. Absolutely. And thanks for your service. Well, will you further yield? I will. It is true that I also know that in law enforcement, about 85 to 90 percent of all budgets are in personal services or salaries, and about 5 to 10 percent more are in vehicles. So if that's the case, you take 5 percent away. You've already spent 90 to 95 percent. You don't have any money left for anything else. Somebody's got to go. That's right. Will you further yield? I will. And taking those first two questions under consideration, would you say that it's fairly likely that if you take 5 percent away from any law enforcement agency that you're going to have a reduction in force, you're going to have them arouse problems, and you're going to do a wave of some professionalism and effectiveness. Absolutely. There's a great bill, and I certainly am going to support it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes the minority leader of the House leader barely for our question. Do your left. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman yield. I will. Isn't it true that the Constitution of the State of Georgia trumps bills that we would pass into general assembly? I believe that to be true. Thank you. You'll start the question. And I will mention there was question in the committee about the home rule issue, and I may be to what you're referring, but home rule only restricts general assembly's ability to pass local bills. This legislation applies statewide, and so I believe this is a good measure that's going to help keep our community safe. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, we have a number of members that want to have signed up to speak on the measure. The debate will be limited to 30 minutes per each side to be allocated between the speakers as they choose, as they see fit. Then we have a minority report and the chairman's time. Chair recognizes representative Wynn to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. His name was Anthony Hill. He was a 26-year-old veteran who served in Afghanistan. He was black, naked, unarmed, and suffering from mental health when he was shot and killed by law enforcement. His apartment manager, who called the police, was concerned for his safety, and the responding officer, who shot and killed him, was actually convicted and sentenced to 12 years. I cannot speak to the intent of the officer, but I can speak about the fact that law enforcement's job is not to handle mental health, and they are simply not equipped to do it. And as with this case, it is not a single isolated case. Between 5 and 15% of calls placed to law enforcement are families who are calling for mental health support for their loved ones. And in these cases, law enforcement officers are often not able to respond adequately. People with untreated mental health issues are 16 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement. 16 times. This along with the killings of Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and other incidences a police brutality has prompted a national dialogue on the role of law enforcement in our communities. I think every member in this body would agree that all Jordans want to live in safe communities. But we also recognize the presence of law enforcement doesn't make all communities safer. It is a truth that we do not like to admit. But we have the statistics and the stories to show it. If you are black or brown, whether armed or unarmed, you are more likely to be killed by...

enforcement than your white counterpart. The calls for reimagining public safety are exactly about this. How do we build communities where all members are protected by law enforcement? And what should the role of law enforcement be in our community? The efforts to transfer funding from police departments is about addressing the root causes that we so desperately need to address. It is mental health issues, homelessness, addiction, domestic violence, poverty, and systemic racism. And at the heart of this, diverting funds to social workers, healthcare, housing, education, or creating new programming is aimed at reducing incarceration. Don't we, as a body, want to reduce incarceration? That's why we created accountability courts and pre-arrests diversion programs. Because we know incarceration doesn't lead to safer communities, but it leads to a cycle that is both financially costly and harmful to our state and to our communities. Our state of Georgia spends $20,000 a year to incarcerate one individual, including those who are convicted for non-violent crimes. And just as we are beginning to address the systemic flaws in policing, this bill would shut down the necessary discourse that elected officials are having with members of their communities. We did see proposals to transfer funding from police departments to other areas of needs, and they did not pass either in Athens, Clark County, or City of Atlanta. But fundamental in this is the public process by which local elected officials, whom are duly elected by their constituents, have the duty and responsibility to engage with their communities to decide what is best for their cities and for their counties. This is gross overreach by our state, to usurp the wills of counties and municipalities and the constituents who elected their local elected officials. We do need the flexibility to have these conversations, and yes, we do need local control. That is what we use to decide what is best for our communities. And sometimes we may not like the outcome of that, but that is also why we have local elections. It's called a democracy. So as we collectively grapple with the role of law enforcement in our communities, my own city, the City of Atlanta, is proposing a department of public safety and wellness. It would create a division focus on non-emergency responses, including mental health crises, and it would establish a non-emergency response number for residents. This department would also reduce the workload for City of Atlanta Police Department, and allow professionals who are actually equipped with the right training to respond to things like mental health and addiction. And this is exactly what we mean by reimagining the police. It means creating communities that are safe for everybody and not just for some of us. It means addressing root causes to reduce crime and to become less reliant on law enforcement. It means if you are black or brown, if you are poor or facing homelessness, if you are suffering from mental health addiction or mental health issues, you are not going to be killed by law enforcement or get shuffled into an incarceration system that does not re-habitate or offer restorative justice. That's why I am voting against House Bill 286 today and ask members to do the same. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Representative Holkham to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let me begin by saying that the context in which this bill has been presented has to do with the very important national discussion that we have had over issues of race and justice in the police. I've done a lot of reflecting over that over the last year, and I think what's really important is that we listen to the voices who have cried out about the injustices and that we work to address that. I think that that's really important. But my problem with this bill is to be really candid. It's really horribly written. It's bad policy and there's so much that is just awful about it. So let me just walk you through it. If you have the bill, there's two sections. And one of them has to do, Section 1 has to do with counties. And there, police departments, Section 2 has to do with municipalities. The language basically maps each other. So where does it fail? It fails right off the bat if you go to line 17. It talks about actual or anticipated revenues. But it does not define revenues. At the local government, you have general fund revenues, which can be property taxes, sales taxes, your basic annual appropriations and revenues. It doesn't take into account one time appropriations. You can have intergovernmental transfers. You can have splosemunnies. You can have special purpose money. So it does a very poor job of defining revenues. And why is that important? Because the revenues are going to set the baseline by which we're going to hold government accountable, going forward. That's a huge mistake and a huge error. I did some surveys over the last few nights in terms of our local governments and what they're spending. And what's interesting is there is no massive decline in funding for public safety or police that's happening. So that, of course, raises the question, why do we need this? In fact, I even looked at Athens, O'Coney County, no decline. It's not happening. So if it's not happening, why do we need this policy? But my concern comes from thinking through, as we are charged to do, the second and third-order effects of if we have economic challenges and you have declines and revenues, we are going to force our local governments to make decisions that may be very damaging and detrimental across the board. So let's continue to work through. Besides this initial revenue issue, another big problem that it has is that it would allow our local governments to reduce, police spending up to 4.99% per year. But then if you go down, there is a look back period that holds the maximum amount that can be declined is 5% over a 10-year period. This does not require complicated math skills to know that if you decline by 4.99%, 3%, 2.5% every year for 10 years, you will be out of compliance with having reduced the budget by 5% over 10 years. So there is a massive internal inconsistency here and we're setting our local governments up for potential failure with that and that is a big concern and a big problem. So with that, the bill I think notes that there may be challenges with home rule and litigation. Among other things, local governments may be exploring how to be innovative to reduce incidents of crime to reduce the need for public expenditures across the board. And if they make such judgments, they can be subject to litigation. This is noted in section 1 in lines 45 through 48. And there's a couple of things about that that I think are worth mentioning. If there's litigation, then that's going to be fewer dollars to pay for police services among other things. So you're going to have fewer resources. And there is an issue with litigation earlier in the bill that I want to highlight and that's in lines 23 to 28 because this even notes that you can have one time legal obligation, which I would read that as a settlement, but it doesn't talk about legal fees. There aren't too many cases that I know of that are wrapped up very quickly. So you can have an elevation in revenues over time and that's not reflected here. Again, it is a failure of how you account for revenues in this bill and there are consequences to that. Another issue with the litigation is it doesn't say what is the enforcement mechanism. So if a local community fails to do this either on an annual basis or over 10 years, what is the enforcement mechanism? What is the outcome? What is ultimately going to happen? There's nothing. It's just window dressing. So there's a lot here that really needs to be fixed and that needs to be improved. And in terms of just efficiency of government, which we should all care about, I think that this prevents innovation and cost saving measures and 5% is not a huge delta. That is something that happens with regularity at the local level. You can have swings in that range and we're capping it at that. So interestingly, this could also have the unintended consequence of if a local government has unforeseen increases in revenues, they could be hesitant to spend more dollars on police because that will set a new baseline going forward by which all of their subsequent appropriations will be judged and kind of modified. So practically speaking, I'll also tell you, having done a little bit of a survey of county and municipal governments, they're all over the map in terms of what they put out there. Some are pretty good and have historical documents over 10 years. Some have a single year that they put forward in terms of the monies that are being spent. I would certainly support efforts at more transparency of showing how much are you spending on these issues, how much are you decreasing them over time to inform the electorate of are we moving up or down. I think that those could be some proposals that we could we could have a conversation about. But overall, as you can tell, my concerns with this are that the unintended consequences are legitimate and significant and it doesn't take a lot of brainstorming to envision how this can take place. It really removes the ability of local decision makers to have flexibility for all kinds of situations that they're likely going to see, retirements, etc. And for some parts of our state, who here thinks that they're going to have the exact same needs in terms of service requirements 10 years from now, we have parts of the state that have declining populations and what we're saying is you still have to budget at 5% of where you were 10 years ago. That's insane. It's ridiculous. So finally, I'll close with this because I know that there are other people that want to speak on it. You may recall that not too long ago, August of 2019, in fact, Governor Kent put forward a statement that said that we were going to cut the budget by 4% mid-year. That gets into also this issue of anticipated actual revenues. That's not clearly defined. It's anticipated only at the beginning or can you anticipate changes along the way. It's unclear. But then what did he say for fiscal year 2021, which is what we're in now? We were going to cut at what level? 6%. This says the max that you can do is 5%. So as the state we're setting a level that we don't even uphold on our own, which I think is just absurd. So I'm happy to answer questions, but I know that there are others that want to speak. So I'll yield the well and if you want to talk, can see me. Thanks. Chair recognizes representative Kenner to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I rise in opposition to HB 286. The largest mental health service provider in our state is Georgia State prisons, the largest by far. This is what happens when mental illness and access to treatment is not prioritized. Georgia remains at the bottom in the US in terms of mental health access. And when we fail to address this issue on the front end with adequate mental health access, we are forced to deal with it on the back end with law enforcement and corrections. And in fact, Georgia criminalizes mental illness. The transitional program of which I am a founder and CEO, we work daily in the middle of this space. We serve the homeless and a typical client for us has a mental health diagnosis, a second diagnosis of addiction and a felony background. These three things are many times connected. According to NAMI, the National Alliance of Mental Illness, most folks who abuse the substances of drugs and alcohol have an underlying mental health condition that is not being treated. So mental illness, addiction, homelessness, incarceration are too often directly related. Here's the way it happens every day in Georgia. One of our citizens experiences a mental health crisis, a 911 call is made, and the police respond. And God bless our police departments. I have many friends and families who are in law enforcement, but they are not mental health professionals. These situations are beyond the ambient of their expertise. It is unfair to everyone engaged. And when the situation escalates as it often does, an arrest happens or sometimes much worse, too many times lethal force. Another dynamic that compounds this problem in our state is that we have so few crisis stabilization unit beds. Jails are used as default facilities. The local community service board in Gwinnett County where I serve is viewpoint health, and they are wonderful. They do wonderful and great work, but their safety net is not large enough. Viewpoint Health serves Gwinnett County, Rockdale, Newton, and portions of the cab, so pushing 1.5 million people. How many crisis beds do we have? 23. A Paltry 23, which does it come close to addressing the needs? And historically, when these CSU beds filled up, filled up the folks who are in custody of the police as a result of the 911 call who are not criminals, they're really sick. They end up being locked up. The person in crisis effectively gets caged and often put into isolation, which is the last thing a person in crisis needs. It only exacerbates the crisis. My county and the cities I serve are grappling with this issue of mental illness looking for better and appropriate options to prevent unnecessary incarceration. The program where I serve, we have 70 bed spaces and we stay maxed out with a waiting list. Many of our clients and much of the waiting list is comprised of referrals from our accountability court systems. I'm a huge fan of the accountability court system. They're very effective, but I need to point out that there's still a reactive measure and not a proactive one. We work with mental health court, drug court, veterans court, DUI court, and for most of these clients, mental health is in the mix. But it's only after this person has been arrested and incarcerated while behind bars that there's a psychiatric evaluation conducted and treatment started. And then we determine this person doesn't need jail. They would be better served by therapy and programming. If programs like ours had more funding, we could expand our capacity. Currently, we turn more people away than we accept. HB 286 with handcuff pun intended us to the law enforcement option. Local governments need the flexibility to allocate our tax dollars to address the issues with our own customized local strategies. When a crime is being committed, we should send our men and women in blue. When it's mental health, we should send the appropriate and qualified professionals. Please vote no to HB 286. Mr. Speaker, in efforts to time, I yield the well. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, Chair recognizes representative Sains to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Why, seat, seat, may of mine, said, be brief. If you go to the well, you're more apt to be listened to. So I will try to do so because there is nothing in this bill that is complex. There is nothing more personal to a Georgia citizen when they need to call 911. When there is a mother in a domestic violence situation, fearing for her life, or the countless other calls for service, our local law enforcement respond to. I have seen firsthand, as a deputy sheriff, the crucialness of a quick and speedy response. The opposition to this bill will try to rationalize the idea that it is not a permanent subject for this body. That there is better use of our time and energy. And on this note, I agree. Restricting defunding police is not a visionary policy. This bill does not dictate how Georgia communities can structure their departments, or what equipment they feel necessary for their officers to have, what mental health services that they should provide, what ways they can serve their citizens. What this bill does is set a minimum standard of what Georgia citizens know, what the standard of the Georgia citizens know, they are entitled to, and the safety that they should expect. This bill is an unfortunate necessity made relevant to us by the willingness of some of our local governments to show their willingness to abdicate their obligations to our citizens, to preserve public order and to protect life and property as of core expectation. My dear colleagues, we ask our local officers to face innumerable unknowns. The funding for their positions should not be one of them, and those they are served deserve better. A member of this body said it best in committee when a Georgia citizen dials for help, they deserve an answer. Let's be clear, this bill is part of answering that. Thank you. I yield the well. Chair recognizes Chairman Allen Powell to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I don't like to come down here and speak on some of these bills from time to time, unless I really think I've got something I want to point out, but the base obligations of government, and that's the duties of government, first and foremost, is public protection to ensure civil society and a safe society. You know, in this world we live in, not everybody I just subscribe to their second amendment rights the way some do. It's the most vulnerable people that need to have public safety in a good, strong public safety system. You know, I listened to this, and I thought to myself when this bill was put in, I said, what's the necessity to this bill? Is it that bad? But it's not necessary to that bad, but it is as much as an answer to the politicalization of an issue that has been made in the last year. De-fund police, defund law enforcement. You know, you can defund a lot of parts of government and a lot of funding in government, but there's one place that you don't need to defund, and that's the public safety arena. The arena that protects people's lives, because that's what really matters. I've listened to some of the speakers intently. They were up here a while ago, and you know, I listened about mental health. I listened about minorities who were killed under justifiable. I don't know if they are or they're not, and I'm sure that there's some law enforcement officers that have probably done some things that were over reaching and things like that, but I always remind people until you walked in their shoes. And when you see someone who, if you see a suspect who has a weapon and you're an officer, you don't know what the suspect's going to do with that weapon. You don't. If that officer is called a duty and a suspect after interrogation takes a weapon from that officer's belt and tries to fire at him whether it's a taser or a weapon, then that's a dangerous situation. And these are things that we need to be on guard. We don't need to be prejudicial until something's been proven about these officers, because these are some folks that are doing a, they're doing a job that nobody else wants to do, like Franklin. But bottom line is they have a base, they have a basic duty, and that's to enforce the law and to protect the citizens, to protect and serve that we continue to hear. But then I heard these, the discussion, not just about, you know, the treatment of minorities, but I heard about the mental health issue. And I'm sitting and I'm thinking to myself and I've heard these discussions about that. But yeah, you need more folks dealing with mental health. I can assure you and I'm telling the members here something that they're not, probably will disagree with, will not disagree with me. But we're going through one of the toughest time on mental health and I call it the co-biode anger stage that you can't please anybody. People's anxieties are up, but that's it in anything new ladies and gentlemen. Law enforcement will tell you that the most dangerous call that they get is on a domestic violence call or a domestic call of any sort. Do they need more, do we need more, do we need to do away with police officers and hire more social, sociologists? Yeah, I'd probably do. But I'll tell you that those police officers for the biggest role in the new training and the extensive training they're good, they are. They've been trained in mediation, mediation results and how to deal with different folks. But at the end of the day, say what they want to, there will always be need for more and not less money that goes to public safety. I remember a few years ago when I sat in the satin chair that chairman Collins had said over at public safety and I was absolutely a guest. When a memo came by me that was put out by Atlanta PD to the memo to the merchants in the bucket area and the such, that if you have shoplifting appearing in your store, then don't call us call private security. And I thought to myself, what kind of message, what kind of message does that send? And then we continue to say of more and more of a deterioration and more and more outwardly criminal activity. Even if you would call street racing or or doing donuts and all of that, you know, we've gone for several years trying to figure out and being held hostage or been asked by the cities help us help us. Passful laws dealing with street racing or cutting drags and all that. And I think to myself, well why don't you just get your law enforcement to do what they always do? They need to block off the streets, they need to catch them, they need to find them, they need to confiscate the vehicles. But there's always another reason of why they can't. Well yes they can enforce the law. But that's not what this is about, this is about defunding. This is a politicalized issue and it's politicalized to play to the base of one of the political parties. But at the end of the day, public safety is out there for both political parties and it should serve both equally. So ladies and gentlemen, I would certainly encourage you to vote yes on this legislation. Do I think it really makes a lot of difference? I don't think you'll ever hear a whole lot about it because you have to be yourself and do you ever see the public safety arena to be cut except in some of the most extreme cases of some of the folks who are continuing to politicalize. But I would encourage you to vote yes on this piece of legislation. Chair recognizes Chairman Knight to speak to the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I don't want to get up and support this bill. But I want to echo what Chairman Powell said. This bill is about politics. And some of the comments that have been made on this floor today in regards to why you shouldn't vote for this bill, I just can't sit here and not respond. Chairman Powell, you're exactly right. One of the primary responsibility of government, especially our local governments is what is public safety. As referred to the comments about the definitions of revenues and this bill lacks that and it just doesn't cut the right language in here. I think that's incorrect. A little history, a little perspective about what local governments do in their funding. We have what's called a general fund and one gentleman mentioned that. That general fund is where tax revenues or taxes are levied by our local government officials and they're appropriated for the purpose of the public and one of those public issues is public safety and public safety should be available to anyone whether there's a fire at your house or your neighbor's house. You are the recipient of that public safety if you need it or if you don't need it and the same thing goes for law enforcement.

for our police departments. God help you and I hope that none of us ever have to experience something in call and have the police call it at our house because there's somebody breaking in or there's a crime being committed. But quite frankly if you do that's a responsibility of local government to do it and then to say that the revenues are out there and the funds and all these different funds while the different funds are restricted and if you're talking about the enterprise funds those are a fee for service fund okay and there to be used for those purposes and when it comes to inter fund transfers that's not revenue that's a balance sheet item one fund owes another fund it's not revenue that's a false statement and as far as the transparency issue of the budgets every local city and county government has meetings commission and committee meetings and everybody in the public is welcome to show up and there's a budgetary process and you are welcome as the public to go up there and if you've got a question about what is being spent in a budget you get to go up there and do it on top of that guess what every local government the state of Georgia is required to fall fall and audit or guess what you may not be subject if you do and you violate that you may not get funded or available to receive state or federal funds so it's just complete nonsense some of the excuses that we've heard I used to do auditing have done it long time city audit municipal audit and I happened at that time at nine I would go out and ride with the police of that that little city and I watched them and I actually was there and I don't how much drugs they took off of the highways and the streets and for people to get up here and say that this is a mental illness issue while at the same time mentioning that it's it's it's about drugs there there's an addiction issue that's causing people to get here well go ahead and and make sure that we're already stretched thin of the world drugs and our police are the primary force fighting the world drugs to keep the drugs out of the hands of the people you pretend to protect let's just let more drugs on the street hypocritical drugs kill people it destroys lives but yet this political point about the police being the enemy when they're in fact the ones are out there defending and on the front line with the world drugs trying to keep drugs out of our state out of our schools out of our cities our communities off our streets and I'm gonna make one last comment we look around in its politics today and we talk about drugs and addictions how many of you would vote to legalize drugs how many of you from your districts in these cities and these counties that want to go and go down this route of defunding the police have refused to prosecute drug crimes but down on the other hand you're sitting here propping yourself up politically on the fact that you're trying to get people off of drugs and that's the reason for all of the middle of illness and all of the issues that face us it's gut check time quit the politics get back down to where we're helping people and we're going to the root cause no matter what color you are there's people who die on the streets every day and dive over doses and it doesn't make a difference if they're black white brown yellow it really does it and to come up here and do this it's intellectually dishonest and it does a disservice to the people of the state to the people we quarterly serving our districts and most of all our friends and our families Mr. Speaker I support this bill and I hope that everyone will too is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here's none the previous question is ordered we're now going on to the minority report and the chairs time 20 minutes each total for each of the presentations 20 minutes for the minority report in 20 minutes for the chairs time to be allocated as the speaker see fit chair recognizes for the minority report representative Shannon thank you mr. Speaker this bill does absolutely nothing to increase or protect public safety all it does is dictate to local governments what they have to spend on law enforcement regardless of what they can afford regardless of how the priorities change within that community and it's really interesting because we have spent so much time micromanaging local governments this session we spend more time on that than we do on state business last week we were told local governments can't decide what kind of fences they want in their neighborhood this week we're told they can't decide how to work out their budget and what the priorities should be in their budget in committee it was said that this bill was to defeat calls to defund the police which is really just black and brown communities saying that over policing leads to more police killings and police brutality in our communities and there are better ways for the money to be spent and let us figure that out in our communities Republicans know that these issues are connected and that's the reason why you didn't want to talk about this bill yesterday because it was the one year anniversary of a mod obrary being killed so you know that this stuff is connected well let's talk about the real animus for these bills because George is not the only only state that seeing one of these bills these bills are being filed across the country by Republicans and I think that this is a weird PR campaign by Republicans to absolve themselves of the fact that domestic terrorists from their party went up to the Capitol on January 6 and killed and maimed police officers defund the police has never killed any police officers defund the police has never maimed any police officers so Republicans you can continue to run these weird PR campaigns if you want to Democrats will continue to press for justice and to make sure that we don't see any more of the following Eric Gardner's Michael Brown Laquan McDonnell to Mayor Rice Walter Scott Samuel DeBose Freddie Gray Alton Sterling Falando Castile a mod obrary Brianna Taylor George Floyd Rishar Brooks Jamarian Robinson Shaleigh Tilson Tanisha Anderson Alexia Christian Maya Hall Nick Thomas and many more I'll yield the next couple of minutes to representative Inelowicz They're recognized as representative of Noelowicz for a portion of the minority report. Thank you Mr. Speaker y'all know that I have always believed that municipal and county governments exemplify the very best of what a representative democracy like ours has to offer a community within a city or a county neighborhoods that make up the essence of what we think of when we think of communities of interest they elect the person who they feel will best represent their voice on their city council their city commission or their county commission it is a critically important that we do not forget that these local elected officials represent their communities in a way that candidly we don't and that the constituencies they represent are often just one segment of our house districts that often span multiple counties and cities I realize this when I made the transition from the Smurnest City Council to this chamber all of a sudden I could shop at the supermarket up the road from my house without being stopped every three minutes to talk about a zoning issue or hear about someone's neighbors noisey dog our local governments ensure that the most fundamental needs of our communities are met it's local governments who we ultimately look to to make sure that when we turn on the tap the water that comes out is safe and that when we flush the toilet that waste water goes where it is supposed to go local governments ensure that the roads are paved they ensure that we have parks that we have recreation and they ensure that when we are in peril when we pick up our phones and we dial 911 someone comes to help us when we are here in Atlanta and make no mistake the work we do here in this chamber is critically important to our communities our local government representatives are on the ground back at home they are making the decisions to ensure that our hometowns are running in a way that serve the best interest of the people who elected them and they not us they are the best fiduciary stewards for their communities whether it's their budgets for public works sanitation parks and recreation or public safety and here's the thing these local officials even the ones whose views might not align with your politics they all want to live in safe communities they all want to live in safe communities we all want to live in safe communities and they are the people who best know how to keep these communities safe it is them not us who should be the ones who have the final purview over their municipal and county police department budgets we also know that there are many reasons that governments make changes in how they plan their budgets as representative hulken we were reminded a moment ago in the summer of 2019 the governor decided to cut 10% of the state's budget a decision that was not predicated in any way on any revenue shortfalls that were anywhere close to 10% this bill prohibits cities and counties from reducing their budget beyond 5% of the past fiscal years appropriations 5% is an arbitrary figure that is not based on any analysis of local government budgets and it artificially and unnecessarily ties the hands of the locally elected officials to make any necessary budget decisions that reflect the priorities of the communities they represent ensuring the public safety is absolutely a responsibility of local elected officials ensuring the public safety is absolutely a core responsibility of local elected officials and I know first hand that police budgets are reflective of input from the local governments elected officials their law enforcement department and the city or county taxpayers and these decisions don't happen in a vacuum or behind closed doors this is not a case of rogue local elected officials who were imposing their will upon the citizenry furthermore budget hearings are required to be public meetings these conversations are not happening behind closed doors and if city officials or county officials propose a police department budget reduction that does not reflect the goals of their residents believe me they are the first people to hear about it this bill is an unnecessary attempt to usurp local control it is a reactionary bill that was put forward in response to isolated examples of cities failed attempts to cut public safety funding attempts that did not work for the precise reason that those local governments did work the group of elected officials representing these various neighborhoods and communities that compose these cities voted to represent the wishes of those citizens the legislation we discuss here in this chamber represents policy that will impact every city and county government in our state if we pass this bill our politics will transcend policy and the consequence of that action would be that our local governments would be absolutely unable to truly represent their constituents priorities I urge you to vote against this utterly unnecessary bill and I yield the balance of my time to the leader chair recognizes the minority leader of the House leader Beverly for the balance of the minority report thank you speaker just for the sake of clarity I have two minutes or eleven minutes eleven thank you very much mr. Speaker ten years ago I was fortunate enough to be elected to the general assembly and I sat right over there in that corner in front of Susan Holmes next to Sam Watson and Jason Shaw in Amy Carter Stacy Abrams was the leader John Burns had Brown hair and I might add that Speaker Ralston had Brown hair as well my hair was black somewhat curly and the day it is obviously gray and I do my own stunts because I cut my own hair now due to covid Barack Hussein Obama was the president of the United States of America Donald J Trump was a game show host every Republican that I sat beside every day that I was over there said to me local control local control home room home room home room as a matter of fact I really believe when we picked up these bills and you look at the top number it says LC number I thought that stood for local control and when you did House resolutions the HR number I thought that actually meant home room because it was ingrained in my psyche in a corner where window will it said if you have to stand in that well for more than 90 seconds you've already failed and Randy Nick's will pull out his stopwatch and we'd all count and watch him come down and he come back said was 86 seconds boys how did I do but that was ten years ago a lot of things have changed in ten years today I find myself in the general assembly with the Democrats are talking about local control in home rule where a year ago a gentleman by the name of a mod Aubrey was murdered one of the coast 90 days later a man named George Floyd was a minionapolis he was on a ground police department maybe was a row cop no no knelt on his knee on his on his neck for eight minutes 46 seconds until he died eight minutes 46 seconds about the time I'm going to be in this well and he died and the issue was not around whether we should defund the police it was around not having accountability for a police department that went rogue it's never about us not wanting to have one to have public safety of course we want safety in our neighborhoods but when we find that we have no redress whatsoever what should we do so we continue to go down the road of the people who put their knees on our neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds and allow us to die will do we go to a higher authority within the governing body that guides our principles and not higher authority sometimes is a sheriff department why because we can elect a sheriff we can say if you're gone rogue we're not going to have a police department that you that you appoint but we'll vote for the people who police our department through a sheriff's department and it was evident in Glen County last year in August September last year Glen County wrestled with that idea because of a mild arbor I was all so admonished in that corner which is where I learned a lot is it don't go chase and waterfalls don't seek the headlines if you're seeking them you've already lost if you're doing what's right and sometimes if you're doing what's wrong the headlines will find you but don't chase the headlines more importantly if you're going to make legislation make sure that you do legislation that will stand a test of time hopefully you'll end up in the constitution of the state of Georgia which is where I want to bring my remarks to the constitution of the state of Georgia and I'll read this for you article nine section two paragraph one F says this the government authority of each county is authorized to fix the salary compensation and expenses of those employed by such governing authority and to establish maintain retirement or pension systems etc. It's very specific this is the constitution article nine section two paragraph one F constitution gives the local authority the ability to fix salaries well we're trying to do in this moment and say the general assembly has more power than a constitution of the state of Georgia now we know that there's one idea around these headlines that we grab I say black lives matter then you say all lives matter I say defund the police you say back the blue it's the nature of the politics that we live in but while the public is bouncing from one foot to the next we have reclaimed an awesome responsibility of being able to speak truth to public for what we legislate and if we allow the headlines to drive anything that we do in this body and we've all we we already lost our way now mr. Speaker I know back in those days 10 years ago Democrats used to get one of two bills out now just I would like for you to reconsider but today we don't which is fine but the reality of this bill right now is a headline chasing bill it doesn't honor the constitution that we stand on 86 pages reading and so this bill if it's passed seeks to trump the constitution so if you're going to grab a headline try that one on the sides Republican bill trumps Georgia Constitution to speak our yield well gentlemen as yielded the will we're going on out of the chairman's time chair recognizes the chairman of the committee chairman darling taylor for the chairman's time thank you mr. Speaker today I share with you that the House fully vetted House bill 286 it was vetted by both the governmental affairs full committee and our general government subcommittee they reviewed that and they identified a number of things in the bill for one thing there's a distinct difference between a sheriff's department which is a constitutional officer and police departments this bill offers consistency and law enforcement funding for Georgia citizens in that it continues reasonable funding for police departments within our state the bill includes exceptions for revenue decreases at the local government while still allowing for police protection for the citizens this bill is a citizen protection bill the measure was passed by a bipartisan support within this committee mr. Speaker I yield back my time to the majority whip chair recognizes uh majority caucus we have representative kelly for a portion of the chair's time thank you mr. Speaker I haven't been here 10 years like my friend the majority leader or my friend the minority leader maybe that's why my hair is not quite as white as theirs but I have been here nine years and I wish we could get back to a time like I was here nine years ago a time when supporting our law enforcement community and supporting those who keep us safe wasn't such a political impasse an issue it really shouldn't be I'm thankful for the law enforcement officers who stand outside these doors and keep us safe I'm thankful for the ones in Washington who are there to protect our members or serving in Washington I'm thankful for the ones who are in our local counties who are protecting our constituents while we're here doing the people's work I'm thankful for the ones in our cities those right outside the steps of this capital here in our states capital city I'm appreciative of them this issue is too important much too important to be emotional much too important to be hysterical and much too important to be dishonest so I want to clear up some inaccuracies about what we're doing today when a city or a county has a revenue shortfall whether that's because their population is declining or because we feel a tough economic time this bill has a provision that will allow them to respond this bill does not violate the home rule provisions of our constitution we've gotten that clear from legislative counsel we talked a lot about what we had to do as a state when we were going through a tough economic time we would be treated the same way that any local government would you have to prioritize there's nothing here that keeps the local government from being able to cut their entire budget but only simply the part that deals with law enforcement and only if the revenue drops have not happened if revenues increasing or revenues the same that's when we say don't call cut law enforcement don't expose your communities to being unsafe we did cut our state budget 10% but what we didn't do is we didn't cut state law enforcement because we did what we ask our constituents all across the state to do put your priorities down on paper just like they have to do in their budgets at home we took a vote as a body where we continue to find law enforcement now we also took another vote during this time it was another bill that my friend from Athens-Claric County carried it was a bill that said while we're cutting our state budget we're also going to take a pay cut I find it ironic that the minority party didn't want to cut our pay but here they are today hoping that the local governments will cut our law enforcement's pay we're going to see where people's priorities are Mr. Speaker I'm proud for the measure that my friends brought it here and I look forward to having the support of a bipartisan measures that came out of committee on the floor today I'll yield the well chair recognizes the author of the bill representative gains to conclude the chair's time thank you mr. Speaker and I just want to conclude by responding to a few points that were brought up in the argument here on the floor this this afternoon the first being local control and I do support local control and believe that is something this general assembly supports but when we have local governments that are out of control and putting lives at risk in our state we have to step in and I live in a community that has considered cutting 50% 50% of its police budget we have to step in lives are at risk in communities that are making those sort of proposals and so that is what this bill addresses and I believe it's an important step in that another point that was brought up is says said that this isn't happening in our state this is a headline bill it is happening in our state the city of Atlanta looked at cutting 73 million dollars last year it only fell by one vote on the city council Athens Clark County has looked at cutting 50% of its police budget that very well could come up for a vote again this year so this is something that was happening and they were considered that cities and counties in our state are considering you know another point that whip Kelly just addressed there is flexibility in this legislation if there's revenue losses if there's a court order for to provide new services we work through exceptions to make sure if there's responsible reasons for reducing spending and police that that our cities and counties have the ability to do that another point that was brought up was mental health and I believe we've got to invest to invest in mental health and this general assembly has done that and I would encourage cities and counties across our state to invest in mental health but we can't do that at the expense of public safety finally someone brought up unintended consequences the unintended consequences of not passing this legislation are lives that we might lose by cutting public safety putting families at risk that's the unintended consequences if we don't pass this legislation you know to be honest when I introduced this bill and brought it forward I didn't think this was a partisan issue and I'm disappointed it's become one because supporting our law enforcement is something we should all do and I hope Mr. Speaker that we pass this legislation to protect Georgia families yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration of this legislation. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here's none the committee substitute is adopted is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here's none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye those opposed will vote no when the clerk will unlock the machine what purpose does the majority leader of the house rise? Parliament inquiry Mr. Speaker isn't it true that while we've been sitting here debating this bill that I received a request from my district to write a letter

seeking grants to support the training of local law enforcement. And their efforts to make sure that those members of local law enforcement are adequately trained in the use of force, de-escalation training, crisis intervention training, crisis negotiating training. Miss Speaker, isn't it true that what we're doing here now will further deter from our local government's being able to provide adequate training for our law enforcement and our public safety folks that protects our, to protect our citizens. And we should support this bill. If the gentleman so states, I know he believes that to be true. What purpose does representative Anola Woods rise? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that of the two cities, I believe it's Atlanta and Athens that have proposed reducing funding to their police departments? Those were isolated incidents and they did not pass because the councils worked and represented their people. We did not want to cut the funding. I think that is a matter that will address itself to the judgment of each and every member of what purpose does Chairman Jay Collins rise? Automatory Equalment Stature inquiry. Is it not true that my 89 year old granddad lives by a column? And if somebody is trying to attack you, I want somebody to send the police officer not a social worker to protect him. I'm sure the gentleman believes in that very intensely. What purpose does representative Cannon rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Tattoo inquiry. Is it not true that this bill exempts up to 100 county police forces on lines 49 and 50? Additionally, is it not true that in the conversation around calling 911 for help? Is something that we can all get behind? But we recognize in today's America, people across the state of Georgia cannot call 911 and not end up in a grave. The lady so states, I know she believes that to be true. Final parliamentary inquiry. What purpose does the minority caucus will represent to Wilkerson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue inquiry. Is it not true that after today's bay, we can all rest assured that we all believe in public safety and want to support our local communities? And that instead of passing bills, the best possible measure may be for that. We get the qualifying information so that everybody in this chamber can run for the local government that they so intend to run from this chamber. I'm sure the gentleman believes that to be true. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 286. The eyes are 101. The nays are 69. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. The clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged residents.
