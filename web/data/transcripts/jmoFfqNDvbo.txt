----------
The hour for convening haven't arrived. All members please take their seats. Please take their seats. We're going to have the morning roll call. All members present. Please. You might be able to talk to me this morning. As we meet this morning, it can't first back to his church. His badge number 290. He was a specialized collision construction expert. And he graduated in the 103rd Trooper School. I know you all join me in praying for his family as they put their loved one to rest. I did want to ask for a moment of silence. Thank you. We will begin our day with scripture reading in prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 74th House District, Representative Karen Matthew. Good morning. And thank you, Madam Speaker. I so appreciate you being here today. Today is a really huge honor for me to introduce a young lady and her family who have meant, you know, when you talk about your pastor, you're talking about somebody very, very intimate in your life. And the gosses and the tackles have been a part of my life. For I'm going to, I'm not going to tell you how long. Pastor Bearing will go, what's not to do that? But there, Pastor Bearing Goss and his wife Barbara and Pastor Dosty and her husband, Chris Tackle, are here to bless this office today. I've known Dosty for most of her life. And if you want to find a woman that knows how to love like Christ loves, this is your lady. She is the best wife, the best mom, the best daughter, and the best friend that Griffin Georgia could ever have. So with all of that being said, come on, Dosty, bless them. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to my dear friend, Representative Karen Matthew to Speaker Burns and to all of you for having me. Here today is a great honor that I do not take for granted. Thank you all for your service and your commitment to our great state. It's because you think it's an easy job or a stress free job. But it's because you really have a heart for people and love people and you want good for us all. The last time I was in this building was in 1985 with my Jackson Road Elementary, fifth grade class. And I can say you guys haven't aged at all. Like you look fantastic, great job. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say to you today. I really just want to speak to your hearts and encourage you with an invitation to live lighter. Since COVID, most of us, our children included, have felt heaviness and both are professional and our personal lives. We are mentally exhausted. We are anxious. We are stressed out. And life has become heavy for so many. And while we cannot control everything in life we face, we can control how we carry it. You see more than Jesus said in Scripture, believe in me or worship me. He said come to me. He said follow me. Watch how I respond. Watch how I do it. Watch the way I do it. And he said it's less about believing the right things. And it's about living the right way. You see Jesus was full of joy. And most of us are full of stress. Jesus didn't worry. Some say this youngest generation is the most anxious generation in our history. Jesus stopped for people. We get so worried about checking off our to-do list and get interrupted that we didn't allow ourselves to just stop. My daughter Anna, she is a freshman at the University of Georgia. And as a stressed out, high achieving competitive 19-year-old, she found herself in a sea of thousands of other students just like her, wondering how to just have fun, how to live lighter, and how to chill out. She is a writer and a blogger and she started blogging and she recently blogged about watching one of her favorite childhood movies called Surfs Up. It's about penguins who love to surf, but her favorite character in the movie is a character named Chicken Joe. He is the only chicken competing with the other penguin surfers. And she writes this, imagine the most west coast laid back absolute dude of all dudes. Now put that persona into a surfing chicken. He's one of the best surfers in the game, but he doesn't even know what he's doing or where his board is or what day it is. He just knows life is going to work out. He has relaxed, carefree, totally trusting that he's going to be okay and he has fun. He's in it for the ride, literally. And she continues, I want to be like Chicken Joe. I want to be carefree, in it for the ride, so relaxed and trusting in God's plan for my life. That when things don't go as planned or don't go my way, that I will know that life is not happening to me, but for me. And so when I read this, I thought to myself, I want to be like Chicken Joe. And I'm sure most of you are in here saying I can't afford to be like Chicken Joe. And perhaps some of you are looking at someone when you're opposing party and saying they don't know what day it is or where their board is either. But I'm sure it's not like that in this house. Well, Jesus doesn't promise us that we can be as chill as Chicken Joe. What he does offer us is something better. And he offers us himself. I'm sure most of you are familiar with the passage in Matthew, where Jesus tells us to come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, who are burdened and I will give you rest. The message, translation, I really appreciate it is passage. And it is an invitation for us all. And the passage goes, are you tired? Are you worn out? Are you burned out on religion? Come to me and get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take real rest. Walk with me and work with me. Watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. But keep company with me and learn to live freely and lightly. I believe he is offering us an invitation to three things here. The first is an invitation to rest. This is not physical rest. It is not physical rest that we need. It is not physical rest that is making us feel exhausted all the time. It is that we don't rest our mind. We don't rest our thoughts. Proverbs 423 says, guard the heart above all else for it determines the course of your life. To guard your heart is to guard your mind. To guard what you're thinking about. Because you see the only power the enemy has over you are the thoughts you choose to stir. You say you don't have to think about everything you feel, but you will feel everything you think about. Wherever your mind goes, your life goes with it. So stop stirring thoughts that are weighing you down and do what Paul urges us to do in Philippians and think on things that are good and right and pure and holy. You see you have to set your mind on things above. It has to be a decision. It is not your default. What you're thinking about is determining what you're living in and Jesus invites us to peace and real rest. It is also an invitation to trust. You see, stress comes from our inability to trust that everything will work out and be okay. It comes from our insatiable desire to control. I have this neat little app on my phone. It is called Life360. It is the app your children hope you never discover. It tells me where my children are, how fast they're driving and if they are safe. This app is supposed to help me in eliminating stress from my life, but I submit to you. It does not eliminate stress from your life because it is not always accurate. To the point to a couple of years ago, I woke my husband up at the middle of the night and I said, Chris, John is in the middle of the road in Athens, Georgia. After subsequent calls to every family member and finding out John was indeed asleep in his dorm, I realized he was okay. I realized this is really not adding comfort to my life. The only true comfort and the only thing the only true trust is in the father. The way we're able to put our trust in him is to be present in this moment. Because you see fear and anxiety can only be attached to the future. When you are present with him, that is where our peace comes from. And finally, it is an invitation to let go. Let go of anything that's not serving you. Resentment, unforgiveness, unmet expectations, disappointment, not getting your way. And if you're waiting to feel the feeling to let go of these things, you may never feel it. It's an intentional act and it's a process. See, why didn't Jesus teach? Bless those who curse you once you're not angry anymore. Or pray for those who hurt you once you get over it. It's because right actions always precedes the right attitude. You won't feel the right things until you do the right things. I would like to close with my daughter Anna's closing words in her blog and she writes, may you relinquish the things that are not serving you. May you take the time to listen to the Spirit, to your inner voice, and may you courageously care for your needs. May you sacrifice your comfort for the beautiful reward of growth. May peace be your navigator rather than fear. And may you learn to live like chicken Joe. Let us pray. Father, thank you for coming to this earth to show us how to live. Thank you that you came to not save us from something, but rather save us to something better. So that we may have life and have it to the full. We ask that you continue to teach us to come to you in every part of our lives, that we can trust in your ways and your care, knowing that you are for us who can be against us. We accept your invitation today to take on your yoke that is easy and light. I bless every person in this room with health, with protection, and with overwhelming peace and your holy wonderful name we pray. Amen. To the five of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

It is perfectly fitting since he attended and graduated from both Augusta University's legacy institution earning a bachelor's degree in biology and chemistry from Augusta College and a doctorate in reproduction into chronology from the medical college of Georgia. While serving as president of Georgia Southern in the state's borough he focused on expanding undergraduate and graduate education through research and community experience and launched the Allen E. Paulson College of Engineering and Information Technology in the Institute for Interdisciplinary STEM Education. During his tenure at Augusta University he expanded his academic offerings in campus infrastructure through the founding of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences, the School of Public Health and the Transdisciplinary Research Initiative in Infomaging and Brain Aging, the Immunology Center for Georgia. The four-year Medical College of Georgia Partnership campus in Savannah, a new College of Science and Mathematics building, a major expansion of research laboratory space and the BERT's Story Cancer Research Building. During his tenure the Medical College of Georgia, the Dental College of Georgia and the College of Nursing have created partnerships to extend education outreach throughout the state and meet the critical needs, healthcare needs of our rule and other underserved areas. While doing all of this he has increased enrollment more than 27% and the National Institute of Health funding by 37%. We want to thank Dr. Keel for his service to our University System and to our State of Georgia and he and his wife Tammy move on to this new chapter in their life. We want to wish them well and we have a resolution that we'll be presenting to them. Please join me in welcoming these special folks to the podium. Thank you very much. What a real privilege and pleasure to be here today. I have so many people to thank and I just don't have time to do that but I do want to pull out just a couple things. First and foremost I would not be here were not for the First Lady of Augusta University and my wife Dr. Tammy Shaloo. I love you more than you know. As a contributing man he was the smartest thing I've ever done in my life. The second smartest thing I've ever done was to ask Russell Keen to join me as Chief of Staff. And I want to thank Russell and Karen for being here today with us too and to Russell and Tammy and I will certainly look forward to following your career as you move ahead. Thank you. I want to give a special shout out to the delegation of Augusta and Richie County, Columbia County. You know who you are. We greatly appreciate the service you give the State day in a day out. I've had the privilege of working under three governors. I've been in the system and I can't say enough about how much we appreciate Governor Camp and the great work he's doing before Augusta has done for Augusta for Gus University. I'd also like to thank the opportunity and I'll be quiet when I get done here. There are two other individuals I want to thank the part of this body. Speaker Burns and Chairman Parish have been more than just leaders to us. They've been personal friends. Speakers, Chairman and Presidents come and go with friendships or endure forever. So John butch thank you so much for your friendship. We can't thank you all enough. It's been great to be back home. I started here, I left here and I'm proud of all the great things we've together been able to accomplish. Thank you for what you do. Appreciate it and go Jax! you the chair recognizes representative Franklin for a one minute or less morning order. Thank you speaker pro tell I'm gonna make this short and sweet. But we're here today. We're here today to recognize and honor a great Georgian tradition. The unfortunately dying art of producing and making cane syrup. Traditionally cane syrup was made on the week following things given when the family was around to help with the process. So we are days native to fourth Friday in November. It's national sugar cane syrup day. And to celebrate you were final sample on your desk donated by Patricia and Randy Morton from Ellen M. Farms. One of only two Centennial Farms located in Bullock County. Patricia and Randy and your family please stand up and be recognized. Thank you for all you do for Bullock County.

I want to welcome the students teachers and staff from the Clor Health Science High School from Gwinnett County if you will stand. Visiting the capital for the first time as a group. The Clor consistently has among the top three or four highest graduation rates in Gwinnett with a minority enrollment of over 97% and they have consistently contributed both to our local health care workforce and services. I know that is critical to this body to use their words standing in the capital will serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of civic engagement to us. And I certainly hope they'll learn a lot today as we approach crossover. So thank you for being here. Special thanks to Commissioner John King for delivering a bilingual message to them earlier and thank you Madam Speaker. Thank you Madam Speaker. Thank you Madam Speaker.

The department was the first department agriculture established in our country and in the years after the war were very terrible at times for agriculture and joined lots of problems. And pulling neglected farmland and the members of this body saw a need to establish this department to help with agriculture practices and problems. And I just in 1874, Eggter but a Marion County carried the bill to establish this department. And we just really appreciate the great employees and the past chairman of commissioners of agriculture.

Chair recognizes Representative Reese for a morning order. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, there's no secret that the University of System of Georgia is the best university system in the United States of America. And what makes us strong is that we also have in addition to that system three phenomenal HBCUs right here in the state of Georgia. Savannah State University, Fort Valley State University, and the Albany State University. And we are happy to have all three of them here today with us under the leadership of Chairman Gregory Hollett and the chairman of the Planning Committee, Gary and Walker. And we also have the legend there, Maria Boynton, with us here today as well, a media mongo right here in Atlanta, Georgia. If you guys will stand up so that the gallery can recognize our representatives from HBCUs from right here in the state of Georgia. We're going on to the rules calendar. The clerk will read the caption House Bill 451. House Bill 451. House Bill 451, my reps on them. Seaball 34th being titled back to a men title 45, the fish go to Georgia annotated relating the public officers and employees says to require that provisions of supplemental illness specific insurance to certain first responders diagnosed with occupation of post-traumatic stress disorder. This bill I'm referring to committee on public safety and homeland security. That committee recommends a disbilled do pass by committee substitute. The chair recognizes representative Seaball to present the bill. Thank you colleagues. If I can have your attention I know there's a lot of conversation going on but I'd really like you to hear this bill. Gentlemen shall suspend. Please give the man in the well the gentlemen in the well your attention. If you have conversations please take them to the anagram. Gentlemen shall continue. Colleagues I rise today to present House Bill 451. This bill came at the request of a Gwinnett police sergeant Ashley Wilson a survivor of PTSD. After witnessing her partner being shot during a routine traffic stop she developed PTSD and when I was unable to return to work her out of pocket cost to get help that she needed so she could return to work was $35,000. It caused a great financial burden on her family and after receiving treatment she was able to return to work where she has been since she has since been promoted and continues to service today. I appreciate her service to law enforcement to the citizens of Gwinnett County and for her tenacity in getting us where we need to be today. What this bill does is requires government agencies in Georgia to provide a mental health supplemental benefit to their first responders who are diagnosed with PTSD resulting from exposure to line-up duty traumatic events. It creates a once per lifetime supplemental benefit to assist with uninsured cost associated with the initial diagnosis in ongoing treatment and recovery from PTSD. This benefit is needed because of stories like Ashley's. This benefit is needed because suicide among first responders is a growing epidemic in Georgia. In fact death by suicide a first responders has surpassed line-up duty deaths. Divorce rates and family separations have significantly increased in this profession due to issues attributed to PTSD. With a significant decline in our public safety workforce over the years we cannot afford to continue losing officers due to the treatment mental health issues. We cannot continue to allow these brave men and women who sacrifice so much for our communities and so much for our well-being to continue to suffer themselves in silence. This benefit allows them to confidentially reach out and get the help they need without risking their jobs and without placing a financial burden on their families. Because of this legislation lives will be saved. Today we have the opportunity to show these heroes we care about their mental well-being by giving them an opportunity to seek early diagnosis in treatment. We will help keep families together, keep moms and dads being moms and dads and role models to their children and it will make our community safer by these professionals being mentally fit. And I'll finish with this. I've been a paramedic for 40 years this May, 10 years on the front lines at the tip of the spear as we might say including time working here on the streets of Atlanta with a great EMS. As first responders we work in a business that never closes, a job that requires us to run towards the danger when others are running away, not responding and not helping is not a choice for us. It is a high-stress job that requires mental and physical toughness even when chaos is going on all around us. Believe it or not this is me excited. Y'all I've personally seen traumatic events that no human should ever see. I've held people as they said their last words took their last breath knowing that I'm holding someone's spouse, father, mother, child, grandchild, sister or brother knowing that I was the last person they saw. What first responders do day after day is an emotional role of coaster, dealing with good events like delivering babies and bringing someone back to life from a heart attack or stroke or even attending coffee with a cop. To horrible events like removing entangled bodies from a wreck car telling a mother her newborn baby is dead, to putting our lives on the line by making a routine traffic stop by removing bodies from a lake or a burned house, entering a scene after a mass shooting having to step over bodies to help those that are injured. Y'all this happens this can all happen in one day. It could be one day. And these first responders are expected to park the vehicle, go home, have dinner with our family, help the kids with homework, attend the football game, coach little league soccer, and attend Wednesday night supper at church and even pick up their own dry clean. And the next morning we get out, we put on the uniform and we do it again with a smile on our face. I assure you friends PTSD is very real and I'm fortunate so far that I have not suffered long terminal health issues because of what I witnessed and experienced and some of you may disagree with that statement. But the memories at night may as early as there, they're locked away and an imaginary box in my mind for which I cannot lose the key. There are many triggers that open the box from time to time but fortunately I can close it and move on. This bill is to help those that cannot. Once the box is open they have a hard time closing it. The counseling they will receive because of your actions today could be the change agent for these men and women who are thinking the only way out as suicide or leaving the industry that they love. Today right now with your yes vote you can make a difference. ACCG and GMA are in support of this bill as well as your state police, local sheriff, firefighters, police and the EMS workers. House Bill 451 comes with a favorable consideration by the public safety committee and the insurance committee. Please join me in support House Bill 451. Join me in showing our first responders in Georgia. We care about them, we care about their families and we are willing to invest in their well-being by providing them this benefit. And with that Madam Speaker I will ask for a favorable consideration and I'm happy to take questions. You do have questions. The chair recognizes Representative War Kaiser for a question to your left. Thank you Madam Chair because Jim and you. I do. It's not true that five years ago this bill spent two years in industry and labor as a workers comp bill and then it was decided that it was better served as a more general bill and spent two years in public safety and then this year was moved to insurance so it's been through three committees and the first responder committee is not true owes you a debt of gratitude for staying with this for five years to get to this day and we thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chair recognizes Representative Bernal for a question to your left. Thank you. Does General Manuil? I do. Is it not true that it is not until you need your services to people really appreciate what you do. I just want to tell you thank you for all your work and for the fact that you are representing the people you work with and you did stick with this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Gladney for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Sir is it not true that resources to support PTSD for first responders has been proven to be just as equivalent to resources that support veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. I believe the woman knows what she speaks. Thank you. Thank you so much for bringing this bill. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Lomston for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Does my friend? Is it not true that roughly one in three first responders develop some form of PTSD? That is true. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes Representative Carter for a question. Thank you. Does the gentleman yield? I do. Is it not true that a few years ago on my way to the hospital it was the fast acting response of a paramedic that ensured that I got to the hospital and today my children still have their mother and mother. Well I'm certainly glad to hear that representative. Thank you. No more questions. No more? Thank you Madam Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Gentlemen is yielded the well and the chair recognizes Representative Kinnard to speak for the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. I rise in favor today of HB 451. I heard a grim statistic over the weekend that Georgia now leads the nation and firefighters suicides. Let me repeat in 2023 there were more firefighters that died by suicide in Georgia than any other state. We also know that law enforcement officers in our state are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty. And this is across the board among all our police officers, firefighters, paramedics and all first responder personnel we have seen a rise in recent years of suicides, alcohol dependency and divorces. Every day our first responders put their lives on the line but they also put their mental health on the line daily they are seeing, hearing and experiencing the unimaginable and the PTSD that often follows is real. In some ways this brand of PTSD is even more acute than what our combat zone military personnel experience because in the armed forces there's usually a limited amount of time and exposure. But with first responders it is the daily pile on the accumulating compound impact day after day across a multi-year career that is particularly debilitating. The good news is one can recover from PTSD with the proper treatment. HB451 provides all of our public first responders a health benefit for PTSD treatment when experienced in the line of duty. It is a nominal investment but it will pay off big benefits for a healthy first responder workforce that can serve for the long term. I also want to thank Sergeant Ashley Wilson who is part of Winnet County's finest who brought this issue to us originally. She is right now serving and protecting today and she's listening to this session via live stream. When we call our first responders in times of need they show up usually within minutes. Today we have the opportunity to show up for them in their time of need. Please vote yes to HB451. I yield the well. The gentleman has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee's substitute? Chair here is none the committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. All members voted for what purpose does representative McCollum rise? The state are inquiry. Madam Speaker is it not true that as a former firefighter I support this measure and a lot of these public servants only make $12 to $15 an hour. This is the least we can do to help them. The gentleman certainly knows of that which he speaks. Have all members voted? If so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the A's were 168 the A's were zero the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House bill 880 House bill 880 House bill 880 by representative Ballard to the 147th and others to be entitled back to amend code section 43134 the fish go to Georgia annotated relating licenses for transitioning members of the armed forces so as to allow military spouses to use an existing license in good standing from another state this bill that referred to the committee unregulated industries that committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Ballard to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker colleagues I have House bill 880 that will ease one of the burdens on our military spouses who follow their service members into Georgia and I'd like to thank chairman Powell for his advice and wisdom on this issue. This bill does three things it ensures that Georgia is compliant with the new federal law regarding military spouse licensure which was signed into law in July 2023 and I worked with our defense department liaison for the southern states to make sure this would get us into compliance it meets the Department of Defense requirements regarding the timeliness of licensure by providing a 30 day time limit and it allows our military spouses to work as soon as they get to Georgia it will be one of the strongest military spouse licensure protection laws in the United States in this bill military spouses can begin the process of getting their license as soon as they are issued their orders before they even get to Georgia. The employer may go ahead and begin the verification process of their license to make sure they're in good standing and have no disciplinary actions and if the spouse meets Georgia's requirements and they have not received any notification about their application within 30 days they may work for that employer and use their license to work or use their license to work for themselves. This gives employers and military communities the freedom and flexibility to hire people who are good fit for them and gets our military spouses to work. I ask for your favorable consideration and I will yield for questions. There are questions the chair recognizes representative Oliver to your left for a question. Thank you does it let me leave you. I do. I want to thank you for this bill all of us get questions about licensure and obstacles and the military is really leading us and how to modernize these licensure rules so that these obstacles can be removed. This is a very good example of a lot of work we have to do in the future to make it easier for people to get licensed. Thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Jenkins to your right for a question. Do you yield? I do. The represent ballot as a is it not true and I can say is a career army veteran that you're addressing one of the primary sacrifices that military families make when they when they enlist in the military for a career. The sacrifice that spouses have to make when they follow their husband around the country as they serve our nation. So thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Ayerhart to your to the front. Thank you. I do. Representative Bowdoin can you tell us a little bit about the DOD rating and how their state currently scores with that as relates to licensure and how that affects our score? Yes. The Department of Defense ranks states in various categories of military friendliness. Some of these are schools, health care system and professional licensure for spouses. Currently Georgia gets zero points in that military spouse licensure category and this piece of legislation will make sure that we get all the points we're entitled to so that our bases might not pack up and be taken away from us in the future. General Eddie further you. Yes. Isn't not true that having been raised on military basis I have a real heart and understanding for the sacrifices that this families lived through and that I'm proud of Georgia for taking the stand to help support our military families. Thank you and I am also a proud military spouse. The Chair recognizes representative Huddleston to your right for a question. Does the general lady yield? Yes. Is it not true that this legislation will support those who supports our troops the most? Absolutely it will. Thank you for the bill. Chair recognizes Chairman Sains to your left for a question. This is General Eddie. I do. Is it not true that I'm proud to represent over 6,000 sailors at Naval submarine base Kings Bay in addition to several coast guard and Marines who all will appreciate that their spouses are able to add to the quality of life for their household because of this bill. Absolutely I believe that. Thank you. A lot of interest. The Chair recognizes representative Prince to the ladies left for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker to the lady yield. I do. Is it not true that this bill would not only help our military spouses and families to meet ends make ends meet but also protect our military basis from future brack closures. I believe it will. Thank you. Madam Speaker if there are no further questions I yield one or two more and that one or two more. Chair recognizes representative Scott for a question to your right. Does the lady yield? I do. Will this bill give our military spouses the right to go from one state to another state and not have to wait person long days to get their license yes the licensing board will have to look at their license within 30 days. Okay I'll just like say thank you for bringing this bill. Final question. Chair recognizes chairman Gunter for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker. Does the lady yield? I do. Does this bill it applies to licenses under the Secretary of State office not professional licenses is that correct. The one's covered under this code section with the Secretary of State. Okay all right thank you. There are no more questions. Thank you Madam Speaker I yield the well. Ladies yield to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered the chair here is none the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute chair here is none the committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which is favorable to the passage of the bill the chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill will vote yes all those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted. For what purpose does representative Thomas rise. Parliamentary inquiry. Statue of inquiry. Madam Speaker is in not true that there are 13 military bases in Georgia and that this legislation will benefit spouses of each of those bases. The gentleman surely knows that of which he speaks have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill the a's were 168 the nays were zero the bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed clerk read the caption House bill 1127 House bill 1127 House bill 1127 by revs and a percol 169th and others to be entitled back to amend title two of the official go to Georgia and to relay an agriculture system authorized the Department of Agriculture to enforce certain criminal laws this bill ever referred to the committee on agriculture and consumer affairs and that committee recommends a disbile do pass.

Sunday about this topic and i wanted to make sure we're all on the same page about where we are to start this to start my journey in the hemp world my kids came home from high school one day and we're talking about the weed store that we had in my district the weed store was on the on the corner that the biggest high school in my district is located workwood high school four thousand students and on the corner is a chevron station they kept referring to the chevron station as the weed shop i said i've got to go see what y'all talking about i go in they took all the drinks out all the chips it was all hemp products delta eight delta nine and if you're familiar you know that delta nine is what we have as illegal weed delta nine when you see it is illegal weed it was in the store broadly advertised delta nine i brought those products to our solicitor in wood at county we had a long conversation i said you know i know the law and i'm pretty sure this is illegal and he said i think you're right let me call the gbi he called the gbi the gbi said they don't test small quantities only large quantities that are being imported by the kilo into the country so yes he agreed with me it was like

illegal but there was no way to test it. There's no way to know for sure. You can't tell by looking, you can't tell by smelling, you can't tell by how somebody tests on a marijuana exam because you don't know if it's Delta 8 which is legal or Delta 9 which is not. So where are we? I have a high school with 4,000 kids and these products who are stronger than what we've laid out as a legislature available for purchase on the corner at the gas station. Now back up a little bit, when I was working for defects in the 90s I worked a split shift. I either worked four to 12 or midnight to eight. I've never slept the same since. I have been in insomniac since that day. So when all of these hemp products are available and I see some of them are labeled for sleep, I was like hmm this could be interesting. So I tried them and let me tell you, how's the best sleep I've had in years? Years! Now I said this was going to be honest conversation. I think Whit Park probably just had a heart attack when I said that but I was on, I was prescribed a narcotic to sleep in my 20s. I've been on the same narcotic, the same strength, which was the strongest rate allowable. I started taking those gummies. I was on Groupon one day and I saw where you can buy a medical marijuana car for Georgia on Groupon for $84. So I bought the Groupon and I talked to the doctor and he said so you have PTSD? I was like well no do I? He said yes and I can approve you for a card. $84 on Groupon. But the bright side to the story is with my Groupon Medical Marrana card and my physician I am no longer on that narcotic. I shop at our legal dispensaries and I am no longer at all on that narcotic. This has a lot of potential, a lot of potential. But when you go to the grocery store and buy funnions that are laced with marijuana hence the picture on the wall that I took at a local smoke shop close walking distance from here. You can see Doritos, Funnions, Captain Crunch. This is all marijuana products. These do not need a license. You do not need a medical marijuana card and let me tell you as a customer of both those are way stronger than what you get at the dispensary for a lot more money. If I'm going to jail they're going to jail. Me and Frito lay too. So my message today is if we can go to any gas station and buy this and our kids can go to any gas station and buy this we needed this bill yesterday. We need a lot more. I suspect that if we can get this at most gas stations in the area we do not have the resources to clean this up. We do not. When every gas station has something potentially illegal who is cleaning this up? Who is testing these? Who is going to these facilities and testing this stuff that we know is illegal but we can't prove it because where we're going to have it tested. If you get pulled over with this who's gone to jail and why? You can't tell if that's legal unless you test it and where you're going to test it. Not the GBI. They already told us they can't. So where are we now? Who how are we going to get the resources to clean this mess up because let me tell you your kids I showed some of these products to the people in the room and no one can tell the difference between something that was laced in marijuana and a regular Frito lay product. I suspect that we are going to have to regulate this much more. I think that it would be smart for us to tax it so that we can get the income to make all of the products that are available in Georgia legal and tested and I know when I use them I know what I'm ingesting because right now we just don't. Those are my remarks hopefully I kept you awake and let's have a great day and I yield the well. The lady has yielded the well the chair recognizes the chairman to complete the remarks of the well on the bill. Thank you. I just want to get us back on top. We've had several bills coming through our committee. Department bills from our Commissioner Agriculture. Tyler Harper has and many of us in this body have seen the dangers of what's out there for sale to our young people and to consumers in our state and we need these bills. We've got another one coming through committee that Representative Cannon has tomorrow and it's three bills we've bringing through our ad committee to try to put some guardrails. Get us back these products back within the law in our state and we're not trying to do away with the with the products we're just trying to put some regulation. Consumers do not know what they're consuming and so this is a great bill. I hope you vote green on it. We've got a great plan to to put some regulations on these products. So thank you Madam Chair. Hope you vote green on this bill with a lot of works going into this by several members of chairman Perkel and others in this body to try to get us on track with these products. Thank you. The gentleman is yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All in favor? The passage of the bill will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The A's were 165. The A's were one. The bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1188. House Bill 1188. House Bill 1188. House Bill 1188 by Representative. A lot of the 131st and others to be titled an act to amend chapter 8 to title 35. The official go to Georgia and it's a related employment and training of police of peace officers so as to extend the time frame for which reimbursement of total training expenses by a subsequent employer of a peace officer may be sought. This bill I refer to the committee on public safety and homeland security that committee recommends a disbile do pass. Chair recognizes representative Lot to present the bill. Thank you, Madame Speaker. Currently in code. If a law enforcement officer is hired by another agency within 15 months after completing formal training then the hiring agency will reimburse the cost of that training to the original agency. This bill only changes the reimbursement requirement from 15 months to 36 months which adds greater protection on their investment by the agency and the community. I will yield for questions, Madame Speaker. There are no questions. Thank you. I ask your favorable consideration. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there an objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Yes, all those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machine. The bill is agreed to. For what purpose does Chairman Sainz rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State's your inquiry. Is this not true that this bill only creates an extension for agencies to incur costs? It does not ever add additional liability to the individual piece officer if they are transferring to a different agency. The gentleman knows that for which he speaks. Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. The bill, the 166th, the nays were zero. The bill having received the requisite constitution majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption House bill 1251. House bill 1251. House bill 1251 by Representative Lebritt of the 123rd and others to be entitled next to a men code section 15630. The fish go to Georgia annotated relating the travel expenses of judges of the spirit court. So it was transferred from the state auditor to the council spirit court judges of Georgia duties related to review and approval of travel expenses. This bill then referred to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. The chair recognizes Representative Lebritt to present the bill. Thank you Madam Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, House bill 1251 simply moves the function of reimbursing Superior Court judges for travel expenses from the Department of the State auditor to the council spirit court judges. We believe this is a move that's long overdue. At the time, the auditor was established as the person to handle this function was in the 40s before the council spirit court judges even existed. And right now they have to get information from the council send inquiries about to justify the expenses. They have to keep records. The council also maintains duplicates of those records. It's extremely inefficient and this would help greatly with government efficiency and keeping sort of costs down as well as putting in the correct agency effectively that function of reimbursing the judges. So I think this is a good move. And I would just share with you, I don't know if any of you have ever had your administrative assistant call you and say the state auditor wants to come meet with you. But that does a lot of things to some of your vital statistics when you hear that. But fortunately, that was all that it was for. So we're doing this as a request to the auditor and believe this makes a lot of sense. Madam Speaker, that's all I have all you have for questions. An exciting presentation. A listening to no questions. Thank you, I asked your favor consideration House Bill 1251. Are you the well? The gentleman is yielded. The well is there any objective?

House Bill 974 requires that the secretary of state establish and maintain a program to post images of paper ballots so that the public can view them and inspect them. And it sets a minimum DPR resolution to ensure that the quality of those images it's as high as possible. Madam Speaker, if there's any questions, I'll be glad to take any. There's one question. Chair recognizes Representative Anderson for question. Yes, I do. Is it not true that any citizen will be able to view these ballots at no charge? That is the case. Thank you for the minute. There's one more question. The chair recognizes Representative Clark for question. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does the gentleman you? Yes, I do. So how exactly are the regular regular everyday person?

Does the gentleman further you? Yes. Is there some process like if they don't like what they see or they don't agree with something?

The official go to Georgia annotated relating to general visions relative to jails. So it's to provide jailers with the rest of powers this bill I'm referring to the committee and public safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends this bill do pass. Does chair recognizes representative vans to present the bill? Thank you Madam Speaker. I come forward today ladies and gentlemen on House Bill 996. This is a bill to authorize post certified jails to have the legal ability to effectuate the arrest of someone who comes to the jail to surrender him or herself into custody for a warrant or a complaint. And number two initiate the arrest of any person violating a criminal law within the jail or perimeter guard lines of the jail. Y'all there's probably 140 to 145 shares departments in Georgia who whenever someone comes to turn themselves in they have to call a deputy off the road to come take that person into custody. This will allow a jailer who is already there and has post training to effectuate that arrest and take that person into custody so that deputy can remain on the road answering those calls. Do hope that you will act terribly upon this bill because it will definitely help county jails in Georgia and keep more of our law enforcement people on the road to answer those calls that you may or may not make. With that Madam Chairman I yield or any questions or yield the will. There are some questions the chair recognizes representative Gullet for a question. Thank you does the gentleman yield yes sir. Isn't it true that in a county of my size I'm a Metro land I'm a pretty large county but we only have four deputies potentially at any given time in the jail and this would give them the ability to to make those arrests the jails in their arrests you're post certified and that my county's been advocating for this a long time and really appreciate you bringing this bill. Yes sir Mr. Gullet you are correct and I really appreciate your question. Thank you chair recognizes representative Stenson for a question. Thank you Madam chairs is the gentleman you. Yes ma'am I do. Representative I appreciate your work on this legislation but I just need to better understand him you're saying this bill will make it where those jails that are post certified do you know of most jails have jails that are post certified. Yes ma'am jails have to attend a jailers academy it is a shorter one than a law enforcement officer academy but they have to attend an academy within six months of being employed so they can get that certification to to stay employed and working the jail. Further question if I may. Yes ma'am. Does was this legislation require a local sheriff departments to spend additional funds on getting trained okay. Good morning. All right well thank you. Thank you. Chair recognizes chairman Petri to your left for a question. Thank you Madam Speaker does gentleman you. Yes sir I do. Representative isn't not true that this issue this bill will help us to deal with a dramatic increase in crime occurring in our local jails is that not true. That's correct sir thank you thank you sir. Chair recognizes representative cannon for question. Thank you Madam Speaker is the gentleman yield. Yes sir I do. Just to comment is it not true that in our county our sheriff pulls from the ranks of the jailers to make sheriff's deputies is that not true. That's correct sir. There are no more questions.
