chakota Georgia an relating education so
provide generally for the competitively
fair and safe student participation in
middle school high school and collegii
and sports this bill have referred to

if you have some extra extra

they're that important so you can hear
each other
thank we're going to have order in
here members will deserve to be heard on
this important piece of legislation if
you don't want to hear it take it to one
of those other places or out the front
door representive boner is recognized to
speak to sb1 representative
boner thank you Mr
Speaker colleagues I rise today to
present Senate bill
one Senate bill one represents years of
work by members of this house and the
Senate intense scrutiny by Senate study
committee led by Senator dolal and hours
of testimony and debate in both Chambers
it is a narrowly tailored Common Sense
bill that achieves the goal of
maintaining fairness in female Athletics
by eliminating the potential for male
advantage and protects female spaces
during Sports reporting events Senate
Bill 1 incorporates many of the
provisions of House Bill 267 we passed
just a few weeks ago and Mr Speaker I
will keep my presentation brief by
highlighting just a few of the
similarities and
differences first Senate bill incorp
Senate bill one incorporates the naming
convention we adopted with the title of
the Riley gains act in fact we
entertained briefly changing the name to
the Gavin Nome act following the
governor of California recent support of
keeping biological males out of girls
Sports the bill includes a more
comprehensive definition of sleeping
quarters found on lines 86 through
89 and then Senate bill one removes the
language regarding birth certificates
but maintains the language we adopted
regarding medical record reviews and
standard School medical procedures
additionally Senate bill one
incorporates the house caveats regarding
those authorized to be in the locker
rooms restrooms and changing
areas in House Bill 267 we established
the Professional Standards Commission as
the firstline Arbiter of complaints and
investigations Senate bill one relies
instead on an existing complaint
standard currently in Ed today and
includes a number of appellate deadlines
the private cause of action Remains the
Same for both bills the most significant
difference in the bill is that Senate
bill one does not include any of the
code revision language found counted
House Bill
267 and represents a bill solely focused
on female Athletics colleagues the bill
before us today provides an opportunity
to provide a Level Playing Field and
ensure Fair competition for female
athletes in Georgia with that Mr Speaker
that is the bill and I would be happy to
stand for any
questions gentleman has a couple of
questions and then we have speakers on
the bill uh I recognize representative
ran to your left up of the center four
question thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield I do thank you so um
we've been talking a lot about this
issue over the past uh duration of the
session how many um trans athletes are
there in the state of Georgia I I do not
have that information got it and um do
you further yield I do thank you so um
you know we have talked a lot about
certain athletes particularly those that
have come down to Lobby on bills like
this from my understanding that athlete
did in fact tie with her trans
counterpart cuz there are frankly very
few trans athletes and they're not you
know very great um I mean they're
they're great for their division but not
necessarily better than their
counterparts so when we talk about like
protecting girls Sports why was there
not more of a focus on things like
athletic facilities making sure they
have um Equitable access to coaches and
things like that well that's certainly
an issue that I'm certainly concerned
with and look forward to working with
you in the future on a bill that
addresses just that do you yield for one
more question no okay got it thank you
Mr
Speaker gentem has a couple other
questions representative rice to your
left is recognized for to your left Mr
chairman is recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker does a gentlemen
what you I do is it not true that for
preserving distinct male and female
sports teams this bill protects the
opportunities scholarships and the
safety of female student athletes across
Georgia absolutely thank you for the
question and I think this bill uh
directly uh speaks to the title n
protections that were so
hardfought gentleman you off for another
question representative fry yes to your
left up front is recognized for a
question gentleman
recognized thank you Mr Speaker
gentleman yield to my friend I do thank
you my
friend this isn't an antagonist of
question but isn't it true that Riley
Gaines came in fifth place yeah fifth
place was defeated by four other women
and she was upset she didn't get a
participation trophy by Hing for
fifth isn't that
true I won't dispute the um I know that
she won some other competitions um I do
know that she may have placed in a
different um in fifth as you say but
here's how I would address that though
is that this is not a one for one so
it's not as if a a biological male that
wins a competition against a biological
female it's not a one for one swap so um
that biological male knocking one female
out of a top spot spot in fact shifts
everybody down and pushes many many
females down the line out of those uh
out of competition for medals uh for
titles and things like that
so representative Corbett to your
right is recogniz for a question thank
you Mr Speaker this gentleman y I do is
it not true that women's sports are not
a backup option for media ochre male
athletes I would completely agree thank
you for the question
I'll stand for one more Mr
Speaker okay uh let's see now you have
you have a couple more uh representative
gullet had his light on light on so I'll
go by that representative gullet is
recognized for a question thank you jman
yield I do isn't it true that this bill
just really enfor reinforces that female
athletes have a fair and safe athletic
um environment to play in absolutely all
we're looking for is simply a Level
Playing Field meaning when a female
athlete steps on the playing field that
there is no Advantage other than fair
and clean competition so with that Mr
Speaker I was certainly yielded well I
encourage my colleagues the yes vote I
would also uh Mr Speaker just take a
moment to thank all those that have had
a part in this this has been a
multi-year effort by a number of house
members and Senators I'd like to thank
Senator dolal lieutenant governor Jones
chairman Chris Irwin and his committee U
for helping guide this and then lastly
you speaker Burns for your leadership on
this issue and providing a play a a
Level Playing Field for female athletes
in Georgia and with that I'd ask your
favorable consideration gentleman
yielded the well okay here's our posture
we have a number of folks that are
interested in on speaking to the bill we
have chair's time and Minority Report as
well so I'm going to give up to 40
minutes to those opposed and those in
favor of the bill that will be allocated
to speakers will allocate their time up
to 40 minutes and we will begin our
discussion on those opposed to sb1 by
recognizing representative
Lupton give the lady and you well your
attention representative Karen lton is
recognized to speak to the Bill thank
thank you Mr Speaker come on folks do I
have to come down and speak about this
again okay you don't want to hear it I
don't want to have to say it but here we
go I've been called upon this is my
job um I sit on the education committee
where sb1 came through and where the uh
comparable HB bill came through um I've
heard people speak to it I've heard
people speak against
it and I especially in this last um in
this last committee
meeting I really noticed something very
distinct about who was speaking for and
who was speaking against
sb1 now if this is such common sense if
this is so needed if this is a
shield for girls in sports you'd think
that there'd be lots of
coaches lots of schools that run Sports
programs
s lots of
athletes coming up storming the castle
and saying oh my gosh we need this
now and
instead the people who spoke to the bill
were athletes who are currently
competing with and against transgender
athletes we had clergy speak against
sb1 we had parents of transgender
children speak speak against
sb1 not a single coach not a single
athletic
organization not a one zero which
incidentally is the amount of
transgender students competing in K
through 12 Sports in Georgia
zero so who spoke in favor of it two
right-wing
organizations the uh faith and uh oh
gosh the faith and freedom
coalition and
Frontline what the heck do they have to
do with women's sports this is why the
last time I got up here I dragged y'all
about the Bible because if the only
people you've got to speak to this bill
are religious right and one of them
categorized as a hate Group by the
Southern Poverty Law Center if that's
the best you can bring I don't think
we're accomplishing safety in women's
sports what we're accomplishing is a
right-wing political theological agenda
being woven into our code and letting
transgender people know that they are
sinful wrong and not welcome in
Georgia now it's true that Riley Gaines
whom this bill is named after um spoke
for this bill the only athlete that we
heard speak to the bill by the
by now this bill is sb1 sb1 we know that
to get to that number number one in uh
in a session in a legislative session
when we're dropping legislation you got
to be purposeful to be number one you
got to be purposeful and on the ball
there when the opportunity opens for us
to drop legislation boom sb1 priority
what is
hb1 hb1 is a democratic bill called the
Pediatric safe storage act that's what
we rushed to this house that's what we
brought a desire to protect our students
a desire to protect young people from
making a tragic mistake that harms them
or others that's what Democrats brought
you this is
sb1 sb1 the Senate's first priority is a
problem that does not exist because you
must get your message out that trans
people are not welcome here we get it
trust me they get it okay my daughter
has many friends that are transgender
she's a gentle soul she drives she kind
of draws these people to
her and one of them shook my hand the
night I won this seat the first time and
said thank you I'm glad that you won I
know you'll stand up for people like
me another friend of hers was relaxing
at our house one night she came she's a
Ken my daughter's a kenas state came
home with some friends and this was
after last session's big trans hoopla
and she said I feel like my state
doesn't want me to
live and I said
well they sure not they're sure not
supporting
you
so one the NCAA has changed its policy
on uh transgender athletes the ioc has
rules in place that deal with
transgender athletes the Georgia High
School Association has rules that deal
with transgender athletes I question
why we must double down and triple down
they they have not asked us for
this now 16 female athletes in the NCAA
signed on with Riley bar with Riley
um gains thank you with Riley uh gains
for her lawsuit against NCAA okay
16 in response to that lawsuit over
400
NCAA professional Olympic par Olympic
athletes over 400 signed an open letter
to the
NCAA saying please just leave trans
folks
alone uh we'd we'd really rather you
focus on something else when it comes to
inequity in women's
sports like perhaps the fact that
21% of women
and 11% of young men say they have been
sexually
abused sexually
abused during Sports when they were
young now that's a fire alarm okay
that's a problem when 21% one in five
women are being sexually assaulted while
they play
sport it's not trans athletes that are
doing that to
them so I
am actually proud
um to stand against
sb1 um I would ask that if you want to
govern by the Bible I mean go all the
way go all the way to love your neighbor
as yourself if you want to govern by the
Constitution fair and equal treatment
before the law is what is our goal
what's our
goal what's our
goal thank you Mr Speaker I yield The
Well the lady has yielded the well
represent asine
Clark is recognized speak to the bill
representative
Clark thank you Mr
Speaker colleagues today I Rise to ask
you to vote no on this bill because this
bill does not make our children
safer this bill is a license to harass
to bully and to
harm and if you don't believe me let me
tell you the story of Amy Toms who is
who is 22 years old when this happened
Amy Sports a pixie cut I don't know if
any of you all in here have a pixie cut
it's a short
haircut she was followed into the
bathroom at her job by a man yelling
expletives at her telling her that she
doesn't belong and that she's
disgusting and you know why he did that
it's because he thought she was trans
she is not trans she is cisgendered she
just didn't happen to look girly enough
for him and he felt like that gave him
the right to harass
her this is the type of harassment that
we would be inviting into our
schools let me to tell you the story
about Jessica Rush Jessica Rush was
accosted in a restroom at the Baylor
Medical Center at a hospital because she
was dressed in basketball shorts and a
t-shirt the man admitted multiple times
that he thought she was a boy because
she was quote dressed like a man so a
person can't go to the hospital to visit
their loved ones dressed in a T-shirt
and basketball shorts without being
harassed because they don't look girly
enough do you have to wear a dress in
order to not be
harassed Kaa Morton she was approached
in a restroom in Arizona by police by
police officers and let me be clear male
police officers after a store employee
assumed that she was
trans so two male officers came into the
women's restroom shined a flashlight
light into the stall where she was
sitting down
urinating shined a flashlight in there
and demanded that she come out of the
restroom when she came out she literally
had to lift up her shirt and expose her
breast expose her breast to prove that
she was a woman because someone assumed
she was trans and felt like that was
licensed for them to send the police
after her do we want girls in our
schools having to expose their bras or
their breasts to school resource
officers to prove that they are
girls and I keep hearing how this bill
is supposed to create an even playing
field but I want to introduce you all to
mabs who did not ask for this Spotlight
but it came upon
[Music]
him he he is a trans
boy and because of a similar law that
passed in
Texas Mack who begged to compete against
boys because he is a boy Mack was told
that he had to compete with the weight
class and the sex that was assigned on
his birth certificate so you know what
Mac had to do that's Mac up there that's
Mac right there they made mac compete
against girls and he won he won fair and
square Mack had been
transitioning yes he was taking
testosterone but what happened in this
in in this instance was the bill that
we're asking for
today we actually that actually made
parents even more upset because now
they're like why is this boy competing
against my little girl and they said
it's because it's the law
that's what this bill is doing this does
not quote even the playing field it just
is a license to harass to bully and to
harm also this bill and similar bills
like
it completely leave out individuals in
our society that are intersex and if
there is nothing that you will learn at
the end of this session you will learn
that intersex people do exist and
sometimes people have ambiguous
genitalia and sometimes that means that
when they are born their parents get to
choose we're going to decide that she's
a girl we're going to decide that he's a
boy and they have no idea what that
individual grow will grow up to decide
or feel like when they get older because
they have a mixture of
both and bills like this completely
erase them off the planet I'm actually
not sure and I have not been able to get
a solid or straight answer from anyone
as to what sport a interex individual
actually gets to play do they get to
play with girls do they get to play with
boys it's so unclear no one has been
able to answer it for me so how do I
tell my constituents that are parents of
intersex individuals or people who have
um gen genetic sex disorders how do I
tell them where they fit because because
according to this law they don't exist
and that is just not right so unlike
many in this chamber I am a parent and
not only am not a parent I'm a parent of
an athlete she plays basketball she runs
track she's played soccer she's played
volleyball she is an athlete by all all
means of imagination I mean she's
great and so I asked her I said baby
girl
how do you feel about this war on girl
Sports because it's the Talk of the Town
down at the capital but since you're
playing in sports I would love to hear
your thoughts on it and she looked at me
confused and she said Mom what are you
talking about and I said you know the
war on girl Sports the one where y'all
are so worried about the trans us trans
athletes you know bumping you out of
contention or and she said my um no one
no one is talking about that y'all are
talking about that we are not talking
about that in the locker room and so we
have created a
bill that is a license to harass a
license to bully a license to harm and
these actual
athletes do not want this they did not
ask for
this and I think that that is a problem
I think that if you truly care about all
of your constituents then you would ask
them you would actually ask the people
that would be most impacted by this bill
and the ones that are most impacted are
saying we do not want this so I'm going
to leave you all with
this if you would like to see trans boys
competing against cisgender girls which
this bill will do then you will probably
go ahead and hit the green button if you
are okay with police officers making
your daughter or your friend's daughter
your niece your little cousin expose
their breast to prove they are a girl
then you will push green on this
button but if you actually care about
your constituents and you understand
that laws like this do not actually make
anyone safer and it's just a license to
harm a license to bully and a license to
harass then you will vote no on sb1
thank you Mr Speaker I yield The
Well the lady has yielded the well
representative Eric
Bell is recognized to speak to the bill
represent de Bell
[Music]
thank you Mr Speaker for being a
knowledge today colleagues I rise in
opposition of sb1 the so-called Riley
gangs act because it is not to govern by
truth but it's political clout I stand
here as a heter as a heterosexual
cisgendered man whose sister didn't fit
the mode of what some
call or some say is a woman she grew up
wearing sneakers instead of heels
playing basketball with the boys instead
of jumping rope with the girls and guess
what she is still a
woman still is a child of God and still
fearfully and wonderfully made Psalms
139: 14 says I praise you for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful
are your Works my soul knows it very
well but like this bill that does not
affirm the
truth this doesn't uplift anyone but
this bill laws like this sends a message
to some of our kids that they do not
belong that some kids deserve that some
kids don't deserve the same
opportunities that some kids deserve to
be punished for just existing when some
of these kids are the very kids have
been victims of traumatic past both
previously and
now and for what why are we doing this
for political points headlines the next
position we want to run for a
distraction but I'm here to talk facts
so let's talk about
it the Georgia High School Association
already prohibits transgender athletes
from competing in sports outside their
biological sex so what would this bill
do the
NCAA has has already made it clear that
the rules of
Eligibility and right now it is very and
right now at this very moment there is
no transgender athlete competing in
Georgia's public
schools again there is no right now
there is no transgender athlete
competing in Georgia's public schools so
if this is about fairness or not if it's
about protecting our children and
protect in our students or not if it's
not about addressing the real issues
then what is it really about this bill
solves no problems because no problem
exists let me repeat this bill solves no
problem because no problem truly exists
so what does this bill do what does sb1
actually
do it invites costly unlimited lawsuits
against our schools a student can be
sued a student can sue a school for
anticipated horn for something that
hasn't even happened schools can be sued
for emotional distress with no clear
limits and for
what yet just weeks ago we stood here
holding that t reform was our number one
priority that was to protect businesses
from excessive lawsuits for protecting
businesses from litigation which was
good policy then why is exposing scho
school to litigation
acceptable so I asked why do
corporations get protection but not
Public Schools why are public schools
left holding their
handbag and what and for what about and
for what about protecting women's sports
let's be real this bill does not protect
female athletes it endangers them if it
were to we would be talking about equal
funding better facilities more
scholarship ships but we're not because
here's the truth men Sports receive more
resources more funding and more
attention than women's sports today
that's a real the real inequity is in
athletics but instead of addressing that
we are debating manufactur crises one
that does not help women at all one that
does not protect girls at all this bill
isn't about fairness is about
fear but instead of solving the real
issue we're spending more time on
political spun political stunts georg's
family sent us up here to solve real
problems problems such as Affordable
Health Care affordable housing school
safety Economic
Opportunity but we're here dealing with
women's sports instead this bill is
about
distraction this bill is nothing more
this bill is nothing more to improve our
schools our communities our economy only
furthering political
pits it will drain money from our class
rooms and put us in the
courtrooms it will send a message it
will send a message that's already heard
today that vulnerable kids are not
welcomed that vulnerable kids in Georgia
are
unwelcomed and to what point to the
point of division that advis us instead
of brings us together and for what to
make harder to make life harder on
children is that is this what we're
doing as a man of Faith as a brother to
a woman who is different but no less
worthy and as a leg and as a legislator
who has took a oath to serve all people
of Georgia I cannot stand by and support
this bill Matthew 25: 40 says truly I
tell you what you do for one of the
least of these brothers and sisters of
mine you did for
me let's not let's be judged by how we
treat the least of thee not by how we
play political politics how we play
politics and I refuse to stand here and
watch children become political become
collateral damage in a political
game because my faith teaches me
something different my conscience tells
me something different my sister's
life her
strength her
resilience her
worth has taught me something
different so let so let's ask ourselves
when the history book looks back at this
moment moment how will we be
judged will we be judged by the
legislature that further victimize
victims or will we be the ones that
ended poverty in
Georgia will we be the ones that solve
homelessness or will we be the ones
known to play
politics so I say let's do the right
thing it's our time to do the right
thing
but we have to vote no and we have to
vote no now for just for clarity Vander
bill has done a study that showed that
83% of lgbtqia individuals have have
suffered some type of drama whether it's
been physical or sexual abuse and here
we have a bill that further victimizes
victims with that Mr Speaker I urge I
urge this body to vote no and I yield
the will thank you
you a gentleman at yield of the
well representative park Canon is
recognized to speak to the bill
representative
Canon thank you Mr speaker thank you
members for your attention today is
transgender day of visibility it is an
annual day where transgender individuals
around the United States
stand up proudly in their bold
identities as daring to say I don't feel
right in this body but if I can get
access to mental health care and
physical health care if I can have
support from social communities and
Community organizations that I will feel
better so instead of celebrating trans
day of visibility today we are literally
erasing transgender Georgians
I am speechless but instead I'm going to
take this 15 minutes and I'm going to
speak to y'all about the importance of
the transgender community and some of
the truths as to what this bill does
first I want to ask each of you have any
of you ever been present for a gender or
sex ambiguous birth have you ever been
in the room when that has happened well
I have and as one of our members spoke
to
what
happens what happens is families in that
moment get to choose how they will
socialize their child until their
genitalia has developed enough and
within that time period within those
next two years they can go to medical
professionals and figure out what is
best for their child they don't come to
the State Constitution and say well
what's legal and what sport is my kid
going to play and base it off of that
we have reports here that show that
transgender discrimination claims have
already cost Georgia taxpayers
$4.1
million that figure includes $2.1
million to settle those claims and
another another two midle inlegal fees I
have placed this on your desk because I
think it's really important that we talk
about this is such a big issue so let's
go over the cases that we we thought
were so great miss Carrie Scott a staff
attorney in the state court system said
after a long process of self-reflection
she realized about 2 and a half years
ago that she needed to transition to
align with her identity as a transgender
woman her surgery was covered by her
state health benefits plan it has been a
wonderful thing that's happened in my
life that surgery was incredible for my
wellbeing I was in a lot of pain
emotionally and now I'm not in pain in
2015 a transgender inmate said she was
refused adequate care and Sue the
Department of Corrections the department
agreed to use qualified medical and
mental health professionals to evaluate
inmates with possible gender dysphoria a
diagnosis used to identify distress
cause when a person's gender identity
differs from the sex listed on their
birth certificate in 2021 two
transgender
women sued the state when they were
denied gender affirming surgeries under
Georgia's medic health insurance program
the the State Department of Community
Health settled the case a year later
agreeing to amend its policy to pay for
gender affirming care through Medicaid
in 2019 a ug employee won a settlement
that requires the state's University
system to cover medically necessary
expenses including gender confirmation
surgeries and in 20123 three transgender
men reached a settlement that requires
the state health benefits plan to pay
for gender dysphoria treatment now I
understand what this piece of policy
does here I know that there's some level
of misleading that is trying to happen
to say oh but it's not
267 it actually does have some of those
Provisions from 267 in it and so either
way we are looking at millions and
millions of dollars in lawsuits now
let's talk about hate crimes we spent
our time years ago working on hate
crimes legislation it was so important
that we spent that entire session
working on that bill back and forth
until it passed well in states with
these restrictive laws the number of
hate crimes on K through2 campuses has
more than quadrupled at the same time
calls to lgbtq youth crisis hotlines
have
exploded the number of
anti-lgbtq school hate crimes serious
enough to be reported to local police
more than doubled Nationwide between
2015 and 19 and again between 21 and
2022 calls have spiked to the Trevor
Project which provides support to lgbtq
youth aimed at Suicide Prevention and
Crisis Intervention in the fiscal year
of 2022 the group fielded about
230,000 crisis contacts the following
year it was more than
500,000 similarly the rainbow youth
project in 2022 had a th000 hotline
calls and in 2023 had 1,400
the rainbow youth project saw a crush of
calls from Oklahoma specifically rising
from 321 in January to nearly 1100 in
February the week following next
Benedict's death in 2021 and 20122 the
most recent years for which data was
available the average more than doubled
to
232 hate crimes at schools so hate
crimes we used to care about that issue
we used to try to create an agent
that could actually look at these hate
crimes and now we're trying to find more
ways let's talk about verifying sex sex
verification testing so what is sex
verification testing it is outdated and
pseudoscientific ideas about sex that
disproportionately impact women whose
bodies do not conform to narrow gender
stereotypes how do they do this one
physical examinations inspections of an
athlete's genitals often degrading and
invasive two chromosomal testing lab
tests that examine an athletes DNA to
determine whether they have XX or XY
chromones chromosomes three hormone
testing blood or urine test to measure
testosterone levels despite the fact
that this type of test is scientifically
flawed and fails to account for genetic
diversity as I close inclusive of pelvic
ultrasounds or MRIs Imaging tests to
determine an athletes reproductive
Anatomy which could be used to exclude
intersex women from competition I ask
that you vote against this bill I have a
lot more to say on it but on trans day
of visibility if you can't just let
transgender people live alone please
take a walk thank you Mr
speaker thank you representative
Canon that concludes our speakers there
we'll be ready for the Minority Report
and cherish time is there any objection
to the previous question being ordered
hearing none the previous question is
ordered we have up to 20 minutes for the
Minority Report and then up to 20
minutes for the chair's
time whip Park is recognized to speak to
the bill up to 20 minutes I guess you'll
allocate those yes sir thank you sir
gentleman's
recognized thank you Mr Speaker good
morning colleagues uh unfortunately we
are here debating another
divisive culture War issue that will do
nothing to support Georgia students and
do everything to harm vulnerable Georgia
children here in this state and so I ask
all members on both sides of the aisle
to either vote no or to walk on S
sp1 now the author of The Bill said that
this piece of legislation went through
an enormous amount of scrutiny over
multiple years well y'all look it up
there's not a single transgender
athlete in our Public
Schools this bill accomplishes
absolutely
nothing with respect to
fairness and of course this really isn't
about fairness is it this is about
discrimination I have to ask myself so
often why is the majority party so
intent to discriminate against
transgender children in the state of
Georgia so intent to discriminate
against vulnerable
children do members of the majority
party not
recognize that these sorts of pieces of
legislation Drive children to commit
suicide as demonstrated by multiple
studies on on these pieces of
legislation do members of the majority
party not recognize that this will drive
harassment and bullying of the most
vulnerable children in our schools is
there no
concern from members of the majority
party about the least among
us we stood today for a
bird a
bird while we are passing legislation to
harm georg's
children
now as the author again mentioned
earlier in his remarks we could have
called this a Gavin
act yet another reminder that this is a
political culture War issue that will
cause harm to Georgia's most vulnerable
students and so again a last last point
I will make on this is you know
throughout this legislative session how
much time and effort did we spend on
tort
reform how much time and effort did the
majority party spend bullying and
twisting arms to make it harder for
injured georan Georgians and victims of
sexual assault to hold those accountable
for causing them
harm and yet at the same time we open up
all of our schools to litigation to
frivolous lawsuits
that's the majority party what what
incentive do y'all have other than this
manufactured culture war in which y'all
have scared your voters into harming a
vulnerable Community as to actually
living up to the dictates of your
faith that clearly mean nothing as
demonstrated by your
actions and so y'all I'm sick and tired
of being sick and tired of children in
this State being used as political ponds
which is what this bill
does this is
unacceptable and so again I urge members
to vote no or to walk on this nonsense
issue that will cause so much more harm
to the most vulnerable Among Us than to
actually do anything of benefit to
Georgia students thank you Mr Speaker I
yield the
well gentleman is yield the yielded the
well representative Wilkerson is
recognized speak to the bill
representative Wilkerson thank you Mr
Speaker today I come to oppose uh Senate
bill one uh the education committee does
a really good job typically of vetting
bills and and in this case we did fix
some things um the initial draft of 267
which is very similar to this would have
banned coaches from even going in the
locker room at halftime to talk to the
young ladies it took about five of us to
convince the author that this was bad
but once Frontline agreed that it was
okay change they made the change and so
let me tell you what I'm here as I'm
here as a
father a coach a Christian a husband
like many of you and we are a
representative of the people and as also
of our experiences and so there are a
lot of times these experiences you may
not know what it means to be a coach of
young women I do and I can tell you no
young ladies I work with and have
coached think this is an important
bill what I will say is up there is I'm
assuming is going to be one of the
methods of verifying a child sex because
the initial bill said we use birth
certificate Riley Gaines went on the
internet and said that we can't do that
so we took the the the the the birth
certificate out right there is the form
you can't really see it very good but if
you go to the next slide it asks you a
bunch of
questions and then this is the form that
you actually turn in nowhere on that
form does it say what your gender is
nowhere on that Forum does it say what
your sex
is so think about this how will we
verify a students sex when it comes to
competition and so what I'm going to ask
you to do is I know people are going to
vote no I know people will vote Yes
those of that that do vote Yes I ask
when it goes to the Senate you fix this
one
part lines 136
says that nothing in this section shall
be construed to authorize a covered
entity or an athletic association to
verify or confirm a student's sex
through visual
inspection and then it goes on to say we
can rely on medical records but as you
see you don't have it on the medical
records or other standard medical
procedures to verify cons student
sex so let's say we're going to the
championship game my 12-year-old
competes my 13-year-old competes in high
school she she's at halftime someone CH
challenges her and said that is a male
that is a male we need to verify who's
going to go in the locker room there is
no protections for children in this bill
to say that an adult has to be present
when they physically inspect a child
there is no protection in this bill at
all so you were going to send a
child that wants to
compete and I'm asking for the Larry
Nasser Amendment right now and when I
say Larry Nasser amendment that means
that there was the coach of the Olympic
team actually he was a he was a doctor
he was a doctor you he went 20 years
abusing children because these
13-year-olds wanted to compete in the
Olympics and they thought that it was
okay for a man to put them in a position
that they had no opportunity to fight
back CU they wanted to
compete we are going to do this to
children every day there are kids on the
field that they think it's unfair
they're going to be in the state
championship and you're going to look at
the other child and you're going to say
that is a boy and then what's going to
happen at the end at halftime the coach
is going to go in there and look at my
child I wish someone would come home and
say my child my daughter had some coach
looking at them it's going to be a fight
now how many of you men agree with me
that's going to be that's going to be a
challenge so what I'm asking you to do
is when this goes to the Senate I don't
care how you vote don't put children in
the position where they have to say no
to a grown
man think about that don't put your
young daughters in a position where they
have to stand up to a man that is bigger
that is taller that is stronger that has
more authority over they do because they
want to play a sport that they love
they're not concerned about about a
transgender athlete they're concerned
about someone touching them someone
attacking them because they have the
power to do it there are many other
examples you have male wrestlers who
couldn't stand up to a wrestling coach
so you telling me I ask as this bill
moves take it to the Senate let them
amend it send it back you all agree you
pass the bill we do what's already in
law which bans people from feeding sex
that is not the one they're born with
that is all that I ask anybody that's
ever sat in the education committee
knows that whether I like a bill whether
I dislike a bill I'm going to try to do
what's best for our children and that's
what I'm doing right now is this is a
dangerous bill it's not just a bad Bill
it's a dangerous bill because we're
going to put young ladies at risk and
with that I yield the well Mr
Speaker gentleman has yielded the well
representative drenner has recognized to
speak to the bill representating
Jena oh man do you all to see baby Jesus
down
here that's
perfect thank you
Mr thank you Mr
Speaker I had two separate speeches
prepared today and so I'm going to go
back and forth between the two of
them so I rise today in strong
opposition to Senate bill one a bill
that claims to protect fairness and
safety but instead singles out
transgendered kids for
discrimination let's be
clear this is not about fairness this is
not about safety and this is about
politics across the country we've seen a
wave of
legislation just like Cil one bill
that use trans kids as political
scapegoats to distract from real issues
like underfunded schools gun violence
and the lack of Mental Health
Resources this is a manufactured crisis
designed not to solve a real problem but
to create Division and
fear we have seen this Playbook before
the same arguments were used against
racial integration in school RS against
women competing in sports and against
same-sex marriage now transgendered
youth are the largest or the latest
Target we must reject this attempt to
turn children into a political
Battleground and instead focus on real
solutions that support all
students so let's take a moment to
examine the real effects of this bill by
addressing the arguments its supporters
have put forth number one supporters of
sb1 claim it's a about protecting
women's
sports but where's the evidence of a
crisis transgendered athletes make up a
tiny fraction of
participants National and state
organizations already have Fair
competition policies in place if
fairness were really the goal we'd be
talking about unequal pay and funding
for women Athletics disparities in
scholarships and coaching
opportunities the real threats to women
in sports like sexual harassment and
abuse sb1 does nothing to address these
problems instead it targets a small
group of students to score political
points now no one on my side
has taken a moment to talk about Riley
Gaines and I would like to do that Riley
gains publicly has shared her experience
against Leah
Thomas and I want to say
clearly to
Riley I empathize with your
frustration competing at the highest
level is a huge
accomplishment and it's understandable
that you would be
upset and that you felt that the playing
field was not level and if I was your
mother I would have been mad
too but you know
what we fixed
that we fixed
that the Georgia High School Association
fix
that this
bill athle
Association
however One race one event does not
justify legislation that impacts
thousands of
children her experience your experience
Riley I listened to
you and when you said woke liberal
agenda I had to stop I don't know what
woke me just like I didn't know what OG
meant I woke every morning so I was
confused about that
expression your experience is being used
to create fear and justify policies that
are going to hurt lots of other people
including transgender kids who are
trying to find their place in this world
Ry gain's story is valid but it's being
politicized and it does not repres
present the larger issue we cannot craft
a policy based on isolated cases
especially when the cost is Banning an
entire group of kids from participating
in sports we need to focus on solutions
that support all athletes not just those
who fit a specific narrative this bill
doesn't solve the fairness this bill
doesn't solve the fairness issues in
women's Sports it's about creating fear
and dividing us further another argument
that we've heard is that allowing
transgendered students to use
appropriate facilities threatens privacy
or
safety but the facts do not support this
claim there is no evidence that
transgender students using the restroom
or locker room that aligns with their
gender identity leads to increase in
harm
schools already have the flexibility to
make accommodations for all students
without this government
overreach let's not forget women were
once told they couldn't share locker
rooms with black athletes they were once
told that allowing them into sports
would ruin
Athletics these same Scare Tactics are
being used again just with new targets
sb1 doesn't protect privacy it creates a
culture of fear and exclusion I usion
proponents of this bill say that biology
alone should determine Sports
participation but this argument is
overly simplistic and selectively
applied we don't ban cisgender female
athletes who naturally have higher
testosterone levels we don't exclude
students with genetic advantages like
height wingspan or lung capacity we
allow student athletes of different
sizes strengths and abilities to compete
every day sports are about skill
training and discipline not just
biology this bill cherry-picks science
to justify discrimination while ignoring
the complexity of human
biology Title Nine was meant to expand
opportunities for women not to exclude
transgender girls if we truly want to
protect women's sports we should be
fighting for Equal Pay ensuring equal
funding for women's programs and
protecting athletes from H harassment
and abuse s sp1 does none of these
things because it's not about women's
sports it's about creating a political
wedge
issue some people argue that polls show
public support for for Banning trans
kids from sports or locker rooms but we
must
remember public opinion wants oppose
racial integration in schools and
sports public opinion once oppose women
from playing contact Sports heck public
opinion used to say women couldn't even
vote Justice is not determined by
polling numbers laws should be based on
fairness evidence and equality not fear
or political
Trends
sb1 does none of those
things instead it manufactures a problem
creates Division and makes transgendered
students less
safe in
conclusion let's call this bill what it
is a political
distraction a manufactured culture War a
harmful policy that makes life harder
for transgendered
kids it's not about fairness it's not
about
safety this is really about using
children as ponds in a political game I
urge you to vote no on S sp1
let's focus on real solutions for
fairness privacy and safety not
government mandated
discrimination thank you Mr Speaker I
yield the
well thank you the lady has yielded the
well now we'll have up to 20 minutes for
chair's time we're recognized the
chairman of the committee from which it
came the education committee chairman
Irwin is recognized to speak to
sb1 thank you Mr Speaker and colleagues
I rise today in strong support of the
Riley gains Act of
2025 a measure rooted in the fundamental
beliefs that
fairness safety and integrity in school
and Collegiate Sports must be preserved
for all student athletes across Georgia
the bill affirms that athletic comp or
athletic competition should be based on
clear biological standards ensuring that
female athletes who have historically
fought for Equal Opportunity are not
denied the right to compete on a
leveling playing field the rally gains
act requires our public and
participating private schools as well as
postsecondary institutions to designate
sports teams as male female or co-ed
based solely on biological sex it
prohibits male from competing in female
sports thereby protecting the
competitive balance and physical safety
that women's sports depend upon at the
same time it provides for limited
exceptions where no female team is
available and ensures co-ed teams remain
accessible to all
students this legislation does not
Target
individuals it targets
inequities it safeguards the decades a
progress made in women's Athletics by
reaffirming the state's interest in
promoting equal opportunity and pro
preventing unfair
advantages the bill also respects
privacy by ensuring that shared
facilities used during competitions such
as locker rooms restrooms and sleeping
quarters are designated and used
according to biological
sex while still offering reasonable
accommodations for all students
the Riley gains act includes a robust
enforcement and grievance mechanism
students who are deprived of
opportunities or face retaliation have a
clear path to seek
redress this is not just a policy of
protection is a declaration of
fairness safety and
transparency in Georgia Sports
colleagues this bill speaks to the heart
of athletic integrity
it is about ensuring that every child
regardless of gender has a chance to
compete safely and fairly and that the
hard one victories for female athletes
are not
erased I urge your favorable
consideration of the Riley gains act let
us stand for fairness let us stand for
safety let us stand for
opportunity Mr Speaker I'm going to
yield the remaining of the uh Chairman's
time to the the gentleman that is
carrying the bill if you would allow
me that's the
Chairman's
right still has time on on his 20
minutes he's uh relinquished his time to
Chairman Bonner representative Bonner
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues uh we
have heard some outrageous claims from
this well personal attacks perversions
of scripture mistruths and just Flatout
lies so let me boil down the issue
biological males have an inherent
physiological
Advantage allowing that advantage on the
field places females at risk let me
highlight this with a personal story two
years ago at my daughter's high school
she shared a class with a boy pretending
to be a girl my daughter's he believed
that my daughter's friend misgendered
him and so after class that boy
pretending to be a girl
jumped my daughter's friend put her on
the ground and beat her mercely without
Mercy time and time again the female
teacher couldn't even pull this boy off
of her it took four individuals to pull
this boy off of my daughter's friend as
he pounded her head time and time again
so don't tell me there is no
Advantage for a biological male on an
athletic
field a yes vote provides a necessary
protections for my daughter and
thousands of other female athletes in
Georgia as for walking on this vote I
don't know about your constituents but
mine sent me here to know where I
stand I'm asking each of you to stand
with me and the overwhelming majority of
Georgians that support keeping
biological males out of girl Sports and
vote yes thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the
well gentleman has yielded the well that
complete
all those speaking in favor the
presentation those in favor of and those

representative
oin thank you Mr Speaker this is Senate

170 what this bill does you've already
passed it unanimously 173 to nothing
this bill is um an emergency
preparedness bill it will allow us to
establish a grant for Rural hospitals
that were affected by the
storm to be able to gain the money that
they need to get generators to increase
our capacities for generators in the
hospitals and this will give them
improvements that will position our
state to withstand future disasters I'll
stand for
questions lady has a question
representative part Canon to your left
is recognized for a question do you do
you want to speak or you have a question
you're signed up to speak sir yes sir I
have a question okay the ladies
recognize for a question thank you Mr
Speaker do you yield I do awesome um so
with this grant program how long will
this grant program run how is the
funding coming and how will it be
reported to the general assembly so we
do have a fiscal note on that um it is
going to be overseen by the by gima and
Homeland Security and the appro it it
will last as long as there are
Appropriations for it okay so a further
inquiry there is a fiscal note to the
amount of to the amount of we're not
sure this is
exact think I don't think
that do do members have a copy of that
on our
desks no we have a fiscal note if we
need it is that fair chair okay
I've already asked the I'm not trying to
ask the question again but I subject to
appropriation I think would be the
answer to that correct thank you Mr
Speaker subject to
Appropriations okay and then the final
question I had already asked you before
which is how will this be reported back
to the general assembly I don't see any
language here on how it will be reported
back to the general
assembly I have no idea when when the
funds are exhausted then that that will
be the end of the
program lady has no further questions
thank you Mr Speaker I askit minute lady
does have a question excuse me
representative rice to your left is
recognized for a question thank you Mr
Speaker does a gentle lady yeld I do is
it not true that by prioritizing
hospitals lacking any existing backup
power this bill strategically directs
resources to the greatest area of need
absolutely thank you so much for saying
that if you had been where I had and you
saw fire department with a Bucket
Brigade flushing toilets and bringing up
water for PE for nurses to wash their
hands youd understand why we need it
thank you so much representative Butner
to your left about Midway back is
recognized for a question uh does the
gentleman gentle lady yield excuse me
all right I I'm very familiar with your
bill and how important it is and very
supportive of it I also have people back
home that are interested in the homeless
Council and I'm I'm having trouble
finding where that is in the bill
now I'm not
sure this is a substitute it was
stripped and put this in there that's
the only thing that I can tell you the
gone I think that's the case thank you
majority extration has one last question
final question yes sir thank you Mr
Speaker General lady yield I do to my
friend ma'am is it not true that this
legislation it's the exact same text as
House Bill 262 I believe that we
previously passed 173 to Zer and that U
no fiscal node necessary because it's
subject to appropriation or other Grant
that's to be received and obviously the
general assembly would be able to follow
that because appropriation would be
necessary for this critical measure to
provide generators at rural hospitals
which we saw were so very critical after
Hurricane Helen is I appreciate you
saying that Mr later better than I could
have thank you so much I'll yield the
whale ladies yield of the whale
representative Park Cannon is recognized
to speak to the bill representative
Canon thank you Mr Speaker I'm here to
speak in favor of this measure um
because we can have questions on the
bill and we can still support it um the
first thing that I just want to be
really clear on is the practice of us
Ling legislation one way or the other
and then saying the like hurricane word
we have to do this because of the
hurricane we have to do this because the
hurricane because of the tornado because
of the storm many of
us are better policy makers in that many
of us have spent time getting National
research on a number of issues and so
it's interesting again to see a really
great bill um the original information
in 170 be completely stripped out and
now we're rushing to the Finish Line on
backup generators for hospitals um so
I'm here to speak in support of really
both of the pieces of legislation and
wanted to just remind folks why 170 was
so important before the big scary word
came in um to which we've been told a
fiscal
note is that necessary because it's
subject to appropriation I think there
are many of us who would say that we
have bills that will be subject to
appropriation and we are mandated to
have a fiscal note to even get a hearing
and then even at a hearing when we have
that fiscal note it's we're told it's
too much or it's too little so I just
wish we would be more transparent with
how much this will be but for the
original bill which would have
recognized that housing is a fundamental
human right and would have United
important stakeholders like government
organizations and service providers
housing Specialists and Advocates to
create an
all-encompassing long-term solution to
homelessness in our state we must
acknowledge that in 2024 about 12,000
individuals on any night are homeless
52% of the homeless population consider
themselves unsheltered meaning they
don't have anything to um sleep under
there has been been a 4.4% increase in
homelessness from 2020 to 2022 and
African-Americans make up 21% of
Georgia's population but 58% of the
homeless population it's important that
we work together as Fearless caring
leadership to put resources towards them
I hope that we will see this bill in its
original version please consider voting
for it as it is today thank you Mr
Speaker I yel the well
ladies yeld the well that concludes our
conversation so far on
sb170 that concludes our comments on
sb170 is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered hearing
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair hears
none committee substitute is adopted is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
hearing none the report of the committee
is agreed to shall this bill now pass
all in favor of the passage of the bill
we'll vote Yes all those opposed we'll
vote no and Mr clerk will you unlock the
machine
have all members
voted for what purposes represent Al
rise I'm sorry I missed you earlier
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
isn't it true that by OSHA standards all
hospitals have to have emergency
generators
already I'm sure the lady is very
knowledge
about health
care for what purposes representative
Martin
rise parliamentary inquir State your
inquir uh isn't it true Mr Speaker to
the uh last speaker's comments on fiscal
notes isn't it true that fiscal notes
are necessary when we're passing laws
that have a statutory requirement on
this body that we don't then look at or
are not subject to Appropriations or
cause us to have a mandate of a spending
process to either reduce Revenue or a
spending process those require fiscal
notes and by its very definition isn't
it true Mr Speaker when in the bill it
says subject to Appropriations that
brings it back before this body and that
is why fiscal note is not required as
the speaker communicated I know the
gentleman knows of what he speaks for
what purpose does repres Sam Park rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry Sir
Mr Speaker is it not true that while I
greatly support the underlying
legislation I do not support the fact
that we have stripped the Senate
Democratic whips legislation regarding
homelessness and that both pieces of
legislation could have otherwise moved
forward but it is not I'm sure the
gentleman firmly believes what he
speaks sometimes the process is
difficult have all members
voted all members voted if so Mr clerk
will you lock the machine on the passage
of Senate Bill 170 the Ys are 165 the
Nays are three this bill hav the
requisite constitutional majority is
therefore
passed Mr clerk will you read the

authorization and support Act of 2025
this bill having referred to the
committee on education that committee
recommends this bill do pass by
committee
substitute chairman Scott Hilton is
recognized to present Senate Bill 82
representative Hilton thank you Mr
Speaker I Rise this afternoon to present
Senate Bill 82 which is a common sense
compromise bill that passed the Senate
with strong bipartisan support including
a majority of both Republicans and
Democrats voting yes yes C Bill 82
addresses the state's Charter School
access issue by incentivizing local
school districts to approve more charter
schools and holding districts
accountable if they repeatedly deny high
quality Charter petitions in Georgia how
we approve local Charter Schools is out
of balance with how most Charters are
approved in most every other state with
new approvals resting almost entirely
with the state rather than the local
system in this way Georgia is an outlier
nationally 90% of charter schools are
authorized locally and 10% are approved
at the state level Georgia is basically
the inverse of these figures in the past
5 years alone only one charter school
was approved by a local school district
in Georgia during that same period the
state Charter School commission approved
over 30 schools most of which were
initially denied
locally so what is the result of this
broken process of the nation's 10 most
populous states Georgia ranks dead last
in Charter School access nationally 7%
of K through2 students attend a charter
school compared to 3.5 or half of that
number of K12 students in Georgia in
developing Senate Bill 82 we partnered
closely with the Department of Education
Georgia school superintendent
Association the Georgia School Board
Association and I'm grateful for their
input and support on this
legislation I'll walk you briefly
through the bill itself on section three
we provide more transparency by
requiring the local boards to provide
disclosure around why the denial the
rationale of the denial and that has to
be provided within 20 business days we
then provide District accountability so
for districts between 10,000 and 6,000
students if a district denies two or
more charter schools that are Subs
quently approved by the state the local
district is not eligible to renew its
flexibility contract this changes to
three or more for schools serving over
60,000
students section four of the bill
provides an incentive to school systems
who approved Charters local locally
approved charters of 250,000 annually
for 3 years up to
$750,000 section five provides State
support for locals who are seeking to
approve a locally approved Charter
School
there is a Minority Report on cill 82
and my wife typically tells me not to
read those as they're bad for my health
but I do want to address some of the
points raised in the
report first and foremost let me dispel
a common misconception as it relates to
Charter Schools charter schools are
public
schools let me repeat that charter
schools are public schools the only
difference is that they receive less
funding typically perform at higher
rates and have higher
accountability the second sentence of
the mon report Praises exactly what this
bill aims to achieve local school
districts best understand the needs of
their students and their
communities we believe this to be
wholeheartedly true which is why Senate
Bill 82 puts in place incentives to
encourage more local
approvals financially charter schools
are responsible for the capital outlay
for a new school in fact all charter
school systems schools in a system have
a funding holdback of 3% to pay for new
schools just three years ago this body
passed a bill which creates additional
dedicated funding weight for all
students enrolled in local Charters so
the districts are pulling more money
from the state to offset costs in this
bill in this bill school systems can
receive
$750,000 and additional funding when
approving a new
school the data is Crystal Clear among
the state authorized charter schools 85%
of those schools outperform surrounding
schools in their area in academic
Mastery or growth on Georgia Milestone
assessments there's going to be a lot of
talk about local
control but let me emphasize this local
control doesn't start with the local
school system it starts with the parents
parents are the ultimate measure of
local control and the parents have
clearly spoken Georgia has over 21,000
students on a wait list to attend a
Georgia charter school please join me in
voting yes on this Common Sense
bipartisan measure thank you Mr Speaker
I will yield for questions gentleman has
a number of questions and we have
speakers I'm going to uh recognize
representative um representative let's
see got a Roman I guess she has had a
question in the last 5 or 10 minutes
representative ran is recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker I can't do
parliamentary inquiries so I got to make
myself do around here but um does it
gentleman yield yes um so you had
mentioned this bill has some bipartisan
support but wouldn't you say that part
of the reason that we are a bamal state
is to allow for more vetting of bills so
sometimes when one body doesn't catch
some things it is our job to
unfortunately fix those
problems sure I don't know if that's a
question but uh would you agree with
that sentiment I agree that the house
generally does a fantastic job of
improving cability
correct gentleman Yi representative
Kelly to your left has recognized for a
question speaker with the gentleman
yield yes sir representative isn't it
true that you mentioned the 21,000
children on the weight list now but
isn't that drastically up in recent
years where it was just 14,000 just a
few years ago so we're seeing dramatic
increases in children wanting to come in
the Charter system it is I for me
standing here in this well again my
ultimate measure of local control is the
parents and the parents have spoken with
their feet and they are saying we
believe and trust in charter schools
we'd like that as an option for our
children and my posture is we need to
give those parents and those families
that choice and so um absolutely let's
open the doors let's not keep it closed
to 21,000 students in our state thank
you representative
Bernell to your left is recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker with a
gentleman y yes is it not true that when
a student goes to a charter school the
mon money that is at the current public
school goes with
them the money stays within the local
system yes it goes to that charter
school with the student correct Money
Follows the student yes okay can I ask
you another question sure okay so is it
not true that se uh Charter Schools fail
because of lack of funding is that not
true well Charter Schools like any
schools fail for a number of reasons uh
funding being one of them the beauty of
a charter school unlike a traditional
public school is if a charter school is
failing we close it uh it is it has the
ultimate accountability measure that
really a traditional public school does
not
have can I ask you one more question one
more yes ma'am okay I'm from Detroit and
uh Charter Schools came into Detroit and
they D they destroyed the entire Detroit
public
schools well that's why we live in the
great state of Georgia
Mr Speaker I know the gentleman has
another question if you'll take one more
to kind of yes sir one more and that's
um representative Town said to your
right down to Center is recognized for a
question this gentleman yield it's my
fellow education Committee Member yes
sir isn't I too I ran a charge school
for approximately 10 years in brunic
Georgia very successful school because
the teacher and staff we got appropriate
school funding from local and state
funding and actually Federal funding as
well that school is still doing well
turning out students who are going to
help us with this Workforce Development
problem that we're have in the state of
Georgia so charge schools are effective
if it's run effectively you're exactly
right charter schools are public schools
who turn out the brightest Minds in our
state and with that Mr Speaker I ask
your favorable consideration on Senate
Bill 82 and I yield the well thank you
gentlemen yielded the well we have
um three speakers on the bill I'm going
to limit y'all to five minutes each up
to five minutes each representative Lisa
Campbell is recognized to speak to the
bill then representative beckles then
representative Williams ladies
recognized we'll give the lady if the
lady will suspend just for a
minute thank you Mr Speaker
proceed today my colleagues I rise in
opposition strong opposition to SP sp82
a bill that is in direct opposition to
the original intention of charter
schools this bill erodes local control
in school boards across our state and
most importantly will further defund our
Public
Schools this bill uses Financial
incentives I'm not sure I've seen this
before in our Public
Schools it's akin to other types of
financial deals that are Unworthy of
this
body sometimes called payoffs or
kickbacks for local school boards to
approve Charter Schools it's a punitive
bill that penalizes elected school board
members that deny petitions that are
later approved by the state and it
imposes new oversight and Reporting
obligations on local districts remember
this later when these same sponsors talk
about rolling back and getting rid of
and necessary
rules yes Charter Schools historically
have been an option in our Public School
System but this bill is about align
allowing private
schools organizers who want to introduce
religious private
curriculum into our public school system
and use our public tax dollars this new
Charter School initiative is not the old
charter schools that you may be familiar
with the bottom line this is yet another
bill that undermines local control of
our Public School Systems it threatens
and pressures School boards to approve
Charter School applications against
their best judgment these are elected
officials who have been asked to look at
Charter Schools applying and are denying
them for very legitimate reasons this
bill takes their elected responsibility
away
completely and not only does it usurp
their elected responsibilities but it
pressures them to approve Charter School
applications and lays the groundwork for
increased privatization of all all of
our Public Schools this is cloaked in a
ton of language about Innovation and
choice but this bill ties funding and
flexibility to the expansion of State
preferred Charter options and threatens
consequences for school districts who
choose differently based on the needs in
their school
district I can tell you about a charter
school in our
district it was denied at the local
level but approved at the state level I
can tell you about this charter school
that trains its teachers and its
curriculum comes from Project
1776 what we now know to be project 2025
it is publicly known and our public tax
dollars are going to support these
schools this particular organization is
called Hillsdale and they are on record
with a very strategic approach to take
legislatures like ours and essentially
trick them into talking about choice for
parents
but I want to set the record straight
what these private extreme far-right
religious organizations are doing is not
right and we should
not fall into this trap of seeing the
name of a bill labeled one thing but in
actuality in reality stripping our tax
dollars from our Public School Systems
and in addition to the federal cuts the
dismantling of our federal department of
education the growth expansion of our
voucher bill that now allows 2third of
our students in Georgia to opt out of
public education do not act like you
supports public schools and sponsor and
say yes to this bill this bill is just
one more way to demonize our local
teachers to defund our public schools
and ultimately dismantle our Public
Schools this bill creates a loss of
local control its Charter expansion by a
coercion its backdoor
privatization and it Fosters unfed
unfunded mandates and bureaucratic
burdens ultimately it undermines public
school cohesion and
planning this bill has been framed as
providing school choice but once again
it does nothing to address the proven
and underlying causes of academic
struggle
poverty we've spent zero minutes in this
chamber talking about the ways to
actually help our children I urge you
all to vote no for this destructive Bill
thank you and I yield The
Well the lady has yielded the well
representative
beckles is recognized to speak to the
bill representative
beckles thank you Mr Speaker colleagues
I rise today with concerns about Senate
Bill
82 this bill undermines local control of
our schools it threatens to punish boys
for revoking their Charter system and it
denies Charter petitions later approved
by the state the financial impact is
troubling this bill commits 250,000 per
year for three years for each new T of
school that's
$750,000 per
school with our existing schools already
struggling for funding teacher pay and
building repairs can can we afford this
additional
expense this bill even admits
insufficient money saying grants will be
reduced if funds run
short let's be clear What's Happening
Here we are bribing our school districts
to approve Charter Schools while
threatening
penalties imagine a school board that
reviews a charter petition and finds
legitimate problems with it under this
bill they must either approve prove it
despite their concerns our risk
penalties is that how we want decisions
about our schools um our children's
education this bill also creates our
necessary
paperwork School boards must provide
detailed written statements within 20
days when denying a petition this
creates more administrative work for
already overloaded school systems
my most concern is how this bill treats
Charter Schools differently than
traditional Public
Schools while we demand strict
accountability for our Public Schools
this bill focusing on only creating more
Charter Schools without giving equal
attention to their
quality I for one believe in Innovation
and choice in
education however the real Choice comes
from Community needs not State
pressure this this bill represents a
dangerous shift from local control
towards the state overriding local
decisions I urge you to vote against
Senate Bill 82 and instead work on real
reforms that respect local governance
while improving education for all of
Georgia's students thank you Mr Speaker
I yeld the
well lady as you of the well
representative Williams has recognized
to speak the bill representative
Williams thank you Mr
Speaker I rise in opposition to S sp82
but for a little different reasons it's
not all bad there are a lot of good
points in this bill some of you will
remember several years ago I was talking
about a bill and I describe I said no
matter what you do with a
skunk if you spray it with Chanel Number
Five when it wears off is still a
skunk this is a skunk and skunks have
good use too they keep Ving down and you
can make a cap out of them but but it's
still a
skunk and local control
when I came to this these August halls
in
1975 lieutenant governor the Holy
Grail was loc local control that was the
Holy
Grail
now I don't know whether it was into
Annie Smith or who but somebody stole
the Grail it's no longer a big thing and
we talk about the distinguished
gentleman sponsored this bill whom I
have great respect for talks about the
people are saying this come on folk if
you listen to the people and here we
have voted on gaming 82% of the folks
said let us vote but of course who are
they but voters who you will go home and
lay another car game on because you
decided they didn't know anything now
all of a sudden For the Love of the
voter we're going to save you again your
saving is very painful I went through a
terrible episode a couple of weeks
I had an upper respiratory infection and
thank Dr Newton for saving my life
because the Cure like to kill me the
antibiotics were awful this cure will
kill public education eventually and
that's the real
purpose because when local control was
in place and local control was the local
control we wanted it was fine
but as demographics
changed local control became a bad
word you're taking money out of public
education when some teachers are having
to buy
supplies to help the children because
they don't have the money the school
system does not supply what they need
they go in their pockets but you've got
money to build another chart at school
and there are several very very
successful charter schools in Georgia
that were set up by
locals a lot of
successful it's worked most of you in
here products of public schools now all
of a sudden it's
demonic nothing wrong with Public
Schools something wrong is how we treat
them but don't let this skunk get out
the cage cuz you can't put him back in
one thing about a skunk he squirts
everywhere he goes and you know he's
been there and we about to turn him a
loose on public education again let's
don't do that let's don't do it this is
and and it also you remember back in the
day when Muhammad Ali beat George
Foreman he beat him with the Rope a doe
he pretended to be being hit and he just
ducked and did the Rope a doe this is a
Rope A Dope a rope a doe this is a
pretend to help you but I don't plan on
helping you I'm plan on building some
schools where poy and boo boos neighbors
ain't going to look the same in the very
near future don't do this to public
education it's an assault on public
education and please call it what it is
don't give it a fancy name say this is a
we don't like public education Bill call
it that cuz that's what it's all about
is not about anything else let's fund
public
education and then we can
stop bragging one day if we concentrate
on public education about being the best
state to do business and say we're the
best state to do business and the best
state to get an education in let's do it
like that I talked a little longer than
I wanted to but I know the speaker
wanted to hear what I had to say with
that Mr Speaker I yield the well
I'm glad you feeling
better is there any objection to the
previous question in order
heing none the previous question is
ordered we now have a minority report
for up to 20 minutes and the Chairman's
time for up to 20 minutes I'm going to
recognize whip Sam park for the first
comments whip Park you're going to
manage help everyone manage your time
sir thank you very much whip Park is
recognized hold it suspend just for a
minute gentlemen
if any conversations need to go into the
any rooms that' be the appropriate thing
to
do whip Park recognized to speak to
sb82 thank you Mr Speaker uh I rise in
opposition to
sb82 now you know I I know there have
been strong comments against um this
piece of legislation uh but you know for
the most part you know I'm open to the
idea uh publicly funded Charter Schools
especially if they're able to provide
Innovative quality programming
provided that they are formed with the
approval of local Boards of Education
because they are under the governance of
those local school boards so let me just
highlight some concerns with uh SP sp82
which I do appreciate uh has been
improved uh but I think these are
concerns also shared uh with others
including possibly uh the Georgia School
Board Association so let's begin first
on lines 104 to 142 uh these lines
provide for a punishment of loss of a
District's flexibility contract for
school districts with 10,000 students
and above uh this currently applies to
38 districts using the October 24 count
this punishment not only usurps local
control of those Constitution elected
local school boards but it also does not
encourage collaboration between a local
Charter petitioner and the district
there is a fundamental difference
between a state Charter and a local
Charter a state Charter is an individual
Standalone entity a local Charter is
part of a school system and the Georgia
Constitution empowers School boards to
be in control which this legislation
undermines
local school boards approve or deny
charters for various reasons common
considerations include that a local
Charter must be academically successful
and fiscally sound a local Charter must
fit in with the school district's
Mission strategic plan and goals there
must be a high level of trust in the
management and operations of the local
Charter and that a local Charter should
otherwise fulfill unique needs that's
the first concern second on lines 155 to
174 these lines provide for a
$250,000 incentive for 3 years on August
1st this is subject to Appropriations by
the legislature and can be reduced
proportionally so the incentive grants
are not guaranteed which makes planning
which makes budget planning challenging
for local districts so while there is a
carrot if you want to call it a carrot
in here it is much smaller than the
stick especially when the incentive
grants are not otherwise guaranted
and so again I I appreciate the intent
of the bill uh but I I do not think that
the bill is yet perfect I think a lot of
work still has to happen in order to
ensure that we are respecting the
Georgia state constitution with respect
to local control of locally approved
Charter Schools as opposed to forcing
local CH or local school districts to
accept these Charter Schools uh by
threatening local school boards by
removing their flexibility which
certainly does also have financial
implications uh so for all those reasons
I encourage members uh to vote no to
Senate Bill 82 with the understanding
that the bill is not yet perfect uh
hopefully we can come back around uh you
know sometime before the end of the bium
to continue uh the work to really ensure
that this is a bipartisan piece of
legislation and really takes into
consideration especially the impact on
local school districts uh so with all of
that said Mr Speaker I will now yield a
portion of my time to representative
Jasmine Clark and then Karen Lupton uh
for the remainder of the minority Port
thank you Mr Speaker y the wh gentleman
as Yoda D wh represent Jasmine Clark is
recognized to speak to the bill
represented
Clark thank you Mr speaker thank you
colleagues um so today I Rise with some
strong concerns about s SP 82 and I know
it has been mentioned a couple of times
but I really want to hone in on lines
148 through 165 of this bill and I
specifically want to hone in on lines
159 through
162 in the event that available
Appropriations are not sufficient to
cover the total amount of such incentive
grants provided for in this subsection
the amount of each sub Grant shall be
reduced proportionally providing
incentive grants and equal amounts to
each such local Board of
Education in other words we are making
promises that we not we may not be able
to keep and I think that that is bad
policy it cost millions of dollars some
estimate about $4
million to start a new charter
school we are only promising a very
small fraction of that initial startup
cost even if we were uh promising even
if we were able to keep our promise
we're basically saying we'll give you
about
750k of millions of
dollars but the problem is we have
written a
um a a a way to back out of that promise
we are telling them you have to do this
and we'll give you money to do it but if
we don't have enough money you may not
get to this is kind of like offering a
reward and then when you uh go and say
all right I'm ready to receive the
reward that you said you were going to
give me you say oh well my bank account
is empty so can't give it to you now
that's a problem and again that is bad
policy and that is why I am asking you
all to vote no on this bill if we are
going to threaten people with penalties
for not um approving these
Charters then we at least need to
promise them that we're going to keep
our end of the bargain thank you Mr
Speaker a y the well
representative lton I'm sorry I could I
didn't see you right
now my bad ladies recognized it's it's
all right Mr speaker thank you we need
to get an Apple box down here or
something um colleagues I rise today in
opposition of to
sb82 um because I think that sb82 seeks
to undermine the authority of our local
elected School boards um I'm very
fortunate to know many of the uh
Commissioners on our decab Board of uh
school board and they work too hard to
get elected and work too hard to try to
make great decisions for our kids um for
their decisions about what's best for
decab County Schools to be overridden by
the state um especially with the
language and attit do bills have
attitudes I think bills can have
attitudes um as my previous um colleague
spoke that these um carrots that we're
offering are not
guaranteed and although you look at the
dollar amount and you think hey what
school wouldn't take
$250,000 a year for three years like
come on guys wouldn't you do it the
money in lines 166 to 170 the money
clearly says this should just be spent
by local school boards to get more
Charter Schools you know you can hire an
admin you can get some real you know get
some better evaluators but it all has to
be spent making and sustaining more
Charter Schools it's not like you get
money for an Innovative writing program
or something like that you that's not
the way this bill is written um and what
you're taking away from them is some of
the ways that our Public Schools try to
be try to meet specialized needs and try
to be Innovative which is those waivers
those local waivers they say hey we get
it State you need us to do this but
actually we have some different needs in
our district can we use this money for
this that's a great way that public
schools can be flexible but you want to
threaten to take that away if they don't
give you the charter schools that the
state wants the state can make Charter
Schools if the state would like Charter
Schools the state can get charter
schools but I trust my local District to
understand especially the budget in our
school in my school district to
understand whether that can be the best
answer for
us call me stupid but I just trust the
people that I elected that I help that
we um trust to run our Public Schools um
now over 30 this is just a real rough
estimate I counted you know going
through our our uh the legislative
website I counted just about over 30 uh
principally Democratic bills relating to
State education public education we're
trying to cover everything from school
safety we're trying to cover feeding
kids at school we're talking about
revamping the QBE based on what was what
was uh suggested in 2015 after a big
state committee um we're talking about
appropriating money for more Mental
Health Providers we're talking about we
saw we heard a bill here about
Innovative writing programs like right
we passed it through here those are over
30 principally Democratic bills that
attend to the needs of our public
schools are we hearing any of them right
now no we're talking about siphoning off
more money from public schools to give
them to
Charters um now our education
subcommittee our education committee um
I'm I really am proud of the work that
we did um under the leadership of our
chair um he when he called us into order
for the first very first committee
meeting he said that we have
two two primary goals one is safety and
one is literacy and boy we have been
attacking literacy we have come up with
some great ideas and we're making a push
we're throwing our legislative weight
behind changes to literacy to make a
difference in every Public School in
Georgia I feel
like at well this bill doesn't have
anything to do with safety it doesn't
have anything to do with
literacy what I feel like we could do is
that if
we put our legislative might
to making Georgia's public
schools Second To
None we could do that if we put our mind
to it would it be difficult yes we're
not scared of hard work instead of
siphoning off a couple couple's kids
here couple kids here giving them more
money per student more less students per
teacher boy if we only we could make our
Public Schools the xanado do that some
Charter schools claim to be now I have a
great Charter actually in my district
it's called the PATH Academy and it um
serves mostly Latino kids um with
Spanish speaking parents they have a
wonderful atmosphere they're
great they're not meeting their academic
standards so they are being held to an
accountability they are having um some
issues but what we need more than
threats and more
what's the word I'm searching
for more um layer of Bureau of
bureaucracy at our Public Schools I'm
interested in trying to take a burden
off of our Public Schools so that they
can be free to do what what else we're
asking them to like change their
literacy and do many other important
things in the classroom for millions and
millions of kids um I'm proud of the the
bills that my fellow Democrats have um
have dropped and you know some of them
have have been uh bipartisan but um this
bill oh hold
on yeah we should be making it easier
for our local school districts to focus
on the special needs that they have for
their for their students if we can get
them the care and the training and the
schooling that they need where they live
even better and we can do that we have
the tools to do that we have not the
will yet but I hope that we that I hope
that we can develop that um this this
legislation is primarily about uh
focusing um forcing a specific political
agenda onto local communities once as
another gentleman said our local
communities aren't doing what the state
wants them to do uh regardless of the
voter's
wishes it's s sp82 fails to address the
larger more pressing issues in Georgia
Georgia's public education system our
Public Schools need increased
investments in teachers infrastructure
and student Support Services they need
smaller class sizes they need
competitive salaries to attract and
retain highquality Educators they need
adequate resources for students with
special
needs instead of focusing on these
critical issues SBA 8 2 diverts
attention and funding away from some of
those very beneficial policies at the
benefit of a few and the expense of the
majority I talk with my hands a whole
lot additionally this bill forces local
school districs to stretch their already
limited budgets even further so when a
new charter school is approved it
doesn't just receive funding it siphons
money away from the local public school
that's there it weakens the ability of
our traditional public schools to serve
their all of their students effectively
creating inequities that hurt the
communities that we claim to
support now public schools are subject
to rigorous oversight transparency
requirements and state standards that
ensure students receive a high quality
education charter schools on the other
hand can sometimes operate with less
oversight and again they are not
governed by people that the people
living in that District have elected
they've elected somebody to stand up and
make decisions for them that's their
local school
board so sb82 to me is not about Choice
it's about coercion it pressures local
boards into decisions that may not align
with their students best interests it
forces them into difficult Financial
situations while while burdening them
with new mandates to drain time and
resources
this is not responsible
policymaking this is a blatant attempt
to override our local control in
favor of an approach dictated top down
by the state colleagues I urge you to
consider the consequences of this bill
by passing s sp82 we're sending a
message that we don't trust our local
school boards right they've been elected
but no no no no no Daddy knows best the
stes coming in and going to tell you
what you need to do with your with your
with your money and with your
students we are sending a message that
we prioritize political pressure over
the actual needs of our students we're
telling communities that their voices
don't matter if their voices are their
votes their votes are not mattering
because we just want to toss aside the
folks that are sitting and making
decisions at the local
level this is not how we build a strong
sustainable public education
system let's reject sb82 let's stand up
for the right of local districts to make
their own
decisions we may not always agree with
them but they are the ones whove been
elected to stand in that place and make
that decisions make those decisions let
us support policies that are truly going
to empower our Educators and
administrators and families and perhaps
lessen the burden on them instead of
constantly adding on I met with some
folks from the uh education from the
Georgia Department of Education and
asked them you know kind of a very
simple question what can we start doing
to take things off the plates of
teachers in public schools what can we
do and we had a very productive talk
they showed me some lovely websites some
really great websites um that the state
has has created to provide resources for
teachers but then they told me that oh
it's the locals that are really
overburdening your the schools with all
of this regulation it's really the local
districts that are doing this
this I mean come on this is the state
saying no no no no no we're going to
pile on more we continue to ask for
blood from a stone and we're not going
to get it instead of allowing our public
schools to kind of die on the
vine as as I said before we have so much
power here to change the narrative and
to change the way we approach public
school for our
students we have the power to do that
instead of cherry-picking that we want a
couple out for special over here and a
couple that are special over here why
don't
we try to give the best of our resources
to every single
school every single public
school no okay nobody's
interested uh thank you thank you I I
appreciate that shout out um a gentleman
from the 49th spoke the other day thank
you so
much um to another education Bill and
urged us to look at our state's QBE
formula in total to prep ourselves to
work towards the review and reworking of
a very complicated QBE formula I cannot
agree more with the gentleman from the
49th if things are getting tough in our
public education space we're the ones
who have the power to fix it we can
review our QBE we can do the hard work
of finding the support for each and
every one of our Public Schools instead
of rescuing a few I mean
schools are not they're not businesses
it's not seral like you don't you go
into a Serial aisle you got 150 choices
for serial how many choices do we
need now I understand that we have some
um some great Charter Schools as I said
one of them is in my district uh but
please vote no on 82 let's find a way to
support all all of our local public
schools thank you Mr Speaker
are I love those choices on the serial
aisle I go ah and tell you that
now that completes all those they were
speaking to The Minority Report now
we'll he hear the chair's time I don't
see the chair so I'm going to recognize
the vice chair of the committee on
education to speak to the bill
representative
rice thank you Mr Speaker I would like
to wave the entirety of my time to
speaker Pro Tim Jones at this time thank
you the vice chair has waved the chair's
time and giv all the allocated time to
the protim of this house representative
Jan Jones representative Jones is
recognized thank you Mr Speaker I don't
need 20 minutes I'm I'm the lucky pinch
header for the chairman who is
negotiating feverishly to get us a
school safety Bill uh with the Senate
and so he asked asked me a few minutes
ago if I would just come up and say a
few words I just want to say that um for
the 20 or so years that I've been here
we've been talking about charter schools
and particularly locally approved
charter schools and in that time very
little progress has been made uh the
first Charter School bill was initiated
by former Democrat representative Kathy
Ash
and since that time we we've seen some
progress particularly in areas like the
city of Atlanta there's some uh very um
they're locally approved charter schools
doing great work around the state but
it's very few what this bill does is
simply it's a very Modest
Proposal uh to encourage local school
boards to provide more Public School
options to students and it's so that we
can have public more public charter
schools
employing Public School
teachers in that are included in the
state retirement p teachers retirement
plan State Health Benefit Plan and
teaching public school students in the
last 10 years of all these efforts to
encourage public authorization by local
school boards guess how many they've
approved in 10 years three
three um the state on the other hand has
approved 56 in that time period some of
you were here when your voters um
approved the cha State Charter School
Amendment it passed by 58% around the
state the county that approved it at the
highest percent in the entire state was
Clayton County at
71% why because parents and students
which I haven't heard a lot of today up
here in the well mostly heard about
systems districts school boards I I
think I could probably count on two
fingers the number of times I heard
students and parents which is what this
is aimed at
um we we've approved them at the state
level parents around the state
grandparents around the state approved
the state Charter School Amendment
because they don't care about your
construct they want Public School
choices they want to attend public
schools with public school teachers
utilizing state and local
dollars I heard a lot about vouchers
religious schools privatization none of
that is in the spell all public charter
schools have a nonprofit
board and they um there is no private in
the nonprofit
board they um
you know I heard about vouchers the bill
has nothing to do about vouchers and let
me just make a
correction 2third of our state cannot
utilize vouchers because there's 1.7
million students and vouchers can only
be utilized by 21,000 students per the
bill we passed last year uh backdoor
privatization is a non-issue these are
public charter
schools public dollars remain in public
schools whether they're public charter
schools or traditional
schools um I've heard over the 20 years
I've been here that folks are open to
the idea I heard that open to the idea
of public charter
schools as long as they're under the
governance of public school boards then
you ought to be for this bill because
this bill encourages local
authorization we got a lot of State
authorization going on we're kind of
full up there what we need are locally
approved charter schools and you know uh
open to the idea usually when I hear
that it doesn't mean supportive I'll
just say that but I read The Minority
Report I don't know where the 2 million
4 million comes from I'll just I'll just
say this when you have a locally
approved Charter
School the property tax dollars that are
raised for the students that live in
that school district stay stay there and
they follow the child to the charter
school they earn QBE when the state
authorizes a public charter school and
that might be where the misunderstanding
came about with the dollars the state's
on the hook for both sides of the
equation we pay for the local share an
equivalent and we pay for QBE well it's
just not
sustainable nor replicable around the
state to keep offering the options that
your constituents your students and your
parents want to have them all approved
at the state level it just isn't because
that's not how public education is
generally funded in the state it's a
partnership about 10% comes from the
feds 40% from the locals and 50% from
the state so if we collectively want to
encourage more public charter schools we
need to figure figure out a way and this
is a very modest proposal to do that uh
to encourage more locally approved but
in 10 years three have been approved
there are over 20,000 students on the
waiting list for those few that exist
now imagine how many would be on how
many more can't get on a wait list
because there's no charter school to get
on the weight list for it's kind of like
prek when I hear about the weit list for
pre it's irrelevant if there's no class
there waiting to get on a wait list for
I don't know how many would want to be
in public prek well the same is true for
public charter schools and I I encourage
you to vote for this I I do have to
address several folks mentioned that the
money isn't
guaranteed you know one legislature
cannot legally bind a future
legislature the only way to is is to put
an appropriation in a tax credit or tax
deduction and until you repeal that the
recipient is due that tax credit or tax
uh deduction anything we pass on this
floor saying we're going to do this loan
grant program we're going to do that
grant program we're going to do these
modest incentives to local school
districts to approve Local Schools is
all always subject to appropriation
that's not being an Indian giver that's
how the state constitution works so do
keep that in mind on future issues that
it it's nothing different than
everything we pass whether it's a uh a
loan program for public school teachers
or for fallen heroes it's always due to
appropriation some of you were here
during the Great Recession
we had to cut back and cut back and make
cutbacks and again that's why we have we
we cannot bind a future leg uh future
legis uh legislature so I encourage you
to vote for
students and parents who are begging for
more options this is not vouchers if you
didn't like vouchers and you're for
public schools and public education only
this should be appealing to you and if
you like local control and you want more
locally approved Charter Schools you
should like this bill because it is a
very Modest Proposal with very minor um
I guess you could say penalties or
inducements to encourage public charter
schools and with that Mr Speaker I do
ask that you vote for this bill and I do
yield the well thank you
lady has yielded the well that

narrowed the bill up I took it back to
committee a second time to incorporate
some language from The Fulton County
Development Authority
chairman um to make it more palatable to
them what's happened is we have two
Legacy cities in North fton who have
their own Development Authority and uh
they do not necessarily want to compete
with another Development Authority I did
not include the other nine cities in
Fulton County because I I don't
represent them and I uh some of them
have expressed interest in similar
legislation next year and I would
support that but um I wanted to leave
that up to the legislators who
um I didn't know what all nine cities
would want and I wanted to leave that up
to them to make um the best decision for
them uh the reason it's General law and
not local law is because uh Development
Authority is contained in general law so
to make a change like this to allow
cities to opt out it had to be General
law um I had a similar Bill a number of
years ago that separated the city of
Atlanta from the rest of Folton County
because the city of Atlanta wanted
to uh increase their Marta sales tax by
50 Cent or 50% and so it made it work
better for the entire County to allow
them to do that uh independent of the
rest of Fon County and the rest of
Fulton County had a higher percentage
for a te blast which seemed to be more
um desired by the cities in South fton
and in North Fulton uh I did delay the
implementation until January 2026 to
allow the Fon County Development
Authority to work with the different
cities I have no reason to believe the
cities will or will not opt out but uh
I'll leave that to their decision making
I will say this it is currently and in
the future if a city opts out of the
Fulton County Development Authority and
they choose later to opt back in they
would have that right I didn't need to
specifically mention that in the bill
because a current city council cannot
obligate uh a future city council on a
decision such as that with this I'd be
happy to take any
questions the lady has no questions well
thank you and with that I would
appreciate your uh favorable vote on um
this Bill thank
you ladies yielded well we have a couple
of folks who want to speak they're
opposed I'm going to ask them to hold it
to five minutes or less if you will and
so we have two speakers the first will
be representing park Canon has
recognized to speak to senate bill1
representative Canon
and give the lady your attention please
thank you Mr speaker thank you members I
rise today in opposition to this
legislation sitting as the chair of the
Fulton County delegation we have had
over 10 meetings this legislative
session to which we have discussed
measures that have impacted or could
have impact on Fulton County and have
requested that the stakeholders come
before us and let us know um on our last
meeting we actually had this bill Senate
Bill 151 on our bad legislation list and
we're pretty surprised to um see it
sitting here today um because of the
concerns that we have had that
ultimately the parties involved were
approached and told I'm doing something
and you either get along with it or you
don't and then came back around to our
delegation and said well you know folks
are actually okay with it and so again
this is that local bill should have been
a local Bill impacts all 15 cities in
Fulton County and Fulton County has not
been asked now I will say that the
Fulton County external Affairs
department is neutral on this bill but
that's only because they don't have a
meeting until Wednesday to which they
can look at this new version of this
legislation um you
know this is like you have a bucket you
tell somebody you have a bucket
everybody can put something in the
bucket and then you say you know what
I've decided I'm taking this bucket away
but I'm going to give a few cups and if
you want to put some things in those
cups good for you if you don't well then
just too bad um delaying the
implementation date again it's not
something that is to the benefit of
these cities that used to have a bucket
and now might be able to opt in or out
of a cup I ask that you vote in
opposition to this bill there's more
work to be done and respectfully the
Power Players the individuals impacted
by this they should be asked how they
feel about it thank you Mr Speaker I
yel ladies yielded the
well we had one more speaker but she
waves we have one speaker in favor and
I'm going to recognize chairman Martin
speaking in favor of the bill up to no
longer than five minutes at the most sir
um thank you Mr Speaker uh let me just
speak uh if I can to to Senate Bill 151
and let me do this because people come
to the well and they say things because
they say things I guess they think
they're true this is General
bill this affects General law therefore
it's a general bill it's the general
bill that's all there is about that and
what this bill does is is it allows the
cities in North Fulton and as the
protim
um spoke it could allow the cities in
South Fulton if they choose to next year
it allows them to have the say as to
what Development Authority can work in
their City doesn't keep them from
working with the Fon County Development
Authority doesn't stop them from doing
it at all does not stop them from
working with that they can opt by
resolution to not allow them to do it
and then later they can opt back to
allow them to do it again so we hear a
lot about local control and taking
things away from people this takes
nothing away from any city in North
Fulton it takes nothing away from the
fton county Development Authority that
the cities want to have happen so I I
would just stand here before you today
this is a general law it comes forward
to us for our our vote because it
affects um Development Authority
language in the general code section and
the cities in North fton support this
because it gives them local control
within their M Municipal bounds and I
ask members let let's don't make this a
partisan issue this is a local control
issue for the people in North Fon this
year and as the sponsor of the bill said
should the folks in South Fon want to do
this next year I stand with them and
would support them and doing so I hope
you will support the members in North
Fulton and by that I mean the city
members in North Fulton in passage of
Senate Bill 151 I yield the
well gentlemen as yield of the will that
completes our discussion on Senate Bill

caption the Senate Bill 212 212 212
Senate Bill 212 by Senator distill of
the 48th and others to be entitled an
act to amend part 14 article 6 chapter 2
Title 20 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to other educational
programs under the quality basic
education act so as to prohibit the
disclosure of public student directory
information to P political candidates
campaign committees political action
committees this bill have referred the
committee on education that committee
recommend this bill do pass by committee
substitute chairman Todd Jones is
recognized to present Senate Bill
212 thank you Mr
Speaker members I come to you with the
house substitute of Senate Bill 212 we
have spoken about two different bills
today have spoke about student safety
making sure that we are protecting the
sanctity of the child and 212 I think
speaks to that completely because
frankly I was surprised that furpa or
current law did not already cover this
because this is effectively the contact
data of a
student Senate Bill 212 does two
important things the first thing it does
is it prohibits a school district from
basically transferring that child's
information to a campaign a candidate or
a
pack the second thing it does is that
under the cloak of I'll say legitimacy
we have
seen organizations go into K12
institutions we're talking about K12
have gone in under the opes of
effectively going in for registration to
vote getting that data and trans ing it
to a campaign or a
pack we must protect our children we
must protect that data this bill does
those two
things it does something else that's
very important and I want to say thank
you to the minority party they added in
an
exception in section one that
ensures that we can for legitimate
reasons with the permission of the
school of course which I think any of us
go into K12 institutions we can go there
to basically have a registration to vote
we can go there to ensure that they are
signing up for their Selective Service
we can go there for a town hall again
with the approval of the principal or
the appropriate person within the school
that's found within lines 42 to
55 I appreciate the thoughtfulness of
not just a majority party but also
minority party on this because we're
talking about data we're talking about
data of minors and we must at all times
put a protective shield over these
individuals to ensure that their
information is not getting out
especially for nefarious
purposes we talk all the time about is
there a problem there is in 20124 this
exact issue occurred in Gwinette Fulton
and foresight County Schools we had
instances of a campaign doing an o r for
public records to the school
of 9th through 12th graders for those
who do not know going into 9th you can
still be 13 years old 14 years old
trying to obtain that data through a
public records
request a campaign also went into high
schools in those same three school
districts acting as if they were there
to register to vote help these
individuals who are 17 to register to
vote when in fact it was there or they
were there to collect the data of these
miners to transfer to a candidate's
database and potentially into a
pack I ask each of you to
consider that during the debate over the
last couple of bills we spoke a lot
about student safety we talked about
making sure that our children are
protected this in fact is a common sense
piece of legislation that ensures that
the good actors are in fact good actors
and those Bad actors we are throwing
over them a shield to say no we're going
to protect our Miners and make sure that
their data stays with them Mr Speaker
that's a completion of my summary and
I'll yield for any questions gentleman
has a couple of questions representative
Jasmine Clark to your left is recognized
for a
question thank you Mr Seer does the
gentleman
yield yes representative um I want to
call your attention to um line 92 and 93
um it speaks to um having uh candidates
um quote solicit individuals under 18 to
fraudulent fraudulently organize an
event what do you mean by that like can
you expound on how someone would
fraudulently organize an event yes
representative Clark it goes to my last
example we know that a campaign went
into for instance fory County Schools
under the aaces of a registration to
vote when in fact the data of the miners
was taken in by that campaign and then
transferred into a c a c a candidate's
database so what we wanted to be able to
do in '92 through pardon me 100 was to
ensure that we wanted to object to
overtly any type of fraudulent
activities that would occur in the k
through2 space especially as it retains
to those individuals data does it
gentleman further yield yes
representative so um I understand what
you mean that we want to make sure to
protect our students I also have a
student in high school and I definitely
want her to be protected I guess what
I'm concerned about is how are we
defining which events are fraudulent or
which ones are not and how do we make
sure that this doesn't stop groups from
coming in and doing voter registration
drives in our high schools which I think
is very important yes representative and
again that's why I I called out the
minority party and we appreciate the
partnership in creating this bill lines
42 through 55 speak through exactly what
you're asking on the latter part of your
question which is if you go to lines 42
through 45 you will see that we want
what you just said and turn the
registration to vote 46 through 47 talks
about selective service and then what 48
through 55 does is effectively say that
you're a testing and writing that you
are here for legitimate purpose you have
informed the school of that legitimate
purpose and you have committed to not
and I want to be clear actively not
transfer to a candidate a pack or a
campaign so g a tiny
question I'm sorry yes and I'll try to
do a tiny answer yes thank you um so a
lot of times when they do the voter
registration they some groups use like
an app to do it with this prevent them
from being able to use those apps for
that purpose again I would say would not
prevent the app as long as they attest
to and follow what hopefully will be a
statute that they are not transferring
that data to the campaign the candidate
or to the pack thank you you're welcome
those tiny questions and answers are
eliciting more questions I can tell you
that so uh let's see how about
representative dubnick chairman dubnick
you got something going to add to this
thank you Mr recognized will the
gentleman yield yes sir Mr chairman is
it not true that by
prohibiting um the disclosure of this
student data that we are taking further
steps to um control and protect their
individualized personal data so that
that's not released to the general
public as well I think the chairman is
exactly correct that's a one of the one
of the aims of this bill is to ensure
that that Minor's data remains the
responsibility of the minor and of
course the parent are the guardian so
thank you very much for the question
thank you Mr chairman great Bill
gentleman has numerous other questions
and we have about five or six seven
speakers that make it bring some clarity
to this
deal but I'll give you another question
recognize one if you'd like no Mr
Speaker given the number of question I
pardon me the number of speakers and the
time of the day I'm going to go ahead
and yield the yield the well and ask for
your farewell
consideration thank you good job
gentleman has yielded the
well let's see we have um
about five speakers that are opposed to
Senate Bill
212 I'm going to give you four minutes a
Max absolute Max of five minutes each
hope y'all can hold it to four minutes
or
less that would be awful awesome not
awful
awesome you know what I meant so we're
going to recognize representative Barry
and representative Barnes your on Deck
representative Barry has recognized the
gentleman recognized for up to 5
minutes thank you Mr Speaker um I rise
today in opposition to Senate Bill
212 because it is no secret that I'm the
youngest person in this chamber the
media has heral long about how I and the
gentleman from the 42nd are the first
genen Z Representatives because of that
I am someone who has lived through the
very struggles this bill seeks to deepen
my back is different from a lot of you
I'm someone who has organized who has
marched and who has fought for the
voices of this bill that seeks to
silence I don't use silence lightly
because there are some bills that we
have passed this session with hopefully
unintentional harms but SP sp212 doesn't
try to mask it it is about power it is
about fear it is about silencing a
generation that is standing up and
demanding change this bill is a direct
attack on the rights of young people of
black and brown students of firsttime
Voters and I will not stand by while
those in power attempt to script them of
their voice their vote and their future
I'm a math teacher but allow me to give
you a history lesson the day is May 3rd
1963 children as young as five and six
years old to those 16 17 18 walk out of
school to March the
streets to demand freedom and
opportunity they didn't March in
unfamiliar territory they marched on
their own streets streets where they
worshiped streets where they played
streets where they spent time and money
and what happened on this day on these
streets an authoritarian who wanted to
silence them and their Fight For Freedom
released dogs and water hoses on
children over 1,000 children were
arrested that day some of you in this
chamber probably remember that day those
images that only happened because Dr
King understood the benefit and the
power of the young voice he reached out
to young people because he understood
their hunger had sp212 been in effect
then he would have been in jail a moment
that changed history and the course of
this nation as we know it would have
never happened if this Bill had been
effect I've seen the hearings and read
the bill thoroughly and through and
through there are so many lies behind
this bill SP sp212 does not protect
students it protects politicians who are
terrified of the power young voters hold
this legislature has no power problem
with schools handing student data over
to military recruiters no problem with
corporations using student data and
information to sell them credit cards
and Loans or other predatory products
but the moment the moment the same
information is used that can help a
student register to vote suddenly we
need privacy protections this bill is
not about privacy it's about stopping
students from organizing mobilizing and
turning out to vote in record numbers
just as they have before and as they
will again so we've seen the Playbook
before every time young people
especially young black and brown voters
turn out in record numbers the rules
suddenly change and every time the
justification is the same some vague IL
defined fraudulent event that no one can
quite explain but somehow demands urgent
legislative action let's be real what
exactly is this fraudulent event when
did it happen who was responsible
where's the proof you would think that
if something so serious actually
occurred we'd be getting specific
details and names and dates and evidence
but instead we get this legislative
equivalent to the trust me bro in this
to March Madness it's like someone
claiming they lost the basketball game
because of bad calls without pointing to
a single replay if you can't tell us
what actually happened maybe just maybe
it didn't and yet here we are again
debating a bill that claims to address a
problem that does not exist sp sp 212
takes real tangible steps to limit Civic
engagement based on an imaginary threat
it makes it harder for student Le
organizations to connect with their
elected officials officials the same
officials they may have soon have the
power to replace it restricts access to
voter education efforts based on nothing
more than a whispered rumor of
wrongdoing so I ask my colleagues are we
really going to write laws based on
ghost stories are we really going to
continue to act like democracy is under
attack just because some people don't
like who's participating in it because
if we keep moving this direction we
won't just be solving a problem that
doesn't exist we'll be creating a real
run a government that legislates based
on myths instead of facts is far more
dangerous to democracy than any
so-called fraudulent event could ever be
with that Mr Speaker i y the well
gentleman is yielded the well the chair
recognizes representative Barnes to
speak to the
Bill thank you madam
speaker I stand in opposition to sb12
while I support some of it there are
some problems in the bill that I feel
like we need to address um while the
intent on sb12 may be to protect student
information and prevent inapo
inappropriate political activity its
unintended consequences could limit
Civic engagement for these uh youth
create legal
confusion uh burden schools and reduce
opportunities for for some students and
especially those in uh underresourced
communities while B
sb212 is presented as a measure to
protect student privacy and uphold
election Integrity it raises several
concerns and potential disadvantages for
some students one major issue is that it
may discourage voter engagement it may
discourage our young voters from voting
it's it's hard to get them to the polls
as it is and with uh some type of
loophole that it could just discourage
them all the way around
by requiring individuals who help
students register to vote or sign up for
the selected service to sign written
waivers and comply with new rules this
could also deter these young individuals
from wanting to vote this is is
especially troubling giving that young
people already face barriers to Civic
engagement as we are making it hard for
them to protest on campus um they
already have barriers so we are
actually implementing more
barriers this bill's prohibitions on
sharing student directory
information uh with political entity
entities could also restrict important
forms of political speech so we could be
shutting these children's speech down as
well it does not distinguish between
partisan campaigns and educational
Outreach efforts so if uh the military
was coming into to the schools to um try
to recruit these students that's okay
and their information is okay to be
shared in that aspect but not this
aspect it doesn't distinguish between
those two it could unintentionally
prevent students from receiving
information about issues that directly
impact their lives so we could be
shutting down uh the ability for them to
gain information information on other
issues such as school funding and voting
rights or Public Safety this raises the
risk that schools become more isolated
from the broader Civic
landscape additionally like all my other
colleagues were saying that fraud
fraudulently organizing an event and
unauthorized Personnel persons is not
clearly defined so I feel like we need
to define those uh more clearly as
well and sb212 could have dis
disproportionate impact on students and
marginalized communities who um um
School serving lowincome rural or
minority students often rely on external
organizations for civic education and
Outreach so this could put a barrier on
that as well by restricting these
Partnerships the bill could reduce
access to these critical resources for
these marginalized
communities student data is you
routinely shared to with thirdparty
vendors for educational technical
companies for military recruiters as I
said earlier yet this legislation does
not include measures to regulate that or
protect against those forms of data
sharing while I know we're tired of
listening to all of us speak I just want
to reiterate that this does not protect
students from uh as much as we think it
does it actually puts a barrier and a
burden on our students so I hope that we
rethink this and put this back to do
some more work on this s sp212 thank you
m M speaker I yield The Well the lady
has yielded the well the chair
recognizes representative Adin to speak
to the
Bill thank you madam speaker
pter members I rise in opposition to
this bill I always ask why is the author
writing the
Bill what is the purpose of the bill who
does the bill
serve while the stated goal of s sp212
is to protect student and voter privacy
the Bill's Broad restrictions and vague
language may have unintended
consequences that limit Civic engagement
confuse implementation and chill
legitimate nonpartisan activity in
schools overreach that could limit
nonpartisan Civic education the bill
could have chilling effect on legitimate
nonpartisan voter registration efforts
in
schools while School staff are Exempted
outside Civic groups like The League of
Women Voters or student L democracy
clubs May avoid engagement for fear of
violating ambiguous
Provisions written attestations for
simply helping students register to vote
could discourage volunteers for
participating Al
together vague and Broad definitions
risk
misinterpretation the terms political
organization acting on behalf of and
fraudulently organized are not clearly
defined and could be subject to
political misuse or over
enforcement unclear language may lead to
unequal application dependent on
political views or affiliations of those
involved suppresses are youth political
engagement this will prohibit minors
from organizing campaign related events
even voluntary even voluntarily May
suppress Civic interests and political
learning at a formative
age students often engage in political
activity as part of classes of or clubs
this law could penalize or silence their
inactive the
initiative potentially undermines Trust
in schools by placing criminal penalties
and burdensome rules around activities
like voter registration the bill may
lead schools to overcorrect and restrict
all political activity even when
allowed how many of you have been asked
by one of your local high schools
political clubs to attend one of their
meetings parents and students may lose
trust in the school environment that are
perceived as as politically silenced
over uh silenced or overly
policed
furer already gives families the right
to opt out of directory information
disclosures this bill May duplicate or
conflict with federal law creating
administrative confusion for
schools weaponizing election law
enforcement by adding harsh penalties
for new subjective offenses like
fraudulent School
events organizations the bill opens the
door to politically motivated
prosecutions especially targeting youth
activists or marginalized
communities so why to be
frank this piece of legislation was born
from a desire for
Retribution
what what does this bill do it does
cause confusion it's still very vague
and and we still have to work on the
language and who does it not serve it
does not serve our students it does not
serve our parents and it does not serve
our
constituents and for that I ask you and
I urge you to vote no on this bill
Madame speaker Pro term I yield the well
thank you the gentleman has yielded the
well the chair recognizes representative
Sanchez to speak to the
Bill thank you madam chair
I Rise here to oppose s sp12 not because
I don't believe we must protect students
data I firmly believe we have to protect
students data and I think there are some
great Parts in this bill that do that
the main issue is of course in section
three lines 92 through 100 where a
campaign pack organization can't
organize an event with a student under
the 18
fraudulently what does that mean exactly
it's not defined in this
bill what I'm worried about is that
fraudulent term being used to chill and
silence the First Amendment rights of
our
students at a time where students in
this country are being disappeared for
exercising those First Amendment rights
as
well we talk about how it's great when
students get civically engaged that we
need more young people getting involved
why aren't the youth getting involved we
keep talking on both sides of the aisle
how to get young voters engaged in
public service in politics and how to
get them to vote and then gen Z becomes
the most politically active youth
generation since the baby boomer
generation and now suddenly the majority
of parties like hey whoo there not like
that is it because the youth are
demanding gun control Swift action
against climate change affordable
housing free public
education a living
wage is it because of that that y'all
don't like those
things again I want to reiterate if
section three was removed from this bill
I would support this measure but that is
as it stands we cannot chill and silence
the voices of anyone in this state
including our
students our children will be attacked
by this bill with their first amendment
rights being attacked when I represent
my constituents I don't only represent
just those who can vote Yes I have over
30,000 registered voters in my district
but I have nearly 6,000 constituents
many of them students and children under
18
their thoughts their opinions and their
civic engagement matters just as much as
their parents and there are many
students in your District as well who
deserve representation and deserve a
have a voice just like anyone
else we have pages and high school
students come to these Halls we applaud
them for their civic engagement but now
we want to limit that engagement their
first amendment
rights we want to punish them if they
engage in a way we don't like
what kind of democracy are we creating
with the passage of sb212 as it is
currently so I urge my colleagues to
vote no on S sp212 because we cannot
silence voices just because you disagree
with them let's continue to be a
democracy thank you Madame chair I yield
the
well gentleman has yielded the well the
chair recognizes representative Howard
to speak to the bill
he
waves is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered the
chair he's none the previous question is
ordered there is a Minority Report the
chair recognizes representative
Wilkinson speak to The Minority Report
thank you madam speaker uh today I Rise
to oppose uh Senate Bill 212 and I think
we can all agree that we want to protect
our children's
information my
issue um comes on lines
42 so in committee we talked about the
crazy idea of a legislator being a
parent of a public school
student a legislator being a parent of a
public school student which I was under
this bill you can't separate David
Wilkerson parent David Wilkerson PTA
parent from David Wilkerson
legislator those are all connected David
Wilkerson campaign is not David
Wilkerson pwder Springs resident they're
not different people so under this bill
if I come in for a career day which is
not open to the public just so you know
in public schools career days are not
open to the public it is a meeting in
the classroom and if I say by the way
make sure you register to vote and make
sure you register for Selective Service
I have to sign a form as a parent
legislator under this bill and that's
what this says so the reality is that
the people that are doing the right
thing or continue to do the right thing
and you will have some people some
Knuckleheads that will go out there and
try to get information they shouldn't be
getting but this bill is going to cause
a lot of issues I just hope and I have
one request to the majority party one
request when we pass the divisive
Concepts Bill a few years ago it only
applied when it IT attacked Republicans
I sent many emails about divisive
Concepts attacking this last election a
Democratic candidate and it went on
unheard ears both within the hallway and
within this body so please make sure
that if we pass a bill make sure we
apply to everybody fairly and in this
case that means as a legislator if you
ever Venture inside of a school and you
ever tell anybody to register or you'll
be at an event where they can come and
participate and get involved in their
civic duties that you make sure you sign
in a test that you are not well that you
signning a test that you're doing that
and I would like to see that if we're
going to do that put it on the ethics
website so anytime anybody does it we
publicly disclose that we're doing it
because right now this bill is going to
penalize those of us that have chosen to
be in public schools because it doesn't
impact private schools my understanding
those that have chosen to be in public
schools is going to impact us and I just
ask that we treat everybody the same way
and we want our students to be engaged
but if we could take a look at those
lines fix it I would appreciate it
otherwise for now I would say please
vote no on this bill and with that Mr
Speaker I yeld the
well chair recognizes representative
Evans to speak to the
Bill thank you Madame speaker good
afternoon colleagues I'm going to add my
voice to the chorus here against cabill
212 not because I want our students
information to be out there willy-nilly
that I think we should all be able to
get it and and talk to them like it
seems like some people think no that's
not what I think I don't think that's
what anybody in here thinks and I also
don't think that's able to happen now I
think there's federal law that protects
our students information and um
reference was made to the ghost
situation during the last campaign and I
think that's exactly what it is um I
don't think anybody's information got
out there or at least no one's shown me
that but if you want to protect student
information that's fine you want to have
a an extra law that does exactly what
federal law already does I guess that's
fine F my concern comes in section
three which starts on technically on
line 87 my concern comes in on line 92
and this is where we have this language
that says no candidate Campaign
Committee or political action committee
and on and on shall solicit any
individual under 18 years old to
fraudulently organize an event on the
property of any local school system and
on and on and on you can skip down to
the last section on lines 99 to
100 let's just let's just go together
here as if we were reading in church to
make sure we're
clear section three line
92 no candidate Campaign Committee or
political action committee shall solicit
any individual under 18 years to
fraudulently organize an event on the
property of a local school system skip
down to line 99 when such event is
otherwise prohibited by law or policy of
the local school system or an individual
School thereof so what this means is you
can't fraudulently induce a student to
participate in an event that they are
already prohibited from
holding let me say that one more time
this law says a candidate cannot solicit
a student to engage in an event at a
school that the student already cannot
participate in not just that the
candidate can't participate in but that
the school can't participate in
so why are we doing
this it also only
prohibits soliciting someone under 18 to
participate in these events that they're
not that they're already not allowed to
participate in so I guess you could
solicit a teacher in the public school
all day every day to participate in an
event that the teacher is not allowed to
participate in on school grounds
why why is that
okay why are we doing this maybe
somebody has an agenda here maybe they
want to use this for something
else okay let's pretend like this even
is a problem for a second that we can't
fraudulently induce someone to
participate in an event that they
already can't do which means that would
never be held at the school unless we
just assume that every teacher every
principal every school board everybody
is asleep and is letting this student
participate in an event that they are
already not allowed to do and someone
solicited them to do it we've made this
unlawful let's just pretend like all
that happens then
what what are we going to
do what are we going to do to this
person who's fraudulently induced
someone to do something that they were
never allowed to to do and never would
do it's never happened it really is a
ghost
event since there's no real effect if
somebody does this thing that is never
going to
happen federal law already protects the
data the only thing my and and I you
know I'm trying to just apply Common
Sense logic to this spill the only thing
I can think of is that we're trying to
chill the young
people we're either doing that or we're
giving somebody campaign fodder for an
anticipated opponent it's one of those
things and I would submit ladies and
gentlemen that we have much better
things to do down here it's very
exciting to get a bill that says um
relating to educational programs under
the quality basic education acts you
think oh wait maybe we're going to
actually address the quality basic ation
funding formula that hasn't been
Rewritten since Joe Frank Harris was
governor in the
1980s when I was about
two no what we're doing here is we are
either giving campaign fod to someone
and or we're chilling young people and
you know I have two thoughts about this
I think it's already hard enough to get
students to engage in politics because
let's be honest y'all we are not the
cool kids in here we're just not it's
not the coolest thing to do in high
school to be involved in politics so
it's already hard enough for that reason
um but even with all that being said we
probably have young people participating
in politics as high at high at as high a
rate as I've seen why do we want to pour
cold water on that and I think that goes
on both sides I mean I think I think all
of us in here have probably had to
answer questions that we'd rather not
answer because young people are paying
attention so is this to protect us from
having to answer out to the questions
that come out of the mouth of
babes
maybe and why do we want to discourage
this will also chill Us in this room
from going out and talking to students
and engaging with them for fear that
we're going to be questioned about
whether we are trying to fraudulently
induce them into an event that they're
not allowed to
hold and then when a student is holding
an event that they are allowed to hold
Maybe somebody thinks an it's an event
that they're not allowed to hold and
then they're going to get questioned who
put you up to this
Missy or little mister I don't want I
don't want people coming to me because
I'm talking to students and trying to
engage them in the process and I don't
want people scaring our children and
it's you know I I appreciate that um
representative Wilkerson and I were able
to come up here and um speak with with
some of our younger members that were
that were lined up here here it makes me
feel youthful but this is how I got my
start was with young Democrats and I
know some of yall on here got your start
with young
Republicans I never I it never even
crossed my mind that somebody would
think somebody was putting me up to it
and I would like to think that it never
crossed the minds of those candidates
that I got to engage in that somebody
was coming over to them and thinking
thinking that they were trying to get me
involved in something that I wasn't
supposed to be involved in that just
invites a whole layer of inquiry and
interrogation in in in a process that we
should be encouraging so it's very
disappointing that we've take had to
take up so much time to talk about a
bill that really does Nothing Stops
nothing and even if we pretend like it
stops something we don't do anything
about it in this bill what so what if if
a person violates what we've put out in
line 92 nothing is going to happen so in
summary this bill does nothing if it
does anything it chills participation in
political process which is something
that I would hope this deliberative body
would not want to be for and so I hope
you will join me in denying campaign
fodder denying the chilling of political
participation by our young people and
vote no on this Bill thank you I yield
the
well chair recognizes uh repres uh
chairman Irwin for the Chairman's time
thank you madam speaker and uh
colleagues let me let me Begin by saying
that there's been an attack on student
data going on for quite a while and it
it is imperative that we protect that
data for our students there's also
colleagues a tack on their time within
the classroom for Learning and we must
take action to defend ours our students
time to be engaged in the learning and
what we're requiring to them and it just
seems like we keep loading that plate up
with more and more distractions but
requiring more and more of their time so
colleagues the passage of Senate Bill
212 is not just about attending
statues or excuse me amending statutes
is about affirming our dedication to the
well-being and privacy of Georgia
students let's come together to support
this essential measure reinforce the
walls that protect our educational
spaces and unwarranted political
intrusion
so Madam speaker what I'd like to do to
somebody who's been much more engaged in
this process and understanding what this
bill really does I would like to turn
over the remaining of the time uh
Chairman's time to Chairman Jones
gentleman has yielded the will and the
chair recognizes chairman Jones to speak
to the
Bill thank you madam speaker uh we have
debated this for some time but I thought
it was important to come back in and
just clear up a couple of things I think
first and foremost there's been a lot
talked about assembly speech engagement
and I can't tell you how much I agree
with all three of those things when it
comes to younger voters when it comes to
younger individuals who will become
voters we want to get them engaged in to
the process this bill does nothing to
their First Amendment right around
speech around assembly matter of fact
there's a lot of things that we go to
where we're not collecting data as a
matter of fact I would argue 90 95% of
the political activities we go to have
nothing to do with collecting data all
this is saying is is if you collect the
data if you do it under the opes of for
instance voter registration then use it
for voter
registration what happens if that 1 and
a half year older thinks that he or she
has already registered because they
registered at the school and instead of
doing the right thing in registering
that person that fraudulent entity
literally just took the data and moved
it over to a campaign to a candidate or
to a pack second there has been a
question inside of the well around why
is this
needed around why is this needed we can
provide data to provide you information
and backup that this occurred in
Gwinette fton and fory the first the
fourth and the fifth largest school
districts in our
state let's have that conversation third
there was a there was a comment made
from the well regarding if fraudulent
was
defined I can assure you fraud is
defined in the
ocga 23-25
[Music]
1 take a look at that definition and
then apply it to lines 92 through 100
and hopefully that will help you turn
from a no to a yes and then finally a
comment was made in the well regarding
furpa the federal law around student
data and student data privacy I was
actually shocked that furpa does not
cover this exact situation when someone
fraudulently goes into a k through2
entity and tries to LIT Min minor in
terms of their
Data before I close up I want to again
reiterate number one under no way shape
or form is this a First Amendment
discussion in my mind that M the waters
have been muddied when we talk about the
idea that this is in fact
discouraging these young individuals
from doing what is their constitutional
right as a matter of fact I'll be the
first one with a bullhorn telling them
get together have that
conversation be passionate about the
things that you believe in
campaign persuade do the things that we
do in here but with your colleagues just
don't do it when you're taking their
data and giving it to someone they
shouldn't be giving it to because you
know why it can be used for the wrong
reason thank you very much Madam speaker
I yield the
well the gentleman has yielded the well
for what purpose does representative
Canon
rise well I had a question I mean we're
in limbo right now may I still ask the
question parliamentary inquiry a
parliamentary inquiry please certainly
is it not true that there has been no
lawsuit spoken to in the well regarding
the misuse of student data nor what the
board of education has said which now
we'll have to weigh in on this measure
I'm sure the lady believes that to be
true is there any objection to adopting
the committee substitute chair hears
none the committee substitute is adopted
is there any objection to agreeing to
the report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair hears none the report of the
committee is agreed to shall this bill

requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed for what purpose
does representative Miller
rise uh parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry um Madam speaker is it not true

activity had occurred that it should be
reported to the ethics office and
investigated the lady is a learned
attorney and I'm sure she believes that
to be true thank

substitute and the house Amendment thank
you Mr Speaker I know the hour is late
so for the the price of one green button
I'm presenting to you two great pieces
of legislation um the first section of
of the Senate of the house substitute um
goes back and modifies the military
retirement income uh credit that were
the military retirement income deduction
it modifies it from
17,500 which is in place right now to a
to a total of 655,000 we previously had
a latter increase it simply goes to the
the final destination of
$65,000 again only for the military
retirement income and then starting on
line 24 we are taking uh what you've pre
previously seen in House Bill
330 uh which uh favorably uh reported
out of the Ways and Means Committee
and it allows for more flexibility for
the law enforcement foundations it uh
two very important things it allows for
One Foundation to see to benefit
multiple agencies right now we're
limited to one and as well as allows for
more flexibility in what those
foundations can do in terms of
supporting that that local uh Public
Safety um agency that it
supports Mr Speaker if there are no
questions I'll yield the well gentleman

thank you is there any objection to

268 House Bill 268 as amended by the

as amended by the
Senate I think everyone has that now so
I'm going to
recognize representative Pinger for a
motion representative
Persinger thank you Mr Speaker I move
that the house agreed to the Senate
substitute the HB 268
Mr clerk will you read the
caption Hospital 268 by representative
Pinger of the 119th to be entitled act
to amend chapter 2 Title 20 the official
C to Georgia an related to Elementary
and secondary education so to provide
for the safety health and well-being of
students and school
communities representative Pinger is
recognized to explain the Senate
substitute thank you Mr Speaker I know
the hour's late so I'll be brief and
just go over the changes that were made
the Senate substitute incorporates s sp7
known as Ricky and Alyssa's law in its
entirety that will require all public
schools to implement a mobile Panic
alert system much like the one used at
appalachi that we know saved countless
lives and prevented as much a much
larger tragedy this will also require
each School to procure digital mapping
data to be shared with the state and
local agencies that respond to
emergencies at school
systems the amended 268 also requires
gima and Homeland Security to establish
a Statewide alert system to report and
monitor incidents of safety threats made
against
schools it will also require schools to
adopt threat assessment plans providing
a structured multi-disciplinary process
to identify assess and mitigate
potential threats to schools while
supporting the safety and wellbeing of
students and school
Personnel Bill also creates a qualified
student advocacy specialist
position who's who's required to
coordinate Mental Health Services for
students in crisis and it also creates
the grants to fund those
positions colleagues after what we
witnessed at appalache this house
committed to championing legislation to
bolster bolster school security mandate
stronger Communications between our
schools and provide critical Mental
Health Resources to our students that's
exactly what house bill 268 will
accomplish and I ask for your favorable
consideration of this bill gentleman has
a couple of questions yes sir feel yield
yes sir uh representative Roberts to
your left has recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I do um I'm all for all of these
security measures um I just am curious
on the uh was it Alyssa's law the
mapping that is required to be
implemented by I think it was July of
2026 um is there funding in the budget
for that or those school systems I have
no idea what they cost um I just wonder
if we're imposing an unfunded mandate on
the schools with quick turnaround time I
think most of the mapping is already
required in the school safety plans we
did I believe in 23 okay so it's just an
addition to okay thank
you gentleman you for another question I
do representative
Bennett to your left is recognized for a
question thank you with the gentleman y
i do you mentioned a mental health um
Personnel is that per each school or for
the school district I wasn't I couldn't
find it in the bill so it was originally
our bill is a um Behavioral Health
coordinator and that's going to
be allocated based on population I
believe it's 18,000 up to 18,000 get um
one that we would fund through grants
um of 18,000 to 36,000 would have two
and over 36,000 students would get up to
three that would be funded by the grants
that we put in the budget if they want
to have more they could have more they
just set to fund in themselves per
District correct thank
you gentleman you for another question
yes Mr Speaker representative Barnes to
your left is recognized for a question
thank you Mr Speaker did a gentleman yel
I will as far as the school safety
devices are they to be placed per
classroom like the alert system that is
the alert system that we use here at the
capital same thing as the alert b so are
we trying to place those in each
classroom is what I'm
asking wait which alerts areum you speak
you talking about alysa's law or the one
that GMA is responsible for um I guess
the gma's law that we're going to
implement and put in each classroom are
we putting these alert systems in each
classroom or just in the school no that
that's information sharing to make sure
that if there is a credible threat to a
school system that all agencies are
involved in that communication that was
part of the lacking at appalache so the
other system that you were explaining is
the actual device GRE the device in
Alyssa's law is the Panic alert alert
badges like we have here okay and they
will go to each teacher or something
like that or student correct most
systems are using that I think if I'm
not mistaken we have about 80% maybe a
little less than that compliance all
right thank you
yep gentleman yield for another question
one more uh representative Butner to
your left has recognized for a question
does a gentleman yield I will um there
was a great deal of conversation after
what happened in um wer and appalache
school and um one of the things that um
they were talking about is that the
student had only been there very brief
ly and that the records from the
previous school that may have given an
indication of a potential problem had
not arrived so when it talks about
procedures to meet the requirements and
students education records in a timely
manner is timely mannered identified or
within five days okay thank you very
much gentleman yield or one more
question is he one more uh represent
Sanchez is recognized for a
question thank you Mr Speaker this J and
yield I will so the G3 database was
removed from this bill that we passed
from the house or the S3 database is
removed correct okay feel further yield
yes but the bill still includes um
disciplinary records following students
if they have a disciplinary record to
from school to school correct correct
that's currently in a student's record
now and follows a student now just not
there's not anything codified as to the
time frame so we're modifying that a
student's record which currently exists
must be transferred within 5 days all
right thank
you speaker I yield the
well gentleman has answered questions
presented the bill and yielded the well
on the gentleman's motion that the house
agreed to the Senate substitute the
house bill 268 all those in favor will
vote Yes all those opposed will vote no
and Mr clerk will you unlock the
machines
have all members
voted all members voted
if so Mr clerk will you lock the
machines on the gentleman's motion the
Y's are
154 the Nays are 12 and this house has
agreed to the Senate substitute the
house bill
268 the school safety Bill
congratulations representative Pinger
[Applause]
thank you
members Mr clerk will you read the
caption the Senate Bill 199 19
199 Senate Bill 199 by Senator Watson of
the 11th being titled act to amend
chapter 5 of title 21 of the official
quod of Georgia annotator relating to
government transparency and campaign
Finance so provide that the state ethics
commission shall not accept or reject
complaints made against candidates 60
days prior to it an election this bill
have refer to the committee on
governmental Affairs that committee
recommends this bill do
pass representative representative Chaz
Canon is recognized to present the bill
representative Canon thank you Mr
Speaker members of the house I have for
you Senate Bill 199 which provides some
much needed uniformity and in terms of
our campaign Finance disclosures it also
streamlines and simplifies some of our
reporting requirements I want to thank
Mr David amatti he was in the gallery
with us right now our state ethics
commissioner uh Commission Executive
Director for his input on this
legislation this is a clean bill no
amendments it pass the Senate without a
single no vote I think you'll like it as
well uh let me tell you about some of
the key Provisions local filings now
done with City and County uh election
clerks will now be reverted back to the
state start January 1st
2027 uh it makes the deadline 60 days
prior to an election to submit
complaints against the candidate for
election currently at 30 uh changes
campaign disclosure reports to quarterly
every year and provides uniformity in
both election years and non-election
years and those days will be standard
across the board January 31st April 30th
July 31st and October 20th it also
changes reporting for packs political
action committees to those dates as well
so uniformity across reporting dates it
also requires packs to have separate
bank accounts much like campaigns it
moves Financial de closure reports to be
due on April 1st every year instead of
different days in a non election year
again making it clarifying the situation
making more simple uh it also requires
our F friends outside on the ropes to
make their reports once a month no later
than the fifth day of the month and Al
also simplif I lobbyist
registrations um one of the last things
I'll kind of talk about is also
restricts elected officials and
candidates for office home address from
public view uh so it does a good bit of
things makes things more uniform
standard across the board Mr Speaker
I'll stand for any questions you have a
couple of questions uh representative
Stacy Evans to your left has recognized
for a question thank you Mr Speaker does
the gentleman yield I yield um I think
there's definitely more good in this
build and bad but I did have a question
I wanted to ask you about on lines
572 I guess really starting on 571 where
we are talking about financial
statements say Amen when you have
it nobody got my joke
what yeah no I just want I was are you
there I didn't want to start yeah yes
okay greater than the Thousand but not
more than
2500 well starting it's that whole
section starting on line 571 through 581
where we are we're having um this part
of the bill appears to me sets out the
requirements for and it may just be the
Statewide candidates for their financial
statements my question is we've got a
lot of compression at the beginning when
you're setting out um when candidates
are setting out their their income or
their what they might hold in something
you know not more than a th000 then
we've got between 1,00 and 2500 2500 and
5,000 5,000 and 15,000 really tiny um
relatively tiny ranges but then we are
like like 500,000 to a million a million
to 5 million then greater than 5 million
so I'm having a hard time understanding
why there's more interest in knowing
whether a candidate
owns you know between a th000 and 15,000
but not knowing whether it was 5 million
10 million 100 million 200 million 500
million we're just letting that
go as high as the sky can go and I was
wondering if that was discussed and what
perhaps was the logic there uh I can't
to speak to that exactly I just know
that it was creating ranges for personal
financial disclosure statements on a
source of income ex instead of Zack
amounts uh that's second I all I can
give you in terms of the reasoning
behind that perhaps that's something
that could be looked at because I I I
think from a transparency standpoint
there's not a lot to be gained between
the range of to me a th000 to 15,000
maybe even 50 um but there's a lot to
know between 5 million and 500 million
and we're we're leaving that to chance
would would you yield for one more I
will um I understand the logic of not
having the ethics
Commission accept or decline a a
complaint during the 60 days before an
election I actually thought that was the
law already but what happens to those
because there there very well may be
some wrongdoing that needs to be brought
to someone's attention and will those
just sit or do they have to be filed
again after the election's over I will
find out but the intent with that is not
to have a
you know somebody logic complaint
against you that close to an election
timeline I think it backs that timeline
up so we can have more time between
those dates in the election uh but I
will find out get back to you C could
you tell me though well not the logic in
that I'm wondering what happens to the
complaints the the commission's not
going to accept them or reject them I
see the motion from the executive
director saying it's going to go back to
after the election so you would have to
refile it after the election that's
correct no you don't you they you don't
have to refile have to file it but you
could they roll
over so they're still heard but after
the election understood and I guess if
if you would yield a little bit further
have a little discussion here if one
more question thank you Mr Speaker um I
I I understand in it's great logic not
to give a campaign fodder to say a
complaint's been filed or the ethics
commission is considering this complaint
and that goes on a mailer within 60 days
of the campaign but are we actually
taking that away because if they file it
and it's not accepted or rejected it
seems like it would still be accurate
for the complaining candidate within
those 60 days to say ethics complaint
has been filed against XYZ is that would
that be accurate if the candidate said
that um not sure I can speak to that uh
just I think we're just trying to
basically make some uniformity and some
Simplicity to the timeline um thank you
thank you
may not comply with state law but I bet
you it'll be said by
somebody uh representive bur chett whip
B is recognized for a question thank you
Mr Speaker does the gentleman yield I
yield to the whip did I understand you
to say that um this is going to simplify
our filing so that even in election
years and non-election years we're
filing quarterly is that correct that's
correct so we don't have this three days
provision uh like we've got right now
alternates 7 7 between 7 and 15 15 days
on non-election years it makes it
standard April 1st I believe thank
you you you want another question Mr
Speaker and in the voice of uh Deputy
Whip Mr Speaker I will yield the
well gentleman yielded the
well is there any objection to the
previous question being ordered hearing
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
hearing none the report of the committee
has agreed to shall this bill shall this
bill now pass all in favor of the pass
of the bill we'll vote Yes all those

this bill unanimously Miss speaker I'd
be happy to answer a question if there
is one to your right representative
Jason Ridley is recognized for a

I'll yield the well
sometimes I'm sorry I recognize people

questions on the gentleman's motion that
the house agreed to the Senate
substitute to house to house bill
288 all those in favor will vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and Mr Clark
will you unlock the machines
have all members
voted have all members voted if so Mr
clerk will you lock the
machines on the gentleman's motion that
y are 152 the Nays are 14 of this house
agreed to the Senate sub substitute the
house bill
288 back on the rules calendar Mr cler
will you read the caption to Senate Bill
2011
201 Senate Bill 2011 by Senator Walker
the 20th and others be titled act to
amend code section 101 393 of the
official code of Georgia annotator
relating unfair deceptive practices in
consumer transactions unlawful examples
this bill have referred to the committee
on agriculture and consumer affairs that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass by committee
substitute the lady from Lions
representative Hagen is recognized to
present the
Bill thank you Mr Speaker um friends
typically after a natural disaster F we
tend to see the best in people but sadly
on some occasions we do see the worst in
people most recently after Hurricane
Helen we saw scammers in the form of
storm chasing repair contractors who
suddenly appear to make home repairs
these um and I'm sure you've seen them
in other instances of natural disasters
around the state they show up and ready
claim to be ready to make repairs
however they often uh are praying on our
senior citizens and potentially others
of us who are not particularly well
versed in contractual language so uh
many people who are in a time of intense
stress because of the natural disaster
sign contracts for home repairs more
quickly than they would have otherwise
without fully understanding what they're
signing so this bill would do two things
to address this first it amends the
Georgia fair business Practices Act to
provide greater protection for
homeowners in the 12 months following a
natural disaster to make sure that
contracted work is performed in a timely
and professional manner and the second
thing that this bill does is prohibit
the assignment of insurance proceeds to
contractors for a period of one year
following the natural disaster so it
what it does is it gives homeowners who
are in a time of intense stress addess
the ability to cancel their contract if
the contractor does not perform as they
should it only applies within the 12
months after a natural disaster in a
county that was included in a state of
emergency Proclamation by the governor
and right now this includes every county
in the state because we have had these
um natural disaster state of emergency
proclamations um Statewide for winter
storms hurricanes um within the past 12
months so um although it was a concern
immediately following the hurricane and
it and this bill did come out of those
concerns it is written in such a way
that it would apply to any County who
has uh within the last 12 months been
declared a natural a a State of
Emergency due to a natural
disaster Mr Speaker that is the the bill
and I'd be happy to take some questions
if there are any lady has no questions

consideration ladies yielded the well is

this bill hav been referred to the
Committee on Public Safety and Homeland
Security that committee recommends this
bill du pass by committee
substitute representative Matt Reeves is
recognized presenting the bill
representative Reeves thank you speaker
burns the members of the house I present
to you Senate Bill 99 the law
enforcement Partners act and although
this has a Senate Bill designation this
has house language the house Committee
on Public Safety worked on this uh this
year twice once with the house bill when
the Senate bill passed 49 to1 I talked
to the Senate sponsor and he agreed to
work on our house version that the
Georgia Sheriff's Association and the
house Public Safety Committee had made
some revisions to so we had a second
hearing and the committee passed it out
on a bipartisan basis Georgia is one of
two states Nebraska being the other one
that lacks a uh jurisdictional basis for
uh the federal authorities to work with
our state authorities in cases of
disaster or upon uh State request with a
Joint Task Force that was an inadvertent
repeal 5 years ago this bill would fix
it and I really appreciate uh the house
members in public safety working so hard
on this on a bipartisan basis to present
this bill which I request your favorable
support of and I yield for any questions
Mr Speaker if there are their questions
I yield the well you have a couple of
questions representative Reese to your
left in the back representative Teddy
Reese thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman y absolutely from my colleague
from Columbus who who uh I've talked
about this with a lot so you're going to
take my inquiry from you then huh
absolutely okay I do want to thank you
for bringing this bill and isn't it true
that this bill will allow our local
sheriff officers to have the necessary
Federal tools that they need to help
them do their jobs within their
jurisdiction absolutely I appreciate you
speaking local law enforcement Columbus
last year and this year and I'm glad
it's here on the floor representative
Neil to your left way back here is to
your yes as recognized representative
Neil recognize for a question does the
gentleman yield yes representative Neil
is it not true that
we stripped this bill and put your bill
into the house version the better
version the preferred version um to make
this a better Bill uh our bill our bill
our house bill absolutely I appreciate
your work on it Public Safety and for
speaking to Federal Federal authorities
to get in better shape absolutely thank
you thank you representative
Lim is recognized for a question to your
right thank you Mr Speaker does the
gentleman yield I do I had a question do
federal law enforcement acting under the
request of state or local law
enforcement have the same immunities as
the state law enforcement the reason I
ask is I'm concerned as as I'm sure you
know Federal feral law enforcement are
subject to viven which are far narrower
than section 1983 and so if there's a
differential in immunities it's possible
that federal law enforcement would act
in a far less constrained manner than
state or law enforce state law
enforcement would in the exact same
scenario and I'm concerned that in that
cases either one would point to the
other and either would avoid
accountability or perhaps even worse the
state would hide under the guise of the
federal law enforcement that that is a
good question representative Limb and uh
we got some questions answered in
committee number one federal law
enforcement uh they are prohibited
nationally from Moonlighting and doing
anything in the private sector uh like
sometimes people do in Georgia so when
they come to work with the state law
enforcement they are doing it under a
specific request think New Orleans on
January the 1st when that terrible
tragedy happened U that kind of thing if
it happened here we'd want everybody uh
hands on deck in law enforcement whether
it's a state or federal issue going on
and so the issue of IM if they're doing
their federal work on federal matters
the federal law would apply and the
state work if they're doing it upon
State request that would be governed by
analysis that we have here in Georgia I
believe Mr Speaker if there are no
further questions I yield the well you
have questions but it's your choice I
yield
well you you were
persuaded gentleman yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered hearing none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to adopting The

caption to Senate Bill 298 298 Senate
Bill 298 by Senator Robertson of the
29th to be entitled in act to amend code
section
5634 of the official code of Georgia
annotator relate relating to judgments
and rulings deemed directly appealable
procedures for review judgments orders
or decisions not subject to direct
appeal this bill have refer to the
committee on Judiciary that committee
recommends this bill do pass by
committee
substitute chairman Rob Leverett has
recognized to speak to Senate Bill 298
298 thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen we're kind of working on a
theme here during this portion of the
rules caliber because just like the
previous bill this is uh sort of a house
bill language coming back to us in the
Senate bill Senate Bill 298 at least the
house uh or the rules committee
substitute that I believe you have in
front of you was House Bill 531 in
essence it provides that a um a local
government or any any type of
governmental entity that it's sued if
they receive an adverse ruling regarding
uh sovereign immunity they have a right
of direct appeal to that ruling but
they've got to exercise the appeal only
one time and within 30 days during
commit legislative immunity and then
legislative privilege um has been added
to that and it's also there's also a
route for direct Appeal on a ruling
relating to that whether it's a criminal
or civil case and there is no limitation
because of course that can come up
multiple times within uh litigation
during the course of Discovery so that
is basically the bill Mr Speaker if
there are any questions I'll be glad to
try to answer
them gentleman has a question
representing Miller to your left
Senator thank you Mr Speaker just a
gentleman you yes ma'am was there any
consideration uh to giving citizens the
right to appeal in adverse ruling direct
appeal in other words if the trial court
found that the municipality had some
kind of immunity that the citizen could
direct appeal it my understanding is
they afforded a right of direct appeal
already because that'd be a final order
in the case thank you so there and and
this is the um
um in the statute on on Direct appeals
that are other than final orders so if
so if so if it disposed of just riddle
me a second if it disposed of one party
to the sue the municipality but there
were other parties who did not have the
immunity um would the citizen be able to
appeal even though the case was still
going on and that I that I cannot answer
to if there's multiple parties I'm not
sure they probably would have to get get
a certificate to appeal in that case
thank you
thank you for the question gentleman has
no further questions thank you Mr
Speaker ladies and gentlemen I ask your
favorable consideration of Senate Bill
298 thank you I yield the well gentleman

caption to Senate Bill
241
241 Senate Bill 241 by Senator Williams
the 25th and others to be entitled act
to amend chapter 18 to title 43 of the
official Cod of George an relating to
funeral directors and establishments in
bombers and crematories so to provide
for the organic human reduction as means
of disposing deceased human bodies this
bill I refer to the committee on
regulated industries that committee
recommends that this bill do
pass chairman Powell is recognized to
present Senate Bill 241 chairman Powell
thank you Mr Speaker and Ladies and
Gentlemen of the house tonight I bring a
Senate Bill two 41 this is a baill by a
former member of the House and the
distinguished one of the few
distinguished Senators who is a member
long-term member of the funeral caucus
now a lot of people name different bills
and I thought the appropriate name for
this might be the Buddy Loach organic
farming
bill you know one of the great things
about being on reg industries that we
hear about all of it but funeral homes
have had a lot of way of a lot of ways
of disposing by these oldfashioned ways
to bury and then you got cremation then
a few years ago I thought I'd about seen
it all when it came up with this
alkaline reduction about putting your
carcass in a bucket of acid and all of
that well now ladies and gentlemen
there's a new one and it's
called organic human reduction and uh
apparently this is the most the latest
and the best on environmentally friendly
disposal of human remains I think you
just basically and I don't know don't
ask me the details of how you do it I
think scratch a hole in the dirt and
they put your carcass in it and cover it
up so the cats can't drag it out but
uh but what this bill does ladies and
gentlemen it puts guard rails uh on this
type of uh behavior and it requires
licensing and in in and inspections and
this protects the families that choose
to use this type of disposal now it's
almost dinner time so I caution you
don't ask many questions cuz you might
get some answers you don't want to hear
before din
but if there's no questions I'll sit
down and yield the wh well there's a
question and I'm a little bit concerned
but it's my job yes sir Mr Speaker
representative Donahue to your left is
recognized for a question the gentleman
you I certainly do is it not true if
this bill passes it will help your dirt
turn into worm farm and every worm farm
will be productive well I have no no
idea that you're right your honor but I
would say that uh once your body has
been composted then I would almost
assure you you can plant it in a tomato
plant and it might add a little bit more
acidity to it well there's that one we
we have one more I'm going to allow
before because I want to have dinner and
I'm have to get over this for a few
minutes or the uh the caucus that knows
a lot about this issue is represented by
representative Patty Stenson and she's
recognized Funeral Home
the ladies
recognized thank you Mr Speaker there a
gentleman y I certainly do for the
lovely lady so we're this question is
really to help colleagues in the room
that really don't quite understand our
very important industry um that really
needs to be highlighted more in the
state of Georgia is that not true that
the funeral industry does need to be
highlighted more in the state of Georgia
it needs the funeral directing needs to
be a part of the list of hi career
demands is that not true as well
absolutely I agree with Lady and is it
not further true that we do need to
separate the license of funeral
directors and Embers in the state of
Georgia is that not true as well I would
not if the ladies so States I agree with
her but back to this bill Senate Bill
241 is it not true that this bill is
only for is optional for families that
are that want to have this type of um
service this cremation service and it
put guard rails in place to protect the
families as well as well as the
environment you're absolutely right for
those families that choose to use this
type of procedure you know I think that
maybe in another year we'll be bearing
them like the crows buried them out west
we'll be putting them on scaffolds and
things like this but it's just another
way of disposing of the remains but is
isn't it not further true that depending
on the funeral home that you use you can
probably get a really good deal by going
this route as well right is that not
true well I'm not sure about that they
tell me that this is a pretty expensive
way but we know how environmentalists
are they'll pay a little bit more to get
a little bit less but is it not further
true that I have a deal for $3,900
that'll take care of everything is that
not for other truth so ma'am so thank
you thank thank you I will be supporting
this bill and I encourage my colleagues
to do the same thank you Mr Speaker I
would certainly encourage members to
vote for Senator Williamsville and uh
let's move on to some other subjects so
why you're a wise man
and that's all I was waiting on to get
it cleared by the funeral home
caucus the other one is not commenting
so we'll just move ahead is the
gentleman yielded the well is there any
objection to the previous question being
ordered hearing none their previous
question is ordered is there any
objection to agreeing to the report of
the committee which was favorable to the

official code of Georgia annotator
relating to fair business Practices Act
of
1975 so as to band commercial cheating
services that Target students and
examinees seeking a professional license
this bill have ferred the committee on
regulated industries that committee
recommends that this bill do
pass representative Martin
representative Chuck Martin is
recognized to present Senate Bill 213
thank you Mr Speaker and all my years
down here at the capital so I've never
been dying to present a bill as much as
I have after following chairman
Powell um yeah that didn't work either
um no I I do have a a simple but
important uh measure for you this
afternoon there are companies out there
that are taking advantage of our
professional people and our students
advertising that they'll have exams
taken for you this is in college our
technical schools but primarily in where
it's most damaging is in the professions
where these companies advertise that
somebody will take your profession
Professional Licensing tests and what
we're seeking to do today is add that
practice with a new code section and
then have that code section alluded to
in the fair business practices act so
that the secret I'm sorry the Attorney
General would be the person that could
prosecute that our idea here is that
these companies that are praying on
students and our Professionals in the uh
the state of Georgia that then get a
license because somebody else took the
test and are at risk of losing that
license if they're found out so what our
Senator uh Senator kpatrick has brought
to us today and what I bring to you in
Senate Bill 213 is very simple it holds
those companies
responsible for cheating basically to
get a grade or a project done in school
or a professional licenser test and
protect the the people the students the
professional licensees and the public
state of Georgia and with that Mr
