TRANSCRIPT
----------
You
I had a little grand entrance for BLB,
otherwise known as Brandon Lamont Beach,
as he walked in the room for those
if you don't know what the L is.
I did a little bit of research
and discovered Brandon Lamont Beach.
So, good to see you, Mr. Chairman.
How are you?
What'd you do this weekend?
Did you place a bed on it?
All right, fantastic.
what do you all hear for this road naming bill is that we're working on okay well we'll
get to that one first then we've got a house resolution 256 it is our annual road naming
bill we think this is the perfect Frankenstein combination of all of the Senate road
nameings and all of the house road nameings. We did have one request that came in from Clayton County for a removal of somebody who is currently in office, which violates their house rules, so that has been removed from this list.
I would encourage all members of the Senate to browse through here, make sure that your road naming is here.
We will have an opportunity to agree on the floor. Should we miss anything? I'm going to recognize after we have to entertain emotional, entertain amendments.
So I will entertain a motion on House Resolution 256, LC393932S.
A motion do pass from Senator Lucas, so I hear a second, second from Senator Mallow.
I'll entertain any discussion or amendments.
Senator Moore.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
At the appropriate time, I'd like to make an amendment to House Resolution 256 by adding
Senate Resolution 102 to it and that is the naming and intersection for Sean
Kornaki. Sean Kornaki was a employee of the Department of Transportation who
was clearing out a road in northwest Georgia on one of the stormy nights that we
had earlier this session and he was working by himself. Unfortunately that
tree limb fell on him and he passed away in the line of duty and this is
coming a little later in session and I was hoping maybe we could we could add this
on if that'd be okay. I think it's Senate resolution 102. I'm not mistaken.
All right. I have a motion to have a second second for Senator Gouge. Chair
and more can you they're telling me that there was not an ad run can you talk
about the ad or the conflict check if either of those. To my to my understanding
The Department of Transportation actually had a resolution naming the road in the intersection, so there is no conflict.
I just got to see a thumbs up there from the commissioner.
Do you know the address or is that not necessary in this instance as well?
Well, I don't think it's necessary.
It's actually Senate resolution 347.
That's Sean Cornacchi Memorial intersection of Walker County to dedicate.
We have a motion and a second on the amendment. All those in favor, please think about saying aye. All those opposed like sign.
Amendment carries unanimously.
We're now onto the underlying bill in the discussion.
All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.
All those like sign, motion carries unanimously.
And I'll go ahead and carry this in the Senate side.
All right, we're now on to House Bill 189, the truck weights bill.
I'm going to take a little bit of chairman's privilege here, walk you through our current posture.
I have had extensive conversations with numerous members of this committee as well as the house sponsor of the bill, as well as the tenant governor's office, and there are not the votes on this committee to pass the resolution as it passed the house.
So we have spent time over the last week to 10 days as well as through the weekend, working on a sub that we think will do a number of things and the community members that sub is in your folder.
But ultimately we recognize that we're at a crossroads with the executive order that has expired and we also recognize that we're at a crossroads with our funding and some of the other underlying issues that really serve as a backdrop to this entire conversation.
The enforcement pieces and a number of other things that we have heard discussed in the two hours or so of testimony we've had on this will be addressed in the sub.
We, you'll see a sunset in the, in the sub and the reason for that is we think that we need to have a serious conversation on infrastructure funding in the state.
Georgia currently ranks six to last in terms of infrastructure funding per road mile and it's a similar number when you work, look at it on a per capita basis.
We're going to get further behind when you consider that a number of states have literally
invested billions of dollars to be their ARPA funding or their surplus is over the last
two years into infrastructure and we really have not done any of that.
We've moved money around within the program.
We've put I think $50 million of money into the baby budget, but we have not done a significant,
we've not gone to significant lengths to ensure that we're investing in the much needed
future of our infrastructure.
What we do know is that any truck weight change,
whether it's a 5% change,
as we heard from the Georgia Tech Professor,
or it's a 40% reduction in the life of a road
that we heard from the Commissioner of G.Dot,
no matter which of those you look at,
a bill is needed to, if we're going to move on truck weights,
we need to be responsible and protect the assets
of the state as it relates to road funding as well.
So you're gonna hear a significant conversation
happen over the summer into the fall,
this year has begun to look at how to address that next year.
But in a recognition of a couple industries in particular that we know that have grown
accustomed to the executive order that expired last week and then really in wanting to
honor the House sponsor as well as the Senate sponsor that have some particular needs for
their areas of the state.
We have crafted a more tailored bill that we think will address the key concerns but
will also keep the conversation open moving forward and with that I would like to turn
it over to Leader Gooch to walk us through the committee sub.
Thank you Chairman Dolezal. Committee members, if you'll look at LC-39-3928S, we can go through
the bill section by section 1. Basically, it's a carve out for the two industries that we have chosen.
That is the timber industry and the ag industry. So those are the two industries that will be given
this variant. So there will be a 10% variance of the 80,000 pound weight limit. So this will allow
those trucks hauling timber products or ag products to go up to 88,000 pounds, it will be allowed
to do so until July 1st of 2024. So it's dependent on when the governor signs this bill into law,
they would have the extra weight provision until 2024, July 1. Section 2 goes into the weight
violations and what the penalties are for that and we have it tiered separately than what we've seen before so for the first
5,000 pounds over weight which is over the 88,000 pounds there would be a 5-cent per pound penalty
That's from 88,000 to 93,000 pounds greater than 93,000 pounds
But less than 100,000 pounds the penalty is increased to 10 cents per pound
for all gross weight and then if the weight of the vehicle exceeds one hundred
thousand pounds the fine will be twenty cents per pound per pound the twenty
cents per pound or the ten cents per pound or the five cents per pound would go
back to the eighty thousand pound limit no different if you had a speeding
ticket today if you were pulled over in the city of Atlanta or back home you may
have a 10% buffer in that speed limit. For example, local law enforcement normally won't
write you a ticket for the first 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. But once you exceed
the 10 miles per hour over the speed limit, the fines would be based on the total speed that
exceeds the posted speed limit. Same thing in this bill. So if you're overweight by 100,000 pounds,
if you have a 100,000 pound weight, your fine would be 20 cents per pound back to 80,000. So that
that would be a 20,000 pound in fraction.
And so that's the, the penalties are still for a reason.
We've heard from a lot of the industry people in the room
that they're okay with the enforcement,
they're okay with the fines,
they just want to be able to have the extra weight capacity
to be able to get their products to the market.
And so especially with Ag and Timber,
we believe that this is a fair compromise.
There is a variance on this up to 88,000 pounds,
but it's only within 75 miles of the origin
of where the product is being shipped from in two.
So they would have this provision up to 75 miles radius.
Bridges, similar violations on bridges,
starts in the bottom of page three.
It deals with the overweight trucks on bridges
that are posted, so the fines would be based
on the posted weight on those bridges.
Similar the way we do today.
The other part of the bill allows for local government law enforcement personnel to enforce the weights.
It's no longer going to be limited to the Motor Carrier Division of Department of Public Safety.
This bill will allow local government law enforcement whether that city or county police departments and
sheriff's department employees to enforce the weights.
And imagine they could do that several ways they can use the manifest and the load tickets that are required to be in the trucks.
They also could have portable scales on their vehicles so they could pull the portable scales out and weigh the trucks on site just like motor carrier does it today.
And I believe that is all that we have put in the bill, Mr. Chairman.
Everything else that was in the previous bill is no longer there to add on to your earlier comments. I think it's important that this committee being engaged fully with the business community, the ag community and also the Department of Transportation over the next few years.
six to eight months. We have to get this breaking logistics plan implemented, but we have to have lots of money to do it, and we believe that people in this room are going to be a key component of that discussion.
Thank you, Leader Gouge. I want to highlight just a couple of things, either I missed or you missed, and then maybe draw a distinction between existing law and what we're doing here.
Members of the committee, if you look on line 17,
you'll see mention of outside of a non-attainment area.
And what this does is it basically precludes
this variance from being allowed in a non-attainment area.
Which, what is that?
That's the following counties.
Cherokee, Clayton, Kaweeda, Cobb, DeCab, Douglass, Fayette,
Forsyth, Fulton, Gwynet, Henry, Paul Dean, and Rockdale.
So, essentially, Metro Atlanta, this variance will not be allowed.
We will revert to existing code in basically the metro-elana area.
What is not included in the 88,000 allotment that is here, or remain at 84, is D-E-N-F
under the current code, which is granite, solid waste, or recovered materials, and concrete
that is freshly mixed or unhardened for a state of delivery of customer.
else moves up to the 88 outside of these attainment areas. The last thing, that I would
just point out, um, leader that maybe just didn't get to, was 153 to 157, allows local
law enforcement to essentially have probable cause to, um, conduct a, a, a, a, a, a,
way of a truck on their roads. Uh, we, we've obviously know that we currently have,
I think that was mentioned a couple hundred people around the state to ensure the enforcement
and compliance of these provisions.
We know that's not enough.
Leader, I think you told me that local municipalities
can purchase the scale for about $4,000.
Is that accurate?
And so we want to, we were told 16,000 for a set of four.
So we want to just ensure that local, the locals whose roads
will come under the same variance here
have the ability to enforce that.
And with that, I'm going to open up for discussion and questions.
I'm going to recognize these in the order I saw
and then come up, Senator Lucas.
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, are you saying those kind of
exclude, if I run up to $80,000,
and I get ready to come to a Henry kind,
I got to get rid of some weight.
That's correct.
Okay, I had one thing to let me remind everyone,
if you're driving on any interstate highway in Georgia,
or across the country, the weight limits 80,000 pounds,
there is no variance for that.
The only exception is if you're bringing a load
of goods out of the port, and it's on a sealed container, and it's an invisible load.
So in other words, you're going to leave Savannah's port, and you're going to drive to anywhere
in Georgia or outside of Georgia, as long as you don't stop and break that load, you're
allowed to go up to 100,000 pounds, but it's primarily on interstate routes.
Well, I'll stay at the only exception.
I understand that, but also you're saying that dump trucks are excluded from the tonnage
based on this bill is our agriculture.
Well, what about when you're doing the highway, is the folks that fixed the highway, we
took my payload too.
Yes, so the dump trucks are in this bill to remain at the 84,000 pounds that they've been
out for the however many years prior to the executive order.
Okay. It looks like Senator again, Chairman again.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Two things.
In the 75 mile radius,
this is my down foot truck,
and I love this,
this Mr. here,
and he might be able to test it.
But every time,
when somebody can't go across the bridge,
they've got to get outside
in the 75 mile,
and hopefully,
the situation will have.
And we have a lot of bridges
When I read the word radius, I do it from a straight line, so if you put the pen in the
center and you draw a 75 mile radius in a circle, then that's your radius.
How you get there is up to you.
I would suggest you talk very nicely to the enforcement officer that has you pulled over.
So for me, I noticed that this bill is small, and I was just saying, or any agency of state,
just looking at scales where these products are being delivered, is that right?
a one-year timeout is to help the ag community and the timber industry to continue what they're
used to doing for the last two years under the executive order. And so it gives us time as a
policy board to get together with our Department of Transportation and everyone in the industry
come together and try to solve a major problem that we're facing in this country and that is the
heavy trucks but also the congestion on the highways in a growing state like ours with the fastest
grow important in the nation. We have to upgrade our infrastructure and it has to start with the
people on this room. We are not talking about that in this bill. Just to be clear for the committee,
you're referencing the actual private entities, they're doing weights at a timber location that we
We heard testimony about whether we have access to those scales, we can work with them, we know we have heard from them last month, and we can talk to the fan actors that are going to exercise, they don't have that level of importance, you may need to have a truck that will hurt 30,000 women and families.
I believe with the extra enforcement by law enforcement at the local level that we will start to identify who some of the bad actors are they're going to be on secondary roads, they'll be on some of the state routes and when the sheriff's department and the police department start to pull them over and they can show
that there's bad actors in the room, they'll be signed, they'll be fined accordingly and they'll have to go to court and they'll have to pay very excessive fines.
Chairman again, I believe Chairman Anne of Attarte was nice.
No?
I'm sorry, that's Senator Mallow.
Well, Senator Beech was first on that way.
Good.
Good person.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And to the members that worked on this substitute,
I really do appreciate you and the work that you've done here.
My question is it relates to the collection of the fees
for enforcement.
If these folks are going to be on state roads,
is it going to be the local governments that collect the fees
as the state collect the fees.
What does the revenue go from the increase in citations?
Because I just have a question about that.
I didn't see where it was spelled out.
There are normal traffic citations.
If Georgia State Patrol pulls you over,
that goes to the local jurisdiction that handles that.
So I just want to ask that question for clarity
on the fees.
My interpretation, talking to the legislature,
as both portions of the fees will go to the state, portions will go to the local governments.
So local governments will get the fine revenue for the tickets that are issued by the local
governments.
In the public safety personnel, I believe, are adjudicated by the Department of Administrative
Services.
So that fine money will continue to go where it goes.
Okay, that's Chairman Beach.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to thank you as chairman and leader Gooch and really the entire committee for having
input on this committee sub.
I think it's a good compromise.
I think that it's great that it's sunsets in one year and we need to do this now so that
we can continue with the governor's executive order playing out.
But I think what we need to do and I think the reason it's important that it's sunsets
is leader Gooch said we've been studying freight logistics for four years and this needs
needs to be part of an overall comprehensive freight and logistics program and how we
fund freight and logistics and move freight and logistics through our state and yet protect
our roads and our infrastructure.
So I think this is a good compromise, it's a good start, and I would be willing to make
a motion at the proper time, Mr. Chairman.
I can chair and be a chair, any other discussion from the committee?
I don't see any, any other lights illuminators, this would be the appropriate time.
Okay.
move, do pass, LC393928S.
We have a motion, do pass, we have a second, Senator McClellan.
All those in favor, please signify by raising your hand.
I've got seven in favor, all those opposed, like sign.
One, two, three, four.
Motion carries seven to four.
Thank members of the committee, welcome Mr. Chairman.
You're just in time for us to adjourn.
So this meeting isn't adjourned.
Are you going to carry this in the Senate?
Russ Goodman is going to carry it.
OK.
You
