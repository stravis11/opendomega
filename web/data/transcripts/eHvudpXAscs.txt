TRANSCRIPT
----------
Okay, good morning everybody. Welcome to the Senate State Committee on Foster Scare Adoption. I'm going to ask Senator Reimer to say that. I'm going to send him just there. Everyone would please buy your head. Dear Henry, Father, we humbly approach you all about as your servant to many. And we thank you all for the opportunity to serve you and to serve the citizens of Georgia. God, please remind us today is tragedy impacts our country once again. And tragedy is impacted our brothers and sisters in the Middle East. That Lord God will be your imperfect and without you will be your nothing. And God, please remind us today to keep our hearts open in our minds up throughout the test only and throughout the work that we are doing. That is so important to the children of Georgia. We ask for every lesson in the name of your son who sacrificed his life for us. Our old Savior Jesus Christ. Thank you, Senator. And thank you for helping with the arrangement for our meeting today. Much appreciated it. We've been traveling on our Senate committees all of the state. So we're happy to be in Columbus today. And I also want to thank our Todd and she's going to come and speak to us and just a minute present. Oh, just a couple things before we get started. I want to ask a message. Mr. Brose, raise your hand. Yeah, thank you for being here and your staff as well. Did you just stand for your hand? Okay. Perfect. Housekeeping items. Restrooms are outside and go left. We're going to have lunch when we finish the meeting and everyone's welcome for that. The other thing is we're on a tight schedule today. We have an aggressive agenda. Someone pointed out to me earlier, but we've got a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it. So it's important that we hear from the spending people. And as many as much knowledge as we can before we make our recommendations. We do have a hard stuff at one o'clock. This meeting is being live streamed and the presentations. You don't have to take frantic notes because they will be available on the study committee website. After the meeting. Give it a few days, but you'll be able to access all the presentations. Those persona committee will be possibly printing our next although there. We do have some of the handouts in our. We'll take a look at those and you'll know what you need to chart around or not. A tentative date for our next meeting is the money after xgiving, which I do believe is. 27th November. And that'll be a wrap up meeting. That's not confirmed yet, but that's just a tentative last meeting and that'll be in the way. So that's what we're doing. I think that's something that's going to happen. I don't know. That's what we're going to come in and have a seat and. Give us a brief summary of what you got going on here. Thank you again for asking us. I think. I'll be hearing that this but I'll. Thank you all for being here today. Thank you all. Welcome you. We hope you enjoy our campus and our facilities fire here. There's anything you need. Please let one of us know. We are very happy to have you here today. Columbus Tech is one of the 22 institutions in the technical college system of Georgia. We are a single campus institution. We have about 45 hundred students in any given year. And we're going to have a lot of students in the community. And we're going to have a lot of students in the community. Is that we're going to develop the workforce. It's needed in the area that we serve. We serve six counties and largest of which is the scope. We're going to look at it today. Harris, Tolbert, Stewart, Quitman and Chattanoche County, which is a great board board is located down in South Columbus in that area. And Chattanoche County. We have. A very, we are very proud of our job placement right far right. Last year was 99.1%. It is annually between 98 and 100% for our graduates. And our graduates who have an associate degree will earn on the average $8500 a year more. And they would have earned just a household promise. So we're very excited about the millions of dollars that that boards back into our very the local economy and the state economy here in Georgia because most of our graduates do stay here. I put a little bit of information on the table in front of you that some of the programs that we have you just have a just a very high level overview on that part. But we're very excited that in November, we will be held in the ribbon funding for a renovated facility in this building where we will be expanding tremendously our culinary arts program, which is a work force. It's in very high demand here in our area. And we will be opening very shortly in November the commercial twit-crime facility that we have constructed on in South Columbus, right near the entrance to board board. Where we already had more than 100 students on the waiting list for that program. And we're very excited that we'll be able to provide additional members into the work force for an area that you all know. I'm sure it's very much in high demand here and likewise. And actually students who live in Georgia, Georgia, resident and elder, for the hood brand and the career brand will be able to complete that program in four weeks for $32. And we'll be able to enter the work force very quickly with the salary that's in $55 to see $5,000. So Columbus take really good as our best to support our students so that they can get the education training that they need to get a job, build a career, support their families and get back to the community. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. Thank you for coming to Columbus today. Thank you. After tired and we all know that work forces the number one thing we hear about us. We try to run the state on a technical college system, such a key part of that. So thanks very much for the work you're doing. Okay, next we're going to ask Lenin Lanier from DHS to come down and give us an overview. I'm going to stand point of the just about what's going on in the world of adoption since this meeting is not explicitly, but it's focused on adoption. Thanks for being with us. When you'll do that. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning again. My name is Lenin Lanier and I serve as the Director for safety and permanency, permanency for the department. I've been with the department for 29 years and thank you for this opportunity to present before you again today our work that's we're doing around the adoption. So it's getting you to pay no. When we are engaged with the family. Our ultimate goal is of course to have the child remain in the community with their family. And when that is not possible. Any child must enter foster care that I remember in the teacher that we would like that child to have with that family. And if we can't do that safely, then of course, one of the options is for a super student. Adoptions for that child. And adoption is a legal process that we have to. Several rights of the parents and that is one of the most serious actions that we contain as the department and that is terminating for a right to score a child. And in that process, we then complete another legal process which is which does involve providing another legal family for that child through the adoption process. Okay, so we wanted to touch on our role in private adoption. I will overall with private adoption to smell. We rely on our legal department. Our attorneys, the child case and agencies who we actually conduct our private adoptions. Our role primarily as the department is what we call our embassy compact replacement of children. And we are required to ensure that children needing Georgia for the purposes of adoption or coming into Georgia for the purposes of adoption follows follow the competitive requirements. And again, that is a legal responsibility. We ensure that the requirements that's needed for that child to be finalized in that with the private adoption occurs with utilizing the attorneys that request our support regarding the review of the actual process for the private options. There are times when the agency provides a gift custody to a relative of the purposes of adoption and goals, adoptions or handle by the family privately outside of the department. But we may facilitate maybe connecting that family with the children who will then facilitate that process for the family. And that is that your scene here presents the information that we actually do to see regarding our productions. This isn't all the lists there are private adoptions that occur in Georgia that you are as I stated that we're not involved in. So this is an idea of the adoption is there occur that he may get a request from the family to maybe have not recurrent supports to our folks that have services that may come to us requesting supports that the families in crisis. In addition, we may provide we receive information from our for support regarding if when adoption has actually been finalizing may receive the preclose from the report. But our overall responsibility for the adoption as I indicated it is actually the minimum responsibility because we rely on the private services that kind of facilitate and long enough to see what you're seeing. So the public adoption these are about shows that we are actually responsible for these are about to be actually facilitate. We wanted to provide a look back to give you an idea of our success regarding adoptions. You will see in 2019 we actually had the highest number of adoptions which was over 1400 adoptions. We started our train bound in 2020 up to 2022 and of course we had to address our practice as a pandemic. But we remain standing around that 1200 range for adoptions and here to be on an upward trends. So that will continue to open during terms of our finalizations for the adoptions that we are actually responsible. We will see in 2020 breaking it. 1200 75% actually said we actually finalize. We wanted to indicate the children who are eligible for adoption by age and you will see that our children zero to five. We have five hundred and eighty nine children who are currently available for adoption our highest category or our children who are between six and 12 years old where we have six hundred and 32 children. And of course the older children the child is you will see that we have a seven we have 43 17 year olds that are currently in the agency's custody that's available for adoption. I wanted to take some time to actually walk through the adoptions process for you. When a person plan is established that a child is actually a restored plan of adoption. There is as I stated before legal services request that must occur and that is a process that the workers responsible for completing what's called a TPR packet that we submit to our staff. And then the same in term will complete the petition that's the position to actually request for the term request for the termination of parental rights. I will mention that this is considered one of our barriers of what are the opportunities I would say in the process for us getting the child's trace ready for adoption. There's a lot that comes into play in just with completing the information pertaining to the packet. There's a lot of document that's required the side of the capacity and the volume that they have to manage within their region sometimes have. And then the delay sometimes it takes up to six months of us to actually get a child's case ready for court and then we have the challenge of actually getting the court things scheduled. And sometimes the court dates through the schedule as far out of six months which significantly impacts our ability to get the child out of hospital care currently. And then the next process that we must consider this is a non-nevolvable our child life history process. This is a process where we have to work here. We're providing knowledge school shows to the foster parent all the information that we have available for the child medical, and psychological, we are ready to provide this information to the foster parent. This is another opportunity for us. We have significant challenges around the developing or receiving the information pertaining to the child's medical history. So I'm just going to give you an example of the child having multiple provider associated with that case. They're maybe multiple psychologists giving what are into the child's needs that may be a challenge. And this creates a significant area of work where it's responsible for trying to identify where the child actually went for treatment. And then manage through the multiple requirements that providers may have in terms of the release of information process. So we don't have a streamlined or systematic way of requesting information that's critical to ensuring that we are adhered to the mandate of full disclosure to our care care. So this is a significant opportunity. I think for us to consider is trying to develop a way that we can provide support which is responsible for gathering these documents for you. I've been with the ages for ages for a very long time, and this is going to challenge for a very long time, just to give you an idea of how significant this is. So one of the people that I'm going to give you the number of cases we currently have with the number of open adoption cases we currently have when requirement child life history. So you will see it will be currently at 296 cases where the child life history is required and up to 296, we have 111 cases that have been referred to our private providers. And they are actively in the process of developing the final product with the child life history. The vendor has the contract with 60 cases of week that information. We have 149 cases needed additional records to be collected before or for open actually made to our private provider that we contract. So that's a significant number of cases that's waiting for additional documents just to hire right again our critical distance is for us. We have six cases that the partner is responsible for writing. We are responsible for writing children under the age of one child life history is everything else we contract out. So 95% of the work we are contracting out to our partner providers. And then we have 37 cases where we have actually going to put to make them in a rise as currently under appeal and sometimes these cases can last for a real more in terms of just getting the case heard in appeal. So these are kids that are also waiting to be adopted. And if you have that's part of the none of the full disclosure, I just say full disclosure, disclosure for our care care workers. We have a form of 29 that pretty much loads of loss in America. Yes indeed. We are preparing this case work for for termination of parental rights. And at that time, we can also submit the application for adoption assistance that will establish with a great will be for the care giver. And that's contingent upon the child's individual needs. And then there's before 150 where we have, if we're informed of the foster parent that the child that we have indeed going to for it and they have the option of be considered as an adopted caregiver and then the form 151 would have been adopted. Care giver actually indicates whether they want to be considered as a resource. So majority of our children are actually adopted by their current foster parents. And part of the process that we have to consider is for ensuring that that parent is assessed that that parent is assessed to ensure that they have taken considered possibility of providing a loan term providing a loan term care for that child. And that process is what we call the adoption consideration evaluation form that we have to complete for our care care workers. If we have an identified resource for the child process being over early quickly, we do have a, we have a number of children that requires recouping activities which we partner with our some of our provider agencies as well. And we have resources such as this is child that have never reached the child's availability for adoption. And then after that, we then complete the child I kiss your presentation to the foster parent and then the. And then we will go forward with a request that sat in square we could develop a dissertation plan with the caregiver and then move forward with the actual signing of the adoption person with the caregiver. At that time, we will submit the information to the caregiver to require request that they contact their attorney. We provide recommendations for the caregiver. If they request an information, you do have a 30 star adoption, how can we work with however this is not an idea they can of course, select whatever attorney they choose to work with. The adoption is then prepared to be finalized in security for it and I will highlight just in terms of the challenges that sometimes this can also be a barrier for us just waiting for us to get a calendar of the actual date for the adoption for the adoption. And as I indicated the adoption that finalized security for it. And to give you another set of points in physical years, we had approximately a hundred and six about just five lives, whatever. So children eligible for adoption with children eligible for adoption in their and if they have an identified resource versus children with no identify resources is sharp, pretty much indicates by age the children that are currently available for adoption. And you will see where our age group of 0 to 5 63% of our children are actually placed within their identified resource 37% are actually do not have an identified resource and these are what we consider our children that would be approved. So part of the process of course is what I mentioned earlier is the adoption assistance special needs criteria and we just just reflects the criteria for children who. The requirement for adoption assistance and as a child who or in who is in our public or private agency. And has been in our legal custody for 24 second months, a child who is a member of the civil group and a child who is going to emotional disabilities as validated by a physician or psychologist. So this reflects our ongoing monthly adoption assistance that includes our non humanitarian assistance child is eligible for Medicaid and we have paid a non current adoption related expenses that. So we have a range of 1500 dollars per child now recurring only adoption assistance and it's our private walk in and. And what I was mentioning earlier about some random that private options these are folks that come in and if the child is eligible can request our one time now recurring adoption assistance. So special services families who are eligible for adoption assistance for us are also eligible for special services up to 300 miles per year. So currently we have over 14,000 adoption assistance pay since our adoption assistance pay. So this is just for every 23 was $105 million of that $105 million, 9.4 million was paid for our 40 funding and 14 million was through state dollars in our average monthly adoption assistance expenditure amount was a little break money out for every three. So we have a basic raise and we have also have our specialize adoption is rate that's going down by categories, category one, mouth moderate, category two, series to severe and category three, medical fragile. So this is another opportunity for us. Just to note that our adoption assistance rates has in change since 2009. But our other program areas have actually seen a steady increase on going so deferring to our cost of care rates are against those who rate our ownership subsidy. Our A A rates have not seen a change in just in case since 2009. I will say that this can be coming issue for some parents when we are looking to finalize an adoption and the child is eligible just to give an example child is eligible for basic also care rates and then we have sex that child determine against the child is also eligible for basic A A rates. So that of 400 out of decreased from the child actually changing from the cost of care program over to adoption assistance program because the brings us to different. So I will just never ask another possibility for us to consider to really consider and for our recognition. I just another view of the number of children that's receiving adoption assistance is pay the ass. And this is again, this is a steady increase in the children that's actually eligible and receive an adoption assistance that you can see from our look at 2021 up to 2023. So we do partner as I indicated earlier with some of our CPA provider agencies. This is a critical partnership for us. And these agency actually work with us on identifying families for our partner place population. These are kids that have significant medical needs. There designated especially based on our adoption assistance criteria of 13 years older and our stability books and this is just a list of our current adoption services partner agencies that we are currently working with. So, by natural incentive. Just again, just highlighting our monthly monetary assistance children child is actually eligible for. Medicaid non-recurring adoption expenses, with adopted and deep-ass after-region age 13, they can't receive adoption assistance and the Georgia administration through the, sorry, I said it very briefly, and the Georgia administration raised a waiver program and used adopted and deep-ass after-region age 14, maybe else for this program, regardless of adoption, eligibility. So, again, just highlighting a partnership with our provider agency. Things are just a list of some of our full adoption services. We celebrate when a child is actually adopted. We want to make sure that at family, it has the capacity to stay the child in the home and we're not looking at seeking that child later on as a regenture into foster care. So, we have developed these posted-off supports that's reflected here on the screen to kind of help manage placements ability for each of you. And these services, I won't go from the economic budget provides, animal prices, intervention, support groups of our teams, as well as clinical training for our social work and there is who are trained to go to train other social workers on our own adoption competitive. So, that they can support these families to ensure that these kids are actually stable in these homes and we, again, don't have to consider real entries for this population of you. And one other thing that I would note before I end is that the department is active and we're looking at leveraging technology opportunities to try to determine where we have keeping the services in terms of the adoption process. We've already began looking at mapping out our process from beginning to end and looking for opportunities. So, you can't just have practice.

and what other supports can provide that will help us to ensure that we are getting children adopted as quickly as possible. So with that, I hope you have any questions. Thank you very much for your concise presentation. We're really complicated process. I have one question for you. And I think we've already covered this on for you. How long did the adoption of system assistance payments go on? So the adoptionist at the child remains in school and I have to verify this for you. But if the child continues to remain in school, the adoption assistance payments came last two. We'll end at age 19, but the medias supports open teams through age. Thank you. Other questions on the meeting? Thank you. You're talking about earlier as far as courses adoption is finalized in spirit work. You said you have a control over how I want that might take what is that average weight time for spirit work here. So that is a question that was posted. We've actually talked to this one yesterday and that is a challenge for us because we have a track that specifically, but I can. There is a way to be actually can pull that information just to be a man process for us. So I can absolutely do that. I can actually to give you an idea of how long that is taking. I can't do this. Some we just are actually doing the job that this is the operation, but then there are others that. There'd be something for the premium right to. There's a lot of people go on. Right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam. My host is me, kick in on one of these up. Your doctor process. We talked about 296 other option cases. Where documents were needed within the state. Of this number one forty one. And then one forty nine. I hear standing back brings that up to two nine. And then the number one is the county was writing the C L. Is that six included one? That six should not be included in one. Okay. That pushes that to the one ninety six number of events and the remaining thirty seven cases. So, well, right. So there are thirty seven cases, but those are thirty seven cases that have active appeals. That's out of the child history. So that that says not included in the two ninety six. Okay. Thank you. And only assistance expenditures. That I think. Chair, correct. alluded to. Is there a financial disclosure requirement through the state's adoption process where we know. What the financial circumstances are prior to the child being adopted. So, that's what the actual adoption assistance application. Does that impact whether the family receives adoption assistance or not? So, if a family that has a substantial income. What's to adopt that are still eligible for the state funding. That's great. Okay. Okay. You mentioned on the process that it was a long time fact it's hard to get information like medical information. So what are your what would your recommendation be to us about how to improve that it can be. You imagine one. So, if we could have. In this. But we have a system and way of having like a repository for all children. We're here responsible for that we go and pull this information out instead of having us go to 100 different providers similar for individual type of. There is no systemic. There is no statewide process as developed. That require the medical providers. The psychologist there is to actually. Provide information inside of say in one place. So that really is what the significant barrier is for us is known to these providers are. And we're going to be able to follow in what their individual process may be for their particular practice. So if we can have a system where there is a requirement for everyone to follow the same process. I mean that was beneficial because you hear also is we're not in here. It's just how all of the things right now. Follow up question and that. Is supposed to be where that information is for right. Is it just that it's not in there or the system can allow easy access to it or. Well, if we have access to the information and yes, we can upload that information into shine. The challenge that we're having is to actually have information because the challenge is requesting it not receiving it or requested it in the. And that's why we're using it to provide it. So we don't have the information to actually put into the system. Very good one one of the question. What percentage of children that in your heat back custody in some way. Result in a permanency through adoption. What percentage through. And I have to call that information. So you need the percentage of children and foster care. And I would that for that number. How many. I can do that. Thank you. I just have a couple of questions about the. The funding the adoption assistance. And you said that the. It hasn't been adjusted since 2000. And is that correct? And was it adjusted up in 2000 line? I'm guessing. Because I know that the. I think I know you can confirm for me. In 2009, the non occurring. And I think that the. I think that the. The adoption assistance was decreased from $2,000 to $1500. Because I. Yes. So was the monthly adoption assistance increased to your knowledge. In 2009. I will have to. Out of that response to that. Well, and I think your point was. It's. It has to. It has to move since 2009. But I know that. I think that. I think that. I think that. The. The special services that actually says the $3,000. That the family can access. Once and 12. Is that funded? Is that something that families. And actually access or is that a system? Oh no, they actually can't accept that. Yes, they. They are eligible for the adoption assistance. And if. They can't identify the supports that they need in their community. And if they can access that $1,000 for. That. Or kind of. Special services. Okay. Thank you. Great presentation. Thank you. Thank you very much. And before we move to. Tim Keller is next. I wanted to introduce a couple of our judges over here. At judge. He and judge. Kind of be your right to pants. Thank you for being with us. And I also didn't allow the committee members. We all know each other so we can get that after we get. Sometimes not everybody has. So Senator Roberts. Did you just briefly introduce yourself? Yes, Senator Rainer Roberts and this is 29. I represent all of truth County Maryway, the County Harris County. And in all of work.

I'm. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Jason. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great to meet you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Scott. Thanks. to air adoption through a live training with foster parents. And I'm currently the president of the Georgia Council of Adoption Lawyers and the State of Georgia. It's a professional organization and obviously. Thank you. And we also have staff supporting us from the Senate, from the Senate Research. We've got a legislative council here, Public Order, Lexi, who's sailing all of our, it'll be things and then have a host of their personal staff. So. Okay, so Mr. Color. Welcome. Great. Great, thank you so much for. Devon, very early. Got it. Well, good morning. My name's Tim Color. I serve as the senior vice president and litigation director and the center for the rights of abused children who were based in Arizona, but we do work nationally and at the congressional level as well. So I appreciate Dr. Mary B here this morning. Trust members of the committee. My role at the center includes overseeing our children's law clinic where we represent pro bono children who are in foster care as well as foster parents, kinship placements and my parents who need assistance to spend their individual cases, both of those cases we're in there. When we do really gate cases all across the country. So our services are available nationwide. And of course, we do policy work as well, which is primary focus of our discussion here this morning. Our mission is fact children change laws and inspire others. That mission is driven by our conviction that all children deserve a safe and loving home. In preparation for this morning, I wanted to make sure I had some sense of what's going on here in the state of Georgia. So I looked at a couple of resources to try to clear myself with what's going on so that I could offer some ideas to improve permanency outcomes for children here in the state. One of the sources that I looked at was most recent report that I'm not going federal law suit involving a wholeton in the Cal counties where the court is overseeing as a number of outcomes that the state is agreed they would aim to achieve with what they would be released to court oversight. A couple of those stood out. And obviously I'm going through all of the big categories. But one was the description of the most recent report of placement crisis. The report talked about the lack of willing and appropriate placement store. All are used with complex needs. They noted that 20% decrease in availability of defects, families like settings, the reporting period. So there were more families sitting in foster care as foster parents than there were folks coming in the front door. And noted that I continued need for a deep and focused attention on the array of placement options for children and youth with complex needs. And also noted that there were more children entering foster care than actually foster care from all three sent reported period. And that the rate of children actually here has slowed in this most recent period of recent, as you can see, that they're involved with the ongoing litigation. And of course, the result being that children are experiencing longer variations times in foster care. And as we're just discussing a moment ago, that the timely finalization of adoption of guardianships it brought to an all-time low. And then of course, defects also had recently put up some data and information showing that they were not eating their own internal permanency guidelines. There were three measures that the defects were looked at. And the results was that they were not eating any of those. Those three categories. And then I wanted to look and see how George was doing with compliance with federal law. The federal adoption is in safe families acts for the priors that services be put in place to try to identify families within the first 15 months of a child being placed in foster care. It requires the state-owned permanency hearing within 12 months. And under federal law, the child's been in foster care for 15 or 22 months. The law says that the state shall file a petition to terminate parental rights. Unless the child is being cared for by a relative or the court claims it can tell the reason that termination is not an child's best interest or that the state had not provided the required services within required deadlines. One of our friends, the National of the American Enterprise Institute, looked at the state-by-state and court of charge to see how states were doing compliance with federal claims, in particular, that the measure that I just talked about was released this year, March of 2023. And George Arranks, 34 out of 50 states were compliance with federal guidelines, the measures that I just talked about. So strikes me that we need to focus our discussion days on increasing the number of placements available for children and improving those permanency time-tracks. So this was the conclusion of the ongoing litigation report that I mentioned that I'd repeat prior to coming to the state. So the title of finalization, guardianships and adoptions, following a termination of parental rights as requirements, mitigating trauma and ensuring children achieve permanency so that they do not engage out of foster care with no legal paths. Now, there are some strong laws in place already in Georgia that I think are important to permanency. But first is that you have a requirement that defects are conducted in immediate relevance for children and child interest foster care. The requirement is that that would be done within the first 30 days. You also have a family and child stability act with all of them mentioned briefly. And you also have a law of the books that allows the restoration of parental rights for older people who have been in care for a period of time when the circumstances have changed and the parents are being safe, all of which are great. There are immediate relative search. Again, when the child comes into care, T-packs is required to complete document in writing and file with the court with a 30-day list of what they have done to conduct a diligent search for relevance. This was a law that we had asked in Arizona, my organization also helped ask this law here in state of Georgia. In Arizona, after we passed it, what we did determine was that simply filing the reports of court marks and facts would really need it to be up the law. So actually this past session, we went in and we required the courts to make specific findings that our department trials at the area of Arizona had actually been actually included in the relevant search report things to proceed maybe worth looking to see. Conducting an audit here in the state to determine whether or not the 30-day requirement is being complied with and perhaps the powering courts to make findings that, in fact, diligent search was a conducted, that these electors did not have a court permanency. You also have a law that says that the trial is pending a placement for 12 months. There is a presumption in place that placement is the best, will be the best place for that trial of the future and that absent, finding that it's in the trial, that's just to move that trial, if deep-atch tries to move the trial for 12 months, that the deep-atches fail to make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan, which is a hefty penalty because it involves with only a federal cost, if that timing is made in that case. So this is important, this is a really important law to ensure that children aren't moved unnecessary. And it provides a nice incentive to find a safe and doable relative placement as as quickly as possible. And then this is a law that, you know, can really serve as a law, not just for George or but also for the nation, when children remain in care for a long period of time with no perspective and object placement, it's sort of a chance to change the parent set and able to overcome the reasons the child was in care and at first instance, there is a process here at the state to restore parental rights. So I brought you this morning to 10 ideas for approving permanency outcomes in the state. Attorneys for children reducing court delays, ensuring infant adoptions in a year, streamlining adoptions for reduced, expediting foster licensing in ways similar to kinship and sometimes be expedited, eliminating regulations that are unrelated to child safety in the licensing of foster parents, other tank foster parents, streamlining the process for former foster parents, interstate reciprocity and recruiting PEP-PENTI-ASters. So let me go through these quickly, I'll let her respect time. One of the big questions that the center for rights of these children is made in Arizona and nationwide is the question to the tall children and foster care are represented by legal counsel. Here in Georgia, that's I have a standing. Children are appointed an attorney who represents the child's best interests. We believe that the better practice is to appoint attorneys for children who represent their legal rights who actually have a 25 relationship with the child, load the child the duty of loyalty, and in jurisdictions that have lawyers, studies have shown that the exit care of the three and a half times faster, the experience to replace them to get more educational stability, and they see more services stock and reporting, including sometimes parents, children's attorneys seeking services for parents. And there's one important point I didn't include here, these studies also tend to show across the board that there's no adverse effects on reunification rates. One of my favorite studies was a firm in West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the few jurisdictions that have this administrative advice attorneys for children's zero to 12 who are in foster care. And again, these are the findings that resulted in that jurisdiction being here to the rest of the state. So some really important opportunities there. House of view is an important accountability mechanism. If you have somebody who could try to enforce some of the rights and timelines that exist, anything state can federal law. And here's one of the things that we've done is we've required that a party wants to extend a case passed state and federal timelines that they actually must show that there are extraordinary circumstances to justify any delay over 30 days. And we require that there be substantial evidence presented before the continuance is in the child's best interests. And Arizona, when we started our work five years ago, the average time for an infant to be adopted was two years. And we sent for a requirement in law that for every infant who was entering here, that the state made a goal of insurant act was placed in a perspective about the placement within the first 12 months of the case. And we have been successful in meeting that measure in Arizona, which is significantly reduced the time to adoption for infants who are entering care. We've also worked to streamline the adoption process for older youth by putting in some timeframes around the home studies and the hearings that are involved to adopt an over-use. And we define this as 16. So for youth who is 16 and who is, what to consent to the adoption, to an adoption, we require that the time study be done within six months and that the hearing reset within three months after completion of the home study. So we try to put some faster timelines around, do I say months, I talk in weeks, sorry. Six weeks for the home study, three weeks for the evaluation of the adoption here. And then another thing that we're doing is taking a look at state laws that allow for the expedited review and placement of children with kids. And seeing if there any lessons that could be learned to streamline the same processes or licensing foster parents. There's no doubt that foster parents actually throw them at it, background checks. There's important trainings that they need to be provided and they need to understand what they're walking into and they have received a foster parent. I didn't mention this front of my foster parent. I saw my wife excerpt, this foster parent's parent has run a group of years, those experiences that led me to ultimately join the organization currently with. But nevertheless, there are always barriers that can be produced and ways to expedite lessons in foster parents. And typically those lessons can be learned from whatever processes already exist to expedite a face of children with kids. I can evaluate unnecessary barriers. This picture is of my colleague, Darcy Olson, who is the founder of President of the Center for the Rights for the New Children. For the children that she fostered and adopted, Darcy's actually had 10 babies in her home. And the reason why she's at Baines is that when she originally applied to be a foster parent, she thought she would take an older child. But the room that she had did not have a separate closet, had a wardrobe and a dresser, but because there was no closet, she wasn't permitted to take teenagers. So these are the sorts of areas that can potentially be eliminated, reduced to open up the front door and improve more families into foster care. But there's a bigger problem, it might have painted the desk, but we've improved what the family has ended up foster care systems to serve as placements. There's a much bigger back door that families are wanting through states all across the country are losing more families than they are or in the end that front door. So if that can find a way to retain foster parents, there's three ways that I think we can do that respect for us and re-engage many of the foster families who are interviewed as they're leaving, say they just did not feel like they were respected by the agency through the process. We've got to find a way to respect the heart rate of foster parents through, but this is the real key, I think, is giving foster parents an opportunity to rest and have a place to, so often if you don't have a child in your care agencies closed licenses, they don't want to maintain open license use. Finding the way kids' parents are an opportunity to put their license on pause, rest, restore themselves, and then re-engage in that process is really credible. We've proposed laws in Arizona that would create a separate licensure category so families can take up a moment. And then reopen that license really easily, maybe just to re-conduct that life safety inspection that the majors have with family and get them back up and running. And if you don't want to give that separate licensure category an idea, maybe find a way to run before a foster parent's back to the report. Another thing that surveys find is that many foster parents have been taking care of their daughter without being a child or having a close in license one or two years later would be very interested in coming back and serving it once again. So what they find is that in order to do so, they literally have to start from the very beginning and be everything over again with a really daunting process to close to that home study process would start to finish at 12 weeks of classes at the background checks, which are important to the status of the baby deal. But I know ways to say that if you've served previously, we have a process I wish you can re-engage it doesn't require every single Marspe check to get. Something else to look into is reciprocity between states. This idea, because it actually stems from a personal experience, my wife and I had an eight year old child in her care, she's been in care for five years. She's injured when she was three years old. She spent her entire life bouncing between group homes and shelters with her siblings. And once parental rights were terminated, they broke up to siblings and put them in family-like placements like our family. We were only the second family she had with her with an employer, foster care, and she just couldn't adjust to the number of kids we had. The department decided she needed to be at home with just one parent, which was a real difficult challenge. And ultimately she ended up being profiled over television station and a family that called in and then licensed in Illinois and had actually adopted nine kids. But they weren't licensed there, so now we found ways to make it work and that is the value of the top. But there've been a rest of the process. A rest of the process, they would have been able to wait then much quickly with the adoption. But she is doing really well with that family, by the way. All right. And my last idea, I can't resist the illiteration, so I said for proletarians. A really good idea is to recruit empty nesters older families. I go in and adopt my boss, by the way, just to discuss these are folks who have the experience. It got the necessarily life skills to come in and really help some of these kids. And we've got to go to have real significant needs. And this may not be a law that we've passed, but this is something that agencies can do. This is something that we can force in that for a sense. Last slide. I know you'll have access to this. The underlying links are actually

things to some of the bills that we asked in Arizona involving some of the ideas I've discussed quickly this morning. And I'm not talking about a link for our website because the fader this month or early next month will be launching a number of toolkits and model legislation, any of which involves some of the ideas that I just discussed this morning as well as a number of other ideas in calling a reform with the healthcare system that would work on Arizona, very education and children searching and trying to prevent missing and traffic kids finding missing and traffic kids. So those all will be available very soon on our website. So just be checking back on that or I'm going to be on the other side once those issues are launched. Thank you so much and be a question from that dancer. Thank you very much. I do have a couple of questions. I really like the right there about making it easier for foster parents to take a break and then come back and I know the agency's been working on a process easier for those parents. I believe that we already that our kids and care have the right to turn in Georgia. As I understand it, they're appointed an attorney who serves as a guardian which means that the attorney works as the child best interest which is different than what sometimes referred to as a client directed or expressed wishes model where the attorney represents the child in the same way that the attorney represents the parents in the case. Okay and the other questions that I had as we we also have a what we refer to is the shot clock time report that that has to do with the timeline to permanency. I'm going to see in that yet but I'll be looking at it in that because I agree with you that streamline that process is really important. Other questions from Danny? I just want to be clear when you talk about streamline in the process, planning toward adoption. You are not already talking about shortening the time that the state invests into reuniting the child with the family? I am not. So are you talking about once Toronto rights are terminated then the clock starts then and we start moving toward adoption? Well I'm talking about providing the appropriate services as city can and to parents to facilitate the reunification process. But there are still timelines involved in terms of how long you wait to turn make parental rights once the service is had begun. Now I mentioned like the little girl might have been in foster care for five years before the state decided to pursue termination rights which I would say is just far too long. So the services must be provided that children shouldn't be forced to linger in foster care as well. So I know. And I don't think anybody would discredit with your own bad concern is that each case is you think and for someone to have lingered for five years if there were appeals from the birth parents or from other family members that had been processed to the court. Sometimes those were factoring to the time that it took to get to where we needed to get to. But in Arizona is reunification the priority? Yes. Everything reunification is always the priority. Well, I mean that's not possible. Yeah, no, it absolutely is. In my organization, that's a place for any child is with his or her mom and dad or mom or dad. It can be safely written by us always to keep priority. The priority in Arizona is our priority at the center for rights of being children. But at the same time we believe that children do deserve highly permanency. And that's really important to their identity. I'm sure that they have a permanent home where they can feel secure and safe in life. I think this is true. Thank you. Yeah. So can you speak to how Arizona is able to do an adoption in one year? Well, also making sure that the rights of the biological parents are not being encouraged to run. How is that process possible? Yeah. So the law is that they are in a prospective permanent adoption within one year. That is the goal that they must meet at their place within a year in an prospective permanent adoption. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Where is that? To talk to us. Is there any state in reciprocity? Is that sounds like an awesome idea? I'm not aware of a single state that is doing reciprocity. Yeah. I wanted to point out to many that you do a document in your packet that's not related to anybody's PowerPoint and it is from the National Conference of State Legislatures. And it's a summary of state efforts to streamline adoption processes and whether any of those are worthy. I haven't really studied that problem yet, but that will be posted on the committee website for any better to look at. Thank you very much to your presentation. The interviewer asked for a question. Where? What is your agency's definition of new cell? Well, the reason I said, on the recent on asTechVices without the state in Croatia for a year. And that's one of the frustrations that we have. We dealt with so many years as what is the definition of an abused child? There were so many kids that were in horrible situations with an apparent. When just actually we're taking no further responsibility for the child. Yeah. It's not an easy question to answer quickly, but obviously there would be physical abuse, sexual abuse. There would also be mental and emotional abuse that occur as well. I think addressing the definitions of both abuse and neglect are really important. It has some kind of neglect can be as sub-super just taking a child because of poverty, the situation where neglect is too low or so I think ensuring the definitions of when a child should be removed from a whole or very bitter and it's not easy. It's not easy, I just want to say thank you. Thank you Mr. Tom. Christine Walter. We're here. And then after Christine we got one person on the Zoom. That's John. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Christine Tom. I am a licensed clinical social worker. Former foster parent is a clinical doctor parent and I was asked and it's really to come and share part of our story. I'd like to start asking you to imagine that you're very cold. You just played outside the snow all day long from so to before and you come in from the very near temperature. You know nothing more than a warm shower is a hot cocoa. So when you come find that shower running and love seeing hot cocoa with wood, you're using sparkles on top. Your wishes came true. You jumped in that warm shower. Now if any of us in the room have ever experienced that, you know that that warm shower you crave first. It stains. It burns. The thing that you crave so much for you is counterintuitive to how it should be. This is a story with which I'm going to share with you today about our adoption journey. While I understand my time is limited on the topic as much of the details as I can help you understand how our dream of adopting, providing forever home for a child of need, how such have it can our lives and truthfully narrow it across me mom. I came from a home in which adoption was at the fore. My mother was adopted and no more siblings was adopted. I had a drink of adopt from a very young age. As a single person I had a panel of foster parents. I believe in this and I want Dr. Bradwood to be in my master's social work. When I tell you this history, just tell you I was no stranger to adoption. The adoption issues to trauma and all the topics that I thought would make me of a good candidate for a doctor's child. So after my husband and I were married for several years we opened our further fostering which we did and then we considered adoption. We developed classes with all the books and approached our matching phase with great seriousness and thoroughness. We sat in our initial stack and we heard about earlier with now our son. We read all the histories we asked some key questions which I still recall. One of those you read about the necessity that had been increased since 2009 when our child was not matched with a base level subsidy. So his experience as a social worker and foster parent I asked why because it's a history you're telling me is true this doesn't make sense. And the response that I got was oh he just had a good caseworker. That may have been true but in fact our son had many many many caseworkers. That second tell from all the documents that I read was to attend. This is an area that needs attention to maintain skilled caseworkers with a history and social work that really understand the dynamics. Speaking of the time my son was in foster care we talked about that time one today it was two and a half years before he went to go to our home. His biological mother was terminating her rights less than one year at the case plan and his father while he still had rights was in prison for child molestation for a victim under the age of three. My child would never should have never been cared at all. He was six when we met him well beyond those of the adult mental milestones that are key that I know in social work and trauma. He was with the same foster parent for much of that time which meant he had another major disruption in this childhood when he came to our loving care and his parental fill home. Back to that staffing with our son. When we were finishing up his caseworkers that she had one more question. If you adopted you know there's lots of questions you're no stranger to this. Yes what would you do if you had a violent episode? That's when I looked to each other quite confused because this wasn't any of the story we were provided. We scoured, broken. Our answer was something like well of course we would love him and figure out how to help but then we asked one of our own why are you asking that question and never thought it was simply that it was a standard question. The thing about the look of the staff that I've stuck with me and I spoke desperately wanted to be a mother of actress to come. We proceeded with the next steps which we've been out on for you today and we followed everyone's recommendation, recommended to you. Where followed was this with his caseworker and ours when we talked about some of the ordinary haters. It might seem kind of strange to some of you but it was almost a perfect child who robot it. One of the things he said is I'm feeling frustrated. Therefore I used my tools to go to my room. I know she showed my house right now that's not more. So I brought up and asked questions and I was told to relax and enjoy being your parents. So again, worst of time I can start. So we started our student-based son in therapy so we could all adjust to one another. About six weeks or so and some things shifted. The remains of frustration bigger than the same age peers that you're screaming, breaking up things. There were some of the things that just didn't seem to be right. Our bread box and our mouth adoption and attachment services. So I've heard a lot of positive outcomes from families that attend bond enhance. I found one in Florida that said we were to attend. Well our adoption was finalized. We had to state permission to attend which we did. I was so hopeful during a particularly close bonding event. I saw something in my child's eyes changed. Exploring at me and screaming worse and appropriate for the second day. We had tapped to assist the piece episodes continued throughout this experience. We had tools left and we were better prepared. We came home and we began using all of those tools. Then the school began calling for the issues starting with the breaking up school work. In the long run progressing the front-end chairs, the tagging staff to the point of growing and believing at his hands. The classrooms were evacuated to keep other children safe. But this wasn't in his history. Home wasn't any better. Ols and walls, those we bought that would be cut up at most of other things. The consulted case workers who told us it would settle down once it finalized. So we were stated with all the tools because again, a licensed couple social worker, I knew what to do. We went to project AdAbstormenta, a sense of family intervention, and we had to talk to the psychiatrists for medication, and to the school meetings and professional meetings, great access for any needs, read even more books, and have blood together through. We saw the arms on the store and we feel safer. But also how far is it? Regis could come on and seemingly nothing, the nana that was challenging to open a single cop that they just didn't ask about for it, right? Or asking if he was going to take a shower with that thing. And not chancements. These are different. These were hours and nights. These were volume turrets by neighbors. This was violence. I was attacked with curtain rods, air conditioning nets, broken hangers, and various other things. Still we tried to use love, understanding, therapy, hope, and prayers. I was scared, but we were told it would get better. Once he understands permanency, it will get better. So then I before finalization I cried, I sat outside this precious and horrible voice from, who had a lot of dearly, who let him pick out the bedding and paint hellers, and I saw a hearing that this was our feature. Lending to the hope that it would give it to me. We finalized 2015 for 2016 and it was a good day, you guys. We went to court, we had pictures taken, we went to a boxy grill, we went to Delta Bay, and all that wrong, we had a Swedish, good, candy fish. With a note that said, it's official and adopted. And there was joy for all of us. The last is for a day or two. School started in our community shortly thereafter. There was a hopeful time of trying to kind of do a routine in a new school year that those wages persisted. Sometimes in the middle of the day and sometimes in the middle of the night. There was what asked what triggers it. I mean, it really never was anything. And then sometimes in the midst of managing a lot in life, life goes your curveball. Two weeks after finalization, after my husband had already lost his job, I think the week to take care of these moments. And getting kicked out of my program and other time that I was pregnant. During my own history, we told no one for four to five months. During this time, when he did not know he was going to be a big brother, we took our sons to the beach. He never seen the ocean before. We had an epic day. The ocean was awesome, the sandcastles were tall. Yeah, that's pretty important. There were potential razor-blad and old military work, roadage trolley, and we even allowed the check on the hotel room's head. There was joy. And then that night I was looking to be in shows by my child. My husband and I slept in shifts the rest of that trip. New beer and tennis beer. But we moved forward. You talked to me about being a big brother of open therapists, so I'm understanding consulted previous case workers to make sure the Zingard Reckson campaign consulted professionals from our attachment camp. We were told that we had better ones that they didn't get to their end. It wasn't. I managed to rage with the school and the family member helping provide care while giving birth on the phone. My husband missed labor classes, because it wasn't safe for us to leave our child with anyone untrained to handle them. And the day came, we came up from the hospital. Again, he tried to attack. But then lunch, the I was first 10, 13, those of you unfamiliar military hospitalizations, because those are all the other side of the box action. Sister was not in my bowl. That's very well done. It's really good to have all these. Because your time is limited. It was a professional I want you to know that 80% of our brain grows before work four. Our son was with his biological mom until he was born without ever having received an immunization medical care or any consistency. There's gas where he was involved and did not find them. When I stand under the guidance of the best professionals, that ever has been studied at your hospitalizations. This does not work with children with severe attachment issues. They feed the disorder. The staff there change every three days and every 12 hours with no requirement of connecting. So therefore that's the only thing we learn. So we all get further programs and other states trying to help find continued help find help for others continuing to handle side of actions. We use programs I believe in six states. At one point our son was discharged from specialized boarding school for children with attachment issues. Due to choking other children and then decapitating their staff animals. When I went back to our post adoption worker in our and our county, we were told to bring in home and use partial hospitalization program. So I was away from our mom between nine and three and many times while we were driving our son's driving the attachment. This was not an option for us. Our son had written down ways he would kill me and his sister. He had told us verbally, he told defects, case workers, therapists, teachers, police officers, and really anyone who would listen for a long run. When we asked her more help, we were told that would you not do anything because of his age, because criminal, he was still under 12 at this time. Unless he did some things in the minor title. So I sent a police report that noted injuries to me that he caused and owned up to. Yep, we always the family worked asking to wait for the injuries to happen to have a baby and then talk. We can actually with an advocacy group, right out of this, which is really called this understand the illustration of the chat with any of you in the beginning. Reaction to the attachment disorder is just that, but this ordered by the attachment. And while many kids in foster care and adopted situations have attachment issues, there is a percentage that has severe disorder at one time son. A harder we loved, the more he reacted. What he wanted and created hurt him and he rejected it verbally or emotionally and physically. While he has some injuries from his past emotionally, as far as it will never be a emotional visible. So today, after many years of terminal, injuries caused by our son, thousands of dollars of damage to our home, stolen not a smart fortune, let's go on, but my time is limited. We tried desperately to make our adoption look like how I wanted him, created it to look. Today, we found what works that we spur today. Currently, we pay out a pocket, our subsidy covers maybe half of what we pay for a private group coming in another state with a great understanding of attachment issues. My son is now navigating high school with continued thoughts of hurting. But no actual issue is in almost two years because he's not being required to attach to somebody who cares for him the way we do. I talk to him about every two weeks for about 15 minutes, which is always able and willing to do at this point. He tells me what he's eaten and he's got the washing movie and what Jordy currently has at this location. He occasionally reminds me that he was still killed, maybe he lived with us, but he's okay or not. Most people don't understand how a child can cause this much fear, intimidation, and violence. But we've all seen stories of the mother who was driven by emotional and illicit car after her child. Out of fear, that is one of our son experiences when he feels, when he feels love. How a kid wanted a family so much, can he live with us? Oh parents, you wanted a kid so much, can't have a member there. How we can be afraid, I can only tell you you only know who you've experienced it, and I'm connected with families across this country experiencing the same. So I was also asked to say what's needed? Transparency, I believe the day that they asked us about the violence that those caseworkers knew. In fact, my son once told me that his foster mom had told us in the walls before we came to our first visit with him, and he was told not to tell us. We did not get the luxury of knowing the full truth of the past history. I don't know that we would have any different decision if there was information not given. Education, remember, there is a spy trade, onto a top school of social work in our state. The bedding of personal interests, my master's degree included about 10 to 20 minute lecture on attachment disorders. Caseworkers that tell us that we'll get better with love and time, our illiberal and relieve the family struggle and make, to make sense that their experiences, experiences with the economy. We need resources for children with extremities in our state. There are not resources that fit our family. Our child was two young, two severe, two smart programs that were offered. I had a full three inch binder, full of resources from our state and may are in our country. We were either too poor or too rich for them. We need resources for families coping with the effect of post-secondary trauma from raising kids from hard places. We need laws that protect families. We've connected with families throughout this journey that have faced charges for failing to pick up their children who have threatened to hurt them. We were able to navigate this without really pushing simply because we have a significant financial investment to do so. And because of my poor, I believe that some connection to him is better than him going back in the foster care. But I'm his nurturing enemy. He knows I love him and support him on an agonist planet. And I'm that hot water on his cold body. I'm here today because I truly believe that shamed eyes on storage or cold and safe places. I love my son with every ounce of my being. I hate that I cannot live with him and be safe. I hate when I see other siblings and I. My son has never asked about my daughter since leaving his sister. And my daughter, if she hears his name, has nine fingers per day. This is not the picture of adoption that I wanted hoped for and prayed for. And I work tirelessly to try to make. Even after being tempted to be killed, then spit on. We need groups like you willing to look at the hard truths. We're going to know that adoption is filled with grief from the very beginning. And willing to ask a hard question and do some hard things. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much for sharing your story. And I feel that some of your credentials and your art or the ones that were chosen for this situation. Thank you for being with us. Questions from the committee. Thank you very much for being here. Okay, we're going to have one person come in by a exam and she wants us to watch a quick video. And then we're going to take a five minute break and then come right back. So, Linda Johnson and this is her. The All in Fostering Futures helps move the foster care system to a better expectation. The expectation that children will thrive when they leave the government system. But when they don't, we have a network of nonprofits, churches, businesses, and other alumni who all make a difference and all are working toward. Thriving people. So, I think the retreats have really helped me with getting some mentorship. People are like Lance and I mean even Greg, all the older guys that even if they don't have kids, but they give me this outlook on what it is to be a better man, how it is to growing up. I mean I'm 23. Sometimes I feel really lost but they really help point me in the right direction and I know I can text them, call them if I need something. They really, I mean watching my son just run around and have so much fun today. The yesterday was great. I mean he just gets to do his thing and everyone loves on him and supports him and supports us. So, as a father I mean they, I just gained some more community and family. That's why I really appreciate it. One of the things I would definitely encourage all foster care youth to do is build community, either other alumni, other men, other women, if you look up to other professionals and you know it can support your professional life as a father, as a mother, it can support you in your career and just be super intentional about building a community because you never know the door that can open for you and support you need as you seek out community and as you go along life. So, what I've seen happen with the retreats is these young people have walked into my home, extremely nervous, shy, not confident and not sure that any adult can be trusted or have a commitment to them and a year later I see trust, I see love, I see confidence in a way that I just never expected. I'm here thank you Madam Chair and the committee. I hope you enjoyed that quick video and it's a real honor to talk to you about foster care and adoption this morning and just for context I was the Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families ACF in the US Department of Health and Human Services. ACF had 65 programs in over 62 billion dollar budget. It was in this capacity that I learned the most about what works and what is not working for vulnerable populations throughout our country. In 2019 ACF created the All-In Challenge where we worked with governors to focus on two priorities around children and youth in America, nationally many governors participated and many saw good success but the definition of success was questionable. Success is all about the young people in our system.

which you saw some of them in the video. Success is about hearing what works when the system is raising our children who are victims of abuse and neglect. Success is when you can answer yes to this question. Would you want your own child raised the way our system raises our foster children? I'm going to touch on three priority areas and others have talked about this and after hearing Mr. Keller and others it makes me excited that there is a focus and that's good. But the importance of quality, stable education, the importance of stability and attachment in life and the importance of quality and available behavioral health and trauma services. Those are critical three points. I have always been that person and maybe you all have been too that no one wants at a cocktail party. Especially when asked what do you do? I go into the lengthy diet tribe about poverty, human trafficking, child care and abuse and neglect. What I've learned is that as I share what I do I notice that I don't have a focus about our systems to share. There's no integrated system focus, no integrated system success. I also learn that with focus any system can be impacted but we seem to play whack-a-mole with the issues impacting the most vulnerable of people and it is not working. So I learned that focus and follow through is critical. Focus on the things that hit the first dominoes over so the rest of the dominoes can fall on their own. Focus not until something gets hard or political people change office. Focus until we move the needle and we make a difference and this is hard to do in human services in politics and especially in child welfare. ACF ask governors to look at two parts of the system. Run end in the high percentage of children and youth who are removed from their homes due to the consequences of poverty. I believe that by integrating systems and getting government, nonprofit agencies and faith-based organizations wrapped around struggling families before child protection is called we could significantly reduce the number of children who enter our system and then get stuck while parents figure out how to get their children back. Second, we look at the number of waiting children whose parental rights had already been terminated. We talked about that and who are waiting for that permanent home. In 30% of these cases the child was in the home that was waiting to adopt them but for court hearings or paperwork to be finished. So until that happens the case worker goes out every month paperwork needs to be filed a lot of workload while we're waiting for that finalization of adoption or permanency or guardianship or whatever that permanent plan is. In these situations I know from the bottom of my heart that there is no intention to traumatize children by waiting but that because of frequent moves from one foster home to another the children go to bed at night wondering if tomorrow would be the day the permanency becomes final or would it all blow up and would they be moved again and that compounds the trauma it compounds the attachment issues. In 2019 and 2020 we had approximately 127,000 waiting children and I loved when we saw the numbers for Georgia in 2019 and 20 your highest number of adoptions and that I love seeing that that focus made a difference. The challenge was to find safe permanent homes for all of the children. The challenge was for all individuals in this country to be all in whether it was for quality childcare excellence in reading at third grade or to eliminate true and see for teens or whatever someone's personal passion is for kids. The all in for our children and in your case your children in Georgia it was exciting to watch 127,000 waiting children they reduced to less than 119,000 in two years. One of the years included COVID so I can't imagine what the numbers would have looked like had we not have the pandemic. One state and you've already heard about this and I did not note Mr. Keller was going to talk about this but Arizona took advantage of the crisis and the shutdowns and they did adoptions virtually. Their numbers of adoption during that year were higher than some of their years when we didn't have the pandemic. It was exciting and amazing to see the success of virtual adoptions and the long-term success of not seeing more failed adoptions so we don't see any correlation there. It was heartwarming to see Oklahoma get down to less than 400 waiting children and Arkansas the last time I checked was down to less than 375 children and then New Hampshire. We look at now granite New Hampshire is probably the size of Atlanta but they had come down to 36 waiting children and again the ones that are currently still waiting it's medically fragile it's helped people with it's with intense mental health rad that you just heard about the reactive attachment disorder. The focus on in these states was so incredible and permanency and success was the priority. Even more important with this focus there were less children staying for long sense of time in the system and less children aging out because they had permanent connections. Now this isn't a long-term research project and because the focus has changed in many areas there is no evaluation as to whether my efforts would have seriously impacted the system over time but I like to think it was a start although I don't have access to new data I firmly believe that with focus on these two issues we not only would have a healthier would have healthier families but we'd have healthier communities reduced domestic violence substance use better mental health less unemployment and so much more because you've pushed community helping community on the back end our children would be less traumatized and be healthier and thriving as they move to adulthood. In fact with these two areas of focus I believed we could have a child welfare system 30 to 40 percent smaller and with less children in the system there would be more funding for prevention intervention in crisis there would be more time for case workers to see faces rather than just cases and the workloads would be manageable. Can you imagine a system where case workers can get excited about their days burnout is reduced and outcomes are a priority rather than compliance? So as I talk to governors I also asked to meet with groups of young adults who had aged out I truly wanted to hear about the childhood experiences of these individuals so I created an advisory board of foster alumni who helped us identify areas to be fixed and then as politics has it I went home at home I was contacted by some of the alumni I had gotten to know I was asked if they would come to color if they could come to Colorado for a sleepover vacation not a visit not a gathering but a sleepover vacation that specific wording because many had never had a sleepover at a friend's house and even more had never gone on a vacation so I said yes to about five young people and about 25 young people later our first sleepover vacation eating some mores wishing climbing mountains laughing cooking playing games more some mores took place the young men asked if I would do a men's retreat because they really didn't know how to raise children they didn't want to do what their dads had done to them they wanted to care for a wife or a family in fact they wanted to learn how to tie a go on a date work on a car manage money and the list kept growing they made a list of what they really wanted to learn that's when all infostering futures was born since then we have had five retreats including a mom's retreat a woman's retreat parents retreats men's retreats and now they want a grief retreat because of the number of sibling disconnections that happened while they were in foster care and they want to grieve that and so we're working on how we would make that happen but at these retreats we laugh we really laugh we support each other we learn and experience healing in safe places the all-in-family has grown in these last two years and I I loved when Mr. Keller one of the things he said as a recommendation was retirees getting kids I did come home from DC thinking I was retiring and now we have in all-in over 100 young people who some call us mom and dad and I've never did I'd be doing this so we have grown we've gone to done all holidays together weddings baby showers we assist with employment advice house purchases and much more I didn't know how critical play and laughter in safe spaces was and it led and is leading to so much healing you all know the statistics I'm sure you've heard them for these young people aging out it's dismal and yet we have found a way to help individuals whose first words to me were you're not going to like me I had four failed adoptions I had this and after so much trauma do we really expect them the kids when they age out become healthy adults so we heard over and over in all your meetings stability and attachments stability and attachment and I know that our first goal is the safety of the children we remove but as years go by is the state the right entity to be raising children and are we okay with the number of children who never find a family or a permanent situation before being released as a dog and I'm sure you've heard it's approximately 20,000 a year is there a reason we don't let children who are moved from home to homes stay in touch with friends they made in previous homes or is it truly beneficial to not stay in touch with siblings or to be separated with little notice or reason I heard over and over from the young adults that if they would have been allowed to call siblings or friends that would have been life changing breaking and leaving relationships behind is traumatic and leaving relationships behind every time over and over again do we wonder how they will find work when we don't even let them learn to drive or they are in 30 different schools and sometimes 20 or more foster homes do we wonder why when we can't find the right foster home or bed for a child they sometimes wait in a detention facility while we work the case or do we agonize over how pelling our youth because we don't have enough mental health facilities that know how to transition our children successfully these are just questions I keep asking myself not to be total downer but seriously there are ways to deal with this Georgia you are doing many many great things that I have seen throughout the country to why don't we look at the other programs that have success why aren't we improving and developing strong awesome mental health behavioral health systems if we did this would less parents lose their children would their beefy or shootings would children be safe to learn I mean really learn in school and do we wonder why we don't adequately fund behavioral health grama is no longer a buzzword post adoption services work and follow up to make sure a child is still safe and an adoptive home is critical family wraparound supports nonprofit and faith based respite all works comma informed care should be a priority for everyone from the staff to teachers to parents to foster an adoptive parents to pastors mental health specialists everyone who may be involved with the systems but normalizing childhood is that rocket science one young lady at my woman's retreat said she laughed more in three days with her daughter than she did in her entire 18 years of childhood that's a heartbreak but the importance of stability and attachment for children's brain development is not new information but why does it get lost in the crisis of the day quality education we've heard that I'm going to add what we heard earlier stable quality education matters I truly believe that quality education which you all in Georgia are doing a good job on are provided to provide higher education for our kids the fostering success act is a model legislation but don't we can't forget tech schools and apprenticeships and tutors for any child who may move more than two times in a foster home or school so they don't fall behind and they congratulate from high school and move forward tutors are really important keys for these young kids quality education will have a positive end goal but what if our foster children aren't removed from the classroom for mental health physical health oral health and court meetings those little things are important Georgia I have spent time here I met with your governor back in 2019 and and I believe truly believe that you have the entities the government the nonprofit agency the faith-based entities the people to focus on fixing the system on working together not in silos but truly working together to do for these children what you would do for your own and in the end I believe you can be one of the first states in this nation to conquer this issue what if the many systems involved with the children all came together at the same time can make decisions together with that perfor ego getting in the way we know this works and now we know we can do it virtually I've not spoken about any one big change to law or rule or regulation we all know we have plenty of those but what I'm talking about here are common sense ideas that implemented would positively change the childhood of the children in our care I challenge you to look into the eyes of those children families listen to the foster parents adopted parents and biological parents and ask them for their top three changes they would like to see don't be surprised if they are small but then do it you might be surprised as the system moves forward not just with change but with buy-in and support needed to create a community movement and be all in for children Georgia you have all the right people the entities the donors the agencies and desire to change the system in just my short conversation with senator Kirkpatrick and what she told me about the committee you all hear about this issue so with focus I believe you will do it so thank you for what I know you're going to do and for taking the time to participate in these very important meetings I appreciate all that you do and I'm honored that you ask me to be here thank you thank you them can you hear me yes I'm coming I couldn't agree more about connecting the systems that governmental and environmental that is whatever in our communities and interbeing are allowing some of the other ones to be more because in our the foster care system I think that's a great point and we are definitely working on that in Georgia the question I have here I was news to me maybe because the only thing I've ever fostered are puppies but is there some what's the reason that kids moving to a different location can't contact their prior contacts friends and so on I think that's been interpretation one of concern that there would be problems with the connections and it changes from state to state some states are actually now just starting to give kids cell phones to say you can stay connected and in other situations the monitoring of those calls people worry that that could cause some problems I really don't think I really don't understand why foster parents are not allowed to let kids make those contacts but I do think it's something we need to address questions from the committee thank you very much for making time to stick to us today and hopefully we will be able to thank you for allowing me to use zoom I appreciate it okay it's 10 to 11 and we're going to start back on I've told so please be back quick justb I'm going to get it for you. Okay, Ms. Leslie Reese, you're up. Okay. Grab a mic because we've got people that are on the live stage. So, says it's on here. Yeah. Wow. Wow. We're going to hold this. Thank you so much. All of you for allowing me to be here. I'm going to be here. Senator Patrick. I'm supporting by you today to do some. In person testimony, I did submit testimony by the way of the last hearing. And it's expansive. It's very detailed. And you should enjoy reading it. I'm not, however, planning to go to that level of detail as I speak to you today. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. Because you do have been writing in his detail in this complex stuff that we're talking about. So I think the right version is going to be most helpful. Let me first introduce myself. My name is Leslie Reese. I am currently minister director for a ministry called Fostering's Gathering. That is housed out of my appointment. And I was a positive officer. I was a serious a very large church. A majority of the church was a church. Most people know our churches based on senior pastor's name. He was a Kennedy. And I have been in this job now for almost 13 years. I did not expect 13 years ago. I truly had an underworked course. I was actually at home finishing raising my five children. But we had chosen to become foster parents. And the journey he became foster parents. I have a compassionate about a few things. And Bob Ruehmatz and Jessica were well, he said, well, long time. And so he's going to be listening to me talk about things that he's heard about before and that. I believe he also is well as to some of my friends from the department who are sitting here today. I feel extremely fortunate that Lynn Johnson just spoke because I actually feel like she is a public service announcement. Good thing that I want most for you guys to hear from me. She talked a lot about focus. I had a background in business that worked for some public accounting and that a political company in writing leadership roles. And you really can't get anything done unless you know what you're trying to get done. And so what can measure matters? What you monitor doesn't matter quite as much. So you can monitor a lot of things and just kind of stay in place. But when you measure things, you're going to make something happen. You can use your focus as very clear. So I thought that Lynn Ruehmatz was essential. I think that we all would also agree that placement civility mean a lack of disruptions. The pace of re-eification, the stability adoptions, the sanity and stability of the kind of case workers, the financial costs of our system are all things like focusing on. And I feel as if after watching the system for so many years, that there are some very simple, straight forward areas of focus that we're just going to say. And it's not to say that it's going to be easy necessarily, but there is a way forward. The underlying thing I want you to walk away with from my talk is that we're expecting too much of the children and families that were there being a lot. And when I say that, what I mean is they have a situation if foster care is needed that is justified or entry into the child welfare system. But they had other relationships, too. As a matter of fact, you know for a fact that somebody reported what happened. Somebody cared. But they probably had more somebody's than even that. They probably had extended family, teachers, caregivers at a child care center. They have probably seen a doctor before in most cases. They probably have two friends. And when we remove them from all of that in addition to what was dangerous, we are inflicting incredible harm. Before relational, we all thrive, grow, and develop in the context of relationship. And there's absolutely no excuse in the state aged that the amount of resource that this state has while we do not have a hyper-local system. And it's not because people don't care. Because it will be hard to figure out where it began and how to build it. The truth is, however, if we have just a little bit of gumption, we can...

45 counties. They should be diverse in their style, not look just the same. They should have a decent ecosystem of supportive organizations like women's describing. They can wrap around the situations that we're going to be basing in that community. And we should just decide that we're going to do everything in our power to keep the kids that are from that county and that county. Their school system doesn't have to change. Their friendships don't have to be eradicated. Everything else that's been done is still around. When I was fostering, one of the things that was the most surprising to me was that my foster son, when I actually came home for a visit, not too far away as some people would say 35 miles. His McDonald's wasn't my mom's. This Walmart wasn't my Walmart. He felt at home knowing he was in his community. He didn't have to necessarily be all the way home of his dad to know that he was close to home. And I truly believe in hindsight that had he known he was close to home a fair amount of his raging and a fair amount of his behavioral issues would have been tamped down. Maybe they wouldn't have disappeared that they would have been tamped down. And on the flip side, his dad would have been able to do a much better job of engaging with him and engaging with the services that would have been available to him because hope would have still been a lot. When you pick a kid up and I read out him this is fourth placement in his many months. So obviously he was raging. He was leaving households because of his situation. We got him at that point and it was months and months and months before I could get his father to lean into relationship with us so that we could be hope for him with his son. They did reunite. They stayed together until this boy turned 18. He's now on his own. He graduated from high school. He's the first one in his family to do that ever, ever. His father was a foster care. His mother was in foster care. He's in army reserves, old son of a job. He's winning. I honestly think he would have been moving better if we could have kept him very started and let him keep so many other relationships in tact at the same time. So with that some problems, the way we, the way we, the way we, the way we sign case short, case is a problem, though that those getting solved can go a long way to fight that system and being able to like strengthen the way that communities capacity to keep their children at home happens. And then there's some other things in my written discussion that can review as well. And I just want you all to know that I stand ready for now to be terminated or maybe 10 years now, I'm 75, to help and to continue to help you guys think about how to make this system meet the needs of the kids where they are so that their hearts and their minds can quiet down and so that the system can look on their behalf for the outcome that we all freeze past to get them back home. Thank you very much for your remarks. That really nicely with the previous speaker. So I appreciate you coming all the way down here. Questions from the committee? Thank you so much for speaking. These questions may actually not really be for you. It's just things that start from your conversation. So in thinking about being able to keep children and they're staying healthy and specifically they're staying school and continuity. And wonder is there a danger or risk to that to the child if the parent knows the kid is still in that same school? What the social emotional aspects may be is keeping a child in that school and the classmates know they aren't with their family anymore. I just I wonder about those those risk factors and if that plays a role in why we might not keep a child in the same school. So that's one that I gave you may not go to the answer to that. I just I'm sure people at the parent will be people who argue on those sides of that. What I would say is let's try and find out not let's assume the fear that we are describing. I when I first came in foster care space and mother-generaling that used to actually look at a bridge, he's in stone and steel, who grew up in a family that fostered advocacy. I think he had 75 on foster support for the years. Well it's one of the people who told me that the fear hard for foster parents of an impressive birth parent was false. And after I stopped for just a minute and thought about it, I was like that makes sense because the truth is they're in their government intervention. There's a legal process going on and if they were aggressive toward a foster parent in a meaningful way, that would only hurt their situation. It only makes their situation worse. I'm not saying it could never happen, but I don't think it's a reasonable expectation in most cases. So that's helpful. And then another piece of thinking about these hyper-local networks of care. I'm wondering if the division might have statistics on this. Are there particular hotspots where we know a lot of children are interested in international care or the particular, I don't know, could be an apartment complex or a beach in or a particular county because I think that could be a really great starting place as we know. I don't think anybody's county is an example, but if we know that there is a hot spot where we have a lot of children interested in, that can be a great opportunity for churches and schools and and concerted citizens to really create that hyper. Yeah there are there are already in happens and really good for runner efforts. Very havoc, it was on 25, which is a regional approach to keeping kids closer to home. Restoration Roam of the Boyth County has actually you know for a dollar a year put an entire center in the hot spot of that county in place in order to both provide services, provide transitional places for kids to stay for coming into care, and also to be in the community where the majority of the kids come from. That model is super powerful. I think there's just an underlying belief that we can't. If you kids where they came from and I think that belief has to be challenged hard and I think that I've been feeling and carrying this thought process for November years now, if we can just try and view counties and move the needle bare, read the results, unreadification rates, case of readification, the cost of the system works. All the things that we are saying are consignment to make this a chaotic, terrible situation that we'll learn what's working, what's not, and once we can capture four or five counties, kids back where they belong, the next thing that happens is we open the fence elsewhere. And there this is like a saying it's not simple, but it's doing. And thank you for your testimony. Don't you think where we began just with continuity through state policy, though, to make sure that every defects office within the state of Georgia is working on the same policy, using the same procedures and everything so that we can determine where the hotspots are or where the issues are. Here the second procedure we have come up in testifying about the regime that they experienced through the process. Throughout my career we were detached over to defects during certain hearings and certain processes we worked with Dr. Juvenile Torx as they went through it. And then I have a lot of my friends and family that participated in the foster care system. And I've never experienced the regime that the child talked about or I've never heard anybody think the personal experience where it happened. And so I think to some degree we have to determine whether that is a psychological issue that is beyond foster care that is maybe a biological issue that it may be something in birth and some of these other things. I will not say that I don't think you can contribute some of it to the disruption that it hurts because I dropped my four-year-old at school this morning and she was in a great mood other than the fact she had all the blood. From my aunt and dad, she was a teacher but I'm dad. So we do know there are some attachment that is at home every day alive. But I think the most important thing is as far as I agree with you the fact that the community has to be involved. Every other out of one sick period, I will once see what they are. Because I think the community has to advocate way too much of their responsibility to the government and expect this huge machine to take here this micro-surgery that we're trying to do. But at the same time in the state of government, when we go to different governments as we kind of treat much better programs, different approaches. So don't you think that we need continuity throughout the state so we can find where those hotspots and tinder are exorbitant? Well, definitely. And there's no doubt that every community is not adequately developed with your system to support the children in here in those communities, which is actually why I'm suggesting you find four or five communities that are reasonably well developed with your ecosystem of supports and experiment there. I don't just go anywhere. We get that. But I also will say and I don't know because you're with people that you know who are fostering the work. What is the center one issue of the children coming from far away, the component of their case? Because if you're in a rural area, chances are not that they, you know, we have a smaller population of kids coming into care that they're able to handle it with their reasonable distance. And therefore, maybe those kids didn't have those issues. I will tell you that my foster son who was down 21 years of age is a normal person. He is functioning as a normal person, even though he looked like a crazy person at eight years of age. He came out with a knife, he, he will mend, which he'll be bad, you know. He, he had all kinds of outworking behaviors that that anyone would have thought could be long-term in nature. I'm not saying he was ever easy for me or his father when he went back home. But I do know that getting him back home made a big difference in widening down the fire that his brain was on about where it's home. And if you just replicate multiple times, you have taught them that relationships consist of paying great for loss. And then we wonder why they're not okay because they don't know that they can actually settle into a relationship and be a part of something that lasts. So anyway, we had a question. Thank you so much. You bet. Sharon hits. Come on, man. I'll mention we, we still have a son up to shoot on the podium. I don't know if we're going to have any extra time around because we do have the stuff at 1 o'clock, but it is over there. Good morning. Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate you opportunity to be here. I am an adoption attorney. My name is Sharon Hicks and I am a lifelong Georgia with the exception of my time in undergraduate law school. I've lived here my entire life. My husband, Jeff and I practice together in our offices in Lawrenceville, which is Gwyneth County. And as I come to you today, I am the president of the Academy of adoption and assisted reproduction attorneys. I'm also a member of the Georgia Council of the Dowsha Lawyers and I have devoted my career to families and children. Just to tell you how I started when I was in 10th grade, my husband got pregnant and placed her child for adoption with the child facing agency here in Georgia. And walking through that with her, she was one of my closest friends, saw her's hand, what that looked and felt like. In fact, in the revocation period was 10 days, and I lived those 10 days with her we had to live across the street from one another. And I've watched her beautiful journey of going all the way through her adulthood and then for re-impeccational with her child. And so I've always had this off space in my heart for adoption. But when I decided to start out working, Laura had a different plan for me and he wanted me to be a public defender and he wanted me to do a parent work. So for the first five or six years of my career, I worked to reunify parents with their children. I was there advocate. So I am blessed that I've seen adoption in a lot of facets. And so I was asked to come here today to kind of tell this committee, what is the status with adoption law here in Georgia? Are we doing good? Is it something to be proud of? Do we need to make changes? And I really appreciate you having a committee where you are asking this question because I don't tell you if there was a problem with the laws or a job of needing down the doors. But I believe, based on my experience, that we are in a really good place. I have the opportunity to work with the attorneys all over the country and so I'm well versed in the laws of the adoption laws in other states. And as this committee knows, adoption law is not February regulated. So it's different from state to state. And I've been able to work with attorneys and understand what good law we have and where our law needed to be changed. And so in 2018, I was a part of the move to update Georgia's adoption code. And at that time, we made some really good changes to the code. I do a lot of work with foster parents. So I represent foster parents right? We were lead in juvenile court. I also handle all types of adoption. So as a committee knows, in Georgia, you've got agency adoptions that are private agency adoptions that come through foster care. You've got set care in relative adoptions and then you've got interstate adoptions and then you've got adoptions that come through private matches where birth mothers selects a family on her own. And I'm happy to report that I think we have good law and we call it the triad. The triad of an adopted parent, a birth mother, and a shy. And I think my experience has shown me that our law is favorable to all parties involved. I do not believe that it's one side. When we revamped the adoption code in 2018, we did make some great changes. Some changes that were warranted. We made some provisions where non-residents can finalize their adoptions in Georgia if they comply with the interstate compact. We also changed the revocation period after a lot of conversation and we've shortened that from 10 to 4 days. And just so you know that's sort of an immediate of what we see throughout the country. We're not the shortest by any means. There's 48, 72 hour revocation periods that are irrevocable upon signing. And then there are also some 30 day revocation periods that exist where a parent has to go before a judge before they're allowed to surrender their child or the purpose of adoption or consent to a adoption. So we leaned in a good spot. We also allowed the payment of living expenses to birth parents to come from private attorneys as well as from agencies. And I believe that that has helped streamline some things as well. But as you all know, the internet has changed things. So I have seen over the course of my career agency adoption is declining and private adoptions increase. And I think we have put some good things into the code to protect both the adoptive parents and the birth parents and children and those similar events. I will say that when a birth parent can go online and find an adoptive resource, you want to make sure that that's going to be a safe place for a child. And Georgia requires an independent, pre-placement home study in private adoptions. So that protection exists. We have other protections in place when a child is going to cross state lines for the purpose of adoption to make sure that the family is adequately vetted. And I would say that in my opinion, we have one of the best state offices in the state carpet that I have worked with in the entire country. So Georgia asks for more information. They don't just want the home study. They want the supporting documents. And I can tell you that they read everything. So kudos to them. But I just wanted to come in and say that if there was something that I thought needed fixing, I would be asking for you to fix it. Just to give you a vanish point, I do about 50 adoptions. I've done about 50 adoptions this year. It's just kind of fun to keep count. And if they get I've done foster parent adoptions, I've done private adoptions, interstate adoptions, step parent adoptions. And the law is we want in every one of those categories. But again, I think it's fair and it's bad. So I want to do a year back for me today because I am in the trenches. And I know we worked very hard to make sure that all of the eyes were gone and the teeth were crossed when we invented the adoption code. And we hadn't changed the adoption code y'all at 25 years. So it was time. We now have post adoption contact agreements that are legally enforceable, which is a great assistance even with my defects cases. If I can tell a family that knows that they're not going to be able to reunify with their children, that we can guarantee them an open adoption that is legally enforceable, I would say I have a 50% success rate. When that county defects has been amazing and being open to that and being willing to talk to the diverse parents through their attorneys about that option and save thousands of dollars in going through costly and timely termination hearings, that all those parents really wanted that was if I can't parent can still have a relationship and know much better. I would piggyback on what Leslie said and said these foster parents and birth parents still have to be enemies. And many times they're not. They realize how and navigate it. And in a post adoption contract is just one example of how that has really worked and helped in the system. We'll say that in defects and options, we do have the ability to certify adoptions and have hearings within 15 days of that certification. And then when the first lady spoke this morning, she said they let anybody choose, but you choose whoever you want to represent you, but I wouldn't say make a long to make this happen. The one suggestion I would have for this committee is make sure to avoid yours who are handling those defects and options. Know that once they get to superior court, you don't have to wait 45 and 60 days for a hearing. That file is usually complete when it comes to you. And all you have to do is sign an affidavit and certify it. And the code says the judge shall hear a case within 15 days. And I can tell you, many jurisdictions that I've practiced and I have never had a judge pushed back on getting that defects in action behind bars. One other interesting thing that we did in 2018 is we allowed to be open with the door I think for virtual hearings because we put into the code that if you weren't being the way that had a non-resident that was going to be finalizing in Georgia, we weren't going to make you come back. And the courts were very gracious and so it's sort of kind of a little bit of use to those virtual hearings. And I still use those regularly if that's what the family wants. The judges are very good to allow those to happen. So anyway, I think the state of the land is good. I think the law of land is good and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have just by sitting on this committee for the last few weeks or a few months, if you want me to answer questions about the law and actions. Here, I'm just going to say it. We're all good. Thank you for your testimony. Now you said you practiced in various counties where I was studying. From my response to the prettiest witness, you know this commuting with ill or defects and everything. Have you noticed that is it being your experience that everything is pretty much the same around the state when it comes to engaging with people? Yes, I will say. It's too bad to even ask the consistency and how many of you are allowed to say. They count your small count. They count your small count. And I think the friend of mine, Thomas T. Bowel is a part of your growing family. He is. And my wife and I have worked with him and he's a phenomenal representative of your association. I appreciate what you're talking about. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for your testimony and thanks for affirming the good work that was done in 2018. I'm curious from, you know, you talk about it's really good. The laws are great. If you think about it from the perspective of the same sex couple and LGBTQ adoptions, do you, is that, is that smooth as we would need it to be, I'm thinking especially about the situations where the, it's the same sex couple, the one that, one of the women has to maybe biologically what happens with that? Parents, that law will be clear and good. I just want to make sure from all the perspectives that we have on. That's a great question and I would say yes. I'm regularly represented same sex parents and I don't know, is there any differentiation in treatment? I would say that second of years ago when we first started seeing it, some of the judges were concerned because there was really not a statutory path for it. It was sort of a combination of a step-parent adoption and a private adoption, but for more that they saw it, for more comfortable, they got with it. And I'm not saying any problems with it right now. We call it confirmatory adoptions when one of the mothers has the baby and then her spouse wants to adopt and it's still necessary. I believe to do that, but in a, yeah, I'm traveling throughout Georgia and I'm not seeing any fish back on that. Thank you. So refreshing here, something that Georgia's doing well. So, thank you. Thanks for being here today. And I believe what you're saying is once you get to the adoption point, things are in good shape and going smoothly, but would you agree with some of the previous speakers about the delays with the childlike histories and the delay between termination of frontal rights in your defects, adoptions, do you see a big delay between the termination of frontal rights and actually when the child is released for adoption, when you get the paperwork in order to do the adoption? Yes, I do. I do see a clog in the system there. So, imagine having a child in your homes for three years and finally getting TPR and it's taking a year for you to get from a TPR, with, let me rephrase that, was a TPR action where both parents ended up voluntarily surrendering the rights for the purpose of adoption and were still a year out because the childlike history has taken that long to complete. And I see that regularly. These people are overworked in their understaffed and we don't have the time to, it's taken too long to get from the juvenile court to permanency to bring them for adoption in superior court. And the court side is trying on both levels but there's a clog in the system. I also think that there is a clog in how long they stay in concurrent plans for reunification and termination. It seems to me that sometimes the parents write or care are paramount to the children's rights and so I just think that needs to be balanced based on what I'm seeing that it does to these children to stay in care without permanency or so long. But I know that's a different topic for a different day. I'm not sure. Do you ever have clients who are concerned about the fact that one of our speakers earlier they talked about how the adoption, the special assistance for adoption is going to be less more accurate adoption than it is for adoption. So foster care, foster care per diem is more than the adoption per diem. Does any, does come I push back about that? It does nothing that I'll put down the education. They're not educated. It's the why they're reading the per diem that they're getting when they're foster parents. They are not prepared for that number to significantly change and then God bless the case manager who's having to break it to. Oh man, really doesn't understand herself why that number is going down. So I have had to take it up to the state level many times to get that answer. So I think there needs to be better education when those sightings are going into place and better education. Why is that number changing and is that justified? Because that definitely has caused issues and caused delays. And I'm sure you've come to use the price of the answer and the question earlier where you said these people are overworked and underpaid. Can we identify these people as case workers in the past? Will that be correct? Yes. Yeah. So that we understand it certain parts of the system are fine and effects as a phenomenal job. But the reality of it is we have second place or about me correctly come and say, probably come and say that or basically get hammered on both sides of this. And I haven't seen their checkbooks but I know that when I have good case managers that tell me they're leaving the department, they'll tell me that is the reason that they are leaving the department. Yeah and I'm always suspect of the individuals that choose to stay sometimes for that pay and because of the experience we have through the impact program and other things, you want the best quality person you can find so the recruitment suffers overall at times what I've experienced in the defects which if that's what they're going to make, they're not putting in that much effort which sometimes it's a substandard of our effort is what we dealt with in some of the all shared compliance that we've got to deal with. But real quick in your program what is the yellow offering post placement services here, the association or anything after you all go through the process or you all just handle the legal process. Which is the legal process? So once the papers are signed and the beautiful ceremony happens in front of the spirit board judge then once the bills are paid the public's again this is a job then yellow are pretty much out of the process. We help them process the verse to check again understand what to do about the social security number and changing that and then yes okay that's usually until they come back because when they have them signed up to do it again. Speaking of the post to this who backs my LCCQ question you said that confirmation is that what you call the confirmation adoption? Is required of that other spouse? Can you speak how much that cost a couple that is legally married in this data already and is having to do this additional process step in order to confirm the other parents' parental rights? We're just through to that. I can tell you that that's going to vary based on who they choose to do it but that in the memo I would say it would probably be somewhere around $1500 in legal fees and it could be that it's $2500 depending on

they have used somebody that are just more. And it depends on where they're coming from too. And to be clear, if you were a heterosexual couple, this process would not be necessary. It's essentially a $1,500 or $350,000 tax for being a same sex couple wouldn't have any child. Well, I think it's a choice that they want to, even though they know that the mayor is illegal in this state, they want to take that protection and make sure those laws are ever overturned. That then they are not in a situation where they're not considered a legal parent of the child. So it's an added, it's an added step that they take, but most of them want to take it. They don't have to take it, but they want to take it just to be sure. That's what my experience has been when they come to me. So to be clear, from your perspective, legally, they don't have to do it as long as the laws remain as they are today. That a non-birthing, same sex couple parent, the non-birthed parent does have legal, horizontal rights. To your knowledge now, and this is just kind of like, but enough, this he felt just in case that's how I'm ashamed of that. Thank you. Mr. Goodlinson. Thank you for your testimony. I heard one time and maybe you can confirm this that the ease that the turns of getting to do Oscar adoptions had been decreased and that they haven't gone up and on. That's true. Back when I first started doing them, I think this number is right. You know, it was, it was almost $1,000 more per case than what it is. When I take a deep X space, because the family has been told that defects is going to come in everything, de fax will pay $1,500 for me to finalize that adoption. But out of that $1,500, I take out filing fee, which I pay myself. I take out background check fee, which can push to be almost $100 and first certificate fees, which are $45. So when you take that out of every single de fax adoption that you're doing, you're not getting $1,500 per case. So they get come considerably down and I think they've been down maybe for 10 years. That's not great. So how many hours would you say that you put in an average adoption? I think it's going to vary from case to case and judge to judge because in some of the situations I have to do more work, some files are super complete when they get to me and some are not. But I would say I'm minimum of four or five hours on case. Now, if it's a family that's adopted several children, of course not, but you know, we have to prepare a petition for adoption. We have to organize all of the exhibits. We have to take it to file an important somehow is, you know, our faster and more expeditions of the others and some of that questions that just take more time. And then of course, anytime you travel to a final hearing in person, you can guarantee you're going to be out in your office for an hour and hour and a half. Do you think if we were to be able to increase those rates that we would have more availability from a legal perspective to kind of speed that part of the adoption process that we think. I don't know. Maybe more attorneys would be willing to take on those cases or maybe it would say families because I know some attorneys don't have our all those costs. And then we have a family and that case ends up having to pay for a family being a background check and things of that nature. So I also think, you know, we just need to make sure that the attorneys that are handling those options aren't educated and understand how the process works because sometimes the works will ask them for extra things that are not necessary. And then they don't know if they're going to be able to do that. And then they don't know if that is something that she has been behind for a while is, is, is getting a list of that adoption attorneys to handle these defects adoptions so that they are handled adequately and quickly and done right. Thank you. I just want to ask for your one today. Okay, let's raise rallies. Long down. And you do have a handout. I'm going to throw it. I'm going to share. I'll convey members of the public's opportunity to share with you and the community about aging fathers and child welfare cases particularly in foster fear and other key cases. I'm also a social worker. I am a community aged researcher and also convening a group of leaders across the state on fathers matter, ETL to improve father engagement and health and services. I'm a community researcher. I have reviewed many states, child and family service reviews and found that many state reviews do not adequately involve fathers of these planning or provide services for the fathers. They feel to contact the fathers even when they have been involved in their children's lives and do not adequately involve fathers in any aspect of their child's case. I'm actually a student of others and kids planning in 50% of cases that were reviewed. Only 22% of cases working at active level at that big percent threshold. When we look at across those states somewhere as well as 12% and others were as high as 75% on you'll be surprised that Idaho was a state that had the 75% possible word. When we look at Georgia though, we can see that we are below 50% threshold and on 40% of the cases agency state efforts to promote a positive father child relationship on 27% of cases, fathers needs more assessment dress and on 39% of cases agencies may consternate efforts to involve fathers and kids planning. With another study that was at 2000 children who were moved from home to their fathers and back as I, 8% of their files contain the father's name yet only 55% in these cases were the fathers actually contacted at those points. There are many challenges to fathers engaging in these cases and not just the child welfare but really across a lot of other human services agencies. And so they bring from individual or personal barriers and also policy and legislative barriers. The generation has been one of the issues that's also currently not only child welfare but also across another number of other health and human services. And so we have a lot of research and recommendations about engaging fathers but we haven't got very far so we must address bias which affects the services. And another major barrier is bias. We do talk a lot about father engagement. We have a lot of research and recommendations about engaging fathers but we haven't got very far so we must address bias which affects the services that these children and their parents will see. And so the one-count will be office or GAO looked at the over representation of African children foster care and specifically examine state perspectives on how bias affects their children to be here. Of the 48 states that were surveyed across reporting and pre-stabbed, making placement decisions and even in judicial requirements more states proceed that bias and after these actions to a moderate or to a great extent. Similarly, there have been several studies that have documented fall standing slow changing gender bias that has negatively impacted fathers and child welfare. Workers are often apprehensive about involving fathers work on certain possible value. The dual impact of racial and gender bias is also the fact that as agencies were less likely to identify, locate and contact African American fathers. Fathers are stereotypical as demand dangerous goes possible in your relevant despite decades of research evidence that shows positive outcomes and federal recommendations called for the need to increase each type of this. When fathers are involved, there is a greater chance of the child returning home, there is a greater, there is fewer placement episodes with a child, there's a little ring of repeat reports of mistreatment, there's less time and foster care and there's reduced trauma that can be caused by some of the issues we've hurted in your body attachment and separation. This is a lot of information, I saw the day of providing the report to Senator Patrick before I can provide it to you as well, but the administration for children and families or ACF has strongly encouraged all in the service agencies to work together to join the creating and maintain an environment that prioritizes father engagement as a credible factor and strengthening families and to enhance father involvement in all families support and child welfare related programs. Recently ACF issued research findings about their fathers and child welfare breaks right through series, which is shown here on slide. This is where they work with six child welfare agencies and four states to develop a collaborative change framework to engage fathers. There were lots of lessons learned here, but the last one I want to make is that they recommended to align a community-wide coordinated system for support services and opportunities. This really leads into the work that I am very proud to be doing here in the state. It is the group of fathers matter to yell again, I want to cite their group of leaders from academia, faith, community-based government agencies, health and social services, where leveraging each other's services and supports since 2021 to promote the support father engagement in Metro Atlanta and now beyond. So in conclusion, really to further engage fathers and foster care in adoption places, really there needs to be more child welfare programs that are providing mandate training for practitioners, which really include those father engagement strategies. There is the training that's there for whether or not it includes father engagement strategies is not known. So there needs to be additional funding for family preservation and remediation services to look at that average and support services for fathers. Those child service state and federal reviews, family reviews or other data that's collected by child welfare, they should include the degree to which the agencies are successful in locating the fathers as well as the degree to which the fathers and the federal relatives have been contacted and used as a place of options. These data should be reviewed regularly and there should be some action and prevent plans to be required. And also, if I to finally say about the generation just that they're used to some study around the impacts of the generation policies and also our families. Thank you so much. Thank you for your concise presentation and I couldn't agree with you more on the fathers matter, but I would also like to ask you. I'm going to talk about legitimate this year and the process of a lot of requests making the man and self-evident says speak and I just want you're getting thought. So our suggestions about what we need to be doing about the generation process. As I said, Georgia says to me, the only state can ask this legitimation issue in terms of, you know, other states if the father acknowledges for time, they had, you know, a chance of for case, then they're there for legal bottom Georgia has this extra step where the father has to file this legitimation. And then they're going to have to do that. And so if we could just again look at it to see what the impacts that there are positive outcomes that come from this legitimation process on compared to what other states are doing that would be the ask because every time I'm talking with local workers or talking with fathers becomes of as a barrier as opposed to something that's helping. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony to tap something. Columbus started a generation station probably 10, 15 years ago. And it is fully funded so it's free for others of the service house here comes tech or while amounts and it's an ability of culture out to the core house and. And that very a lot of success was well expanded out there was a path that they could go through to legitimize themselves. And I myself was a single father who raised 15 acres so about myself appreciate what's our doing to get the fathers more involved. I think it's important that you're that collection. I think you're on point with that. But I'm curious do you think it's important to collect the data on how many of these children's come from two parent homes as opposed to single parent because I've dealt with some private businesses in my district that serve the labor followers for child support. And it's difficult time locating a lot of these that's because of many cases the parents were never married and it's tougher for the mother to provide good information on that. So would you agree that one that point that would probably help to is if we do have any of these children coming from two parent homes and how many were coming from single parent homes to determine exactly the efforts that are being put forth by defects to locate these dads. Yeah, most of the studies that I share to you in the presentation are both on ours and so there are fathers that were not living in the home at the time that are child welfare. And just a couple. And so you know that though a lot of recommendations have been made basically to your point that there may be fathers that are in just for systems or in public systems. And if we work together that information can be accessed and the father can be contacted and most types of things so that is going to major recommendation that includes all resources that we have available to locate and identify those fathers. And I want to give a little legitimization piece so can you speak to how that can become a barrier to fathers being able to have a children. My understanding was that today's about adoption that when it comes to adoption, whether or not they've been legitimized or not, the father has to be notified that there still has to be some time engagement with the biological father without legitimization. So can you just speak to what obstacles people are encountering because they have not just my agenda. Sure. And so this is this is just again what I heard from child welfare practitioners as well as former fathers until they cannot engage with them because they're not illegal father. And then to add to that we again have some fathers who have gone through the process of legitimization and still are not able to get access to the channel. It sounds like we have a little more work to do on understanding our generation process. Any other questions? Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

It's up early in the morning. G.C.'s of the location, students out to the principal of that school. We're a county school district. We have 12,000 students, like 80 King schools. And she'll notify the principal and all she does is his own student's name. And then she says, handle the care. That principal then notifies the teacher, handle the care. And all that occurred before the school day begins for that child. And all of that information is held between the groups of the contact. If no other teacher is stalled and the child's personal business is on the street around the school day. A counselor may be a counselor in the school. A counselor. And just for the group, that is not far from students, a permanent record. We're sure a couple of things. Especially the system is very much aware of this. It's given the rural areas. They're working hard, getting implemented. And the rural areas, the residential school is very supportive of this. And if you choose to move forward with anything around it, they screw attendance and screw the climate protocol committee. Very good question. It's very, very easy. And that's all we already require to look away before the round. And we'll hear as well as the food climate. As obviously these things are actually the things. Anybody else? Thank you so much for sharing that with us. Jackie Jackson. We heard from you before, but I think you're here to talk to a professor. You're right. For your time. And you have this in your packets uniform. Unregulated chocolate, so you drink for that? Is that correct? Yeah. I said PowerPoint is well, but I've thought I'd be here just to do something. Probably not doing the work. But thank you all for allowing me to come and show today. My name is Jackie Jackson. I am a CEO and no founder of the White Co. Champions for Children. We have a heart for adoption, just as you all do. And in 2018, I was very blessed to have been invited up to DC to work alongside a uniform law commission on the unregulated child custody transfer act. It is considered a uniform law and to that end, we are hoping to have at least 32 states, I believe, enact this, this act that we have drafted. It was something that has been spoken about. We've heard numerous times today about trauma and instability and the ways that kids, in care, kids are vulnerable. Because if you are in the fostered system, if you are going to be placed for adoption, you will be able to do something somewhere, it has gone really from in your family of origin. So what we want to do is help to work to be from a state where we are being proactive instead of reactive. And one of the things that I have seen within our organization and when I was working with the UL State family out of this is something that is really impacting across the board nationally, is kind of there is a note that there are vulnerable kids. And we know how to find them. And although there have been efforts to shut down chat rooms and Facebook pages, there is still a very high number of people who get a point where a child has become so gestriculated and the parents have become so disheartened or even disillusioned that the adoption becomes in jeopardy, an adoption disruption, or an adoption disillusioned, which means that child has gone from, and they are not going to be able to make it up for a child to take care of their family of origin into possibly a foster or several foster placements. And then into a family that the child, I always heard, and I am a former foster child and an adult he was your forever family. And after seven years of working in this space and now doing my PhD research in this area, on our committee, we all know that children deserve any safe families. And when we began with this act, we realized that we can take this situation, which is overwhelming, which is a direct pipeline with vulnerable children, unregulated child custody transfers, and then going into the trafficking type situation. The statistics are incredibly under-reported, so the statistics that we do have, you just have to look at them and say there are many, many more that we are not aware of. But I believe that this act would give us an avenue to give child nursing agencies attorneys, they would be able to leverage the law that we already have here and to be able to put more protective measures around our most vulnerable population. Those who care for kids in crisis, and we've heard this a number of times today, are not always a grip with resources and the support for the physical and psychological needs these children have. And creditors and traffickers know exactly where and how to exploit those issues. One of the things that I pulled and you can do internet searches on it, this is from 2013, but I actually had something that was from 2019, some of the most recent research, the University of Georgia. There was a voiders investigation on the child exchange, and I just wanted to highlight a couple of things because this is something that has been ongoing. And even though this was highlighted in 2013, it's by the ULC and the state department began working on this and particularly focusing on the vulnerable populations of children been adopted because these children have already experienced some and are probably showing behaviors because that happens in these situations at times. There was a mother and she went on a site called considering disrupting an adoption. It was a Yahoo group and most children mentioned on this bulletin board. They were moving on the sexual act now. They were moving very increased violent behaviors and parents were desperate. And it goes forward to share that there were two individuals that came forward that I can take care of that child and there have passed then people previously on Craigslist. I'm sure that they have moved the sites and the shepherds to new different places, but there was transfers happening without social history, without medical history, with no court overseeing it with no place-thing agency overseeing it. And these children were just being transferred with a known thing as first and last ability to take care of my child. No, I see PC, nothing that was regularly missed. What we have seen in this particular instance, which was a five-part series, 18% of these kids were shown to have a history of sexual or physical abuse and these descriptions when you put it on a on the internet or people or predators. They see this and it is as they know it, it's a tremendous order to have to have dangerous people come and attend to the concept. So what the Uniform Unregulated Child custody transfer act allows is the opportunity for state agency or work oversight that assures a new course student is safe and appropriate for the child. And what we want to make sure is that we want to shut down the high risk of adoption in the solution, but we also want to shut down, as I said, the trafficking pipeline. Somebody here mentioned, and I actually read them in a quote, she and guys from stories are told and safe, this is. And it is under reported, it is not something that families want to share, but when they are in crisis, there is the significant lack of resources to help them. I can share within our organization we have a family that adopted a way a child, international adoption and because the medical and social history turned out as we got out later to not be complete, although the family did everything within their knowledge, understanding, power reaching out to their facing agency, reaching out to their church. We were walking along side them. The child went with 1013 with the suicide watch and was then moved to behavioral health and what happened because the child had been impacting our sexuality and the environment. The family was told that their biological children were in danger being removed from their home if they brought the child back in. So they had a child that they loved, that they fought for, that they waited years to bring home. And now they have biological children that, when the police responded as they needed to, they were in danger of not just having one child removed but having all four. The difficult decision was that they prevent to try to find an appropriate new home and they, because they had all of the resources around them and send it every way that they could to do it. In the law, legal aid oversight to this day, the child has now been for a year and a half in defects custody, in a behavioral institute, which is really not a clip for long-term, but when she came in here, she was 11 and most group homes won't take you into your talk. And the best case, of course, which would be for her to be in a family that could meet and protect your needs, because by the grace of God, I had been a part of this study and a part of creating this act as a advisor or observer. I knew and understood that we had to follow certain protocol, they are loopholes across the nation. And the way that this act is crafted, it's pretty much a plug-in play. It will adapt to however Georgia needs it to. It can be, you can add in or add a dendons that will go along with what we already have in places to check the measures, but it kind of seals up some of our souls. And if I could just share this one, particular, this is from 2019, which was a study out at the University of Georgia. So although the lawyers and investigations point out to this is true to me, the un-rathulated custody transfers exposed children, potentially significant harm, that exempting legal tools are currently insufficient to help combat the practice. The definition of the tumors closely related practices are illegal adoption and human trafficking and do not hear any comepest these types of transfers. And they research or end advising a world is recognizing children are especially vulnerable to exploitation and tributes. Battling and regulating custody transfers by mandated state intervention ensures that the death of children be the biological or adopted can be more readily guaranteed and then the necessary harms to those children can be avoided. So when I'm looking at it, there are several parts to the act, but to highlight some of the things that this act will allow Georgia to do. This act addresses certain child custody transfers not all and it's really based on if the parent has determined that they can no longer hear this child. It wouldn't be for a deployment with military and your transferring custody to a single member. So this is very particular if there is a dissolution or a termination. The act is consistent with recommendations from the US working group composed of representatives from federal agencies, state child welfare organizations and the national association of attorneys general. And this act protects children by prohibiting parent from transferring a custody of child to someone beyond family members and certain others specified individuals if the parent intends to abandon their parental rights. So that's really what the key is. And if that provides the state protective agencies and law enforcement with the authority to investigate because right now if this happens, neither the individual or the family who is trying to find and think they use the word re-home and that is a term that makes me stick to my stomach, that that is kind of the common use of the word. And for people receiving the child or person receiving the child and we have no idea in any kind of background, although the state of Georgia requires for an adoption a home study. This kind of transfer it's certain things that. So this is what this act would help close down. And the act supports families by providing information change. So one of the things that we have heard is that when you don't have the support and sometimes in the hardest of cases, even when you do, there needs to be a protective pathway if the child is that's insurance and the families that's just to serve by moving them to a different situation, but we can't allow vulnerable already vulnerable children to be transferred outside the oversight of Obama. When that happens, children are the victims and honestly our community suffer as well. And this is this could be a way to evenly that Georgia could be one of the floor runners. When we were working on this, actually work every chapter with these smiders, she is legislated and helpful at the ULC to get the most updated information in this morning. She sent me so far the Greece date and enacted this. The unregulated Chalka city transfer at Utah, Colorado, and Washington. The Greece dates are considering it for their 24 legislative season. And those are Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina. And one thing that she noted that I thought was fully impactful, so far there have been no propositions to the hearing of the enactment of this. Thank you very much. Do you want to go to members? Thank you very much for this. You talk about training. Let me talk about the kind of training that you think would help families in this situation. And then do we have that in those today? I believe that we do have that. It's just the accessibility, especially for biological families who maybe child welfare involved, but they kind of don't do impact change, because they're not foster parents. So they haven't gone to whatever place the agency at their adopted family. So if you are a child, my family who is absolutely working to bring the child into your home to foster adoption, there are certain expectations that if you are a biological family who suddenly finds yourself in a situation where to avoid being identified by a child project of service that you try to circumvent, they may not know about that. It's the most likely to do more. Mariah thought would be just making sure that TVRI training, the informed training, is available. That's one of the best ones of TCU Texas Christian University that we have seen as incredible support. And then leveraging as we per today for a number of other speakers, making sure that the community is involved with different nonprofits, faith-based organizations, because the more we are able to surround families and prices we can prevent these kinds of disruptions and particularly prevent children going into the system of the first phase. Follow up question. Is there, if I don't know if there were many research on this, but if there were more post-adaptive support for families, is there any research that there are anything that is tied up this or that you write about that would indicate that this need for this transfer might be reduced and you stick about that in place to foster adoption support might play. Yes, and to my mind and my personal and professional experience, the post-adaptive support is the area that we need most, I would say nationally, specifically to Georgia. We have a lot of creative impact classes, I know that one of our families specifically, going through the foster care process, was allowed to choose different types of training and one was Texas or Texas. Because, and I got her, she was waiting on as a single mother to be a foster to adopt type of placement, but the types of training that are could really be be done, but most especially the family that I shared about, is in bulk of it might hope and we're continuing to offer them support. They went to their placing agency and their placing agency specific to adoption, and this one happened to be an international adoption, you know, an action. I'm going to open this back up. I want to make sure I don't forget the statistics. They had nothing in place. They did not have respite, they did not have a mentor type situation, and over and over again, our family heard some of the other tradition today, kind of if you love them enough, once they get used to coming in, the idea, once this is final, it will get better, and it didn't. And the worst it got, and the more intervention that had to come from the police department, and then they had your help, the more fear they were of losing their biological children as well. And I just feel because of our leadership in this day, because it made me so like you all, asking the hard questions and doing the hard work, anything that we can do to support families to protect children, to shut down especially that trafficking right on to predators. I think that's worth it, and it's a win. And so I'm having a hard time understanding how this situation happens. So you could just help me, because what you're saying is that parent has child, let's say it's a biological child, and then they decide that the child needs to be re-homed if you are sort of why would they not hold defects? Is there like, I'm just getting like, I'm a lot of, why would you use the internet to find somebody instead of calling or, I mean, and it's all in your home, right? And is it possible, can you drop a, I mean, I don't even do this for a minute, I think you can look at it at the safe age, you can even ask a little or a fire department. Can I leave 13-year-old? How can I leave it to a certain number of months or even weeks for Georgia in some stage, if there's a 15-month, if they think there's enough life for children? And so is it that parents don't, is it punitive to call CPS and say, I can't take care of my child, then you can go somewhere else, like I just hope you understand why people are not going to the agency, like, do you have a baby baby to, yeah, that would be a bit of a second. Why is that wrong? Well, and this is my understanding from what we unlearn being a part of this ULC study and then what we experienced within our ministry. There are some concerns, especially if you have other children in the home, which is exactly what happened, that if you identify and go to these protective agencies that when they realize the level of outbursts, and I think somebody mentioned earlier, it's not tantrums, it is it is violence, and you have other children in the home, there is a great concern and has been shown in my experience that out of, you know, wanting to protect, well, these other children might keep her moving. So that might be number one in my opinion. Another is there are simply times when after trying, and we have had other ways in our organization that have reached out and reached out to different aspects, and these are different regions, I don't know as far as deep access sensors have handled differently, and different regions, but it sounds like it is different than nature than it is in my role. That they did it in that situation, I was told that if it wasn't an upright, it's like the abuse that some people wouldn't come in, and when that happens, because the abusing is not happening from appearance of a child, there was just documentation of the ways the parent might have been abused or hurt, and that didn't trigger the protection of the children. Thank you very much for that information. Thank you. Okay, let's go to the police, Jimmy Lord. Come on down, brush your sand and tell me how you did it. Morning. Oh, it's afternoon. Good afternoon. I don't know why the only thing standing between you and Laksh, so hopefully I'm still with me today. Okay, I'm live. Or hot. One of those days. All right, so I'm thinking of having the informed right study board up to the O of children. Our agency helps to reveal from trauma faster than their families. Our aim is to equip care diverses in agent, appealing for their children and their home. The lightest view today, I have personally connected to this space for 28 years. I have a brother who was adopted actually out of the water foster care. He came into our home 24 years ago, so I'm not new to this space. I've also served as a foster care person myself. So I today, even though our agency helps all children and families that intersect with child welfare have been asked specifically to speak about post-adopt issues and post-adoption services. I think your student services are one of the largest adoption agencies in the US did a study some long years ago to look at dissolution statistics. The dissolution is when a child is re-homed, because he just just previously mentioned when an adoption falls apart and a child is no longer able to stand at home. What they found is the average dissolution happens after eight years now. That's time of shocking. However, it is not, and I'm going to help you understand why. So I think it's really important. One of the things that Lynn said earlier was trauma is no longer a best word, but it is extremely important to understand that every child who is part of a child welfare system has encountered trauma. They have been separated from their birth family. That's a loss that will have to be freed at some point in a child's life. Even if they enter the system as an infant, even from birth, there was probably some exposure in the room, which is traumatic, and it has consequences for the lectern of a child. Trauma is also developed in all. What that means is that trauma behavior is demerged over the lectern of a child. We typically see this at age 5, 8, 12, 15, and 18. Why is that? Five years older child is entering into school, and we start to see some behaviors as it is in the issues emerged. Eight years old from higher-level thinking is starting to happen. You might see it then. Twelve years old, entering adolescence, 15, entering high school, and then 18, basic and adulthood. Trauma has such an impact on a child's development. Even early childhood trauma. I mentioned earlier that my brother was adopted out of foster care. We didn't know in the 90s that the first 19 months of his wife before he was in our house, what had actually happened to his brain development. But when he's facing adulthood, that's actually, he's not functioning like an 18-year-old. He isn't because of that trauma that they've experienced. As I mentioned before, there are some current post-op services that are available in the state of Georgia. Those are focused on physical safety of the child. I will say earlier, Senator Robertson, he made a statement. You said, shouldn't there, this is when Lese was speaking, shouldn't there be a continuity of policies across the system before we look at hyper-lovelization? I would add to that, I would say looking at continuity of policies is not enough. We have to actually have a paradigm through which we're looking at the policies that we're making for these children. The system is designed around the welfare of children safety. That is essential, but you cannot discount the well-being of a child. As we know, children are not born in isolation. Children are intended to be inside a family. You have to look at the family system that is surrounding their childhood. It's an adopted family, foster family, or even if it's the birth family in reuniting them. So, while there are some post-op services in the state of Georgia, I will tell you what is not currently available or why it may be available. trauma responsive parent and family coaching. We've heard today about some of the situations when rating some of the behavioral issues, those behavioral issues that stem from the lack of secure attachment from an early child, childhood standpoint, that trauma responsive parent and family coaching is essential to the families, healing as well as providing with any other children. Also, not widely available attachment-focused plans and techniques that parents can use with their children. Connecting and powering and connecting, correcting principles at DSGLAT crisis, where caregivers are actually able to meet the needs of their child in the home. As well as as the stated earlier, pangol mental health services that are adoption competent extremely important, were focuses on the grief and loss of the children. As an agency, we have 25 contracts that we are currently serving. Six of those are in post-in-the-post-op and other states in Georgia. I want this is extremely important. Of those six contracts, that we have a 90% utilization rate, which means that we're almost maxing out with the potential that contract is. For our foster care contracts, they're 57%. That demonstrates the extreme need for these types of services. I'm going to read this. It's really important. According to an academic article in the Georgia Family Service Journal, there's a scarcity of effective treatments that address complex developmental trauma. One reason for this scarcity is that as of this writing, the DSM-5, which is a diagnostic tool, few psychological meetings, does not make a distinction between acute trauma and complex developmental trauma. Acute trauma is the child experiences with tornado, the experience of car accident, whereas complex developmental trauma is compounded effects of trauma over time. That is the lack of visual disorder. Chronic sexual abuse, physical abuse, even chronic disabilities. Children and youth suffering from complex trauma most often exhibit disorders related to attachment, which affects regulation, physiology, behavioral control, cognition, and self-concept. So if you look at that list, regulation, physiology, medical, behavioral control, cognition, variability to learn, and thriving in academic setting, these types of disorders can lead to a variety of diagnoses that need a diverse treatment plan. Most often in our space, children are being treated with a medical model where they are seeing a doctor or therapist perhaps one more week, where the caregivers are playing a superficial role in a treatment of their child. However, key points. Interim systems that include caregivers are much more effective because treatment occurs in the child's environment where the challenges are actually occurring.

children, all children are raised in that hour, week, and the professional. The issues that need addressing are actually happening in the home and in school. In particular, if you noted that the relationship-based trauma can only be resolved through loving, stable relationships such as that can be offered in the nurturing by a nursery caregiver. If whipping caregivers is essential, I have been, as I said, in the space for 28 years, one of the reasons that I stay in this space is because this is not widely understood. Foster care training is not sufficient to prepare adoptive parents who are working with women in being on the life of the adoption day finalization. Children who have been harmed in relationship can only kill in the context of relationship. Until a short story, there's been many stories today and this is actually a story from a family that we started here at Georgia. The Lincoln family, Mary and Mike, became once in foster parents in 2015. They had had that desire for many years, and earlier in their marriage, they immediately took a foster-sidling group for not for the family of heart. Shortly after that, they accepted two other placements. They went on to adopt six children and then forced their two years to come. Things began to go south for them just before the adoption. Though their process started in 2015, we did not start working with his family until 2021. Two of the children from the sibling group that first entered their home began sharing some of the abuse that had happened in the home, and most of it seemed their story around one of their sisters, Peter, who was nine at the time she entered the home. They took Peter's side and said, can you share more about what happens before you came to live with us? And as she began to open up, this changed the course of their family's life forever. She began to share about the extreme sexual abuse that she didn't encounter. Once the police became involved, the biological father was charged with more than 12. He was charged with more than a dozen counts of aggravated sexual poverty. Heather seemed again to hear voices. These were the voices of her biological parents and the third perpetrator telling her to encounter her parents. For a state teach, she went to adopt a grandmother, and that she actually attempted to murder her adopt a grandmother. This is the first incident that happened where she was attempting to harm other people or pests. Three years after entering the home, she continued to escalate to the point where she had to have her first emergency mental health evaluation. This set off a number of events. So she now, 12, remember I said, one of those traumatic behaviors starts from her during adolescence, first went to health evaluation, and the Lincoln family started their long journey with Medicaid and limitations of Medicaid. So there as just an example, she was required to receive three short-term, place three short-term evaluations before she was eligible for a long-term treatment plan within a system that could meet her needs. As she was in therapy, she began to understand more about the voices that she was hearing. For those who do not know how psychological background, that is an exercise called association. It is a survival tactic where she was safe, the pain that she was in, she goes to living in her world. That association is extremely difficult to treat, and the parents have found a treatment facility and some methodologies, outsensitive, Georgia that were more close to me her needs, but because the limitations within Georgia, she was not allowed to receive that out of state care. She went on to be in dozens of facilities. Then cost of her current facility where she has been in long-term care for the last two years is approximately $10,000 a month. And I wish I could tell you that that was an exceptional break, it is not. She was forced by the state to testify an inter-biological father who is not certain the less than tips in prison. While this is an extreme case, it is an important case because there are themes within it that are very consistent with the families that we serve, which is there is a lack of access to appropriate care to meet the needs of the children who can leave their in the home. As an example of that, I will tell you that one of the things that she was allowed to, the parents were allowed to access through the adoption system in the state of Georgia was, they were allowed to have a security officer stationed in their home to make sure that there was safety. So imagine the view back, six children in the home, and you'd buy a security officer, that that can then never stop is traumatizing, that stationed in the home. So that was one thing that was available through adoption systems, but the family couldn't get access to the treatment that she had for her dispensation. So you know, there's going to a lot of statistics here today. I think it's important that you hear that mental health issues 80% of the children who are in foster care have mental health. 80% was described earlier about, you know, our early intervention directly affects crime 80% of the men who are in the prison system in our country. That's time to foster care. So if we can focus on the early intervention and providing the families and the children what they need to feel from the trauma they'd experienced, not just because of the play state, and I think we would be winning. We must increase the support services that funding and access to these vital services that can help to earn a deal so that they do not perpetuate what has been done to them and create more cycles of trauma for future generations. Thank you very much for hanging in there until the end of our neck in the long journey to share your story. Very impactful. Questions from the committee? Okay, thank you very much. We have one person, two people signed up to speak, I think they're together and we are getting close on time so Carol, I feel on Janet Newman if you wanted to be right. Come on, Dan and I get this a short one more minute. We're all done. Working. My name is Janet Newman. That's her best. The President of Board of Rights for Chemical Care Services, Adam and C3 in St. Georgia. We have worked for over 35 years to play children in two parent homes. Our commitment is that we find families with children and not children or families. So it looks a little different in a lot of ways. What we've talked about today, I'll just tell you a brief synopsis of one of the things in your packet. It talks about services for a lifetime or all of the triad. That is the adoptive, the birth parents and the adoptive parents. And in that triad and that support for the triad, what that looks like is March 2011, our son was placed in our care and by July of 30 of that same year, less than four months. We stood in Judge's Chamber, Cindy Cattacan, and that adoption was finalized. In that scenario, you have amazing things to happen. As as a new mother and father, you have much grief and trauma from the loss of two children and infertility just in our story. And then you fast-forward 11 years and you begin, you have any questions, you hold this child in your arm and talk about the fact that they're fearfully wonderfully made. You talk about the fact that they're adopted, that's part of their story. You talk about the fact that you have a tip looking to a seven-year-old and he says just remember when you say I'm the best mom in the world, he says then you're the second best mom in the world. As a speaker about his work, not so there's nothing that's been held back from his story from last day in one. And in working with Kevin and Karen options, one of the things that happened to us about a year ago, more and more questions began to be asked. I'll tell you a story and I'm only going to tell you this because these stories are what matters and those are the things that stick in your head. So our group chat is Kevin here, which we've had a long-standing relationship, obviously, in the Serbian cohort because now I'm in, I'm one leading services assistant, I got to mom, what do I do? And I said here's some questions and so Kevin here reaches out to his birth mom and informs her. The first question was is he okay? Or is he saying yes, he's received letters and pictures for these 11 years? Yes, he is fine. He just has some questions, you mind contact. And through that contact, one of the things that came about was a picture that we didn't have of her. And I said, would you like the picture? And I slid it across the dinner table, after the three of us sat there and we talked about the day and everything, I slid it across the picture. And and 11 year-old looks at me and he says, wow, now she's beautiful as his meat. Clearly, one of the benefits to his is talking, my husband and I are not lovers, but slid it across this as well. And that's what he said, the question mark is gone. So now I always wonder what she would like. And that was his place in services. And so what Kevin cares committed to serving all parts of the tribe, yes, we're five and one is either a yes or a pay face. We know that everybody has to be together working to do this because what defects do you submit? We can't do. We have things what private adoption attorneys can do. We don't do. Over in the game, we've been here for not going anywhere. Someone says, well, you know, what are you all going to do in light of the decision after the heart be blessed? We're going to keep doing what we've always been doing. We're going to keep working with members in the tribe to provide safe and legal adaptions in the sector culture. And I'll just let Carol share anything just a minute, but I'm thankful for our staff. It's small. We serve 1509 County, Georgia. And one of those things, just from what we've reiterated, what's been reiterated to hear our owners a trauma, we have on our staff, we have capable case workers that I'm working every day, whereas we're running stock, paying them more so we can keep them. We haven't covered in this day. We have adopted family case workers that work directly. So when these issues come up, there's mediators. And then we also have an assistant executive director. There's also TDR license as a TDR license counselor. And just those things continue to work to make sure that we keep advance to serving all parts of the tribe. There's been what's been a beautiful partnership and what I'm committed and not being as convinced as working for life. And so I thank you all for thinking about it and wondering how can we do it better in the state of Georgia because I would love this state and I love this people and I'm loving making sure that we're protecting the rights of children and that we're providing safe and wiggle without sheets. She's the pretty part. I'm the real heart. So I'm going to take you to a direct air covenator and you know when I hear everybody talking and I hear all the bays, if any phrase, we have partnered with you guys adoption. We worked with adoption attorneys, things like that. So I think the main focus for me and what I want to talk to you guys about today is you hear that in the law, it states reasonable living senses. What would you define as reasonable living senses? That we're going to pay for your apartment the whole family and your pregnant. We're going to buy you a car. We're going to need to cash. What does that look like? It is very broad. It's extremely broad. And so what we're coming again as an agency is it's an or not a discretion. Well, what I have to tell you guys I just like it like. So it's policy for pregnant here. We don't exchange money with our phones. We don't exchange money for expected clients. We're licensed by the state of Georgia. We get audited above and beyond from an accountant to show where our money is going because it's people in here. It's Janet Allen who did the company care as a nonprofit. So when I have to talk to a donor and they say, well, where does my money go? When I say, well, actually we're working with an expected client or a birth mom host like Smith who the reason she came to us because we don't go worse. We don't say, oh, I'm sorry, we gave you, you know, we pay for an apartment or a hotel for six months or whatever that is. We either do to infer work, whatever that looks like. Well, when she's in the hospital, she is grieving her decision to place a child for adoption. And she looks at me and said, I can't do this. As a vetted agency, do I look at her and say, I'm sorry, you know what? We had to we paid you $5,000. We put you up. Sorry, you're going to have to pay that back. That is happening in the state of Georgia. You need to know that children are being brokered in the state of Georgia. Women are being poached. I think you might have asked the question Senator about why are they not knowing that these agencies, why are they not, they don't trust us. One person makes it look bad and so we're all bad. And what we want to make the difference is there are people out there who trust. There are agencies out there who are vetted, who won't let's best. And so nothing is money's going to enable. Money helps. Sure. I mean, if you come, you're making an adoption plan for a reason. We're not making adoption plans, are we? We're not in the foster care system for a reason. So if I'm coming for, because I have an addiction to death, well, what's what's my plan? How am I going to help? And she said, I need help is Carol. Okay, sweetheart. So what we're going to do is we're going to walk along side you and we're going to get you into a rehab facility. She ventures off and she's homeless living in the woods. Who's going out there to serve her? We are. And so I think it's just being mindful about yes, I agree. The laws there are in place are great. Revocation period being down to four days. Yes, to be able to help reasonable living expenses. That is wonderful. Those are things that we've got to do. Is there a limit for people? You know, I mean, where are we? If we're out of attorney and we can charge $70,000 for an adoption, where's that $70,000 going? I'm currently working with a family that went through another agency, $54,000. 50 for that. And what is that doing? There's no post-license services for that family. So they come to us to say, hey, can we can we contract? We don't know. We don't want to contract. We don't want any of your money. Because you know what? We want to make sure you're educated. We want to make sure your child has got some sort of connection, you know, when we're dealing with trauma and we're dealing with those things. And of course, our prayer is that our children never deal with anything hard or anything that's tough. But you can't promise that whether you're biological or adopted. We all got issues. Now, keep quiet on it. Say that, but I'll be the first to say. We cover well, but we do. So I'm sorry I was almost so boxed. I love and appreciate all the girl very much. Do what you do. Okay. And so you make the issue about reasonable, reasonable living expenses. Obviously having no cat presents a problem. And as someone who's still on time in this arena, I do believe people are such as five children and birth parents are being paid. Like it's an economy. Well, they're searching for other states. It'll pay more or maybe they'll have a vacation. Exactly. So in your opinion, you know, which are asking this body because there's some limits of what are reasonable expenses. And if so, what would that element look like? Are you looking for us to the five of that? What in your experience in wisdom would help assist and address this issue one and be if we did that for that result. And we're when I just go to another state where they are. I'm on what they can set their baby for an element. Right. I can't say in my opinion is that we have seen we have had hospital social workers selects and we come into the hospital to start with the birth box. Hospitals are very like, ooh, adoption. You all can do that outside of here. Like that is too messy. We don't want to do that. But what we want to train people is nurses have seen women walk out with their baby and stay in the parking lot with a person, a couple, and the birth mom with her baby and a hand baby over and she receives an envelope. What's in that envelope? Or I've had birth moms call and say, well, I got to check for $10,000 and it's all now and they have my baby and I don't know how to get in touch with them. What do I do? Well, it went through us. So here, here we are having an out of date for other people who may have done it. Not as... I guess you could think so. To answer your question, I think it would be great for us to have it be defined or would be not a suggestion. Just to clarify, the reasonable living expenses, that's an agency standard, that's a life of agency and they have people coming in at least once a year to look at their files and they could look at their files. I mean, if people are lying and hiding things that's hard to find, any private attorney that's paying birth mom expenses, it's a very set out. We don't get reasonable living expenses. You can pay rent, you can pay utilities and you can buy food and you can buy expenses and maternity. So I just, just to be clear, your issue is with agencies that are... Well, but the private attorneys have to be just a statement and check your records. We're licensed, we could be just barred. Okay. And the court can oversee. That would be good, be clear. I think there's a few attorneys in the room. They should show up for the... There would have to be a complaint for that to be reviewed. And I think the attorneys that I have dealt with have always been above the board of drop solids. Somebody told me the price that they paid their attorney good adoption and I was a little perplexed because I think I used to really get the attorney and I didn't pay you where near them. But I think one thing we can't do is we cannot put our head in the sand and to modify that, you know, Senator Jackson and Senator Robertson, although there's a great a lot of that. So we both know there's a traffic children in the state of Georgia where people are selling babies and sadly in my career, and I'm sure the Chief Deck Marshaler, we have come in contact with defects and others where sadly, women have had multiple children and because they knew there was an opportunity to profit here off that, whether it be because of addiction, whether it be because of abuse, whether it be because of mental illness and the sort of kind of stuff. And that is something that in this whole conversation we need to take serious as a part of it, that for us to have a good clean system in Georgia, we have to take the cash around and that does happen here. And we can't put our head in the sand. Yeah, I just add that for every industry that we have in Georgia, you have to turn over the rocks because there's bad behavior in many different sectors and this is only one of them. So we just have to be sure we've got the right awesome place and then we enforce the laws we have. Anything else? Okay, so everybody did a great job. It's five to one. And we're going to the jar and there is lunch. I'm going to lay right outside the room. The medic members, we are scheduled to do a tour of Twin Seaters. I think everybody else has welcomed the joint and that's available starting at 130. It's officially set up for two. We wanted to go a little bit earlier. That would be fun. Really appreciate all the great tests among you today and again all the materials will be available on the Sunday, Sunday, website. I would love to ask our next speaker. Thank you very much for being here.
