Mr Speaker and good morning colleagues
this is a happy Monday you know why
because this is the day that the Lord
has made and let us all rejoice and be
glad in it and I'm surely glad in it
because this is my 11th year in this
chamber and this is my third time
introducing the chapter of the day and
I'm proud to introduce my friend my
pastor Colby McKenzie but before I do
that I want to recognize his lovely
mother Burnett and his aunt Darlene if
you would please welcome them to this
chamber
colleagues I bring to you none other
than the Reverend Kobe McKenzie the
pastor of the Oak Grove Missionary
Baptist Church in Milledgeville Georgia
the new Pilgrim Missionary Baptist
Church in Macon Georgia and the Magnolia
Baptist Church in Montezuma Georgia the
home of the late great representative
Lynn Moore James so I am so proud to
have him here and now let us welcome
Reverend Kobe McKenzie
welcome sir good to have you much
to God our Father Jesus Christ as our
savior who died for our sins on the
calvary
to the Holy Spirit who's our comforter
and our teacher well certainly to all of
you a speaker and to those of you who
serve as elected officials
certainly to any clergy or present
when you get to your own private praying
ground of your leisure time
stand here not on my own efforts
but as a sinner saved by grace
through faith our Lord Jesus Christ
Jeremiah's gospel chapter number three
verse 15 says
and I will give you Shepherds
after my own heart
who will feed you with knowledge
and understanding
Jeremiah 3
verse 15 and I will give you Shepherds
after my own heart
which shall feed you with knowledge
and understanding
Theses are objective of our devotional
message for this brief time
simply is this rising to the spiritual
challenge
very quickly to give you a history of
the background of our texts
Jeremiah is a young lad who was from a
town called anaphor
was raised around his father hilkaya
hilkaya was a preacher Jeremiah in that
town called NFL was raised around
priests
he never sought out
never had the intention to preach or
prophesy but God called him
the Bible says that according to God
that he
pre-ordained Jeremiah
from the womb
because in Jeremiah chapter number one
it says before I formed thee in the
belly I knew thee I Sanctified an
ordained thee as a prophet to the nation
that word Prophet is different ladies
and gentlemen from the word priest
because that word Prophet simply means
one who stands on behalf of God before
the people
the word priest means one who stands
before God on behalf of the people
at the time of our text the world was
filled with immorality
brutality and in Justice
and God calls a little boy named
Jeremiah
and he says unto Jeremiah
go and speak for me Jeremiah says I am
Young
God says don't say that you're young but
go wherever Cindy
speak whatever I tell thee Jeremiah like
you and I when God speaks we need
confirmation he says Jeremiah what do
you see very quickly Jeremiah says I see
a branch off an almond tree
he says in essence a Jeremiah that means
I'm with you
he says what else do you see he says I
see a Boiling Pot of water
God says that's my angering that's
that's my wrath against the people
because of their wickedness at the time
of our text the people of God the people
of this world had fallen away from God
and falling away from worship which then
sets us into sin of idolatry what is
this gist what is the objective of the
message here it is when you look at the
word in Morality and the word injustice
and even brutality that's Jeremiah
chapter number one the background of the
text but doesn't it seem like today
immorality brutality and Injustice and
can't you hear the people saying
Jeremiah can't speak to us he cannot
prophesy to us he's too young he's too
inexperienced let me help you by the aid
of the Holy Spirit ladies and gentlemen
my brothers and sisters in Christ
when God calls you
he sanctifies you the word sanctify
means sanctification which means sacred
means for Holy use for holy living
God says in essence that the people have
been indulged in adultery but God says
in the closing of our message in chapter
number three that is just like a wife or
in essence or a husband who goes out and
cheat on their spouse
ladies and gentlemen does that seem like
today
our world we have
indulge in first teachers acts with the
any man
ladies and gentlemen
and the God we serve he's a jealous God
and whenever we seem to be at that point
of idolatry God would give us grace and
mercy but to a certain extent he will
pour out his Wrath
Jeremiah stands and speaks to the people
of God
and my challenge for you today is ladies
and gentlemen that in this world that
we're living in no matter how unpopular
this message may seem
we have a spiritual wickedness in the
land
what is the spiritual what is the soul
it is a seat and the character of our
emotions
ladies and gentlemen I too am like
Jeremiah
at the latter part of age of 15 in the
ninth grade year God called me
and whenever God calls you
it's not always about pleasing those or
to be pimped and primed by the people
because he tells Jeremiah be not afraid
of their faces
he says whatever I say unto you you
shall speak
as you serve
in this great state of Georgia
God is calling you
to rise to the spiritual challenge
because where there is no challenge
there is no growth
and I'm afraid although I'm in this new
coming generation we always want to be
congratulated but never convicted
but isn't convicted it's in not all the
people who said Kobe you're a great
preacher but it's in those individuals
like you who pulled me to the side and
told me you're wrong that helped me in
this life
so the message devotional message to you
today
is rise to the spiritual challenge
where's the spiritual challenge it is
fine in the book
Genesis through revelation
but there's another one
his name starts with Jay it's not
Jeremiah but I want to close by telling
you this thank God for Jesus
therefore we have all fallen short of
the glory of God
but the Christ that we serve no matter
your race no matter your ethnicity he
died for you when he died for me
leave this session when session is over
knowing that we must rise to the
spiritual challenge
Jeremiah was very much aware he was very
young but he was also politically alert
it was also economically alert
but at the same time
it is deceit
and the characteristic of our emotions
that corrupts the land shall we stand
for prayer
God we honor you now as
the maker and creator of all things in
all people
Lord we honor your son Jesus Christ
Lord we honor the Holy Spirit
God
thanks to you for this opportunity
thanks to these your people who have
allowed me to come
and who have accepted me
God I prayed I've searched and I assault
you for weeks now
and I've given the people everything
that you have given me
I pray Lord that these your people have
been educated today
they have been enlightened
and through the teaching of the Gospel
they have been equipped to go out and
serve and in that word challenge help
them to know to not leave emotional
riled up
but to know that there will be some
difficult days ahead there will be some
troubles God I pray for our government
no matter which party it is
because God you have the power
to work on the hearts of Kings
you have the power to work on hearts of
Queen
help us to lay down our own Pride
and as Jesus said deny ourselves
pick up our cross
and follow you
the Lord we pray for our country we pray
for the people I pray Lord that you will
bring a Revival in the land
and in the midst of Revival bring
revitalization
and God I'll give you the glory for what
you have done what you are doing right
now and what you're about to do
in Jesus name amen
let us turn to the flag for the
pleasures of Legions in unison
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America
for which
one Nations

thank you Mr Speaker
Mr Speaker your committee on information
and audits has read the journal from the
previous election later today and found
it to be correct
and not to mention what day this is
because I said I wasn't going to
this is just something to think about
the best time to plant a tree was 20
years ago
the next best time is today
truer words of wisdom were never spoken
any more eloquently than that you're
exactly right Mr chairman
chairman Tarvin the chair of the
committee on information and audits
reports that the Journal of the previous
legislative day has been read and found
to be correct is there any objection to
dispense with the reading of the journal

journal is dispensed with is there any
objection to the confirmation of the
journal chair here's none and the
journal is confirmed

five minutes then we'll get started

you that
don't even think about it
there's no excuse
absolutely no excuse I'm not going to

excuses
colleagues we're going to move on to
some special resolutions
we're gonna move on to some special
resolutions at this time
Mr clerk will you read the caption to a
special resolution
a resolution
recognizing and commending Charles S
Johnson IV
representative Park Cannon is recognized
for a resolution
thank you so much Mr Speaker today I'm
here with a coach of a soccer team
he's also a father
and he knows deeply the importance of
making sure that we care for our
families as they're going through
childbirth I'm so grateful that you and
your children are here we have a photo
of them
um up there and they're here in the
front
Langston
and Charles ages six and eight we just
thank you for being such a beautiful
surviving memory of your mother and at
this time Charles if you'd like to
address the body thank you so much
good morning good morning
um first and foremost let me thank
representative Park Cannon for thinking
of us for being a steadfast Relentless
advocate for mothers and babies in our
state
um
I love this state I'm a proud son of
Georgia my wife was a Georgia Peach
I'm proud that Georgia leads the way
in so many things
but this having the distinction
of leading our country
with the worst maternal Health outcomes
we have work to do
and so I'm proud to stand here in
solidarity with all of you because as I
say oftentimes there are only two types
of people in our country either you are
a mama or you got one
right and so I know that the work that
you all do is challenging
and there's so many issues that divide
us but this issue around ensuring that
mothers and babies have this safe
dignified birthing experience they
deserve is something that we should be
able to unify behind and rally behind
and find innovative ways to set the bar
for what
collaboration looks like when people
lead with love so it is my honor and my
privilege to receive this honor thank
you so much and I look forward to
working in collaboration with all of you
to make sure that every mother
gets to go home with their precious
children thank you so much
[Applause]
Charles we're we're sorry for your loss
but as you well know this house has
taken the lead on development policies
um
policy and funding to make sure we move
the needle on maternal mortality and we

children to be here with us today thank

representative Draper rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker isn't it true that under HB
710 the Democratic and Republican County
parties in Sly County will not have the
opportunity to appoint members to the
sly County Board of Elections
I'm sure the representative agrees with
her statement I believe that statement
and and that process is up for some sort
of debate back and forth and we
encourage you to continue to be involved
in that conversation thank you Mr
Speaker one more inquiry State your
inquiry isn't it true that under HB 710
the sly County Board of Commissioners
makes all appointments to the Board of
Elections and that most if not all of
the Commissioners are Republicans
I'm sure the lady has looked deeply into
that and believes and understands what
she
sees in slot County thank you
for what purposes representative Vermont
rise
parliamentary inquiry staging inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker isn't it true that
I normally defer to local delegations on
local issues but this bill is not merely
about local issues since Regional
Statewide and National Democratic and
Republican candidates are on the ballot
in these counties
yet the lady so States one more just
State your inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
isn't it true that since the legislative
session began eight Counties have
opposed legislation in the house to
create or reconstitute their Boards of
Elections and in every instance the
legislation proposed allows for the
possibility of the boards of election
will consist of members entirely from
one party
the lady so States there's lots of
possibilities out there and they do
occur from time to time
for what purpose is representative
Westbrook rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker State
you're in court thank you Mr Speaker
isn't it true that under HB 713 the
Democratic and Republican County parties
in Polk County will not have the
opportunity to appoint members to the
Polk County Board of Elections
I'm sure if the lady so State she's read
the bill and one further inquiry Mr
Speaker please State your inquiry isn't
it true that under HB 713 the Polk
County Board of Commissioners makes all
appointments to the Board of Elections
and that all of the Commissioners in
Polk County are Republicans
if the Lady Sue States I'm not sure
about Polk County I'm going to take a
couple more thank you Mr Speaker
for what purposes representing Glady
rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker the
state your inquiry isn't it true that
under I'm sorry isn't it true that
having both parties represented on
Boards of Elections it's critical for
checks and balances on Power and
promoting transparency sir
if the lady so States and as such I am
opposing these bills which would allow
the boards of Elections to be filed by
members of only one party sir
if the lady so states she has to vote
her conscious thank you sir
for what purposes will burchett rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
isn't it true that if any local
legislation required that a commission
appoint just one party that it would be
unconstitutional isn't that true Mr
Speaker
I've heard that the gentleman's a
constitutional scholar so I'm sure he
knows what he speaks
thank you Mr Speaker one more
State your inquiry isn't it true Mr
Speaker that no local legislation
listed up there on the board requires
our local control commissions to appoint
just one party
the gentleman so States I'm sure he
believes
of the words he just stated
what purposes represent Miller rise
thank you Mr Speaker parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry isn't it true
that Boards of election and registration
determine essential election elements
such as voter challenges election
certification and Precinct locations
which is why partisan balance is so
important
if the lady so States one more inquiry
Mr Speaker stay tuned isn't it true that
Democratic strongholds of Fulton County
DeKalb county Cobb County and Gwinnett
County all explicitly provide in their
local legislation for Republicans to sit
on their Boards of election and in fact
Republicans do sit on those Boards of
election
I'm absolutely sure the lady knows what
she says States
for what purpose does representative
Jordan Ridley rise
parliamentarian inquiry State your
inquiry isn't it true there's more than
two parties in this great country
I'm sure the gentleman knows of what he
speaks now I'm going to do something I
normally don't do but I'm going to
recognize a member for a second question
representing Draper for what purpose do
you rise thank you Mr Speaker
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
isn't it true that the concern here is
not that these bills will require that
the nominations be all from one party
but these bills do not preclude the
possibility that all the nominations
will be from one party
if the lady sow States
thank you Mr Speaker
I think all the members know where they
stand and they voted so Mr clerk will
you please lock the machines
on the passage of the bills on the local
calendar the eyes are 101 the Nays are
72. these bills haven't received the
requisite constitutional majority or
therefore passed

infantry division
begin an early morning March towards
Baghdad from the northern border of
Kuwait
we accepted the mission with courage
none of us knew if we would survive
but we went anyway because our country
asked us to
What followed was 26 days of sustained
combat with third infantry division
units from both Fort Benning and Fort
Stewart leading the way
we won't ever forget the sights and
smells of combat but we should also
never forget the heroism of our American
Military
one such example is Sergeant First Class
Paul R Smith
the first Medal of Honor recipient
awarded during the Iraq War and a member
of the third infantry division
Sergeant Smith fought until his very
last breath protecting his men
when they finally recovered him
Sergeant Smith was found slumped over
his 50 caliber machine gun
he had gone through three boxes of
ammunition before he was killed by the
enemy
and a note to his parents Sergeant Smith
said
there are two ways to come home
stepping off the plane or being carried
off the plane
it doesn't matter to me because I am
prepared to give all that I am to ensure
that all my boys make it home
thank God for American heroes like this
in addition to Sergeant Smith's heroism
the third infantry division
was awarded a presidential unit Citation
for its heroism and Valor in combat
it was such a privilege to serve with
these men and women
they were in our America's in Georgia's

chairman Hawkins is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker Senate Bill 223
addresses a need that we have patients I
need that patients have especially our
most ill patients those who have gone
through chemotherapy cancer treatment
and now uh their only Avenue is to go
into clinical trials this bill lays into
code that the different hospitals
clinical trial organizations whoever it
may be can reimburse the patient for for
hotel stays and travel
to me it's sort of amazing we have to do
this but such is the case so that's what
this bill speaks to it it allows
especially important it allows people to
go into clinical trials whether they
have the financial means to do so or not
so this opens it up for everyone in any
patient if there are no questions Mr
Speaker I will yield the well
you have no questions
the gentleman has yielded the well is
there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair here
has done the previous question is
ordered is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the chair he has done the
report of the committee is agreed to
shall this bill now pass all in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote Yes
all those opposed will vote no and the
clerk will unlock the machine
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
170 the Nay zero the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional

Mr Clark will you read the caption to SB
5959
Senate Bill 59 by Senator Hatchet to the
50th and others to be entitled an act to
amend chapter 12 the title 45 the
official code of George annotated
relating to the governor since
established the office of the Inspector
General this bill ever referred the
committee on Judiciary that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
chair recognizes a representative Hong
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I present to you SB
59 this has to do with the officer of
the Inspector General what this bill
will do is codify that office as well as
grant them law enforcement Authority the
office of the Inspector General has been
in place since 2003. their job is to
um they're essentially an oversight
investigator for fraud waste any type of
ethical issues within the executive
branch they don't do any oversights over
Judiciary uh or legislative branch
but just the executive branch and again
what this bill will do is um
codify the the office as well as give
them law enforcement Authority in order
for them to subpoena and have arrest
Powers I'll take any questions Mr
Speaker
representative Jasmine Clark to your
left has a question
thank you Mr Speaker this is General
lady yield I do um so you said that this
office specifically focuses on fraud at
the executive level is that did I hear
that correct so any employees officers
um within the executive branch so
different departments and agencies
within the executive branch there's a
general idea for the yield yes so
um by creating this law enforcement arm
of the inspector General's office will
they uh will they carry firearms and be
arresting members of or staff or
whatever from the executive branch or by
what will be their jurisdiction as far
as who they can carry off in handcuffs
correct and they will have arrest power
so they have to be certified peace
officers that will have arrest Powers
within currently the office of Inspector
General they have about nine or ten
employees currently and about four of
them are posted fight officers so it
will allow them to be able to arrest and
in addition to investigate and then to
General lady yield for one more yes I'm
just curious
usually when we do things like this
there's a reason is there a reason why
we need to is there did something happen
that initiated this bill needing to come
to our desk today yes
um so again this has this office has
been and this agency has been in place
since 2003
um
but because they haven't been able to
have certain powers like subpoena powers
and arrest Powers it has delayed their
investigation it has put certain
officers in a dangerous position where
they are
faced with faced with criminals that
they are unable to arrest right away
based on their investigation so and they
had to rely on different agencies for
these law enforcement powers and so
this has been brought up and it has been
it has been an issue so this will allow
them to do their job more efficiently
thank you thank you
the lady has no further questions thank
you and I um asked for a favorable
consideration of this Bill thank you and
I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well is there
any objection to the previous question
being ordered chair hits none the
previous question is ordered is there
any objection to agreeing to the report
of the committee which was favorable to
the passage of the bill chair he was now

agreed to shall this bill now pass all

and the clerk will unlock the machine
[Music]

have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine on
the passage of the bill the yeas were
171 the Nays two the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed members
we're going to take out one more bill
then we're going to break for lunch and
come back and finish our work Mr clerk
if you'll read the caption to Senate
bill 181-181
Senate Bill 181 by Senator Payne to the
54th and others to be entitled an Act 2
amend chapter 25 the title 50 the fish
Dakota George annotated relating the
Georgia technology Authority shows
require such authority to conduct
certain fingerprint criminal background
checks of all current and prospective
employees contractors and subcontractors
this bill haven't referred to the
committee on Judiciary non-civil that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
chairman Tyler Paul Smith is recognized
to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I'll be brief since
I'm holding up in lunch and I'm Baptist
so house members I bring to you today
Senate Bill 181 and just to let you know
this does three things it allows the GTA
which the Georgia technology authority
to fingerprint employees with access to
or proximity to federal tax information
it allows GTA to fingerprint contractors
and subcontractors it also would allow
GTA to fingerprint all current and
future employees beginning on January
the 1st of 2025. just so you know recent
audit conducted by the Internal Revenue
Service determined that certain
employees of the GTA have access to
federal tax information but have not
undergone the fingerprint criminal
background check required in the IRS
publication 1075.
the IRS had actually established a
January 31st 2023 deadline for GTA to
comply with these requirements and
they're having to give weekly updates on
this matter until we can get this done
here in the legislature so with that Mr
Speaker uh year yield for any questions
if there are any you have no questions I
did have one are you a tax attorney no
sir I specifically made sure not to take
that same Professor that I had in tort
law well so you do have one question if
you'll yield yes sir
representative Ramon is recognized for a
question does the gentleman yield yes
for Coalition thank you
um just really quickly is the agency
itself doing the fingerprinting in-house
are they going to have someone else do
it for them and then it gets sent to the
gbi I understand what it would be uh
currently I want to say that it would
probably be down at the sheriff's office
here in Fulton Canada that's usually how
that works okay so that's my
understanding one more question yeah
would would this bill allow for them to
be able to use other vendors to get
fingerprinting in case for whatever
reason someone can't access the
sheriff's office they could potentially
is my understanding so I'll follow up
and get an answer for you on that
specifically though thank you thank you
gentleman year for one more just one
more miss one more representative
Jasmine Clark is recognized to your left
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield for my friends
um this is a very easy question I'm just
curious why wait until January of 2025
if you said this is something that is
actually
urgent
um and it specifically says January 2025
not why why not until the signing by the
governor so my understanding is that
this is giving them time to make sure
that all the folks that they bring in
the subcontract workout for GTA that
they could actually have them
fingerprinted and complied with my
understanding is that the actual GTA
employs those would be the first to be
fingerprinted under this legislation
once we pass it
does the gentleman further yield one
more is it possible that
um this can be done much sooner than
that it seems pretty urgent and 225 is
pretty far away that's what we're hoping
is they'll get it done as soon as they
can and would be done hopefully even a
year before that
thank you thank you Mr Speaker with that
I yield well
gentleman has shielded the well is there

we're going to uh leave our rules
calendar for today and go back and pick
up a bill that was on our consideration
our rules calendar uh Thursday we didn't
get to Mr Clark will you read the
caption to SB 149 149. set up a 149
percent of Albers to 56 and others to be
entitled an act to amend article two
Title 11 of the official code of Georgia
annotated relating to sales under the
commercial code so it's enact the
Georgia door-to-door sales Act
this bill ever referred to the committee
on agriculture and consumer affairs that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
by committee substitute
chairman Dickey
is recognized to present the bill but
first he has to tell us what kind of
effect the freeze had on the peach crop
if you don't mind Mr chairman before you
present the bill uh thank you Mr Speaker
I wish I had better news about the peace
crop but uh this morning when I left
mizal it was uh 25 degrees and turned
freezing at three o'clock and I'm afraid
we've got a lot of Frozen
dead peaches but you know parm's always
optimistic so I'm optimistic we got a
few left
but we will see uh as the days go on so
thank you everyone for your asking and
concern and uh
you mornings like this I think we set a
record in making Georgia for the lowest
temperature on this date so but it makes
you understand who's in control and it's
not uh it's not us and uh but God's good
awesome thank you Mr chairman uh if you
will present the bill
uh thank you Mr Speaker and um
colleagues I bring you a SB
1409 it's a uh it's a a consumer bill
consumer protection Bill one of the best
ones I've seen is for large unsus
solicited door-to-door transactions uh
it's modeled after the Federal Trade
commission's uh National door to door
cooling off here that we've had since
1992 and that's just a three-day cooling
off period but when we have these large
unsolicited door-to-door
uh salesman
um where this bill takes it to a 30-day
cooling off period uh with three
elements that might happen it's
unsolicited it's ten thousand dollars or
more in cost uh it includes a leasing or
a financing of 10 years or more
and uh eligible for federal tax credits
and so this bill just really simply
gives our Georgia consumers more time to
check the information that they're
presented to them
unsolicited some of these large
transactions are very complex very large
ties our consumers up for many years
uh on these and um
and so I think the bill is is uh
tailored to not to include some other uh
transactions but but these uh large ones
uh a lot of these uh cons these uh solar
transactions of what this build is
really targeted toward and um I'll just
um I want to also thank our house
committee uh chairman Parsons and
representative Gallup for working on
this for several years is two this is
not their bill but but they have really
uh targeted some some other legislation
that would would help in this area for
our consumers so with that
Mr Speaker I would happy to take any
questions
you have no questions thank you I'll ask
you a favorable consideration
the gentleman has yielded of the whale

notice requirements this bill ever heard

that committee recommends that this bill
do pass
representative will Wade
from the ninth house district is
recognized to present the bill
thanks speaker ladies and gentlemen the
gentlemen I Rise to present to you
Senate Bill 42 this is a Governor's
priority Bill and
um I also want to say I appreciate this
house taking up the issue and the
seriousness of human trafficking in our
state and in this country and I believe
we also need to give
a true shout out to the first lady of
Georgia Marty Kemp who has prioritized
this effort and brought grace to the
process but also meaning
today this bill just does two things to
exist in code we're taking a May to a
shall as it relates to minimum and
maximum fines and I believe that this is
also
in partnership with our communities and
businesses because I believe that most
business owners want us to continue to
be the number one state in which to do
business and a simple notification to
ensure that we can protect folks in the
state women especially in children is
warranted and with that I'm happy to
answer any questions if not I'm happy to

set up a 44 of our Senator hatch to the
50th and others are being titled act to
amend title 16 in the official go to
Georgiana relating to crimes and
offenses so survived for the mandatory
minimum penalties for violation of the
street gang terrorism and prevention act
this bill that refer to the committee on
Judiciary non-civil that committee
recommends that this bill do pass by
committee substitute
before we begin debate on this bill I'll
let all the members know we do have
members that will speak in fact the the
author will present the bill we have
members in favor those opposed and we
have a Minority Report and we do have
some time limits so we would adhere to
those time limits
chair recognizes
Governor flow leader Hong to present the
bill
thank you Mr Speaker I am here to
present Senate Bill 44 on behalf of the
governor
this bill revises the punishment for
violations of the Georgia street gang
and terrorism prevention Act
it provides for enhanced sentencing for
recruiting when such violation involves
a person under 17 or a person with a
disability and additionally codifies the
current practice for issuing or bonds so
specifically this bill
will establish a mandatory minimum
sentence of five years if you are in
violation of the criminal street gang
statute
in addition it's going to enhance
penalties on those adult gang members
who are recruiting our children that are
under 17. gangs must recruit in order to
survive and we are sending a strong
message with this bill that if you come
into our state and you are recruiting
our children then we will have severe
punishment for you
through this spell
um you we are helping our victims we are
helping victims of gang activity as well
as our children from being recruited
into gangs
in addition we are we are codifying what
current judges are doing as far as or
bonds or unsecure judicial release
so it will have the judges look to
whether or not a accused has been
convicted of any bail jumping in the
last five years it will also have the
judge look to whether or not there's
been a bench warrant that's been issued
in the last five years and it does not
affect any traffic offense failure to
appear
in addition it will have the judge look
to any criminal history of the accused
when considering or bonds and with that
Mr Speaker I will yield for any
questions
you have no questions
you do have thank you a couple now okay
almost
two-year left representing more to your
left has a question representative Moore
is recognized for a question
good morning this is the gentlelady
yield well I do
not the well but you yes
um when you said the mandatory is that
five years or ten years because the
mandatory minimum in Georgia is 10 is
that correct no it's not currently
um this is enhancing it to five years
currently it's three years
is the minimum now would the judge have
leeway to go to the maximum of 10.
so
this bill is going to increase the
sentencing from 5 to 15 years and just
like any sentencing as far as judges go
judges can look to and and sentence up
to the maximum if if needed correct I
see so 5 to 15 years five to fifteen
years for gang activity now if you are
recruiting
someone that is under 17 then the
um the sentence goes from 5 to 20 years
and do you further I'm sorry 10 to 20
years you further yield yes now when we
talk about mandatory minimums that is
without any chance for parole is that
correct
ah
so it depends it depends on the crime it
depends on the sentencing so if as far
as the gang activity portion goes and
this is gang activity if you're a leader
if you're recruiting so there are
different things that the judge is going
to look at in order to factor in the
sentencing portion and so if the if the
judge decides to minimize that they will
have to go through certain requirements
to see whether or not the accused fits
into that category or not in order to go
off of the mandatory minimum sentencing
and the judge has to put on record why
the judge did not follow the minimum
sentencing if you are recruiting on
those that are under 17 there is no uh
there is no going off of the mandatory
minimum no no chance at all for parole
during the mandatory management and if
in fact the judge did decide to go to
the maximum of 10 to 20 they would in
that would not be any that's correct any
chance for parole as well that's correct
all right thank you thank you
I do the lady yield representative
Roberts right out in front of you is
recognized for our question thank you Mr
Speaker does the gentle lady I do
um in this bill you talk about
recruiting is 17 and under is that
correct does it distinguish a recruiter
who is actually under 17 themselves no
it doesn't and we
um and I think that it's good that we
don't distinguish that because then you
are opening the gate for gang members to
actually use those that are under 17 in
order to recruit in order to continue
getting activity so this bill will focus
on those adults that are recruiting
those that are under 17. if you are
under 17 and recruiting those that are
under 17 they will be prosecuted under
the juvenile code as a juvenile
okay thank you thank you
lady further yield I will yield for one
more question Mr Speaker
the gentleman from
the 15th representative gamble has a
question straight out in front of you
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentlelady
yield I do
is it not true that this bill is
codifying best practices of Judges
across the state in regard to issuing or
bonds that is correct and somebody that
does practice regularly in front of
Courts I know that the judges do you
look at criminal history as well as any
type of bench warrants or failure to
appears in the past
is generally further yield I do is it
not further true that this bill does not
preclude a judge from issuing an or Bond
and insures to the public that at the
very least a judge has reviewed the most
relevant information applicable to an
individual's Bond determination that is
correct and it does state that the judge
May so correct thank you
thank you Mr Speaker I um respectfully
asked for a yes vote on this bill and I
yield the well
the lady has yielded well
we have some folks in favor and some
opposed representative Tonya Miller is
recognized for up to 30 minutes
representing Miller
thank you
thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon
colleagues
I stand before you today to speak
against the passage of Senate bill 44.
as a former federal and state prosecutor
and current defense and civil rights
attorney I have spent more than 20 years
believe it or not
on the front lines of our Criminal
Justice System working to make
neighborhoods safer
by ensuring that both criminals and our
judicial system are held accountable now
before I get started on my rationale for
asking you to oppose Senate bill 44. I
want to give you a hypothetical just so
that it's really clear what the
applicability of these mandatory
minimums will do
let's say for example there are three
young men 17 years old who get together
for the purposes of committing crimes
that's essentially all it takes to be
considered a criminal street gang in
Georgia three or more people who
associate or organize for the purpose of
committing crimes now those crimes do
not have to be violent
those crimes can be misdemeanors
there is a possibility that people will
organize or associate to commit crimes
that are not violent so just put a pin
in that as I share this hypothetical
three boys let's say they're from my
neighborhood Grant Park right I'll use
my neighborhood so it's not putting one
else's neighborhood on blast
these three boys call themselves The
Grant Park Boys
there are three seniors at Jackson high
school and they like to get together to
tag or do graffiti on buildings they
they do smiley faces and they do it on
lockers they also like to get together
and pull their money after school
to buy marijuana now let me stop there
because I want you to know that nothing
in my comments is meant to endorse any
of this Behavior criminal Street gang
behavior is bad it is wrong and it is
something that we ought to actually come
up with policies that combat against
but let's just stick with this
hypothetical for a second
these three 17 year old boys have just
violated Georgia's gang act which by the
way is the most robust
the most comprehensive and the most
powerful in all of the United States
there is no dispute about that
my Grant Park Boys get arrested my Grant
Park Boys get charged with participating
in criminal Street gang activity
those boys will each face a mandatory
minimum sentence of five years in prison
to serve in the Department of
Corrections
five years to serve
now let's say one of those 17 year old
boys
pulls his 16 year old cousin to come
along with them when they pull their
money together to buy some marijuana to
smoke at one of their houses
now that 17 year old boy who has
recruited someone under the age of 17 to
participate in criminal street gang
activity that's 17 year old boy excuse
me that 17 year old boy is facing a
mandatory minimum 10 years to serve in
the Georgia Department of Corrections
this bill
is too inflexible it is too broad and it
does not do what we actually need to be
doing to keep our communities safer and
by the way that 10-year mandatory
minimum sentence
nobody has the discretion to reduce not
the prosecutor and not the judge
so that 17 year old boy
no matter what his previous condition is
before getting arrested
we'll be going to the Department of
Corrections under this bill that will be
legal in the state of Georgia
under SB 440s penalties
we are not doing the best that we can to
get at what it is that we all really
want to get at and that is the most
violent offenders in our community
violent criminals must be held
accountable nothing in what I'm saying
to you today is meant to undermine this
principle
I say this as having been a person who
prosecuted violent felonies for more
than a decade murders
rapists child molesters I can tell you
that I have seen in my career on the
front lines of our Criminal Justice
System the worst of the worst
I have made sure that people have gone
to prison for the rest of their lives
when the facts and the law require it
so understand this position is not one
that comes out of a place of softness or
naivety
naivete however we say that about what
is happening
in our Criminal Justice System Senate
Bill 44 is wrong
because it won't make us safer
this bill will move our state backwards
solely for the the the purpose of
appearing
for appearing to be tough on crime
so when it comes to Public Safety I give
this bill an f and let me tell you why
one this bill strips flexibility away
from our Superior Court judges
this bill is not supported by facts
and what is actually happening in our
communities as it relates to the
recruitment of young people into gangs
here is a news flash
there's not some big homie from La
that's taking a plane to Georgia
creeping around playgrounds
and recruiting teenagers to become
members of the Gangster Disciples
it is far more likely that the people
who are recruiting children into
criminal street gangs are themselves
children
so if we really care about saving our
kids if we really care about doing what
is best for the most vulnerable among us
we ought to vote no against this bill
and we ought to get down to the business
of doing the things that stop kids from
joining gangs in the first place
this bill fails to implement
evidence-based strategies actually
proven to prevent children from being
recruited into gangs and making us safer
now I know this is not a popular
position to take
it is not difficult to stand up here as
a former prosecutor
as a person who ran on
community-centered public safety and
tell you to vote no against this bill so
I'm going to spend some time explaining
to you and to the public why I think
it's so important that we do
first of all this bill lacks flexibility
what does Senate Bill 44 say to our
Superior Court judges
The Gatekeepers of Justice in our state
the people who actually see defendants
and victims and hear all the facts in
any given case
Senate Bill 44 suggests that those
currently holding the political power
believe that they know better than any
judge how to best affect Justice in any
particular case
it is sometimes worth reminding
ourselves that the separation of powers
is enshrined in our state's Constitution
for good reason
the separation of powers is crucial to
our democratic form of government
it works to prevent the concentration of
power in any one branch and it provides
for those checks and balances that we
learned about in eighth grade social
studies
in one way this bill would strip
sentencing power away from our judges
and give it to prosecutors so there are
two sentencing Provisions in this case
one makes any criminal street gang
activity offense whether the people are
committing violent crimes or not a
mandatory minimum five years to serve
that's the first part
the second enhanced enhanced enhancement
would make the recruitment of a 17 year
old by any person including a minor
a mandatory minimum 10 years to serve
for which there is no deviation
and so I want to correct something and
make it clear before I go any further
because there will be circumstances
under which
people who are 16 and who are 15 and who
are 14 if they are charged as adults in
our criminal justice system
they will be subject to the same
mandatory minimum sentences as adults
let me say that again to be clear
there are mechanisms in our law
to charge people as young as 14.
as adults
there are mechanisms in our law
to move to remove children from juvenile
court and have their cases adjudicated
in Superior Court as young as 14.
those kids
if they are also accused of recruiting
someone under the age of 17 will be
subject to these mandatory minimums in
our current judicial system as this bill
is written
be clear on what you're saying today if
you vote Yes to this bill
now while the first part of the sentence
the mandatory five for any criminal
street gang activity can be reduced by a
prosecutor if they choose to do so it's
in their sole discretion
okay
can be reduced by a judge but only under
very limited circumstances
the judge can depart from the five years
after seven I think it's six or seven
factors are met and they all have to be
met and the judge does not have the
ability to say well six of the seven are
met so I want to I want to depart or
four of the seven are met I want to
depart that is why this statute as
written is so inflexible and I've
already told you that on the recruiting
element of it there is no deviation from
anybody
our laws need to be flexible enough they
need to be nimble enough to allow us to
deal appropriately with the most violent
Among Us
and to restore and rehabilitate the ones
that we can
this bill robs our criminal justice
system of this carefully crafted balance
and my friends this balance is important
it is critical to making us safer
this bill is not based on facts
it wasn't so long ago that Governor deal
established the Georgia Council on
Criminal Justice Reform with the
blessing and support of this body
Governor deal realized that the way our
state was handling Crime and Punishment
needed to be rethought both from a human
and an economic perspective over a
five-year period the Council on Criminal
Justice Reform conducted a comprehensive
review of every aspect of our state's
criminal justice system
that comprehensive review led to a
series of reforms to our Criminal
Justice System including this is some
not all
reducing some non-violent felonies to
misdemeanors which of course decreased
the population in our prison
increase the number of accountability
courts from 3 to 150 which take in
veterans the mentally ill and those
suffering from addiction
who have committed non-violent crimes
and connects them with the appropriate
wrap-around services that they need all
under the supervision of a court all for
the purpose of diverting them from our
prisons
these reforms reduce the rate of
recidivism and the number of
incarcerations dramatically now this is
pre-covered because I think once you
talk about covid the numbers start to
skew a little bit as they have all
across the country
but from 2009 to 2018 the number of
offenders sent to sent to Georgia
prisons dropped by almost 20 percent
based on just these reforms
and the number of black Georgians who
were imprisoned dropped by 30 percent
all of this was done in good faith by
Governor deal by the Supreme Court
Justice chief justice Boggs and all of
the members who participated with with a
focus on public safety
which led to an overall drop in our
crime rate because the reforms focused
on Redemption Rehabilitation Fair
sentencing and appropriately saving our
resources for the worst offenders Among
Us
what we are witnessing here today
some might argue
is an attempt to assert to usurp the
authority of our judicial branch
for the purpose of what appears to many
to be political grandstanding
there are some who believe that signing
this bill into law would send a quote
strong leader strong message to gang
leaders
to paraphrase a message we have heard at
the highest levels of our state
government
you come after our children and endanger
our communities we will come after you
that certainly sounds tough
but what actually does this bill propose
to do
to do in reality affirmatively to
protect our children
Senate Bill 44 is too clunky it's too
inflexible it provides no safeguards for
juvenile offenders who often become
involved with gang activity as a result
of other juveniles
instead of adopting evidence-based
strategies seeking to prevent violent
crimes including strengthening
educational wraparounds for poor
students at home interventions that have
been proven to help poor kids who lack
Parental Guidance and support at home
housing support for children who are
experiencing homelessness I cannot tell
you how many folks out here join gangs
because they don't have anywhere else to
go
they are literally hungry
they are literally stealing Vienna
sausages from gas stations
employment programs for our young people
increased access to programs proven to
reduce gang involvement by strengthening
mentorship programs
this bill
prescribes a one-size-fits-all approach
that is heavy on prison and light on
Hope
now gangs and gangs gang violence are a
serious problem and that absolutely must
be addressed it must be addressed and
there are ways to do it we must focus
our deterrent efforts on the few the few
who are causing the most problems we
must be smart about how we utilize our
resources to focus on the most dangerous
among us we cannot continue to keep
painting with a broad brush because the
sound bites
make hay for us back home
any serious attempt to address the
problem of children being recruited into
gangs must begin with tackling the root
causes
we know which children are most at risk
at becoming involved with the gang let's
save those children
Let's help those children let's
interrupt the process of gang recruiting
in a meaningful way it's not a mystery
the primary factors
are child abuse and neglect
academic problems disciplinary problems
at school
a lack of Parental involvement
poverty hunger and homelessness
alcohol and drug abuse
and of course mental health problems
when children are acting out it is not
because something is inherently wrong
with them it's more often because
something has happened to them
we are most often seeing the impact of
quote adverse childhood experiences
living in a state of poverty in and of
itself is deemed
in adverse childhood experience
children and young people join gangs for
many reasons their brains are still
developing remember this conversation
from last week
about how 17 year olds just don't have
the mental capacity to know what's best
it's not certain 17 year olds it's all
of them
it's the nature of being a 17 year old
or a 16 year old or a 14 year old or a
15 year old
they cannot and often do not make wise
choices anybody ever raised a teenager
especially in the absence of positive
role models and Alternatives in their
lives
according to the most recent data from
kids count twenty percent of all
children in Georgia 20 percent of our
precious children in this state
they're still precious right
20 percent of our children in Georgia
are living below the poverty level of
those 20 percent half are living in what
is defined as extreme poverty
if we truly truly want to address
violent crime and gangs and interrupt
the lifeblood which is in fact the
recruitment of young children we cannot
and should not ignore this connection
many young people many ask any
prosecutor or defense lawyer or social
worker or judge many young people join
gangs because an older sibling or a
neighbor is involved in the Gang
this bill is disproportionately more
likely to harm teenagers and minors with
slightly older siblings or family
members who might be associated with
these gangs
are we as legislators really prepared to
take the responsibility for these
unintended consequences for 14 and 15
and 16 and 17 year old kids being sent
to prison for mandatory minimum terms of
10 years
without regard to whether or not they
actually did anything violent
this bill will eradicate the backstop of
judicial discretion and in some cases
prosecutorial discretion
please read it closely
as I stated in my hypothetical the 17
year old who recruits the 16 year old
to tag buildings and smoke marijuana
would not have the ability to have a
prosecutor or a judge reduce that
sentence
our judges should be trusted to do their
jobs
to hear all case facts and to provide
sentences appropriately
if they don't we should trust the voters
to remove them
or the judicial qualifications
commission to discipline them
we as legislators should not substitute
our judgment for theirs in these very
fact-specific important determinations
each individual case is different
and is made up of different facts people
circumstances it's the duty of our
judges they get a lot of practice at it
believe it or not
to weigh all of these factors and to
consider them in the sentencing process
it is a fact that this bill should it
become law will disproportionately
affect people of color
it will disproportionately affect people
of color
if we are sincere about protecting all
of our children
from being recruited into gang
membership then I emphatically ask you
why or not we why are we not willing to
do more to invest in proven gang
prevention programs that would benefit
these very children
let's invest time and resources in
addressing the factors that make these
children vulnerable in the first place
that make them Prime targets to be
recruited or enticed into gang
membership
instead we are about to spend Untold
sums of money locking the door
indiscriminately on their Futures we
could do so much more in this state to
ensure that the children in Georgia
don't feel the need to join a criminal
gang we know that 95 percent of a
child's brain development happens within
the first five years of life let's talk
about some of the things we can do
before the child reaches the age of
kindergarten why are we not providing
pre-kindergarten for all Georgia's
children
we know that the number of quality rated
preschool providers in our state is
woefully inadequate for our population
in over half of the 159 counties in
Georgia there are fewer than 50 percent
of the daycare providers that meet
quality rated standards
how many of you are aware that only
about five to seven percent of all
eligible families in our state receive
subsidies for child care
from the Georgia Department of early
care and learning due to a lack of
funding and resources what does this say
about how much we truly care about our
quote most vulnerable
children
we know the quality after we know that
quality after school programs keep our
young people out of trouble
and out of the reach of potential Bad
actors in our community yet there are a
quarter of a million Georgia children
who are at home unsupervised during
after school hours every day due to a
lack of funding for programs in their
communities that would provide for
after-school care
another primary purpose of sb-44 I keep
wanting to call it 440 that was another
s Bill SB bill
um
as expressed by the supporters is that
it will be an effective deterrent to
criminal gang activity we've talked
about this debate about whether or not
mandatory minimums are actually an
effective determine deterrent to
criminal gang activity or to crime in
general
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret it's probably not one that a lot
of you don't know especially if you
worked in our criminal justice system
people who commit crimes
especially children who commit crimes
have no clue about what we do down here
they don't know penalties
how can they be deterred by something
that they don't even know
many of them don't even understand the
difference between a public defender and
a prosecutor
when they get into the courtroom
I've actually had to explain that to
children that I've represented
Georgia already has as I stated before
one of the most robust anti-gang
statutes in the entire country
and it has been in place for many many
many years
we're probably number one in terms of
legislation combating ganks
yet our anti-gang laws have not deterred
gangs from taking root in our community
why because it takes more than just
passing laws
as a Fulton County prosecutor as I told
y'all I served in both the crimes
against women and children in the
homicide unit
again this is not me being naive
but we just have got to understand and
realize
that there has to be an ability for the
folks who are working on the front lines
to have flexibility when we lock the
door and throw away the key
we must always remember that that is not
the end
the offender is still connected to the
community that offender will most often
one day return to the community and the
longer they've been incarcerated the
harder it is to re-enter them into
society the more difficult it is for
them to become productive members of
society to get housing to get jobs to
not recidivate
this does not make us safer
with one out of every 18 adults under
some form of Correctional control
Georgia has the highest rate of
Correctional Supervision in the country
to put this in perspective
George's rate of Correctional control is
73 percent higher than that of
Pennsylvania the state with the second
highest
being tough on crime requires more than
standing behind a microphone and saying
if you come for our children will come
after you
we have a systemic problem in our
communities where gang violence has
taken hold it is rooted in poverty it is
rooted in fear and it is rooted in
hopelessness local communities should be
incentivized to come together bring all
stakeholders to the table and create
plans that will work to prevent violent
crime these plans must be both law
enforcement LED and Community centered
and led by the folks in our community
my distinguished house colleagues I
implore you
to question why we are departing from
the path Governor deal placed us on in
2011.
a national model for successful Criminal
Justice Reform initiatives a path that
led to lower rates of incarceration and
thus saving tax dollar money
taxpayer money
a path that led to
1729 people graduating from Georgia
accountability courts in 2017 alone with
each graduate producing over 22 000 in
economic benefits and savings to the
state in all more than 38 million
because we were able to divert
when it's appropriate
when we are flexible
when we operate based on facts and this
information came from the Georgia
University of Georgia Carl Vinson
Institute
in summary
this is what we should be focused upon
in this body continuing down the path of
proven Criminal Justice Reform work
investing in solutions that are based
upon evidence and facts I implore you to
reconsider your support of how of Senate
Bill 44 especially if your true intent
is to solve the problem of young
children being recruited into gangs let
us take on the hard work of really and
truly supporting our most vulnerable
our children one of five of whom are
living in poverty in our state let's
tackle the root issues of poverty and
hopelessness by investing in Resources
by investing our resources in the
programs we know that make a difference
in terms of preventing our children from
even being enticed by a gang in the
first place
and let us get back on the path that we
have deviated from
the one that is proven to be effective
and to save taxpayer dollars thank you I
yield Mr Speaker
the lady has yielded the well
we will now have up to 30 minutes for
those who want to speak in favor of the
bill
representing Barry Fleming is recognized
to speak
Senate Bill 44 representative Fleming
thank you Mr Speaker and members of the
house I rise today in support of Senate
bill 44. and arise to tell you some real
life examples of why this package of
gang anti-street game legislation that
we've been working on now with Governor
Kemp's leadership really does work and
tell you some stories about that the
governor's floor leader asked me to come
and share the information with the whole
house that I did with the house
Judiciary Committee when we debated the
very bill that's right before you now to
understand what I'm about to tell you
you need to understand the geography of
the part of the state that I come from
if you look at the map of Georgia over
near the greater Augusta area you will
see that the area we call the CSRA the
central Savannah River area is really
two metropolitan areas that act together
as one you've got the Augusta side with
Columbia County and the surrounding
counties of close to half a million
people and then right across the
Savannah River you've got the South
Carolina portion of our metropolitan
area close maybe to a quarter of a
million people Aitkin County North
Augusta that area the two communities as
I said usually work at one socially
business-wise if you're an attorney you
quite often practice in both States
because your client doesn't care where
you practice he wants you to handle this
business for him well unfortunately the
criminal gang system that we're fighting
over that works the same way too
for the longest time they didn't care if
their business was on the South Carolina
side or the Georgia side until recently
and something changed and that's what
I'm here to tell you about with Governor
Kemp's leadership over these past few
years as we have focused on cracking
down on street gang crime in Georgia it
really has made a difference and let me
give you the example
in Georgia over in the guest area for a
while we had a local prosecutor and a
federal prosecutor that worked well
together and they took these tools that
we have given them through these
anti-street game and they started going
after these street gangs it got so bad
they said that when you would arrest the
gang members and bring them to be booked
they would say man don't gang me man
don't gang me now what does that mean
and they're slaying that means they
understand that when they get arrested
on the Georgia side the ability to put
them behind bars for what they've done
and keep them there away from our kids
and our other family members that are
being harmed was much more significant
than they had been arrested on the South
Carolina side also South Carolina
officials were talking about the rise in
the gang activity on the South Carolina
side and directly relating it to fact
that the gangs got smart and they were
moving out of the Augusta area across
the Savannah River to South Carolina
because it was a easier for them to do
business there and it was easier for
them to get away and not get punished as
severely for some of the horrendous
things that they were doing in our
community ladies and gentlemen of this
house that is a real life example of how
our focus on anti-streak gang laws and
why Senate Bill 44 fits in there is
exactly the right way forward to us to
go anybody that stands here from this
well and tries to tell you that this
doesn't work all you need is a couple of
prosecutors who will do it the good news
on that is that we have passed laws to
allow now our attorney general to step
into areas of this state where we have
weak on crime prosecutors that won't use
these gang laws that we've passed and
ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell
you from my own Community this stuff
will and does work when you use it I
urge you to once again vote Yes for
Senate Bill 44 another part a great part
of the governor's package of cracking
down on gang crime in this state Mr
Speaker I yield the well
the gentleman has yielded the well
Majority Leader illustration is
recognized
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker ladies and
gentlemen of the house I just felt
compelled to come up here and and talk
with you about this bill here today I
recall the old saying
you're entitled to your own opinion but
you're not entitled to your own facts
and I unfortunately think that the what
we've heard from the well
earlier today is just inconsistent with
the facts
and I like to really focus on the
language that's in the bill and really
talk to you as a former prosecutor
myself and the experience that I've had
observing the criminal justice system
earlier today we heard in this bill we
heard debated that it's too inflexible
repeated too inflexible the judge has no
discretion
if you actually look at the bill it does
provide discretion line 93 in the
Court's discretion a judge May depart
from the mandatory minimum sentence
and I really hope is this legislation is
covered
that it's covered according what to
what's actually in the bill
not what folks say remember say here in
the well
a judge is authorized to depart from the
sentencing guidelines if the judge makes
his determination that it's appropriate
and then if the judge
line 105 to 106 the judge shall specify
on the record the circumstances for the
reduction and the interest served by
such departure so the judge and his or
her discretion in the courtroom can take
a look at the facts that are involved in
the case and do what's best to serve
Justice
so any assertion that a judge's hands
are tied here by legislators is just
inaccurate
now another issue was raised that
the criminal Georgia Council on Criminal
Justice Reform
was not supportive of mandatory minimums
or work to remove those from the statute
I served on that Council for several
years
and I'll just tell you you can look at
the state of our law
mandatory minimums were not repealed
under the Council on Criminal Justice
Reform now in fact the primary objective
of the Criminal Justice Reform Council
was to make sure that Public Safety was
preserved as we really went at some of
the underlying causes such as addiction
and Drug crimes
we didn't repeal mandatory minimum
sentences no what's happened is that
term has now been used as a buzzword to
try to attack legislation
and what we have put into the law is
Provisions such as the one in this bill
to allow judges the discretion to do
what's right under the circumstance the
judge is closest to the facts
now additionally As I understood what
was said earlier from the well there was
an assertion that
time could not be paroled
I even checked when I heard that when I
understood that to have been said to to
verify if Senate Bill 44 is enacted
Georgia Board on Pardons and paroles
will still make determinations as to how
to grid these offenses
we're not doing anything as far as
taking away the power to consider
those convicted of being eligible for
parole that is still retained even if
this bill passes here today
so you're entitled to your to your own
opinion but you're not entitled to your
own facts and if you look at the
legislation that's presented here today
this goes after a very serious criminal
Enterprise issue in our state criminal
street gangs it's been estimated
estimated or connected to
over 50 percent of all violent crime in
our state and a way to address it is by
getting aggressive doing it in an
appropriate manner having sentences
reflect the severity of the crimes
but this also does so while preserving
flexibility for judges within the
courtroom
and maintaining the Board of Pardons and
paroles Independence to consider whether
parole should be eligible in certain
cases I'd encourage your support of
Senate Bill 44 and Mr Speaker I yield
the well
the gentleman has yielded the well we
have another speaker
chairman Knight is recognized and speak
to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I don't come often to the well
but when things affect our communities
like gang violence
and you know it is it's affecting
Georgia
every day we get up
and we watch the news and we watch
another shooting another drive-by
e and we hear people killed
we hear of even our fellow
Representatives get up and they they
come to the well and we've recognized
the death
of innocent people
because of drug I mean gain violence
well it is home
it hits home even in Griffin
and I heard the initial speaker who got
up here and and gave eloquent
um
testimony of why we shouldn't vote for
this bill and it was about protecting
the most vulnerable our children
well let me tell you what happened in
Griffin a couple years ago and it just
wrapped up in a trial
back in July of 2020
some gang members
planned an armed robbery to be able to
join
a local game
and they drove up to the apartments
and the victim opened the door
they attacked the victim
and they shot him in the back of the
head
and they robbed him
but his fiancee and his two small
children
were also in an apartment
and again this was a recruitment and
this was a gang initiation
RDA
who prosecuted this and thank God that
she's standing up for the innocent
families and for these children who now
don't have a father
she said I'm going into schools
and she's seeing the first-hand impacts
of gangs and what they're having on the
young people
across the state it's not only the
there's two children who lost a father
but it's the very innocent people that
you want to protect
and she said
that she's seeing children 10 11 and 12
years old being recruited
in the gangs
and she said that the cooler case was a
clear example of the type of recruitment
explaining that the one or the other
defendants who got convicted was
recruited at the age of 12 years old
and that the shooter
was 19. during this reported initiation
and it was overseen by an older 26 year
old leader
if we want to protect the most
vulnerable
let's first of all think about the folks
who are either getting killed or they're
losing loved ones children parents
but if you really want to look at the
most vulnerable let's look at those
children who are being
put into gangs and let's get rid of the
people who are out there recruiting them
I urge you to support this let's think
about the so think about the two
children that don't have a dad anymore
because they were recruitment into games
and the gang violence that is plaguing
the state thank you Mr Speaker
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair has
known that previous question is ordered
there is a Minority Report
on Senate bill 44.
whip Park
you ready
is recognized as the first Speaker I
think and he will allocate time and he
said as he sees fit for up to 20 minutes
we'll park
thank you Mr Speaker
I rise in opposition to Senate bill 44.
I appreciate the intent of this bill
all of us all of us want to protect
children
all of us want safer communities
we all want to take actions to prevent
gang violence
however just like the bill we debated
the prior legislative day where the
intent was to protect the children even
though the actual effect would be to
harm children which is why the Georgia
chapter of the American Foundation For
Suicide Prevention testified in
opposition to that bill
I agree with my learned colleague
representative Tanya Miller that this
bill will do more harm than good
sb44 would not make us safer rather it
takes us backwards because it is not
based on the facts and it fails to
implement evidence-based strategies
actually proven to prevent violent
crimes
rather than protecting children and
building safer communities for all
Georgians that requires long-term
investment in people
this bill will directly harm children
under this bill youth pressure to commit
gang crimes will be incarcerated for a
mandatory five to twenty years for line
61-66.
youth who recruit other youth will be
incarcerated for up to 25 years
incarcerated for up to 25 years for line
67 to 85.
according to the U.S department of
justice Office of Juvenile Justice and
delinquency prevention Children and
Youth often report joining a gang for
protection and they are most likely to
be recruited by their friends once a
youth is in a gang however they face a
higher risk of becoming a victim of
violence those threats of violence
increase the likelihood a youth will
commit a crime
during periods of active gang membership
again we're talking about minors here
we're talking about children
the average age at which a child joins a
gang is 15 years old
current Georgia law ensures that youth
are subject
to sb44's punitive sentencing scheme
so not only will children be harmed by
sb44 this bill will not protect children
from Criminal gang activity which
requires a comprehensive multifaceted
collaborative approach that involves
prevention intervention and suppression
strategies
colleagues what matters more than your
intent for a piece of legislation is its
effect
the impact it will have on the problem
we are trying to address
y'all we live in the information age not
the Stone Age
we have the capability of researching
studying and understanding what policies
work best to address the shared problems
we face
even though we have that intellectual
capacity it remains a matter of choice
and character as to whether or not we as
legislators demonstrate the wisdom and
humility necessary to find and Implement
those policies that serve the best
interest interests of Georgians rather
than doubling down on failed policies
that are politically expedient
colleagues mandatory minimum sentences
are failed policies they are failed
policies and that is not my opinion and
this is also why so many of my
Democratic colleagues are so strongly
opposed to mandatory minimums in this
bill and in other pieces of legislation
as it was heard just a few moments ago
we are not we are all entitled to our
opinion but not
the facts
I urge y'all
to look at lines
75 to 77 80 to 82 and 83 to 84.
it makes clear that there are multiple
mandatory minimum sentences in this
piece of legislation that shall not be
reduced suspended or otherwise departed
as my colleague representative Tanya
Miller accurately described this bill
there is limited limited discretion in
which a judge would have to clearly
demonstrate five to seven conditions
that can then be appealed
by the state court
this bill is
possibly going to lock up children in
this state for up to 25 years that's
what you're voting on
mandatory minimum sentences are again
failed policies they fail to deter crime
they disproportionately harm people of
color and they fail to promote Public
Safety
Governor Nathan Deal understood this
under his leadership Georgia became a
leader in Criminal Justice Reform and so
it is unfortunate to see his hard work
and his legacy undermined by pieces of
legislation like this and so many others
that seem more focused on sending a
political message rather than doing the
hard work to keep all of us safe
now again it's not a mere opinion
that mandatory minimums are failed
policy one of the best studies on the
ineffectiveness of mandatory minimums is
a report by the United States sentencing
commission
the report found that mandatory minimum
sentences did not have a significant
deterrent effect on crime and did not
reduce recidivism rates
the report also found that mandatory
minimums resulted in disproportionate
sentences for people of color and
low-level offenders that's a report from
almost a decade ago
another study published in the Journal
of criminal law and criminology in 2016
analyzed the impact of mandatory
minimums on drug offenses in the United
States again
no significant effect
let's continue again these are all
publicly available studies a national
research Council found that mandatory
minimums had no clear impact on reducing
crime or improving Public Safety that
report again almost from a decade ago
recommended that lawmakers consider
alternatives to mandatory minimums such
as evidence-based sentencing practices
that take into account the individual
circumstances of each case
now there have been several studies
specifically conducted on the impact of
mandatory minimums on gang violence and
participation
one study by the University of
California Los Angeles found that
mandatory minimums did not reduce gang
participation or violent crime
the study looked at the impact of
mandatory minimums on gang-related
crimes in California and found that
there was no significant difference in
the number of gang-related crimes before
and after the implementation
of mandatory minimums
are clear my colleagues
mandatory minimums are ineffective
this bill will lock up more kids
mandatory minimums are not not an
effective way to reduce gang violence or
participation
as my colleague again further noted
there are clear unintended consequences
associated with mandatory minimums
multiple studies again done on policies
enacted throughout multiple States over
the past few decades
these unintended consequences range from
increased violence to prison
overcrowding that will only continue to
support
the private prison industrial complex to
the detriment of Georgia taxpayer
dollars
we have to take steps to address these
problems at its root
rather than putting a bandage trying to
merely address the symptoms
Georgians deserve more than tough on
crime messaging and mere intentions
we need real evidence-based policy
solutions to reduce gang participation
and violent crime
sb44 is not it
sb44 will do more harm than good
accordingly I urge my colleagues to vote
no to sb44 thank you Mr Speaker I yield
the well
gentlemen has yielded the well the chair
recognizes representative Willis to
speak to the bill
thank you madam speaker
greetings honorable colleagues
arise today in opposition to Senate bill
44.
there's intent
and there's impact
let us not pretend that we do not see
the connectivity in all things
it is blatantly obvious that access
begets progress and sustainable success
gang violence is a fruit issue
a lack of opportunity
inequality and systemic prison pipelines
are in fact the root
gang violence is the fruit of resource
deserts
poverty
and although I absolutely appreciate
proposals that fully fund QBE
more concretely gang violence is a
result of underfunding public education
by 10.2 billion dollars since 2003.
putting Georgia 38th in the nation in
per student funding
as we tout being the number one place to
do business
as written these enhancements in sb44 do
not prevent crime
one in five Georgia children are living
below the federal poverty level
with half of those living in extreme
poverty
for years my colleagues and I have
proposed a state-earned income tax
credit to help lift Children and
Families out of poverty
what evidence-based anti-poverty
measures has this body enacted
with the billions in Surplus thanks in
part to austerity Cuts before the
pandemic and federal stimulus dollars we
can and we must do more to be good
fiscal stewards of taxpayer dollars to
in fact build safer communities
addressing gang violence at its root
requires comprehensive and sustained
approaches that involve multiple
stakeholders and effective strategies
Solutions
investing in education
strengthening community-based programs
providing Mental Health Services
supporting Law Enforcement Training
efforts addressing poverty and
inequality and providing job training
and employment opportunities
we must attack the root
to impact the fruit
these strategies are interconnected and
cannot be implemented in isolation
we must work together to address these
causes of gang violence and build safer
and healthier communities for each of us
and all of our districts
imposing more mandatory minimum
sentences is not the answer
Georgians deserve more than rhetoric
they deserve more than pageantry
we need real
evidence-based policy solutions that are
proven
to reduce crime
children make mistakes
the issue is that many people don't view
these children as children at all
SB 44
causes irreversible harm to a generation
accordingly I urge my colleagues each of
you to contemplate that fact and vote no
to SB 44. thank you madam speaker are
you at the well
the lady has yielded the well
representative Roberts is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I'm going to start with a quote
Americans from across the political
Spectrum can unite around prison reform
legislation that will reduce crime while
giving our fellow citizens a chance at
Redemption any idea who said that
let me tell you it was former president
Donald Trump when he signed the first
step to act into law this quote was
featured in an article published by the
Nolan Center for Justice Just last month
the Nolan Center was established by the
American conservative Union Foundation
to provide leadership for the growing
conservative consensus that our criminal
justice system is badly broken and that
there are proven conservative reforms
that will keep the public safe while
restraining costs and for those who
don't know what the acuf is it's one of
the nation's oldest organizations
representing Grassroots conservatives
throughout the United States found in
more than five decades ago and it works
to advance conservatives core values of
Liberty personal responsibility and
fiscal responsibility all of which are
impacted by Criminal Justice Reform I
don't think any of us here disagree that
incarceration is often required for
accountability General deterrence or
keeping dangerous people off the street
but the Nolan Center clearly points out
that incarceration for incarceration's
sake makes no sense it burdens taxpayers
harms families Hollows out our
communities and impacts the economy
so
this article also went on to mention our
very own Governor deal in a list of
conservative leaders who supported a
smaller and more effective Criminal
Justice System their successes show that
we can lower crime and incarceration
rates at the same time if done properly
so just five months ago in October 2022
leading National pollsters venison
strategy group and public opinion
strategies conducted a poll to
understand voters views on Criminal
Justice Reform and how they feel about
candidates that support policies that
will safely reduce the number of people
incarcerated in jails and prisons
consistent with past polling new public
opinion research shows that Republican
voters continue to support Criminal
Justice Reform and are more likely to
vote for candidates that do as well
so for efficiency I'm only going to read
they broke it down between total GOP
voters and very conservative gops
62 percent of very conservative voter
support Justice Criminal Justice Reform
sixty percent of very conservative
voters believe it is important to reduce
the jail and prison population
as far as impactful policy changes to
safely reduce the jail and prison
population 78 percent of very
conservative voters support allowing
people
in prison to earn additional time off
their sentences for following prison
rules and participating Rehabilitation
programs
okay
um the biggest one is 62 percent support
eliminating mandatory minimums and other
sentencing laws that require a long
princess rather than allowing judges to
determine the appropriate punishment
based on the facts of this case so
the this last election in 2022
this week on crime Theory worked but it
didn't actually work for your base so
I'm trying to understand we're about to
increase our budget from 2022 to 2023
the Georgia Department of Corrections
increased the budget
154 million and from amended FY 23 to
the proposed 2024 there's an additional
81 million in proposed budget taxpayers
are going to bear this cost of rising
prison populations dozens of Decades of
research show these policies will not
make us safer think about what we could
do with those hundreds of millions of
dollars to actually put it in the
communities and help these kids rather
than sweeping them up in unnecessary
legislation that will not work so listen
to your own voters and vote your
conscience
representative Kennard is recognized to
speak to the bill
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
opposition to sb-44 this isn't a matter
of uh smart on crime or soft on crime or
hard-on crime not soft don't cry my
heart on crime but being smart on crime
and I mean that in the most literal way
I checked our most recent Department of
Corrections uh statistics and the
majority of folks locked up in our state
prisons dropped out of school their
school dropouts another 38 percent went
to 12th grade or have a GED
nine percent or less have some college
and a microscopic 1.8 percent of those
who have a four-year degree represent
our prison population
less than two percent of our prison
population is a four-year degree uh
holders
so what I'm trying to communicate is
that the greatest tool in our Public
Safety toolbox is higher education we
get our more Georgians through college
with a four-year degree we almost
eliminate them from the possibility of
being incarcerated
uh also we understand the connection
between literacy rates and potential
incarceration we know that kids not
reading on a third grade level are
highly more likely to have an
interaction with uh Corrections did you
know that we spend fifty four hundred
dollars to put a Pre-K student through a
year of state-funded pre-K do you know
how much we spend to incarcerate an
individual per year that number is 27
000.
the average Senate served is five years
you do the math 27 times five that's 135
000 we're spending on the average person
to incarcerate them we can take one year
of that twenty seven thousand dollars
and put someone through a four-year
degree in one of our college and
university systems so what I'm saying to
you is that a smarter Georgia is a safer
Georgia and for that reason I'm opposing
this bill we should be thinking about
how we can get more folks in our Pre-K
right now 60 of our four-year-olds are
in pre-k let's move that up to uh 100 I
got a fiscal note on that it would cost
about 250 million dollars and that would
to put every four-year-old in our Pre-K
system that would uh be the cost of
tuition teachers and the capital outlay
to build more to build more classrooms
and Early Child Learning Centers so
let's reinvest let's rethink what we're
doing a smarter Georgia is a safer
Georgia thank you
the gentleman has yielded the well
that concludes our Minority Report we'll
move on now to the chairs time up to 20
minutes
chair of the committee chairman Tyler
Paul Smith is recognized to speak to the
bill
thank you Mr Speaker I yield part of the
Chairman's time to Chairman Rob Liberty
representative Rob liver has recognized
to speak to the bill
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
Speaker
uh my father practiced law with judge
Robert M Hurd for many many years a
former member of this body
and he used to tell me Robert whenever
you're given a legal opinion
it's usually a good idea to look at the
law once in a while
I would say the same is true when we
consider legislation a lot of a lot of
opinions have been expressed and I
respect the opinions of the folks who
have spoken from this well
um I I I I truly do
um
I would just suggest when we look at the
at the bill it doesn't seem to me to
have quite the wide ranging effect that
has been described
the bill makes limited amendments to the
to the gang statute
specifically it increases the penalties
for recruiting a young person or a
person with a disability
and it does admittedly do that it it it
makes them a good bit stiffer and it
does limit the discretion of the judge
in some cases to depart from that of
course it doesn't do anything to the
Board of Pardons and parole's ability to
parole or probate some of that sentence
that cannot be done uh constitutionally
it also does provide avenues for a judge
to depart from these these penalties in
some circumstances
um but I I want to address an issue that
has been raised today about the notion
that we can do more I I agree
criminal gangs have become a scourge of
our society they have multiplied lately
they're not just in urban areas they're
everywhere they're in my district a
rural District I share a part of
Representative Flemings County and we've
heard from law enforcement down there
how pervasive they are and how
aggressive they are in committing crimes
and recruiting young people
as it has been said that's that's sort
of their life's blood
and so this this statute tries to
address that through an enhanced penalty
and if you don't believe enhancing
penalties has any effect then then I
probably have lost you but I do believe
that is part of a sound strategy for
addressing this issue I agree we can do
other things and we should nothing in
this bill prohibits us from taking other
action I I agree we need a more holistic
approach and this doesn't preclude that
but I do believe part of the approach is
stiffening penalties for people who
recruit children into gangs we need to
get tougher with them we we're tough
already but we need to get tougher there
needs to be a a proportional response to
their action and and as representative
Fleming said it
the evidence to me is that when you take
that stance when you get tough with them
consistently when you go after them you
begin to beat them back and this this
statute will give prosecutors a tool to
do that
now
a bit has been said also about
the impact this will have on children
who are recruited in The Gangs because
it has been said and I believe it to be
true that sometimes the recruiters are
the children who just got recruited
they're recruited for the purpose of
recruiting
and I think that does happen I wouldn't
question that
but keep in mind nothing in this statute
changes the rules on transfer of cases
from juvenile court to Superior Court
people under 17 are still likely to be
tried in juvenile court there is a
process where cases can be transferred
one way the other there's also a process
where DA's can transfer cases down to
juvenile court if they think that's
appropriate but nothing changes what I
view to be the strong policy and
presumption in our law that favors
trying those under 17 in juvenile court
not in Superior Court and if they're in
juvenile court
oh the minimums and the mandatory
sentences in here are not going to apply
anyway they're going to be sentence
pursuant to the statutory framework for
sentencing juveniles
so I would keep that in mind when you
review
this this bill I I don't believe it's
going to have quite the severe of the
effect that has been characterized
again it just changes the penalty for
recruitment it generally leaves
untouched the 5 to 20 penalty that
currently exists for most violations of
the gang statute
it also does allow for the departures
and that's to be done on an in-camera
hearing to protect the person who's
getting the departure from any any kind
of Revelation to the members of the gang
and of course it does address bonding
too but I believe all of this is a
consistent cohesive package that is part
of a measured approach to attacking the
evil of gangs in our society I urge you
to vote for this bill I don't believe
it's going to have a lot of the
ill-intended effects that have been
described and I believe it's a
consistent and smart part of any
comprehensive approach to combating gang
activity it simply does not prohibit all
of the other approaches which I agree we
need to to employ but I think this is a
a vital part of that strategy and I
encourage you to vote this so
prosecutors can have this tool to combat
this great evil
thank you Mr Speaker
the gentlemen has yielded the well
there is a little time left on the
Chairman's time
chairman Smith has recognized
to speak to us further on the bill
chairman Smith
thank you Mr Speaker
today I rise in favor of Senate bill 44.
you know I was reminded Mr Speaker and I
could hear it just going over in my head
the Waylon Jennings song Don't You Think
This Outlaw business has done got out of
hand
and uh just for y'all's information we
referenced Waylon Jennings in our
Committee hearing
you may think I'm crazy but Waylon
Jennings
had Hells Angels that would fall around
him as he did a tour as his personal
bodyguards
now
just so you know being a member of a
gang
under current law and under this law
is not a crime
it takes a Nexus
between breaking another statute and
furthering the purposes of a gang
activity
I've heard a lot of Criminal Justice
measures that have been brought before
both of these bodies at this point
and you know I'm always
mindful
of Genesis chapter 3 the fall
the fall of humans and the banishment
from the Garden of Eden
I see it all the time but not just
Genesis 3 with the fall of humankind I
see Genesis 9.
the noahic Covenant
and we talk about the morality
and how we can
how we can or we cannot legislate
morality
what do you think we got our murder
statues
now
in particular you look at this
legislation
this legislation
deals with those that are recruiting
those that are 17 years of age or
younger we've all got laws on the books
to deal with juveniles who have decided
they want to cross that threshold of
adulthood and start acting like an adult
we already have those statutes on the
books but what we're talking about
is the corruption of our youth
now look I agree with you there's a lot
of folks in jail right now
on certain offenses
that I think should have been released
or bonded out by now there's some
offenses
that they're just being held there
because maybe the prosecutor's got a
personal Vendetta against that person I
deal with it all the time
I'm probably one of the only members
here
that has ever defended gang members
there's few
represent pan it shows I know there's
several others of you here
and I can tell you
they have always always been just so
nice to their counsel
but you read about what they do and in
counseling these people it's tough let
me tell you you're dealing with human
beings
a lot of times remorseful
again I'm dealing with Genesis chapter 3
here in the fall
I'm dealing with fallen and broken
humankind
as we all are right here today
and you look at this and so many times
they say Only God can judge me
I was like well yes he is the final
judge when this all winds up for us
but let me tell you read over in Peter
and you talk about having abide by a
man's law
what this bill in particular will do
is take those that are recruiting our
youth 17 years of age or younger
you are going to have them off of the
streets for 10 or 15 years
like I said a while ago I agree with you
that's folks sitting in jail right now
that need to be bonded out they
shouldn't be there
I'll be the first to lead the charge on
getting those folks out so we can put
the worst of society these gang members
that are recruiting our youth into those
spots I'm all for it
we as a society
have to legislate
what is right and what is wrong we have
to determine what is right and what is
wrong
this bill right here
more than any other that has come to my
committee is one of personal
responsibility
I've seen a lot of stuff that just
make an offense lawyer and want to go
just pull his hair out
but you know I was reminded of this
quote from the judge starring Robert
Duvall and Robert Downey Jr
and this phrase has stood out in my mind
for a long long time now
in my practice
and then having to discuss things with
clients so you'll see that there's a
bail provision in this bill nobody
talked about it hardly
and you know I looked at it
and I cannot tell you how many
conversations I've had with clients
telling them
this is not a dentist appointment
this is not going to the doctor you can
just reschedule it
which
doc Newton I always make sure I go to my
doctor's appointments because I respect
the time
it's like no this is the institution to
where you don't show up you get bench
warrant you get to go spend some time in
the county hotel but this quote I want
to leave with you here today
it goes as far as you're standing in one
of the last great cathedrals in this
country built on the premise that you
and you alone
are responsible for the consequences
of your actions
there has to be personal responsibility
this bill brings that personal
responsibility back Mr Speaker
with that I'm going to yield the well
and ask this body's favorable
consideration
the gentleman has yielded the well
that completes
all the time we had allocated
is there any objection to adopting the
committee's substitute the chair here
has none The committee's Substitute is
adopted is there any objection to
agreeing to the report of the committee
which was favorable to the passage of
the bill the Jerry has done if the port
of the committee is agreed to shall this
bill now pass all in favor of the
passage of the bill we'll vote Yes all
those opposed will vote no and the clerk
will unlock the machine
for what purpose does leader Beverly
rise moved Lee uh Senate Bill 44 on the
table
the gentleman's moved to
live
Mr leader I'm
understanding that per the rules of this
house after the vote is open that is not
a prop appropriate motion
for what purposes representative Roberts
rise parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
thank you Mr Speaker uh isn't it true
that if
what representative Miller told us that
Georgia has one of the most robust gang
laws in the country and
if representative Fleming who I know
told the truth said that gangs are
fleeing to South Carolina isn't it true
that that means the existing laws on the
books are working and this is overkill
thank you
I'm sure the lady believes in what she
states
for what purposes represented Miller
rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
Mr Speaker isn't it true that under SB
44 a mandatory minimum sentence imposed
pursuant to the paragraph relating to
the recruitment of minors quote shall
not be reduced suspended or otherwise
departed from pursuant to paragraph four
or five of this subsection those are
lines 83 through 85 and paragraph five
references the Court's discretion so to
be clear Mr Speaker is it not true that
a judge cannot depart when the
accusation is that an individual has
recruited a minor
if the gentlelady so States
for what purposes represented
represented Petrie rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker stay
tuned Mr Speaker it's not true that just
less than a year ago the Fulton County
D.A stated that gangs were responsible
for nearly 75 to 80 percent of violent
crimes in Atlanta
I'm sure the gentleman believes what he
so States
what purpose does representative Chas
can unrise
he waves
for what purposes represent Lisa
Campbell rise
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
isn't it true Mr Speaker that the
Brookings Institute recently researched
and found that in states that have
implemented Medicaid expansion they have
seen reduce reductions in violent crime
by 5.8 percent in property crime by 3
percent and resulted in cost Savings of
13.6 billion due to these reductions in
crimes and based on this evidence and
these strategies shouldn't we be
investing in expanding access to health
care if we are sincerely interested in
reducing gang Recruitment and violence
if the general lady Associates I'm sure
she believes
for what purpose does repsody Okoye rise
parliamentary aquarium Mr Speaker State
you're inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true
that during the debate on SB 140 the
transgender Bill we were told that
children up to 18 years and even above
are not fully formed to make decisions
and yes by themselves but today we are
also seeking to punish those children or
what could be an
uninformed decision
and there's some level of hypocrisy in
that Mr Speaker
if the gentleman so States what purpose
is represent the Aden Sanya arise
thank you Mr Speaker our parliamentary
inquiry State your inquiry isn't it true
that Common Sense gun reform is the true
measure to keeping our community safe
rather than extending mandatory minimum
centers
I'm sure the gentleman believes what he
says States for the inquiry one more
inquiry is it not true that extending
mandatory minimum freezing time doesn't
really send tough messages to
communities but instead it seems more
blackmail and other minorities to fill
up on private on private prison beds
I'm sure the gentleman believes what he
says States
for what purposes representing David
Clark rise
Paul Mary inquiry State your inquiry is
it not true that in 2020 I was off
serving my country in uniform away from
my family and in the in the middle of
the night there's a drive-by shooting my
wife kids were asleep
um and uh they were safe but would this
bill not help actually crack down gang
violence and protect our communities
we appreciate the gentleman's service to
this country and I'm sure he believes
what he says States
on what happened in his neighborhood
for what purposes representing Bentley
rise
parliamentary inquired Mr Speaker State
your inquiry Mr Speaker is it not true
that I do appreciate all of the comments
that were made by all of the colleagues
in this chamber this afternoon but I've
also been throughout the debate reaching
out to constituents in my district and
the vast majority of them have asked for
my support of this legislation even a
funeral director who's preparing to bury
of a small child that was killed by a
stray bullet is that not true Mr Speaker
I'm sure if the gentlelady state says so
as true and she certainly believes in
what she speaks
we'll take a couple more
for what purposes represent the
appendage rise
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
isn't it not true that as representative
Tyler Paul Smith said I'm a criminal
defense attorney and that many of us
charge more depending on the length of
sentence that could be imposed if
conviction if there's a conviction
I'm not sure how y'all charge
my brother's choir it's usually a lot
but yes
may I further inquire
State your inquiry and is it not further
true that even though I would have a
financial incentive to vote Yes on this
bill because I could charge more for
more minimum mandatory crimes that I'm
choosing to vote against this bill
because of the damage that minimum
mandatory sentences do to this country
if the general ladies so States I'm sure
she believes I'm going to take two more
foreign
I think you have a um inquiry for what
purpose do you rise thank you Mr Speaker
parliamentary inquiry State your inquiry
is it not true that the name of this
bill street gang terrorism and
prevention act sounds like a great idea
and something that our communities need
because unfortunately many of them have
been negatively impacted by this
violence however as we heard today the
conversation is not that gang violence
is not a bad thing or not a problem it
is that the solution we are pursuing is
going to harm a lot of people
I'm sure the lady believes in what she
says States for what purpose is Chairman
Knight Rise parliamentary inquiry State
inquiry Mr Speaker isn't it true in
addition to the story Untold in the well
that just a little over a week ago in
Griffin Georgia
11 year old little girl was killed
and drive-by shootings
and the the suspect who they are now
chasing
is also wanted in violation of the
Georgia Street gain act isn't it true
also Mr Speaker that Georgians are fed
up with gang violence
I'm sure the gentleman believes what he
speaks
I am going to take two more and this is
going to be it
I want to recognize the lady from the
165th representative Jackson
for
you thank you rise representative
parliamentary inquiry State inquiry
to my colleagues here isn't it true that
I spoke in Noel the other day regarding
my nephew that was shot in Savannah in
the head
but as I look at this this bill today is
it not true that we as members of this
house should listen to what is being
said as it not true as I look at this
there is no Democratic side that is
quotes put on here as voting for this
bill is it not true that this should be
sent back
to the house or to the Senate to ask for
some changes as they better affect what
is happening in our community
we had a reduction in Savannah in gang
related by getting working together
shouldn't this if we are going to vote
on this today shouldn't we have
some things up there that said that this
was a decision that was made by both the
Democratic and the Republicans in this
house and that we do not have to follow
what is happening on the other side of
the hall thank you
if the gentlelady so States
have all members voted
have all members voted if so the clerk
will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
99 the Nays 74 the bill having received
the requisite constitutional majority is
therefore passed
Mr clerk will you read the caption to
Senate bill 61.
we're moving on to supplemental calendar
that was set this morning Mr clerk
Senate bills 61 Senate Bill 61 with
Senator Strickland to the 17th to be a
talent act to amend code section 34 110
for the official quoted George annotated
relaying the use of sick leave for care
of immediate the family members so as to
repeal the sunset provision relating to
such sick leave requirements this bill
ever referred to the committee on
industry and labor that committee
recommends that this bill do pass
representative Daniel is recognized to
present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker
I'm so excited to bring something I hope
we can all agree on after our couple of
hours of debating that important
legislation today I Rise to bring Senate
Bill 61 which was carried by my
counterpart on the other side
um Senator Strickland this bill is a
wonderful piece of legislation that will
end at the sunset clause and the Family
Care Act which was passed with
bipartisan support and the legislature
back in 2017.
um the bill before you doesn't tell you
what that is so I did come prepared to
tell you what the Family Care Act does
it simply allows employees who already
earn paid sick days to use up to five of
those days per year to care for a sick
loved one it does not require employees
to offer any additional paid sick days
beyond what they already provide their
employers
uh let's see
this law has been in effect for the last
six years and it has shown that it is
something that's good for employers and
families in our state and so we believe
at this time it would be a good move to
remove that sunset provision and
um
seed
when it was originally introduced it had
a three-year provision so this would be
the second time that we would be
extending it and so they have actually
chosen to just remove it all together
and I think this is a good move for us
as we continue the efforts to make
Georgia the best place to live work and
raise our families so I asked for your
favorable support and will yield the
well if there are no questions
you have no questions
the lady has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered chair here's none
the previous question is ordered is
there an objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair here's none the report the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill we'll vote Yes all those
opposed will vote no and the clerk will
unlock the machine
[Music]
for what purposes represent these Samson
rise
he weighs
have all members voted
if so
the clerk will lock the machine on the
passage of the bill the yeas were
172 the Nays were one the bill having
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed Mr clerk
will you read the caption to Senate bill
990.
the Senate Bill Noni by Senator Dixon
the 45th and others to be entitled back
to amend chapter one of title 10 of the
official go to George annotated relating
selling and other practices so as to
provide for commercial financing
disclosures this beloved referred to the
committee on Banks and banking that
committee recommends that this bill do
pass
by committee substitute
the gentleman from the 118th is
recognized representative Crowe to
present the bill
[Music]
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues this is
Senate Bill 90 as I stated it is a
revenue-based uh
financing provision that uh allows for a
current form of finance and that many
smaller medium-sized businesses use when
Traditional Bank Loan is not the best
option this may sound familiar to you uh
representative Rhodes earlier in this
session had House Bill 84 which
essentially did the same thing that
passed out of this house and was sent
over to the Senate this is a senate
version uh companion bill that they had
coming back
uh in addition to that portion though we
have a portion added to it in the
substitute that was a bill that I had
House Bill 471
and House Bill 471 dealt with some
predatory real estate practices
um
Midway through 2020 Georgia began seeing
a new real estate predatory practice
typically a scenario would go something
like this homeowners offered cash as
part of a homeowner program in reality
the homeowners coerced in an area
40-year listing agreement uh for their
home the listing agreement Then followed
the clerk's office and a covenant
running with the land for those 40 years
so when them or particularly their heirs
would inherit it trying to sell the
property there'd be a cloud on the title
and they wouldn't be able to sell the
property unless they paid that company
uh percentage typically three percent of
whatever they decided the value of that
property was in order to sell the
property so it's
it's currently estimated that there are
as many as 7 000 of those currently
recorded in the state of Georgia what
this portion of the legislation seeks to
do is to cut off the at creating
more of those it would establish it as a
as an action listed uh in the fair
business Practices Act of 1975 it would
stop them from being able to record
those or be used as a cloud against the
title and then sections one or uh sorry
sections three
uh four and six would deal with
um wholesalers these are the folks that
send out a notice saying they want to
buy your home and actually they want to
get a listing or a
option to buy your home and then go out
and Market that and what they're trying
to do is avoid real estate license your
laws and prohibitions against net
listings so they want to get it under
contract so they can Market it and then
sell it for an increased amount and keep
the difference between those so
that's what these this bill is seeking
to do on both those accounts Mr Speaker
and I will answer any questions if folks
have those
gentlemen yields for a question I do
representative Jasmine Clark to your
left has a question representative Clark
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield yes all right so we did discuss
this but I wanted to know if you got an
answer to the question line 103 the bill
states that a commercial financing
transaction that's more than half a
million dollars
does not this this bill would not apply
to them do you ever find out why
yes ma'am um and and much like the other
question you had which is why it was uh
more than five transactions that's the
cutoff that they decided to put in here
most of these transactions are going to
be between fifty and a hundred thousand
dollars very rarely are they even going
to go over two hundred thousand dollars
so uh it's very unlikely that there
would be any that would go over 500
because it is a risky proposition to to
lend that amount of money so that was
the the cut off when they tried to
narrow down this portion of the law does
the gentleman throw the yield yes ma'am
and then further down on lines 118
through 120 it talks about they're only
needing to be one disclosure even if you
were to change or basically modify or go
through a forbearance or change the
financing commercial financing
transaction are there any concerns about
um the people who are being financed you
know if there was a change there's no
requirement that they have to do a new
disclosure for that right and it does
say that it's uh a disclosure is not
required as a result of modification
prevails or change to a consummated
commercial transaction so that would be
one that had already been consummated so
I guess I didn't see a need to need to
redisclose that it's already been
consummated
thank you thank you gentlemen further
yield yes sir representative Roberts to
your left in front of you thank you Mr
Speaker does the gentleman yield I do uh
isn't it true that the latter part of
the bill uh that I was a co-sponsor and
that this
um predatory practice among these
companies uh being a licensed realtor
myself and a real estate lawyer it is
praying on our most vulnerable our
elderly Community they are looking
they're in Desperate situations they
take 700 cash and don't realize that
they are locked into a covenant running
with their land for 40 years that's
exactly right and typically from what
the the
investigations have shown into some of
these is that these folks are typically
targeting uh elderly and lower income
homeowners the folks that would be more
desperate to to seek out something like
this
no further questions thank you Mr
Speaker
will representative Becky Evans is
recognized to speak to the bill
Mr Speaker colleagues today I Rise to
support Senate Bill 90 but also to
express concern that it not it does not
go far enough to protect these Legacy
homeowners from deceptive business
practices
which I know is important to all of us
we need to pass legislation that
provides for disclosure requirements
for wholesale buyers and sellers of real
residential real property we need to do
more to Define and regulate wholesale
sellers
lines 178 to 208 are fine in terms of
some kind of transparency but they don't
really do anything to combat deceptive
real estate wholesalers they're only
required to disclose that they're
soliciting but not the fact that they're
simply an intermediary between the
seller and buyer not the actual buyer
disclosing their actual intent
is the most important piece in my
opinion
also I didn't see that a deceived seller
has any recourse to terminate the
contract on their home
currently wholesalers are permitted to
oversee real estate transactions with no
licensing training or education
requirements
it's the Wild Wild West and they're
playing with people's homes
it's no accident that if you run a
Google search for Real Estate
wholesaling Georgia
two of the first results that come up
are questions about whether or not it's
legal
there's an article that I want to tell
you all about that illuminates what uh
what representative Crowe and
representative Roberts have talked about
where the wholesalers are taking
advantage of elderly home sailors
it says the booming Atlanta real estate
market may make some elderly homeowners
a Target
homeowners are selling their houses for
tens and even hundreds of thousands
dollars less than they are worth
one elderly woman
contacted Channel 2 after she sold her
Southwest Atlanta home for more than a
hundred and forty thousand dollars less
than the Real Estate Zillow estimated it
was worth
the woman did not want to be interviewed
and her name is not being used
the investigative reporter spoke with
the real estate broker who found the
elderly woman on the side of the road
with her belongings while the
wholesalers who bought her home cleared
it out
the wholesaler listen to this the
wholesaler would come to her house every
single day and beg her to sell
she would say no then they started
bringing her dinner then they started
asking her if she needed her medication
picked up from the pharmacy they
befriended her
another person got a call about a woman
who had just sold her home and needed
help buying a condo
she didn't have enough money for a condo
and she was almost 80 years old
and so it's the West End by the Atlanta
BeltLine it's the hottest juiciest
neighborhood right now in Atlanta
the women's Southwest Atlanta home was
purchased by Green Sky properties on
July 30th of this year for ninety five
thousand dollars
the same day green Sky properties sold
the home to Nigeria where for field for
a hundred and thirty thousand dollars
Zillow estimated the home was worth more
than two hundred and forty thousand
dollars
Atlanta Legal Aid attorney Sarah Stein
told gray that wholesalers typically
shop for houses that aren't for sale
Stein said the wholesalers buying homes
for Less the market value and reselling
them to investors the same day as a
calculated technique
they are literally doing nothing to the
property and selling it the same day to
somebody else for significantly more
the wholesale group that was involved in
the purchase of the elderly woman's home
holds a weekly training sessions called
wholesale live in Southwest Atlanta
the producer paid 35 dollars to attend
this session where the wholesale Live
Crew had our cold call owners off Market
homes around the metro area
their technique is not to take no for an
answer and to try to get homeowners to
sign a contract on the same day
the wholesalers provide a script for
cold callers
if an attendees lead resulted in a
signed contract they would get a cut
from the state
it's like a boiler room atmosphere
everyone is in here one room making
phone calls
when they went to the wholesale live
session to ask about their elderly
woman's home the organizer said the
woman approached their team about
selling her home
she said my name's not on any documents
Williams is not on any of the home sale
documents that the channel 2 reviewed
but her Instagram follows every step of
the purchase and renovation of the
elderly woman's home
Williams and the fellow wholesale live
instructor appeared in a post a
testimonial video at the closing
attorney's office on the day of the sale
to talk about the Elder ones experience
working with the team
the elderly woman said they're like my
children
in other videos Williams documents the
flipping process including inviting
Instagram followers to a demo party to
educate them on the renovation process
of course guys when you acquire
properties especially directly from the
seller and they've been in their house a
long time it's possible you may run into
some of these type of situations
recorded in the basement of the elderly
woman's home explaining that they would
have to remove 47 years worth of
furniture and other properties
David Blake with Georgia's Department of
Human Services Division of Aging trains
police across the state to investigate
elder abuse cases
Blake told gray deceiving an elder to
buy their home in a bargain could be a
crime
foreign
two has not found evidence that the
wholesalers are committing a crime and
that's what I hope our body might
address but in that an Atlanta police
fraud investigator did contact the new
cessation with questions on the case
the new station passed the investigators
information on to the elderly woman's
attorney
whether it was a crime or not the
situation the elderly woman was put in
is wrong there's absolutely no doubt in
my mind that they took advantage of her
so we need to do more I hope in our next
uh legislative session to to be able to
protect these elderly people from abuse
thank you Mr Speaker I yield the well
the lady has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered
is there any objection to adopting The
committee's Substitute chair hears none
The committee's Substitute is adopted is
there an objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill
chair Hills none the report the
committee is agreed to shall this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill will vote Yes all those opposed
will vote no and the clerk will unlock
the machine
for what purpose is representative
Jasmine Clark rise
parliamentary inquiry Mr Speaker stay
tuned glory is it not true that I
wholeheartedly support the portion of
this bill that is for Consumer
Protection but I still have serious
concerns about the portion of the bill
that was previously HB 84 with the
arbitrary limits and lack of disclosure
requirements and that I and many of my
colleagues voted no on that bill when it
was before the body earlier this year
yet the lady so states have all members
voted if so the clerk will lock the
machine on the passage of the bill the
yeas were 163 the Nays nine the bill
having received the requisite
constitutional majority is therefore
passed members we're going to take up
one more bill but before I do I want to
tell you I made a misstep representing
Michelle Henson who served in this body
for many years was a valued member was
here on the floor a little bit earlier
and I apologize to her so if you see her
be sure you recognize her and thank her
for her service to this body into this
state representative Michelle Hanson a
valued member of this body
[Applause]
Mr clerk will you read the caption to SB
93 Senate bill 93.
Senate Bill 93 by Senator Anna debarte
the 31st and others to be entitled an
act to amend chapter 29 and tunnel 50
the official code of Georgia and said it
related information technology so as to
restrict the use of certain social media
platforms on state equipment this bill I
haven't refer to the Committee on Public
Safety and Homeland Security that
committee recommends this bill do pass
by committee substitute
chair recognizes representative Crow
Clint Crow to present the bill
thank you Mr Speaker seems like forever
since I've been here
um
this is the last bill so I will be brief
on this I know y'all all have other
places to be and other things to do as
do I so
um Senate Bill 93 uh
[Music]
well a little feedback Senate Bill 93 is
a technology bill passed 50 to nothing
in the Senate and what it does is it
prohibits the use of social media on
state-owned devices when the social
media platform is owned or operated by a
foreign adversary or by a company which
is domiciled in has headquarters in or
is organized under the laws of foreign
adversary uh
specifically Tick Tock in this instance
but that is the bill and I would stand
for any questions Mr Speaker
[Music]
General yield I do
representative Jason Ridley from the six
to your extreme right over here has a
question president Ridley I just got one
question how do you know where
something's connected to
so that uh
I think that's my answer thank you sir
yeah
I don't think somebody wants me to
answer that question
um but anyway it would be determined by
the uh the director of the uh
Department of Georgia Homeland Security
Department
and those foreign adversaries are listed
by the federal government and updated
this will be updated on the list for
January 1st 2023.
yep I think the sound system's getting
tired I think that's what's going on it
is I'll Stand way over here
representative Williams is recognized
for a question to your left take me
speaking
thank you for the bill I think it's a
good Bill I'm just I'm a little confused
I explain to me if we're going to knock
Tick Tock out of the business
we got a little boat yard in Savannah
it's loaded down with Chinese materials
and Americans can't get more they can't
break the habit we take tick-tocks out I
help you understand how we keep Logan
Chinese products into America
Wilson I I wish I could help you with
that I can't I can't answer that um and
this is not knocking Tick Tock out of
business on your personal device it's
just on a state uh employees or students
on state-owned devices that it's being
banned from
representative Ramon is recognized for a
question
thank you Mr Speaker does the gentleman
yield I do
um so it appears that there has been
extensive conversation about Tick Tock
but is it not true that a lot of social
media companies currently do track a lot
of our data and do sell it to other
companies so why this particular
interest in only Tick Tock and for the
record I understand that we need to keep
some of these social media applications
off our state devices but I am curious
why this wasn't sort of brought into
other
Tech related I think it's because of the
um
the fact that it's it's owned or
controlled or overseen by a foreign
adversary in this case uh China and so
and again it's not trying to prohibit it
from your personal device this is just
trying to make sure that our state-owned
devices that are used by state employees
and students are secured
and Tick Tock like I said it's this is
specifically targeting those social
media sites that are owned or controlled
by a foreign adversary
as determined by the federal government
gentleman yield for another question
I'll take one more Mr Speaker
representative sains chairman sayings to
your left
to the gentleman yield I do this is not
true that this bill is specific to the
estate devices to ensure that our
citizens data is kept secure and however
the larger conversation on on the
distinction between data security and
the the youth Health in terms of social
media usage is part of a broader
conversation that can be addressed but
is not part of this bill
yes sir that is exactly correct
and with that Mr Speaker I will yield
the will and ask for this body's
favorable consideration
the gentleman has yielded the well
is there any objection to the previous
question being ordered the chair hears
none the previous question is ordered is
there any objection to adopting the
committee substitute the chair hears
none the committee substitute is adopted
is there an objection to agreeing to the
report of the committee which was
favorable to the passage of the bill the
chair here's none the report the
committee is agreed to sell this bill
now pass all in favor of the passage of
the bill will vote Yes all those opposed
will vote no and their clerk will unlock
the machine
for what purpose does chairman wiedau
arise parliamentary inquiry State your
inquiry is it not true that this bill
will not keep representative Crowe from
posting on social media the pending
birth of his second grandchild today
I'm sure the gentleman knows what he
speaks on both congratulations
[Applause]
boy or girl
little boy congratulations
another Crow headed to the nest
so
have all members voted
if so the clerk will lock the machine
on the passage of the bill the yeas were
174 the Nay zero the bill haven't
received the requisite constitutional
majority is therefore passed
