I pray for wisdom and judgment over this body as we go through these matters before
us today, Lord.
I pray for our first responders and our men and women serving here at home and overseas
to pray that you put a hedge of protection around them
and bring them home safely.
And here, in Jesus' name, amen.
Thank you, Chairman Dixon.
Before we get started, I do want to flag for everyone
in February 12th.
If you have not received a notification
of our committee dinner, it is tentatively,
but pretty firmly scheduled for the 12th at Bones.
So please mark your calendars for that.
And we are waiting on Janine Miller to get here to walk us through the freight logistics report and there she is ladies and gentlemen
Perfect timing. Let's welcome to the front of the room with a rousing round of applause if you will miss Janine Miller
Are you out of breath from those stairs because they are you would not be alone if you're out of breath from the stairs
Yes, and the cold
I'm gonna recognize uh oh no
I just want to make sure that the Center for the 23rd heard that the dinner is going to be on February 12th.
Last time I missed the dinner because we had an ethics committee meeting that was a few hours long, so I hope we would work that out.
I just want to make an observation, too, that we have no greater confidence that nobody watches
these meetings than the public invitation to wear and win our dinner, so thank you very
much.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
While we're waiting for her to present, you have a few stickers on, are you part of the
sticker caucus today?
What are you wearing over there?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
to represent causes that are as germane as possible
to the committee's business.
But since you're giving me a chance
to do some shout outs,
there was the Georgia Speech Language Hearing Association
at Tenon State.
I think the rules chairman said something about them
and reproductive freedom for all is the other cause.
So, go team.
Fantastic.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you so much.
Ms. Miller, must we listen to more of his die tribes
or you by chance, ready to?
Thankfully, I have a very boring topic,
great infrastructure.
Thank you for having me at the committee today.
And this is a topic that is important for all of transportation,
the trucks that move along our roadways
and the cargo that's moved by rail and ship.
We're going to focus today on our roads,
trucks on our roadways, and it's not just important
for transportation, but it's important
or economic development, the community impacts for quality
life and ends on and on.
So I wanted to give an update on our recent analysis
and studies that we've done here in the state of Georgia.
And these are just, these are the main ones.
There's freight and truck-related data
that we look at in all of the studies and plans
that we do at G.Dot.
But I'm going to give you kind of an overview
on the highest level, the biggest picture analysis
that we've been doing.
So for the first time ever, we did an evaluation
of the reliance of Georgia's key industries
on our transportation networks based on private sector data.
So we procured about two dozen either acquired,
because as public data are procured,
he has his private data, two dozen sources of information,
information data flows about cargo trucks, you name it, and the type of industries that
are impacted that are using our roadways throughout the state. Never done this before,
and this is the same data that private companies themselves both populate and use for their
operational and strategic investment decisions. So we are working from the same batch of data
that private sector uses.
And this is one of the most interesting outfits.
Usually, when you see a map of George and Broadway,
as you see the map on the right,
and you see it in all one color, you can say black or gray or blue.
But here for the first time, we are able to dissect
which industries use which parts of our network the most.
Food and agriculture and manufacturing
are the most distributed in terms of the state routes
that are used.
But of course agriculture is good in agriculture,
using the southern half of our state more prolifically
than other industries.
And the eastern part and northern part of our state
is what manufacturing industries rely upon.
Distribution and retail is predominantly in Metro Atlanta,
because that is the population center of the state of Georgia.
So as you layer them all together,
you can see that every part of our road network
is used for our key industries.
and these industries represent 60% or more of the cargo
that's moving on Georgia State routes.
By 2050, we took this data, we put it into our model.
So by 2050, the freight moving on our road network
is going to grow significantly,
nearly doubling in weight to 900 million tons
and more than doubling in value to $1.6 trillion
moving on our roads in the next 25 years.
You can see that in the gray on the left,
most of it by truck, of course.
Although rail in Georgia is very, very important.
We have more rail miles than any other state
in the southeast, more freight rail miles.
And we have both class one railroads
at our ocean port in Savannah, which
is a unique advantage for shippers,
both because they can reach more locations in Georgia
communities and throughout the southeast
into and out of the port, but also it enables competition
between the two carriers for those shippers
that are able to use either class one,
CSX or Norfolk Southern.
But in either case, cargo is nearly gonna double in weight.
That translates into congestion costs.
If we do nothing, if we expand our network
in no significant ways, our delay is going to more than double.
than double.
And you can see broken down by the color of the bar there,
in the base there is manufacturing.
Congestion cost to manufacturing shippers,
cargo owners is going to double.
Congestion costs for distribution,
that's the lighter blue, is going to nearly quadruple.
And then congestion costs for food and agriculture
will nearly double.
and other industries also have impacts,
but this is the main part of our congestion costs
and things that we are using as a decision maker
as G.Looks at our project options in front of us
that are in our pipeline right now
and what we need to develop going forward.
So I'm gonna reflect back to this.
Every one of those roadway networks
is going to be experiencing this congestion cost doubling.
Okay. Part of our infrastructure is when trucks are not just moving, but when they parked
their parked or need to park. This commend the Senate for the study committee that was
done over the past year. Excellent, excellent work and the attention to this issue is critical
for our economy, but it's also critical for the whole Eastern seaboard in Southeast.
Georgia is not the only place that is having the truck parking challenge.
It's caused by federal regulation, federal law and regulation that require truck drivers
to pull over and rest for 30 minutes or to get breaks in between their service hours.
When the electronic logging device came into play,
there was no longer the ability for them
to drive an extra mile or two.
So they have to pull over wherever they can get a parking space.
And I don't know how many of you might have seen
trucks parked along the interstate ramps,
the exit ramps overnight.
It's typically when you'll see it early
in the morning or late at night.
We have more truck demand than we have parking spaces
in our state.
It's important to note, though, that of the parking,
truck parking that we have in the state of Georgia,
6% is public spaces.
6% of truck parking places are at our rest areas,
way stations, or visitor center.
94% of truck parking is at private truck stops,
think of ATL, the travel centers of America loves and others where there are amenities
available beyond what we're able to provide at our est areas.
The problem becomes though that when they cannot find a place to park, the driver is going
to spend nearly an hour looking for a truck parking space or they have to cut off their
hours of service early so that they can park somewhere that they know is safe. That is
an impact of 10% to the supply chain and 12% equates to 12% cut to truck driver pay.
These are frontline workers that are moving our 70 to 80% of our economy and so we want
to do what we can to understand where truck parking opportunities to expand truck parking
exist. We did a study last about two years ago that is helping us locate where we can
expand truck parking that might be useful for drivers who are needing to rest. Of course,
the Atlanta is the epicenter of where unauthorized parking is occurring and that's what this map
shows in the brighter yellow and red. But we do have unauthorized truck parking that is
on our interstate ramps inside of the roadways in other parts of the state as well as you
can see there, wherever it's lit up in purple or blue.
So we are considering what capital investments we can make, either directly at our rest areas
or potentially through partnerships with, again, those private truck stop operators.
And we need to ensure we have compliance with federal and state laws and funding availability
and eligibility.
This is a focus for the department to do our part to catalyze truck parking availability
and expand that in our state.
One other thing that we've done is taken a look at the coastal empire.
That is the four counties that are around the port of Savannah that being Brian, Bullock,
at Chatham and Effingham County, where 75% of trips to and from the Port of
Savannah are heading with their cargo that's imported. We do know that there's
going to be expanded capacity at the at the Port of Savannah, so maybe you've
may have seen that, but we saw a 20% uptick in T.U. that's 20 foot equivalent
units of container capacity increased by 20% during the pandemic.
So Savannah is a port of choice for shippers and for carriers alike and we're doing our
best to keep up with that demand that's occurring outside the port area.
So we took a look at the coastal empire analyzing regional freight patterns, excuse me, industrial
development patterns and effects of the port growth on that local area. And this is what
we found that congestion growth in Metro Savannah from 2020 to 30 years out by level of
service. That is the metric that we use, the data point that we use to indicate the level
of congestion. So on the left is essentially, if you drive down in the Savannah area today,
you will see and you'll experience traffic congestion where those red dots are on the
left map 2020. Those are levels of service F as you can almost think about it as a grade
that kids have, school children have it in their classwork. So there's some congestion
occurring today but by 2050 without significant investment you can see where level of service
F for traffic congestion expands throughout this study area, throughout this catchment
area for the Savannah cargo that is moving through our port.
That is equating to a great deal of delay and making those land areas less available to
truckers within a one hour drive of the port.
In fact, without targeted investment by 2050, roughly 40% of the available industrial
space will be an hour drive from the port where right now it's about 10 to 20 minutes.
So the darker the shade of blue on the right means those are in the hour to two hour
distance from the port where none of that is being experienced today.
So that delay that's happening as a result of that congestion is making land development
less accessible for those shippers that are needing to move cargo quickly.
One thing to also note about this distance away from the port that collapses with congestion
is it impacts our truckers, our dry truckers in the area.
Today they can make multiple turns as they call it into and out of the port because their
destination of an industrial facility, whether it's manufacturing or distribution, is close.
So it depends on the trucker, it depends on what shift they're in, but they can make
anywhere from 4 to 8 turns a day, that is going to be cut in half.
So this is another impact to truck drivers.
We will need more truck drivers to do these terms in future years
unless we're able to invest in capacity improvements in the area.
So those capacity improvements we studied include corridor expansions,
about a dozen of them as you can see here.
This includes I-16, but it also includes 80.
and 21 into Effingham, as well as some improvements on I-95
and around the new metasite there in Bryan County,
plus about a dozen intersection improvements.
And these intersection improvements are much more economical
and they help out the flow a lot.
Even today, if we were able to build all of these improvements
today, you would see improvements in flow much more quickly
than if you do corridor improvements
because intersections are less expensive.
Therefore, we have more money available to do more of them.
And they're also quicker to construct
because they require less right away and less permitting.
We also did a study of Troop County.
The reason we did this is there's some of you may have heard
of MPOs, Metropolitan Planning Organizations
that are throughout Georgia, there's 16 MPOs.
Those are federally designated areas
that the local governments come together
and do a specific transportation planning
about a handful of them have their own money
to improve their roadway networks.
But Troop County is not one of those metro areas.
It just does not meet the population threshold
to get federal planning money or federal funds
for road improvements in that area.
Of course, Troop County is the home of Kia
are currently only operating auto manufacturer
in the state of Georgia.
the growth that has happened there is exponential.
In the last time that a plan was done in Troop County
was 2006.
And that was the year that Kia announced it would open.
So that as you all know, the community there
has transformed, has grown significantly.
And we wanted to partner with the county there
to do that study where federal resources weren't available.
So this is on the Alabama line.
It's just north of Columbus.
In fact, right after you might be heading down to Columbus
and split off on I-85, I-185, sorry, you're in
Troop County at that point, and then you pass by
Lagrange and on your way to Alabama is where you come
to West Point, which is where the Kia plant is.
There's three cities in Troop County.
Lagrange, Hogan'sville, and again, West Point is where
the Kia plant is, but there are suppliers throughout
this area.
We wanted to identify transportation
network improvements to address the future growth and with a focus on freight and provide
recommendations for road and bridge infrastructure and touch on transit and multi-moldal projects
as well. That study is underway and we'll be having, we've been having meetings with
the local communities and local governments there over the past nine to twelve months and
results will be coming out soon. And then we also took a look at State Route 365. Where
is that that is right where 985 ends and it is also where there is a new
northeast inland port will be opening soon. This is a strategic location that
was chosen by the port of Savannah as a way to move cargo inland on rail and
keep trucks off of a couple hundred miles worth of roadways by moving
those containers on rail instead. So at the inland port is where there's an
exchange of cargo containers that come from the port of Savannah, they will move on to
a truck at this inland port or intermodal facility.
So we knew that there was going to be some growth happening there, but in reality, that
location was chosen strategically because there already is a lot of manufacturing and distribution
that is occurring in this area.
So it's just another piece of the puzzle that's solving the freight volumes that are increasing
there.
we are looking at adjacent roadways,
as well as what's going on around the port,
and analyzing existing and future conditions
from 985 up north east to Belton Bridge,
and we're gonna develop and evaluate
transportation improvement options.
And then one last study to tell you about
that we've had underway for a little bit
is in the Brazleton, Huston area.
That is on I-85, just outside of the,
Well, it's just outside of the Gwyneth Barrow County line
into Jackson County.
So if you see in the purple is the area,
it's a pretty large area and it crosses county boundaries
as most transportation trips in Georgia,
cross county boundaries.
They trucks and cars are moving from origin to destination
regardless of what border of a county or city
it might be crossing.
So that is a role that G.Dot can uniquely play
to look at the true travel demand,
regardless of what jurisdiction it's in.
So we're looking at regional connectivity,
the demand for North and South travel.
Through trips is a significant challenge in the area,
but there's also been an incredible amount
of manufacturing distribution growth
that is happening in particularly Jackson County.
And so there's a great deal of interest
in ensuring the local communities
continue to have safe access to their businesses
neighborhoods as the industrial base grows in that area.
So that is it for me if you, for what I have for formal presentation, but happy to answer
any questions, refer back to any slides if you'd like.
This QR code and that link will take you to the Georgia Freight Planning Analysis.
That is where you find about a 25 page report reflecting that statewide analysis of key industries
and congestion costs.
Thank you.
Director Miller.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Some of you may be wondering why we keep talking about this.
Chairman B. H. when he was leading the charge on transportation and study committee, I think
it was four years ago on this topic.
And there's really two reasons we were looking at this one.
If we look at those 2050 numbers, it's not a George that any of us would want to live
in, right?
Where we're seeing two hours to get 50 miles outside the port of Savannah.
We're going to see gridlock traffic in Atlanta around the state.
You overlay that with our current situation.
I believe, director, you had what's not in here.
I read a report that came out from your office last week.
I believe that, give me the timeline on this.
But you all put a rough number of $90 billion,
essentially the $90 billion dollar solve on this problem.
Is that with that same 2050 kind of time horizon?
That's correct, yes.
That's additional funding above and beyond
the current plan, is that correct?
Most of it would be additional.
that's just the total investment over a 25 year period
would be 90 billion.
And that 90 billion dollars worth of improvements
would improve freight, but it would also improve
people flow as well, that we don't have just trucks
on any of our remains in Georgia.
That's right.
So to put that 90 billion in perspective,
we will see about 2.2, 2.3 billion in the budget this year.
The feds will give us about 1.8.
So we're currently spending about $4 billion a year
with our existing needs.
And all those existing needs fund all the other projects
in all of our districts that may or may not have anything to do with these identified
freight corridors. I'm in active conversations with Chairman Jasper's in the house. I
think we probably have a generational opportunity to allocate existing revenue sources from
our surplus to some of these transportation projects. Personally, I would love to see
us do that without having to raise new revenue, without having to do, you know, line item tax
increases as has been done in the past.
We think we've got about 10 years left, at least,
in the gas tax.
The gas tax has been relatively resilient.
That $2.2 billion number has been pretty consistent.
But eventually, we know that that will change.
And so we have things out there that
exist such as the marketplace facilitator tax
that will increase over time as the motor fuel tax decreases.
I think those are all things we need to be actively
thinking about this exercise and talking about this is not just so we can look at maps
and say, hey, we're going to have congestion problems in 30 years and let's just, you
know, kind of realize that maybe try to build one or two more roads.
I think that with the surpluses that we've had, we've seen states of the north, south,
and east of us in the west for that matter do something similar with Governor Kimpton
last week.
Make multi-billion dollar investments of the surplus money or ARPA money or both and as
As you saw on the governor's budget, he put forth about $1.5 billion in the baby budget
for fiscal year 24.
600 or so, if that would go to freight, 600 or so, that will go to the existing called
the G.Doc program, which I think is important to note a great percentage of that, merely
backfill projects that we've had to spend money on with the economic development success
in the state.
So when we go win a KIO or a Hyundai or a Rivian, we're spending tens of millions of dollars
around that area to build up infrastructure.
And what that means for us in our districts,
if that doesn't happen to be in our district,
is without an injection of capital,
other projects are getting pushed down the list.
So I want to thank the governor and his team
for essentially allowing the plan that we have,
the tip to stay on track.
And then lastly, there's $200 million
that you'll see in there for the Elma grants,
which are done by formula, which is something that all of you,
if you have not called your local county commissioners
or city managers, let them know about that yet.
that is something that essentially doubles that spend for the local maintenance improvement
programs that we have.
So, I just want to kind of cast that net over this conversation as to why we're having
that.
I know a couple members need to leave in a few minutes and one of those is going to be
leader Goose.
I'm going to let you ask the first question.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Janine, thanks for being here.
It's always good to get an update from you.
Dearing thanks given I drove my family out to Arkansas and as we've talked so many times
about trucks and truck stops and overnight parking.
I realized when we drove through Arkansas,
there were truck parking lots spread throughout
interstate 40.
I wonder why Arkansas has done that and we haven't.
What, where's the money coming from
and how are they doing that on interstate 40?
Good question, I haven't been along that corridor
but I will definitely research it.
Thank you for flagging that.
I think it would be good to look into that.
I'd love to see that in Georgia.
Indeed, we are embarking on a very special deep dive study.
We have business consultants and transportation consultants
that are going to really unpack,
where is the private sector demand
and what the state can do to support that.
Couple things to note, we are rest areas as they exist today
by federal law, we cannot have any commercial activity
on those rest areas.
So wherever we expand that would have the amenities
that truck drivers need and want along their journey,
We will have to do that in partnership with the private sector.
From what I saw, these parking lots were just vacant lots that were built off the interstate.
No exit anywhere else.
They were just pull-offs, maybe a five acre flat asphalt lot, 100 trucks spots, perhaps.
No utilities, no water or anything, so they literally looked like they were built primarily
for truckers to spend the night and get their hours in.
Thank you for that.
That would be a stop gap measure somewhere to at least just park, but we know that just
like all of us, we need the human amenities to make our journey safe and comfortable.
So we do have engineering and analysis underway to expand our rest area parking by about 400
spaces.
We don't have the funding for all of that, but we do have engineering underway for that.
last question if I may the pinch point that Henry County what's the status on that what can we expect to
see in the next two to four years. A analysis was done and I believe it's on our website that is the
corridor between Macon and Atlanta and it's showing that the the Henry County is indeed a pinch
point and we are taking a deeper analysis right now of where we should expand that capacity. The
The truck only, the commercial vehicle lanes that are planned are just covering about
a little over half of that distance between Macon and 285, and those are northbound only.
But there's clearly from what we've gathered so far, much more traffic congestion today
and in the future than just northbound commercial vehicles lanes would accommodate.
So we're taking a look at the best way to phase those investments over time, where the traffic is the worst.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chairman Beach.
My name is Chairman, I want to kind of piggyback on what Chairman Beach here.
Mike is not pulling up, he might pull in Senator Mellon's mic over to you, thank you.
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to kind of piggyback on your comments.
We started studying freight logistics when Chairman Tanner was here about four or five years
ago.
And I think we've done enough studying it.
My question to you is, do we have a project list and can we prioritize that?
And have you and the Port Authority and GDOT and Economic Development Development Pat Wilson
sat down and say, hey, this is, we've got a Hyundai plant coming here, Rivian here, we've
got to build infrastructure.
Is there some joint meetings going on between all of you and some collaboration?
I can tell you, if we don't start building roads in Savannah today, the trucks will not
be able to leave the gate of the port in ten years.
They'll be so backed up.
So we've got to do it.
I know Griff Lynch and his appropriations hearing talked a little bit about partnership
with Rail and trying to get more product on Rail and there's talk about, I know Norfolk
We've got to start building now and I know we've studied a lot, but is there some project list we can look at and prioritize and get shovels in the ground and start building?
Yes, let me first answer the question about collaboration coordination amongst the agencies.
Yes, we meet on a regular basis of Georgia Ports Authority and very frequently with Pat Wilson
and his team at the Department of Economic Development to understand where not just the big plants
are going in but small manufacturing and distribution around the state.
So we're regularly looking at that and trying to get ahead and stay ahead where we can.
As you know, Chairman, it takes a long time to develop a project, unfortunately, with
the regulations that are required of us to follow from environmental permitting to public
involvement, to engineering, safety design, all of it, right away acquisition, it takes
a very long time to develop projects.
So in terms of the projects that are for freight, and the freight program is recommended
by the governor. Commissioner and I are working on that battery of projects that are going
to be able to come into the program that might be in the out years that are going to benefit
free. That's a one time solution and we have had construction cost increases. So we know
just the overall cost of doing business is more than it used to be. So we're working
with the engineering team and the permitting and right away teams to figure out how we
can bring the best most cost effective projects forward with those funds.
And it's in terms of when it will be hard to get trucks out of the port of Savannah, we're
not sure.
It's hard to exactly project that.
We just know by 2050 it will look like this.
This may show up earlier than 2050.
We do have some of these coastal empire study projects in the pipeline already, particularly
as I was referring to the intersections are going to be the quickest and easiest ones
to get going. This has been looked at by our engineering project development team, both
this one of intersections and these of corridors, and we're evaluating what do we already
have available in the program, can bring off the shelf and get those started right away,
and then which ones require PE and right away, and we'll take a little bit longer to develop.
This is the most mature of all of the freight projects, for the ones that we're going
to want to build for truck parking, as I mentioned, to Senator Gooch, but also to address
these along all of these routes statewide is a lot of additional work to get it from
a concept in a model to a project list that is a concrete ready to let to bid project
list. That's going to take a good bit longer. But we're working on it.
Can I have one follow up question? So let's say next year we have another huge surplus
and the governor wants to give you $3 billion.
Are you going to be able to get that money
in the ground working on capital projects?
Whether the governor gives us more money
by next year or not, we will know a lot more.
We are underway right now to translate
these roadway networks with this congestion costs
into projects that's going to happen
whether there's more money available or not.
That's our duty to do that.
Okay, thank you.
I'm Chair and V. H. Senator Lucas.
Yes.
A talk to the question president on the bill, of course, and all that.
One by the end of the bill, in the middle of the year, you'd say, twigs, a meal counter coming
in to be a counter.
There's another land out there to do it.
and knock the sun on the mud, bag of poultry to the chocolate mud.
Wouldn't that be an ideal place not only to do a port, but also a truck round beam?
If you had that time, you would assume that first you would have the railroads where to put the trailer on.
In terms of the exact location of where inland ports go, we defer to the port of Savannah,
the Georgia Ports Authority, because they have the line of sight into their cargo owners'
data and origin destinations in ways that we don't.
So we defer to the port's authority on planning those.
There is one in cordial today.
Probably not big enough.
There is one in Appalachian Regional Port in northwest Georgia.
The inland port in Gainesville Hall County will be open soon.
And then the Georgia Port Authority is also planning one over west central Georgia near
the Kia plant to support the cargo flows there.
That is what I know is planned.
Beyond that, I'd have to defer to the Port Authority on where they believe their customers
are best going to utilize the inland port and get the most use out of it.
Well, the reason I asked is, it's going to take money.
And we need the trouble.
I mean, I've done, I've done a thing for a bit.
When I give you money now, just then have a short break to roll this line.
or the tractor trailer got everything back up going into the land.
And so the question becomes whether or not you can take someone that often gets to the little door here.
And you have an awful stuff whether or not you will be able to do an in-emport
as well as drivers being able to along the island once they get there
And it absolutely takes some of the trucks off their own
because it won't send if I was straight to the map.
Well, as you can see here, I 75 shows up on every map
for every industry, north of Macon,
and then both for food and agriculture and distribution
retail.
I 75 all the way to Florida border is a key corridor.
And there's a study done by the US Department of Agriculture
a few years back that indicated that I-75 through the whole state of Georgia is critical for
all of the nations, food and agriculture.
What an inland port does, though, it only would go to and from the port of Savannah.
So we've got a lot of through traffic on I-75 that an inland port wouldn't even be able
to address.
But we will bring that back to the port authority.
We'll let them know that there's an interest there and we're going to be meeting with them
further on.
What else we can do here?
And that's, I mean, you've got to have it.
They have to have a land, it's rural areas in the land.
And it's right.
The side of it was a metro area.
And then you got to know a person who is running
to Wilkinson and to meet for the kids.
And when they do the Inland Ports, they partner.
They, the Georgia Ports Authority partners
with one of the rail carriers.
So we got a chance to do Norfolk Southern, right?
They want to be, oh, they don't want to be night.
I guess we're going to have about five more minutes here with Ms. Miller.
So I'm going to take two more questions.
Senator Mel, your button was, are you, did you still have a question?
I did.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And to Director Miller, I thank you for the graph that you provided us.
I drive I-16 every day coming to session back and forth.
And I appreciate the study that you all did.
I've been talking about I-16 with no study because I've been driving it.
Is there any opportunity to consider adding IE and express lane where you could use
a peach pass to get through some of the congestion a little faster where the truck traffic may
take up.
The right lane and then truck traffic then gets in the left lane and then you're stuck
with the trucks.
And I don't know if anybody has ever rolled past them on I-16 but they shake your car
as you ride them.
It makes me nervous.
So any opportunity to do that in small sections to eat this elephant?
That's a great question.
I-16 is a focal point not just for the Coastal Empire study but for all of the freight
plan. What is the best way to add capacity to I-16 is a corridor study is what we would
like to do with the additional funding that hopefully is appropriated because there are
many options that have been offered up. People have discussed truck only lanes. People
have discussed just in HOV lane for folks who have more than two or three people in a car
to use that. People have discussed a transit lane. So there are many options in there.
We do know that in Atlanta, say on I-75, that reversible corridor, we'd prefer not to
do reversible. If we do a lane addition of any sort, we would want it to be in each direction
because we know there's bidirectional flows. That's something that's important. But wherever
we do have our toll lanes in Metro Atlanta. We don't allow trucks in those lanes up here.
So if toll lanes become something that we might want to do in Savannah,
only if it will provide the best option and the best use of the public's dollars,
we would still have to determine it would trucks use the lane or not. There's a lot left to
understand in that. Any opportunity to use the contra flow lanes that we have for evacuation to
to maybe supplement that while they exist,
they sit dormant until we have a hurricane,
which is usually from August to November,
and other than that, they're not in use.
That's a great question,
and that will be part of our analysis
to make the best use of existing infrastructure.
It was the most cost-effective way to improve capacity.
Thank you, Chair and Burns, is this you, or is it?
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and a quick question.
We've talked a lot about roads, we've talked a lot about trucks,
we'll talk about rail.
We have to integrate our rail with our truck traffic.
I have a current traffic in my district
that's three miles long in breaking communities apart.
Rail.
Rail.
Now, we have to have a combination of rail and truck
in order to move freight to an inlet port
or to a final destination.
Now, my question is, how do you integrate rail
into your overall transportation freight strategy?
And how can we ensure that rail will have a capacity
to accept the offload from trucks?
Great question.
along with the truck parking analysis,
with the private sector that I mentioned before,
we're also that same consultant team,
business consultants who understand private sector
rail demand, and our transportation consultants
are gonna team up and do a deep dive understanding
where we have those blocked crossings
or occupied crossings around the state.
And what can we do about those?
We're gonna be explaining rail capacity.
That's right.
So what will come out of that,
We're not sure we do believe that a grade separation
is the best way to keep those communities
from being blocked.
We also know that grade separations
can cost anywhere from $10 million up to $50 million each
and take a long time to develop and partner
with the railroads on making sure
that engineering works for both parties.
So there may be the potential to do some rail sightings,
is what it's called, like an offshoot
where the train can park and get out of the community.
that's going to be a really important part of the study
because those are less expensive.
But as you know, we have the gratuities clause
in our constitution, so we can't give state money
to a private, give away to a private,
it has to be a public-private partnership
to make those happen.
But those would be a more cost-effective way
of doing it, where we can find two and three miles
that doesn't have a public crossing.
So it's complex.
Thank you for teaching.
All right, quickly to Chairman again.
Thank you, Chairman.
Mr. Miller, I appreciate your presentation.
One of the things that I'm gonna pick on my colleague
from down in Savannah, and I look at, okay,
we just heard the, you come up I-16 to 75,
you get to Henry County at stops.
The, I'm gonna implore you to keep pushing
those secondary routes.
If I was in Savannah, I wanna go to Atlanta.
I might take Highway 17 north to,
I-20 coming in, I-20, use some of those under,
underutilized routes.
I guarantee you there's not 10 minutes difference between the time actually it may be much faster
using those routes but you know those are opportunities and I want to see us try to continue
to push those I know how we 17 was back in the day the grip program said the I was there
moving those things forward I appreciate what you do and thanks for being here today.
The bridge you got to be in the care of the work.
Thank you.
They ain't no bridges down there, South Jordan.
Just ask that one about Savannah.
They got a little bridge problem down there.
Thank you for the comment on the grip corridors.
Those have been, I believe, a key for attracting business
to the state of Georgia with the four lane roads
that is a grid network around the state.
And many of these that are on this map here are grip corridors.
And they provide an incredible high performance
and important route to, throughout communities
for industry to the port and to Metro Atlanta.
Thank you, Director Malone, for being here today.
I think that probably the most encouraging news
is that we have a project list coming out
that's something that's been very interesting
to members of the committee as well as the appropriators.
That was a question that was kind of whispered amongst
everyone as we realized we can $1.5 billion
appropriated around the state at least this year.
And obviously we're hoping that continues as well.
Thank you for coming today and presenting this study and God speed you.
We have three bills that I think we can get through relatively quickly today.
I'm going to call Josh Waller up first to talk about Senate Bill 353
that I'm actually carrying as the department bill.
All three of our bills, this is a little bit of a caveat,
but this is the department bill you're about to hear is sent to your redo
of the department bill that we had last year.
It was veto due to something that was added.
And then the second and third bills that we'll hear are also bills were recommitted to the committee.
So the subject matter of all three of these bills is something that we have already discussed.
As a committee, but certainly you're more than welcome to ask any questions that you have.
I just wanted to kind of let you know that's why we're seeing these three this quickly.
And wish that Josh welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for carrying the bill. I'll just run through it. Section 1 was a
Recommendation from Legislative Council just updating the way that they notify you for board elections
Obviously, you're here usually the elections are called during session more effective the email you versus no no out to you so
Section 2 is a cleanup
Changing request for proposals to proposal revisions at that point in the process the RFP is already taken place
So this was just a cleanup of terms
Section 3 is a cleanup from when you all adopted alternative contracting methods back in
2021, clarifies when there's restrictions on when you can do construction manager general
contract or procurement.
This just cleans that up and here was a point where there was an amendment that we've
tightened up the language to say it can be waived once every 10 years.
The original version had once, there was some confusion as to what is once made as being
one time, one time ever or one time in an instance.
So that should hopefully make it absolutely clear that it's once every 10 years.
Section 4 is just conforming it to changes in federal law in terms of the length of
these modular sexual housing units.
Section 5 was a provision that we would work with different parties on to improve, particularly
in the metropolitan area where you have a crash on our interstates or limited access road
where you have a fatality.
Before that, the crash site can be resolved, you have to have someone on site to declare
the individual or individual's deceased.
Sometimes just like any of us,
if you've got a major crash,
a corner will have the same challenges accessing the site.
So what this does is allows for the corner,
it makes it clear the corner
and their discretion can designate someone else author
who's eligible on site to perform those duties
for the corner so that that hopefully allows
for the buyer to be then moved,
the crash site to be resolved.
Because the longer you have that delay,
the more challenge you have of secondary crashes
and other instances will come.
So section six is just to clean up to belt suspenders
to say, look, if in the world we're transportation data
and different data that are out there,
make it absolutely clear that the open records that can't be used
to get personal data about people and their movements
on our roadway system.
With that, and then obviously section seven
is just the effective language.
That concludes section by section.
Any for any questions?
Chair again.
Thank you. I was curious. I've seen an inordinate amount of these. I think they call them
flock cameras. I'm not sure what flock stands for, but the that's a company. It's a brand
name. Okay. They all over the state on state highways, rural parts of the state, urban
parts of the state, others. The data on those, you're telling me that they're not subject
open records. So the department does not operate any of those. This would only be
data that the state has. Who operates those and who allowed them to be
installed on right away if the department doesn't operate them. So those are
done by a permit local law enforcement. And who's paying for them? The local
law enforcement. And who's if they decide they want to. Or the local government.
Now I would have to. And if they want to sell that data, the to say, well hey we
saw, you know, so and so's tag going about here at this point at this time of day was
to prevent them from selling that data.
I would have to, I couldn't speak to that.
But it's, you're allowing that on State Highway right away.
And we have a process whereby with local governments we do and local law enforcement, but they
they have, but if they want to commercialize that and they, is any of that contemplated in
this bill?
No.
This isn't it.
Let's stick with the contents of this bill.
Thanks.
Senator McClure, is that your light?
Copy.
Any other questions from the committee?
Seeing none, what's the will of the committee?
We have a motion to do pass from Chairman Napertate, a second from Chairman Beech.
Any discussion?
All those in favor of the motion, please sign up for raising your hand.
The motion carries unanimously.
Thank you Josh. Next up is Senate Resolution 158, Senator Anne
of Attarte. Let you present from there.
Yep, number nine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be quick this past unanimously.
Last year, last session, basically just piggybacking off of Jenny's
presentation. This is a logistics corridor, basically to study, examine, and
bring logistics and supply chain jobs to West Georgia.
I think it was Chairman. Any questions?
I will start with Chairman Burns first.
Do you have a question, Senator Lucas?
I see it is at 20.
Second.
At 20's involved.
All right, no other questions. What's the what's the pleasure of the committee?
We have motion to do pass from Senator McClure and
Second from Mr. Chairman again. All those in favor any discussion?
Go ahead
The resolution doesn't mention a 16. Is that a motion to amend?
Mr. Chairman, I'm a wave just for a pointed discussion. Appreciate it. I thought the gentleman from the 31st fantastic
All those in favor of the motion, please signify buries in your hand.
Motion carries unanimously.
Congratulations, this is the center end of a talk to you.
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for, House Bill 524, with freshmen, representative
Ridley-Karian, what I believe is your first bill that was spectacularly overlooked on
signing a die but you were here again and you all had a little fun with it last
year but like you said it passed out of this committee House Bill 524 just
says three-wheeled vehicles that are partially or fully enclosed they don't
have to wear a helmet currently all three-wheeled vehicles in the state
require a helmet and I have photos just like last year if you remember showing
what they look like if anyone has any questions can we see those photos
I recognize Chairman Lucas for a question or sorry Senator Lucas for a question.
They are legal on the road and some of them do go 60-70 miles an hour.
Chairman Burns.
Okay.
A similar question.
These are licensed, insured.
Yes, sir.
And they have a tag.
They have a track and national highway transportation meets all safety
rates. Yes, they made all the safety requirements of any other vehicle in the
same way category. Thank you. Representative, when you ran for office, you go
door to door. I did. And when you went door to door and talked about your
platform was passing the bill for three wheeled vehicles part of the
part of your platform. That specifically wasn't, but you know, reducing
regulations and you know, trying to help people have an easier time out there
was part of it. Fantastic. Any other questions from the committee?
Chair again. I'm curious. The tag that goes on this
is a motorcycle tag or an automobile tag. Automobile tag.
And the three wheeler open style vehicles I see on the road.
Are those at the slingshots? Select slingshots type vehicle.
I wouldn't even name a name, but they are they
automobiles or they motorcycles. So this is for ones that have a frame
enclosed like your slingshot they don't have a roof those are motorcycles and
those would still require a helmet. Okay. Thank you. I am curious about line 37
where it says to partially or fully enclose the operator what's the scenario
which it would be partially enclosed. Some of them they're like jeeps the doors
come off so it's not fully enclosed when the doors are off. Would a slingshot
operator they'll be able to argue that they are partially enclosed. This is actually
a serious question. Their body is partially enclosed whereas everything above their
body is open. Well the argument was partially enclosed and like with the frame
there's no frame on top of them. So like in the like I said line 37, a frame
to partially or fully enclose. When you're not above you I think it'd be a hard
argument to say you're partially enclosed because you're really just you're
We're not in close at all at that point.
Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mello.
I'll come to you next, Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just have a question.
Since we have a little small manufacturing plant coming down
at 16, will these vehicles be manufactured or created
somewhere along at 16?
Since they can ride on at 16, will we be able to make them
or how would that work?
Yes, sir.
There is a company that sells them out of Savannah already.
But what about making them?
Where did they make that?
I'm not exactly sure where they make them, but I know they sell them out of Savannah and they're very popular in the Savannah area.
Okay.
Chair again.
Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure if my question is for the freshman representative or for our experienced council in the room, but
I think it could be argued in the courts that, you know, okay, those sling shots or whatever have a frame that partially encloses you.
And in this case, I think if we were going to clarify this, we might want to say, you know,
that the frame members go all the way above or around the occupant.
Because I could see, you know, on those slingshots, I can see those being partially enclosed.
I mean, you need to have a frame on that lower portion. What's the difference?
I'm not the lawyer in the room, but some of them do.
do and I understand when you have a roof but if you if you can take the doors off and it doesn't say
anything about okay it has the frame has to be above the occupant as well and and that's where for
me I'm just kind of curious okay from a legal standpoint I think what we're doing is we're saying
that now a slingshot can make this definition do you want to address that representative argument
I'm going to make there as we do allow cars on the road today they don't have roofs you know
no convertibles or top go down.
So in that example, the slingshot and a convertible
would be the same thing.
Senator Lawrence.
Mr. Chairman, to Senator Gaines' point,
maybe we could drop a little note here for the judiciary
and have a legislative history moment.
So with a pointed question,
is it the author's intention whatsoever
that slingshots would be covered by this bill?
No, it's not.
Well, great, now they know.
So, thanks very much.
Thank you, Councillor. Any other questions in the committee? What's the pleasure of the committee?
We've got a move to pass from Senator Lucas, second from Senator Malo, any discussion? All
those in favor please signify by raising your hand? All those opposed? This motion carries
six to two. Thank you, Representative. Thank you, members of the committee for your
time today. That completes our business and we're adjourned.
