you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you to make. Many of you along with myself serve with our dear friend, former chairman Bill Himmry. And y'all know Bill has been ill for some time now. Just got word, Katie, thank you. That bill passed this morning. As you know, it's easy to say he's in a better place, but I know Bill was ready for whatever the good Lord had prepared for him. Where it was here, as he inspired media blus with his writings and with his life and his counsel. I just learned I did not know this. Obviously we'll keep that family in our prayer and give thanks for Bill Himmry, but his sister, Olga, Olga, and I say that right, also works in the clerks' office. So she's a part of this family as well. So let's keep that entire family and give thanks for a life we'll live. So if you will bow with me for a moment of prayer. God, thank you for good people. Thank you for those who inspire us to do better. They'd be our best, to treat our neighbor with kindness and fairness. Lord, let those life lessons inspire us all. Lord, will you know that we'll lift up that family? We know you will hold them in your hands, Lord, and give them comfort and peace. And the prayers will come from these folks here in this room as they remember a friend, a former colleague. We just give you thanks for the life of Bill Himmry. Amen. Thank you members. As is our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning, enjoyed meeting he and his family. We'll be introduced by the lady from the 82nd House District, Chair Lady Karen Madyach. Chair Lady Madyach. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, colleagues. It's such a pleasure to have family here today. We don't always get to enjoy the families of our pastors. So I'm very blessed to have Rebecca and Kayla. She's a fourth grader and her first time to the Capitol. And she got to see the animals down in the rotunda. And I also have a good friend of my former state senator Mitch Sebaugh. He lives in my district now and I'm so blessed and honored to have you here today, Senator. Thank you so much. Thank you, Pastor, for coming and being with us today. Pastor Devon is originally from Albany. My seatmate will enjoy that. Stephen grew up in a broken home. Where church attendance really wasn't a priority. My community, my district has a rich, rich history of Christendom. And I'm so proud of that and I'm proud to have Pastor Stephen with us. As a teenager, he came to faith in Christ as soon as he sensed God's call to ministry. He married his high school sweetheart, Rebecca. And together, God has blessed them with five children, Cade, Cole, Cason, Carrington and Kayla, all with a C. Stephen has served in full-time ministry for over two decades, finally leading churches to Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. He is passionate about teaching God's word in a way that connects people to Christ and believes the local church is God's plan A for reaching the world. With a heart for sharing the gospel, making disciples and equipping others to do the same, Stephen leads with conviction, humility and deep love for the church. He holds a master in divinity from Liberty University, Baptist Theological Seminar, and Stephen has been the pastor of Oak Hill Church in Williamson, Georgia for over eight years. So please enjoy his word this morning. Good morning. As a lifelong Georgian growing up, driving through downtown Atlanta to get to mineral bluff to see my grandparents, I would have never dreamed that I would have been in this building. And so thank you for being here. I know probably it's probably against some of your wills. So we'll try to get through this together. I want to thank first speaker Burns for allowing me to be here, speaker protein Jones, leader of frustration, leader Hugley and chairwoman Mathy. Thank you so much for allowing me to be here this morning. In Mark 10, we read where Jesus is foretelling his death. He's walking with his disciples. And in the back, James and John are making plans. They are working and networking to try to see where they can be. Jesus over hears or comments as they come up and they say, can we ask you a question? Can we sit next to you? They will honor. They won't prestige. They won't recognition. And Jesus responds in Mark 10, 45 in a most peculiar way when he says, for even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve. And he gave his life as a ransom for many. There's a lot that preachers and politicians have in common. And I know that probably some of the people that vote for you and some of the people that attend my church would agree. We both speak for a living and we hope that people will listen. We shake a lot of hands and attend more meetings than we care to attend. We get criticized by people that have never done our job a day in their life. Can I get amen? We're expected to have all the answers for problems that are bigger than ourselves. But the biggest thing that we have in common is not the microphones that we stand behind, but rather the motivation for why we do it. At some point, you and I decided that we wanted to give our lives or a portion of our lives to serve people, because people matter. And we know that the way up is down. Jesus tells us if we wanted to be great in

world that we should serve. True leadership is measured by service. He says to give his life Mark 1045, Jesus' greatest act of service happened without applause, without headlines, and without votes. And oftentimes for all of us, the most meaningful service is unseen. It's unselibated. It's unappreciated. And because of the late nights that I know that are coming from many of you, it also is inconvenient. But God sees those late nights. He sees those tough decisions and the quiet sacrifices that you make. And those that never make the news. And as a Georgian, I want to tell you that I'm grateful for what you do in making our state a better place. We see that service also happens when no one is applauding. Leadership is not about position. It's not about our title or influence. It's about a responsibility to care for people and to care for people well. So whether it's a pulpit or in the capital, leadership means asking this, who am I responsible for today? The goal of service is the good of others, not the glory of self. And while James and John were jockeying for position or doing everything they can to ensure that they would have a seat at the table when perhaps the best seat next to their savior, oftentimes we find out that Jesus, we read in the Word of God, at the last supper, when he took a towel that should have been where he was being served, he lowered it and tied it around his waist and washed the feet of those that he set an example for, that they would serve. He came as a ransom for many. Jesus served with others in mind, not of himself. He gave of himself to the very end. And when service is our goal, the beautiful thing of service is that unity becomes possible even when we disagree. And I'm sure there's never any disagreement in this room. You can disagree strongly and oftentimes that happens both in this building and the building that I call my church home, but you can still serve and love honorably when the focus is on the people. Different colleagues, different convictions, but the same definition of greatness, all of us are called to serve. In my prayer for you and I pray that your prayer is for me, that God would give us the strength to keep serving well, especially when it's difficult. Can we pray together? Father, I thank you for these men and women that are feeling this room. Father, you know every one of their needs, but there's nothing that you don't know. Father, I pray that you would protect their children, their grandchildren, their marriages. Father, I pray that you would keep them far from evil and alert to sin, that they would choose you, that they would know that you made them for purpose and on purpose. And the Father, I pray that you would walk with them in the days ahead, that you would give them wisdom as they make decisions that will impact their families and every family in our state. Father, I pray for the family of Bill Himmri in his passing. I pray that Father, you would be nearer than you've ever been before, that they would sense you, that they would love you and know that they're love to buy you. It's in the name of Jesus, I pray. Amen. Would you join me for the Pledge of Allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America in the delivery public for which it stands, formation, power, God, individual with liberty and justice for all. Perfect. Thank you, brother Stephen. Don't go anywhere to stay right here. Door, keep as you may unlock the doors. Members, you may join Brother Stephen out in the South, any room and give, show your appreciation. Thanks for reminding us about our responsibility. Thank you, strong message. Thank you. Thank you.

It is keeping Georgia while day and I'm not speaking on that but on that theme, I am proud to welcome and celebrate the winners of our now annual State Park and Historic Sites Art Contest, which Senator Halpern and I co-created and first launched last year with our State's Department of Natural Resources. We created this initiative specifically to celebrate two things. One, if you don't know, Georgia has 48 beautiful State Parks and 15 Historic Sites and two, we have some really talented youth. This year we got nearly 250 submissions from high schoolers all over the state and today we welcome our top 10, which sitting on the jury I have to say was not particularly easy to get down to. If they are here, I ask them to rise. Not sure I see them. They are over in the Senate but we still want to recognize them. If you want to see that we have all the top artwork featured in the South Wing starting at 1pm today and a reception, celebrating the winners at 230, go out and see our beautiful State Parks and Historic Sites.

Good morning colleagues. 118 years ago on the campus at Howard University something incredible occurred. In the midst of lynching rates being at all time high and African-American attendance rates in college being at all time low. 16 scholars. 16 black women. One in particular. I had a photo of Betsy. You didn't get it. Ethel Hedgeman had a vision. A vision fair. That black women should be able to assemble as sisters. And the first and finest black sisterhood on record was founded Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated. January 15th, 1908 on the campus of Howard University. 118 years later we continue to serve globally together in our communities as well as in yours.

Dale would you stand. Who cares so much about literacy? Thank you. I appreciate the difference you're making in people's lives. Thank you. Because you met a huge difference in my life. Thank you. I also like to welcome the First Lady of the Senate, Mrs. Jan Jones. Thank you for being here and thank you for supporting this gentleman to my left and your family. Thank you for everything you do. Please stand up and welcome you. Some other special folks here with our Lieutenant Governor Jones, his former state representative. He's doing a great job. He did a great job. His father, Bill Jones, his sister, Natalie Tiller and his brother-in-law, Chris. Would you all all stand and let us recognize you all? Thank you for your service in the house, Mr. Bill. Now, my honor also to recognize someone very important to the workings of this chamber and to the workings of our state, along a distinguished career is not over. And that's Speaker Pro Tem, Jan Jones. Pro Tem. A gentleman's name has a long tenure of service in our state. He's continuing that tenure of service to the people of Georgia. And that name is Larry Walker. This is Larry Walker III, the new Pro Tem in the Georgia Senate. Thank you for your service of Georgia and your family. Now, I want to recognize some folks that are very important part of our lives in Georgia. And those are folks that are at service our judges. I want to recognize first Chief Justice Nail's SD Peterson for your service. Please stand and let us recognize you, Mr. Chief Justice. Very important part of that whole process presiding Justice Sarah Hawkins Warren. Thank you for being here and letting us be in part of this day. Now, also we have the Chief Judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals, Chief Judge Trenton Brown. Thank you for being here. Thank you to our judiciary. It's certainly a very, very important part of our process as we all care about our neighbors. Thank you for your wisdom and your justice for the people of Georgia. We have a couple of constitutional officers, I think, if my eyes aren't fooling me that are here today and I want to start with one is the Attorney General of our State of Georgia, Attorney General Chris Carr. It is beautiful wife Joan. Let's make them welcome. Secretary of State Brad Reffensberger, former House member. Our insurance commissioner, Commissioner John King. Welcome back to the House commissioner. Our number one industry in the state, our agriculture commissioner Tyler Hopper. And a lady is doing an outstanding job. Thank you Governor. Nice job here. Labor commissioner Bob will Rivera Holmes. Commissioner Holmes, thank you for your service. State schools superintendent Richard Woods. Thank you Mr. Superintendent. I wanted to make sure the mayor could find his way from down the street. Mayor Andre Dickens, a dear friend, doing a great job leading the city of Atlanta. Mayor Dickens. The gentleman who has had long and distinguished service to our country and our state. Chancellor Sonny Perdue. We are looking to build some relationships this morning so I am going to introduce these next two gentlemen together from the University of Georgia. Don't applaud yet. The president of the University of Georgia, President Jerry Morhead. Hold it. And also from the Georgia Institute of Technology, President Angel Cabera. Thank you. I hope you all are together. There they are right there. We have our public service commission here and they are led by former House member, Chairman Jason Shaw and members of the public service commission to fuel stand. The consular corps, I know we have a lot of good folks here, fuel stand so we can make you welcome here to the Georgia House. We all may be seated. I have never said anything that receives such approval. Thank you all for welcoming all our guests and recognizing some very, very important people in the lives of Georgians. Now I am very honored and some misgivings as well to introduce Governor Kim today. Because this may be the last time he will be delivering this address to the people of our great state. But I can assure you that the legacy, Governor Kim, you, your family has been well last far beyond the eight years that you will have spent serving as governor of this state. Often say this and it's true, a story seldom told is soon forgotten. And the success story, you've helped this General Assembly write for Georgia will certainly not be forgotten anytime soon. You've led with integrity, determination and resilience. Through some of the most difficult times we face as Georgians and as a nation. When COVID struck, you put the people of Georgia first and re-open our state for business to ensure our economy remains strong and it worked. And Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Elaine swept across South Georgia leaving behind generational damage and devastation to countless communities, farmers, families, you and your family make sure each of those Georgia's new they were not alone. Thank you. Thank you to your family. I can't thank you enough for the impact you, Marty and the girls have had on our communities as they face some of their darkest hours. I was there and I saw it. It made a difference. But you've also led our state doing its heights of achievement. Even invited opportunities for job creators and employees to put down their roots here in our state. Lead in our state, Georgia, to historic economic success and growth. We've been able to us to work alongside you, deliver over $9 billion in tax relief for hard working Georgians. I want to applaud you for that. Now, whether that relief came as rate reductions, tax returns or your suspension of the gas tax at appropriate times, you've increased access to educational opportunities, employment and health care all over the state. You've invested in public safety, keeping our communities in our citizens safe and secure. Most of all, you've done what's best for the great state of Georgia every step of the way. And I know this session will be no different. Jesus my distinct honor and privilege to welcome the very best governor in the Union, the third governor of this great state, Brian P. Kemp. Thank you all so much. Thank you very much. Thank you all so much. Thank you Speaker Burns. Thank you for those kind words. I'll tell you all what I just told Speaker Burns and Lieutenant Governor Jones has been an honor serving with you. Lieutenant Governor Jones. Speaker Burns, President Pro Tem Walker, Speaker Pro Tem Jones, Members of the General Assembly, my fellow constitutional officers, Mayor Dickens, Members of the Judiciary, Members of the Constable Corps and my fellow Georgians. As we begin a new year, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of our state and its people. Many taxes on hard work in Jordan are low and go and lower. Our rainy day fund is at a record high. Our schools are fully funded. Our infrastructures receiving historic investments and our state law enforcement and educators are paid more today than they were seven years ago. Our communities are safer. Unemployment is low. More new private sector jobs are being created every day and businesses around the country and the world know Georgia is the place to be. Our ports are busy and growing. Our kids have some of the finest technical colleges and universities in the country to choose from and our economy is diverse and built to last. Again, opportunity, hard work and a fair shot at the American Dream have a home in the great state of Georgia. There is no question the state of our state is stronger, more prosperous and safer today than it was in January of 2019. Thank you all. But also I want to be clear, this success, this good news isn't guaranteed. It doesn't happen by default or accident. There's more work to be done and more wood to chop to make sure Georgia continues to be the best place to live, work and raise a family for generations to come. I believe that starts with continuing to address hard work and Georgia's concerns over the persistently high cost of living in everyday necessities. Since 2021 working together with this General Assembly we have provided one time tax relief to the tune of over $3.2 billion. 3 tax relief, nearly 1 billion, over 2.2 billion in motor fuel tax suspensions and a permanent income tax savings of nearly $3.4 billion. That's almost $9.7 billion that have helped hard work in Georgia and fight through the record high inflation forced upon all of us by the previous administration in D.C. and a Congress that couldn't put down the nation's credit card. These are historic investments in families. Recent college graduates looking to start a career. Our seniors on fixed income and single parents just trying to make ends meet. But these investments were possible because we rejected the idea that just because government takes in more money, it shouldn't turn right around and spend it on more government. California may think that way. New York may think that way. But in Georgia we do things differently. We keep your tax burden low. We budget conservatively and responsibly. And we ensure that state government is efficient with the dollars that you trust us with. At the end of the day, if we have more than we need, we give it back to the people who actually earned it. As Marty, the girls in our tribal all across our state, we hear from Georgians in all walks of life. Hard work in people trying to put food on the table for themselves and their families. And the reality is that too many of our citizens are still struggling to make ends meet each and every day because costs are still too high. Groceries, rent, insurance, clothes for the kids, it all adds up to more than it used to. That's why my budget proposal will include a fourth, one-time, one-billion-dollar tax rebate this year that will return or save the average file or $250 and a married couple up to 500. With this rebate, my administration and this General Assembly will have returned over $7.5 billion in surplus revenue to the taxpayers of our state over the last four years. We also know that one-time relief is a short-term solution that recognizes the state has collected more of your tax dollars than it needs to fund our priorities and save for whatever the future may bring. We must continue doing everything in our power to allow the hard work in men of our state to keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket in the years to come. Because as I've said before, that's your money, not the governments. That's why my administration will also be proposing a further 20 basis point reduction in our state's personal and corporate income tax rate, bringing it down to just 4.99%. This will fulfill a promise to the people of the state that I made during my re-election campaign to lower our state income tax rate to under 5%. And with the General Assembly's passage in my signature, it will come a full three years ahead of schedule. This tax cut doesn't promise to pay for itself years down the road or create future budget holes with today's one-time money. Our plan fulfills my promise to the voters of this state in a responsible way. And most importantly, this plan puts all the hard-working people of our state first. The reason that we've been able to do this and through it three years ahead of schedule is because of our fiscal discipline. It's also worth noting a few other important accomplishments that the last few years may not have made headlines or pleased some of those that constantly advocate for bigger government. Even with the rebate and tax cuts that my office will propose this legislative session, our state's rainy day fund and strategic reserves will still stand at over $10 billion. These reserves are four-time higher than any administration will lead behind in our history and enough to run state government for three full months. But also want to provide a word of caution for the future. It's not a question if hard times will hit our state again. It is simply a question of when. When governors Purdue and Dill were fighting long sides members of the General Assembly to pull our state through the great recession, billions more in state reserves would have been a critical lifeline as Georgia families, our state and our country were experiencing incredible economic hardship. But as good leaders do, both governors made tough choices and tough times to make sure our state weathered the storm. And they both, along with the members of this legislature who serve with them, deserve our thanks and gratitude for their leadership. Fast forward to today and Georgia stands in a historic position to confidently face whatever the future may bring. Showing fiscal restraint and continuing to build on these reserves instead of spending it all in the future may not be popular or easy. But the Georgia of today that has been built over the last 25 years does not stand on sticks made of easy or politically convenient. The Georgia of today stands on a firm foundation. A foundation built on the character of our people, the resolve of leaders both past and present and by the grace of our creator. So when the storms of tomorrow come, it is my hope that we will share in a commitment to keeping the state we all love on that firm foundation. Our state reserves are just one area that we have made historic strides in to set Georgia up for future success and prosperity. From the 2024 budget through the proposed amended 26 budget, $4.1 billion in capital projects have been funded through cash instead of debt. This strategic investment will save Georgia taxpayers and future state appropriators $3.3 billion in interest payments over the next 20 years. The cash funding of capital projects we began in fiscal year 2024 has allowed us to reduce outstanding debt by over 20 percent in just three years. And the ratio of our state's debt service to revenues is just 3 percent. The lowest since the state began issuing debt bonds in the 1970s. These savings were all made while implementing historic tax cuts.

$10 in water, sewer, and transportation projects across the state. Refusing to grow government budgeting conservatively and paying off debt aren't flashy. They don't get you on the cable news, make you famous on social media, or fit on a bumper sticker. And that might be the reason Washington has been so allergic to them. But I learned a long time ago building houses that it's better to be a workhorse than a showhorse. Because workhorse's deliver results ahead of schedule under budget and do right by the customer. And that's exactly what we have been doing together for the people of our state. Another key investment this General Assembly in my administration has made is in our state's workforce. During my administration, we have reduced our state employee turnover rate by over 25%. All while keeping the size of our full-time state workforce at 2019 levels. We've invested in a vital workforce, saved taxpayer dollars in training and equipping new employees, and utilized innovative and innovation and technology to better deliver state services. Our state employees have done an incredible job in unprecedented times. And are one of the driving forces behind Georgia's success. That is why today I'm proposing a one-time $2,000 pace supplement for all state employees, including our educators and state public safety officers. This is just another reminder on top of the pay raises and supplements we have provided in years past. These important investments, tax cuts, rebates, and record state reserves would not be possible without the drive and hard work. A million of Georgia's who get up every day and do the best they can to provide for their set themselves and their families. They go to work, chasing the American dream, hoping to earn a honest living and leave their kids and their grandkids better than they had it. That's the American spirit. That's the spirit of what it means to be a Georgia. When I launched my campaign for Governor, it was about promising those hard work and Georgians that I would fight for them every day, whether they voted for me or not, regardless of their neighborhood or their zip code. Republican or Democrat or something in between, my goal was to make a positive difference in their lives. As a small business owner and a construction guy, I believe so much good can come from an honest day's work at a job that pays a good wage. I believe in what that job can do not only for that employee but also for their family and that community. That's why my administration from day one has prioritized economic development, job creation, and bringing investment to all four corners of our state. Over the last seven years, Georgia has seen over 219,700 new jobs in more than $118 billion in investment from projects work by the state economic development team. 64% of those jobs in 75% of those investment dollars are going to communities outside the Metro Atlanta region. Since 2019, we've welcomed the three largest economic development projects in state history. In continued Georgia's streak is the number one state for business for an unprecedented 12 years in a row. But here in the best state for business, we don't just welcome big companies. We also champion small businesses that have a big impact on local communities. A great example of that is La Regina, an Italian food production company with a facility in Alma, Georgia that employs 110 hard work in men and women. This facility also happens to be a former bakery that went out of business years ago. To that community of less than 4,000 people, the loss of an employer like that can be devastating. But because we prioritize economic development in rural Georgia, La Regina came in and revitalized that facility and created 110 jobs that are making a real and lasting difference with more on the way. The impact of this small business extends far beyond Alma's borders. In addition to moving plenty of goods through the ports of Savannah, La Regina also purchases local produce from over 100 Georgia farmers. Including more than 40,000 pounds of onions per week. With touch points throughout that region of our state, that one small employer produced a record 25 million jars of pasta sauce last year alone. When Marty and I went to Southern Italy in 2024, we visited the headquarters of this family owned and operated business. We talked to the men and women who had preserved their family's recipes for over 100 years. And we saw how similar their values were to the very family owned farms and businesses here in Georgia that La Regina supports. That company, a full ocean away from our state, has the same values that we do. Family, community and a strong belief in a hard day's work. Today we're joined by two La Regina company leaders who represent how small town Georgia and international markets truly connect all to the benefit of our workers. In the gallery as a mediae Renaldi, chief operating officer of La Regina who has moved his entire family to our great state. He is joined by Jerry Lady, the plant manager and employee one for La Regina at Georgia's facility. You'll be glad to know that Jerry was the former bakery manager for the company that closed down. Well both of you please stand and let us thank you for your investment in our state. Thank you. Whether the size of the Hyundai Meta Plant or La Regina food processing center, each project, each facility, job or investment represents a general generational opportunity for a Georgia family in their community. In one of the biggest reasons these job creators of all sizes choose Georgia is our highly skilled and reliable workforce. Over the last seven years we put more money toward education and workforce training programs than ever before in the history of our state. In fact as of this current fiscal year we have not only fully funded QBE seven times but added $368 million to programs and initiatives that directly prepare workers for good jobs. We've also set new precedents when it comes to school safety. Starting with the first year of my administration we began with three campus security grants totaling $184.5 million. And then added $109 million into the base budget so every school system can plan for how to best keep our classrooms and all of the children in them safe. We will again fulfill that commitment in this year's budget bringing the total amount that we have allocated to school safety during my time in office to over $511 million. Thank you all. Thank you all. I also want to take a moment to also congratulate and thank the members of this body both past and present who joined my administration and achieving something that not many people thought was possible when I was sworn in as a governor seven years ago. In fact when I pledged in 2018 to raise T-shirt paid by $5,000 I remember a former opponent of mine claiming I was making false promises to our educators across the state. Well in a way the media and the doubters were right. We didn't raise T-shirt paid by $5,000 we raised it by $9,500. This historic investment in our educators increased the starting salary for a Georgia teacher by almost 28%. And you don't have to get an A in math to know that that's an impressive jump. Let's again take a moment to thank all of the hard work and Georgians who lead our classrooms, pour into our students and help keep and make our state a better place. Thank you all. In addition to K through 12 we've also made historic investments in our post-secondary education institutions and programs. We have worked together to return the hope scholarship to 100% of its promise. All while the border reasons has held tuition cost and check across the system so greater opportunity in Georgia can remain affordable. Contrast that with other states that have again and again raised cost of higher education. All while inflation reached 40 years highs under the prior administration. The University of California for instance raised tuition by roughly 19% between 2019 and the current academic year. But here in Georgia tuition is increased by just 5% in that same period. And your partnership in eliminating the special institution fee helped us lessen the impact on those increases on hard work and families and students. In fact data from the National Center for Educational Statistics shows that Georgia is one of the top states in the country for four year public university affordability. All while we've kept the cost of higher education and check in college within the reach of Georgia families. We've also invested more in post-secondary education than ever before. We're now putting two billion additional dollars toward higher education in Georgia than when I first took office. That includes $40.7 million in this year's budget proposal, a loan for healthcare education facilities and medical workforce training programs. And since I first took office we spent over $26 million for medical residency slots in our state adding 897 positions for a grand total of 2,523 residency slots as of this fiscal year. This year my budget proposal adds another $2.1 million to further this upward trend in such a critical workforce need. Along with these unprecedented investments Georgia is truly the national leader in merit based aid for higher education between the hope scholarship and grant programs. But in this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating from high school. We also recognize the advantage that need based financial assistance can give to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education. Like there appears who have the means to attend college. These students have great dreams for rewarding careers and impactful lives. But they don't always have hope that those dreams can become a reality. Dreams without the benefit of hope remain dreams deferred perhaps for entire generations. How much richer would the lives of those and their families be if they could attain the type of education that leads to a high paying job with great benefits? And how much would communities across our state benefit from these young people getting a degree that opens their door or starts a rewarding career? I believe we owe it to every child to ensure they start out on a level playing field no matter their zip code. Therefore my amended budget proposal invests $325 million in the university system of Georgia's dream scholarship program. The first need based scholarship of its kind in Georgia history. In future years this one time endowment will create opportunities for generational economic advancement for thousands of students. And down the road it will allow them to complete college and begin meaningful careers without the burden of crippling debt. The dream scholarship will build on the incredible unmatched legacy of the hope scholarship and leave no stone unturned when it comes to student achievement in our state. From now on throughout the country Americans will know that hopes and dreams are alive right here in the great state of Georgia. This unprecedented initiative, sorry, this unprecedented initiative will also compensate for the lack of education. And just the first two years of match we've seen a 5.9% rise in USG enrollment and a 7.1% increase in TCSG enrollment. Meanwhile other states around the country have seen decreases in public university enrollment and 17 states are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Not only is Georgia's work for strong and growing, we continue to outpace our competitors for at least another generation in this regard. When you consider all of these measures together it's clear to see that our commitment to those just beginning their careers in Georgia is unwavering. But so too is our commitment to those preparing to finish their careers, a valued service to the people of our state. I'm talking about the men and women who face danger on a regular basis to protect our communities. Marty the girls and I feel the weight and value of their service and sacrifices on a very real and personal level. We have seen firsthand the uncommon bravery they embody and we had mourned with their families when their services come to a tragic end. We have been reminded of countless times of just how exceptional they are for answering the call to serve. When law enforcement are under siege more than ever before. That is why today I'm proposing an enhanced retirement plan for state law enforcement officers. Under this. Under this new model the state would provide a higher match to the 401k savings accounts of eligible public safety officers through a steeper contribution schedule. Not only will the states match increase at a higher rate but will also raise the maximum percentage cap from 9% under the current plan to 15. By year 10 of an officer service to the state three full years before they would reach the contribution cap under the current plan they will already have obtained the new maximum match of 15%. When you contrast that to the current system we're effectively doubling the state's contribution for state law enforcement. I believe this is well deserved given the dangers that they face in today's world. But this new model will also help us better recruit and retain brave and capable public safety officers and will put Georgia's law enforcement retirement plan well ahead of other states. Those who are opposed certified who run toward danger who help shield even the people who try to vilify them deserve a safe and assured retirement and we are going to give it to them. Our. Our commitment to law enforcement in Georgia is only matched by our unrelenting determination to go after those who operate in the evil industry of human trafficking. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the best First Lady in the country and members of the Grace Commission who are champions in this fight. You have overwhelmingly passed ten pieces of legislation that make Georgia a safe haven for victims and a hostile place for traffickers. Those measures include the launch of the human trafficking prosecution unit within the Attorney General Chris Carr's office. Since this creation in 2019 that unit has secured more than 70 convictions and rescued and assisted over 200 children. With your help in the legislature we have also expanded this unit with two new regional offices through the funding and amended 25 and 2026 budgets. I know that our First Lady would want me to take this opportunity to thank you all for your continued support in this fight over the years. Whether through legislation or budgetary actions while we have made incredible strides in this area and while Georgia is now the undisputed national leader in anti-human trafficking policy we all know this fight is not over. That's why my team will introduce an 11th Bill in the coming days that will further protect our children, expose abusers and save lives by preventing the silence imposed on far too many victims. Modeled after trade law passed in other states it will be just the latest reminder that no child should be a victim of such an evil act. As a mother of three beautiful daughters and as someone who spent time as an assistant pre-K teacher and a middle school substitute teacher. As an unwavering supporter of those in our state's foster care system and as a First Lady who never fails to have a smile and a hug for the children she meets throughout Georgia. Marty has truly been the perfect person to leave this cause to make sure Georgia's sons and daughters are safe. Her grace under fire along with the work of those who have been in the trenches on this issue for decades created a turning point in this state when it comes to identifying and stopping this crime that affects every county yet hides in plain sight. Through our work here though I'm sorry though our work here is now in spinal year. The impact of her human trafficking efforts and that of so many others in this room and beyond will be felt for whole generations. Will you join me in thanking her and all of us all of them have been in that fight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You all didn't let me get out the part about thanking those that have been in the trenches on this issue for so long. Marty and I are so appreciative of all those people that are out there every single day that we never get to see fighting this good fight. So thank you for recognizing them all. This is we have made historic progress in fighting human trafficking. We've also made monumental strides in going after violent gangs. If you recall just a few short years ago members of the Atlanta media didn't think our state faced a gang problem. They weren't listening to the sheriffs and the prosecutors who were witnessing firsthand the rise of gang related violent crime in their local communities. But the members of this body in my administration were in 2019 my office worked with many of you to stand up and fund the anti gang task force within the GBI. And then later the gang prosecution unit within the attorney general's office. Since then the GBI has invested to get it over 1800 gang related cases and arrested close to 2500 offenders with gang affiliation. They've also seized over $95 million in drugs and illegal items associated with those crimes. That's $95 million worth of illegal substances and dangerous weapons that are not in our schools, own our streets or threatening our neighborhoods. Complimenting the GBI's good work the attorney general's gang prosecution unit has also investigated and prosecuted cases in 19 counties securing over 120 convictions across the state. We're also taking the fight to gang members and other dangerous criminals on the very streets where they operate through the crime suppression unit now in its fifth year. With the combined resources and personnel of multiple state public safety agencies partnering with local law enforcement the CSU has found and arrested 1340 wounded persons. Help take dangerous drugs off our streets by arresting 557 traffickers and carriers recovered 1179 stolen vehicles and apprehended 49 murder suspects. Here is a news flash to those who try to demonize our law enforcement. This is what happens when you simply let them do their job. I see chief share bomb up in the gallery with the mayor. He has been a great partner in this effort. Thank you, chief. I again want to thank the men and women working in these units for their dedication to keeping our families and our community safe. As you all know, this is my final time speaking to you in the state of the state address as your governor. Some of you may be more happy about that than others. But I hope you know that it has been an incredible honor for Marty the girls and me to serve as your first family. We have done this together every step of the way and I'd like to take a moment and ask if you join me again and recognize and marty the girls for their service over the last seven years. I love y'all. Thankfully, the girls look like the mother. I'd also like to thank my mom, my sister, Julie and her family here also here with us today. I know speaker Burns recognize you early, but love you all. Thank you for your support. Today, I've talked a lot about past accomplishments and some very important issues that I believe we must address in our final legislative session serving together. Don't be fooled. There's more work to be done over the next 37 legislative days. And for those of you who may think I'm a lame dub, just remember I have a big red pen. But in all seriousness.

I was just thinking about what to say to my last captored legislative audience. And I was reminded of an old hymn written in 1924 called Little Much, Little is Much when God is in it. The first and second verse say the following. In the harvest field now ripen, there is a work for all to do. Mark the master's voice is calling to harvest calling you. Does the place your call to labor seem so small and little known? Well it is great if God is in it and he will not forsake his own. In God's word we have so many examples of little acts of faith reaping more than one could imagine. Often done by people of lesser means or lower standing in society, but filled with God's power and guided by His design. My family service to this state will be a small footnote in the history books. Your service under the gold dome will likely be the same. When compared to the heroes of our faith or everyday actions of so many heroes across our state, our service pales in comparison. Our goal as elected leaders was to do the best we could for the people who sent us here to serve in this building. We work together to make our community safer. Their dreams more achievable, their lives more prosperous in their future, a little brighter. When I put my hand on the Bible that Marty was holding in January of 2019, I didn't know what choices we would face. I didn't know what challenges would come. And while the last seven years have seemed so big in our lives, the many decisions in the outcomes, the truth is that the budgets, the new laws, pandemics, elections, legislative debates, political arguments, at the end of the day, they're small. They're small and compared to the plan of the master builder, our creator. But my hope, my prayer, is that God would be in those small things for our service together. Because I believe he can take whatever we have done and help build on it for the people of our state and make it great. The last verse and chorus of that hymn I mentioned says this, and when the conflict here has ended and our race on earth has run, he will say, if you've been faithful, welcome home my child well done. Little is much when God is in it. Labor not for wealth or fame. It's a crown and you can win it if you go in Jesus name. Let's go finish the race. Like Nehemiah said, let's finish the great work we started. Thank you all. It has been an honor. May God bless you and God continue to bless the great state of Georgia. Governor, you nailed it. I think I can speak for every individual in this gathering. You don't know how much we appreciate your friendship, your leadership, or the people of Georgia. You made our futures brighter and fulfilling in so many different ways. Along with the marvelous first lady, we appreciate you and we look forward to continuing this year on a strong note. And certainly, he said you may not be remembered in history, I think you will. And we're going to help tell Destro. Thank you all. It is a great day to be a Georgia, isn't it? We'll go down about that. Will the Committee of Escort please escort the honorable Ryan Peak Camp, Governor of the great state of Georgia and his distinguished guests from this House Chamber.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today we honor the life and legacy of a great more house man and resident of District 56, the Reverend Doctor Martin King Jr. Who understood best that to do justice means to love your fellow man. It means recognizing that our destinies are tied together. That injustice anywhere truly is a threat to justice everywhere. He taught us that justice is not abstract. It is lived out in our laws, our budgets and the choices we make when no one is watching. To love mercy as our King showed us is to see the humanity in those society too often cast aside. It is to meet punishment with rehabilitation, poverty with opportunity, and indifference with compassion. Mercy does not mean the absence of accountability. It means understanding that every person is worthy of dignity and a chance to be made whole. And to walk humbly with your God is to remember that leadership is not about power but about service. Dr. King walked humbly even as he shook foundations of this very nation. He did not seek applause or comfort. He sought righteousness. He reminded us that the moral progress requires courage and that silence in the face of injustice is itself a choice. As lawmakers we sit in the seats of immense responsibility. The bills we pass and the votes we cast shape the lives of families we may never meet. On this day, Dr. King is not about quoting his words, it is about continuing his work. So my charge to his body is simple on this weekend that we celebrate him. Let us legislate with justice as our guide, mercy as our posture, and humility as our compass. Let us ensure that he will laws this state been not towards convenience but towards justice. And that is how we honor Dr. King. Not just today but every day we are entrusted with the power to serve. Let us take a moment to silence our own and the life and legacy of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Mary and friends for honoring Dr. King, a great legacy. There she is. Representative Sandra Scott is recognized for the only son up with this, this is pretty important. That's right.
