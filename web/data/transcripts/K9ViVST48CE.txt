We will begin our day with Scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 179th House District, the chairman of the Committee on Information and Audits, chairman Don Hogan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, it's a delight for me to introduce a good friend of mine, April Latin Reed. She's from Brunswick, Georgia, and she is a pastor at the Harper Chapel United Methodist Church in Baxley, Georgia. So she serves as boarded director for the Coastal Georgia Area Community Action Authority, a founding trustee for the College of Coastal Georgia and as a member of the Brunswick Chapel of Lynx. She has received numerous awards for her service to the community. Her ministry is to go with a simple, it's to demonstrate the love of Jesus Christ. She currently serves as chief manager of the administration of the Department of Justice, United States Marshal Service at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick where she has oversight of financial procurement and administrative operations. Avery is married to Bay Reed with 34 years. They have four children and daughters and justine her youngest daughters here with her today. So no father do I introduce the chapter about today. Good morning everyone. I'd like to thank Speaker Ralston for his hospitality and invitation to stand before you this great assembly this morning. It is an honor and a privilege. I also want to thank my good friend representative Don Hogan who has served the 179th district with honor, distinction and integrity. I have found him to be a man of courage, a man of deep abiding faith and love for his neighbor. I give you greetings from Harper's Chapel United Methodist Church where I have the honor and the privilege to serve as his pastor. We're in the Lenten season and as we reflect on the tenets of our faith, it is appropriate for us to meditate on God's goodness and be reminded of God's great love and grace that he has bestowed upon us each and every day. As I was preparing to travel to Atlanta to be here with you this morning, I thought about the many symbols and the commodities of our great state of Georgia. I thought about the symbols from the farmland and our coastal land, the golden owls, all the way up to the Blue Ridge Mountains. I also thought about the hopes, the symbols of our faith and prosperity for this great state and the present-day innovation whereby Georgia is recognized as a leader. One of my favorite personal commodities of our state is that of resiliency. When we think about what all we have experienced in the last 18 months from COVID, from everything that you all get to medlege slate from the marketplace to the things that God trust me at his house of worship, we've been through a lot. But yet God's grace has been there for us, amen? When I think about all of the symbols, regardless of your favorite symbol or your favorite hope or even your favorite innovation that you have championed, all of us have been uniquely knitted together. And the message I believe God would give me to give you this morning is based on an old familiar hymn. Blessed be the tie that binds. Blessed be the tie that binds our hearts and Christian love. The fellowship of Kendrick Mines is like that above. This first stands of this old hymn was authored in 1772. And like every good song or hymn, there is a backstory. The backstory to this hymn is that there was an old preacher who was torn between personal ambition and a sacred truss he had in his heart to serve God. When you think about that hymn, regardless of your affiliation with your church or your faith, all of us have some symbol, some hope, some love that ties us together. This preacher's song and this hymn reminds you and I of the power of love. This hymn is about Christian love that binds us together. The work that each and every one of you do is tying Georgia together. Each of you bring your best wisdom, your faith and your love for this great state to this great hall and regardless of your county that you represent and the needs of those county and above all the symbols and the commodities that we champion, the hopes that we hold and even the innovation that we introduce, love is our greatest asset. Love must be your collective motivator because it is the tie that binds us together. When we look at the Holy Scriptures, Paul writes in Colossians chapter 3 verses 13 through 15, bear with each other and forgive one another. If any of you have agreements against someone, forgive as the Lord has forgave you and all of all of these virtues put on love which binds and ties everything perfectly together. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts and since as members of one body, you were called to peace and be thankful. Blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love. The fellowship of Kendrick minds is like that from above. Please pray with me. Father God in the name of Jesus as we stand before your throne of grace and mercy this morning, we invite your Holy Spirit to come and breathe upon us. Breathe upon our lives, our hearts, our wills, Lord God and yes even our ambition. We ask in your Holy Word and name Lord that your Word, your will be above our own. Help us as the great state of Georgia to continue to not only execute wisdom, justice and moderation but to be reminded Lord God that we are our neighbor and our brothers keeper. And whatever symbol, whatever commodity, whatever hope, whatever aspiration we bring to the table, help us to remember and recall that without love we will not be able to do any of it. For Father you are love and I ask also in your name that you continue to bless every representative for whatever county they come from and whatever their needs may be Lord God like that old preacher that reminded us. Let's be the tie that bind. Help us Lord God to be thankful and remember our own tie to your heart and to your Word. Father we ask as we go forth this day that you continue to help us to reflect and remember the Lenten season is designed to not only for us to reflect and search our own hearts but that we refine ourselves continually tied to you. This in your Holy name I pray. Amen. Please join me in the pledge allegiance. A pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

There's not everybody's going to get reached today. Second rule is that we're going to limit remarks to one minute. And we'll see what we can get done. Chair recognizes Chairman Jay Collins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I rise to recognize the Georgia Department of Public Safety. The 85th anniversary will be observed tomorrow, March 9, 1937. The Georgia Department of Public Safety includes the Georgia State Patrol, the Motor Carole Compliance Division, along with the Capitol Police. Their core values are represented each and every day when they put on their badge and try to protect and serve this great state, trust, fortitude, professionalism, and compassion. Thank you to the Georgia Department of Public Safety for all you do to keep us safe here at the Capitol and for keeping our state safe and our constituents back home. Thank you. Chair recognizes the make and be of delegation. I'm going to let y'all decide who it is. OK, Dale. I don't know where Robert Dickey is, but anyway, Representative Dickey. Everyone, we just want to let you all know that today is the first day of our annual Cherry Blossom Festival. It is a beautiful thing for you all to come and visit making, just to see it. We're touted as the prettiest and the pinkest party on Earth. This is our 40th year of the Cherry Blossom Festival. So all others that you see are copycats. Need to come down to the original. It is a 10-day event. The ball starts tonight. I think it sold out, but you should come down. It's balloon rides, all kinds of festivities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Representative Anderson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I stand this morning to ask you to support the taxpayers of Georgia. In the heat of the pandemic, our Department of Labor issued pandemic unemployment assistance payments to many of our constituents on behalf of the federal government. Last spring, some of these recipients received letters from the Department of Labor informing them that they may have qualified, may it may not have qualified for those payments and demanding they return to funds. The amounts ranged typically from around $6,000 to $12,000. There was an appeal process offered, and everyone I've spoken with filed appeals. As of today, I have yet to hear of any of these appeals being resolved. This past weekend, I received emails and phone calls from some of my constituents stating that their state income tax refunds were being garnished without due process. I've drafted a letter to Commissioner Butler that I will have on my desk over here to my right for anyone who wishes to sign. The letter simply states, I and my colleagues from the Georgia House of Representatives formally request that the Department immediately cease garnishing funds from Georgians with ongoing appeals until a final resolution is attuticated. Further, that any garnished funds be refunded immediately until each individual appeal has a final ruling. Thank you. Chair recognizes Chairman Cooper for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I wanted to make you aware that this is brain awareness week, a global education initiative to help raise awareness about research and advancement into treatment, prevention, and cures for brain disorders, including strokes. Thanks to medical advancement, there is now a minimally invasive way to remove the clots that, you know, I brought off the blood flow in stroke victims, but we need to get a system in our state that makes sure that we get victims of stroke to level one trauma centers as soon as possible. So our courage, our health officials to explore ways of improving how we try to triage and transport stroke victims to our level one centers, but also commend those of our first responders for all they're doing for their tireless effort to save patients across our state. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes Chairman Carpenter for a morning order. Thank you, Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I'm here today to celebrate film day at the Capitol. We have placed on your desk a book that illustrates the film industry's impacts on all areas of the state. Usually lost in this conversation about film in Georgia is the direct and indirect benefit that this industry provides to hundreds of Georgia businesses and thousands of employees. So flip through the pages and hopefully you will open your eyes to the impact of film throughout our great state. HR 1038 honors the businesses and celebrates Georgia's commitment to building the complete ecosystem of film. I look forward to offseason conversations about bringing distribution companies to the state of Georgia so we can continue our investment. Thank you, and I yield the well. Chair recognizes representative Alec Zander for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we have Douglas County Day at the Capitol. We have about 40 members here with the Chamber. We also had Elena Myers, the Olympic gold medalist, here earlier, and Douglas County was featured in this issue which is the most current one. So there are tons of our leadership, elected officials, the mayor, the economic development, our city mayor, and our county commissioner in this issue around magazine. So thank you guys. We appreciate it. Read about Douglas County. Chair recognizes representative Lebritt for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I just wanted to add my voice to those of us who've come down and boasted on our hometown teams, the Elbert County Lady Blue Devils earlier this month, the one the state AA Championship of Girls, basketball, coach Josh Jones and his staff did a great job. It was a historic year for the Lady Blue Devils. The first state championship in school history, they broke all sorts of records. It's a wonderful, really hardworking, dedicated team. I just wanted to shout out to them today. So join me in congratulating the Lady Blue Devils. So, Chair recognizes representative Seba for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I rise today to recognize the Pike Alpha for Turnity, Edith Sigma Chapter at the University of West Georgia. The Pike Alpha for Turnity was founded at the University of Virginia in 1868 and has grown to become an international brotherhood composed of more than 300,000 members, 220 chapters and 150 alumni associations. This week in my alma mater, Edith Sigma Chapter, will gather to tell tales of years gone by. And remember the days at long hair and flat bellies. And while we may look mature and be present with our wives, children and grandchildren, I know we will be teleported back to that day when we had no idea what our contributions to society would be. Indeed, and our parents may have wondered where they went wrong. I submit to you today that Pike Alpha for Turnity members have excelled in all facets of life and have become significant professional business men, true assets in their local communities, and men donating significant time, treasure and talent in service to organizations all over the world. Well, is it not true, Mr. Speaker, we're going to end with this? That if there is any beer left in the thriving college town in Carrollton, Georgia after St. Paddy's Day, on Saturday night, some old friends offered and referred to his pikes were partaking a cold mug of beer and toast to our brotherhood in lasting friendships. And remember those that are no longer with us. Colleagues, please join me in congratulating Pike Alpha's Edith Sigma Chapter on 50 years of service in Georgia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Chair recognizes representatives McCloud, Davis and Carter for a morning order. Good morning, members. Good morning.

And happy belated birthday, Speaker Rosten. We send you PICY season. Our time for morning orders has expired. If you, we had some members that were not reached. And if you want to get up here and sign up now for Monday, you know, you're free to do that. We're going on now to the rules calendar. Going on to the rules calendar. Chair recognizes, or Chair would ask the clerk to read the caption to House Resolution 467. House Resolution 467, my friends, on a green in the 151st and others, urging the Georgia Department of Transportation to study the potential costs and benefits of extending interstate, I-85 and extending and expanding Georgia 300. This resolution have been referred to the Committee on Transportation that Committee recommends that this resolution be adopted. Chair recognizes Chairman Gerald Green to present the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. I bring for your consideration this morning, House Resolution 467. But before I do that, I want to thank the Chairman, Chairman Jasper's and the Transportation Committee for doing this and bringing it out. And what I have before you this morning is a urgent resolution that is directed to our Department of Transportation and is a proactive approach to address problem areas which are interstate 185, extending to Highway 27 and Georgia 300. These highways could benefit from improvements, and especially as an economic tool in Southwest Georgia. We need this study, and we are looking to study the potential cost and benefits of extending interstate 185 and expanding Georgia 300. Mr. Speaker, that's the essence of this urgent resolution and to the members I ask for your favorable consideration on HR 467 and remember this is Friday. Mr. Speaker, that's the essence. We're here, we remembered. You have a question, I think, if you care to yield. Yes, sir. Believe it or not, Chair recognizes Representative Brad Thomas to your right for a question. Do you yield? Yes, sir, to my friend. Is it not true that this route will allow people to bypass the state of Alabama to get down to the Gulf Coast? Amen. You said it correctly. Do you further yield? Yes. Is it true that I'm tired of paying speed and tickets to the state of Alabama? You have a lot of them on the stand. Thank you, and thank you for bringing this bill. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the adoption of House Resolution 467. The eyes are 129. The nails are zero. This resolution, having received the requisite constitutional majority, is therefore adopted. Clerk will read the caption to House Resolution 650. House Resolution 650, by the rubbed on Gamble, the 15th and others, creating the House Study Committee on Literacy Instruction. This resolution, having referred to the Committee on Education, that committee recommends that this resolution be adopted by Committee Substitute. Chair recognizes Representative Gamble to speak to the resolution. Good morning, colleagues. Happy Friday. I know we're all glad to be here today. I rise today to ask for your support for House Resolution 650, which establishes the House Study Committee on Literacy Instruction. Let me say that first and foremost, I am grateful to my first grade teacher, Ms. Sharon Vossberg, who taught me to read, Ms. Vossberg retired from the Cardiff's Will City School System, and she taught many generations of students to read during her long and distinguished career. We all know the devastating impact that illiteracy can have on students. You have all heard the statistics of what happens when a student is not reading on grade level by the third grade. Last September, Representative Evans and I attended a Science for Georgia Meeting, where literacy was determined to be their number one priority for helping students prepare for science education. Now, imagine that. The science educators aren't working on science education. They're wanting to work on reading and helping students be able to read. We've worked closely with Dr. Amy Sharma with Science for Georgia, Tina Ingbert with Decoding, Dyslexia, Jessica Walgian with Gears, Niel Do Delph with Literacy for All, and Nicole Vella with the Reading League of Georgia. But most importantly, we've had a powerful advocate with Malcolm Mitchell in his organization, which is Share the Magic Foundation. They are all asking that we take a close look at how we're teaching young people in our state to read. We're doing some wonderful things, so I don't want anybody to leave here and think that there aren't great things going on. We all know that we could do it a little bit better, and so that's the purpose of this literacy task force that's outlined in House Resolution. I know there's another speaker, Representative Evans, that signed up to speak, and so with that, I'm going to yield the well and allow her that opportunity. The chair allows the opportunity. But that was nice of him wasn't. We do have another member that wishes to be heard. The chair recognizes Representative Becky Evans to speak to the resolution. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you so much, Rep Gamble. It's been such a pleasure working with you. Thank you so much for sponsoring this bill. And colleagues, I stand in strong and enthusiastic support today for House Resolution 650, the Literacy Instruction Study Committee. And I want to also thank Dr. Amy Sharma, who Representative Gamble talked about the Executive Director of Science for Georgia, because she drafted a lot of this resolution for us. So I don't know about all of you, but I was thinking back to my childhood, and when I learned to read, and thinking about my first grade teacher taught me how to read, and of all the, and of how important it was a huge part of my life. A little bookworm, but I remember reading took me on adventures beyond my neighborhood, and really opened up my dreams and imaginations, and helped me to empathize with others that are different from me. And tragically, we do have a situation here in Georgia. It really is a national problem, where only a third of our students can read proficiently by the end of third grade. It's like, it's you can't believe it when you hear it. It's like so terrible. And I remember being in the Education Committee in 2019, when I was first elected in Georgia Partnership on Excellence in Education, I talked to us about this statistic, and I was horrified. And we did make some steps in improvement with our dyslexia, our bill, you know, screening for dyslexia, and I'm very grateful that the Chamber took those actions. I also remember when Representative Kenner had his bill to make kindergarten mandatory, which unfortunately in Georgia is still not mandatory, but we did have a great speaker, Comer Yates, of Atlanta speech school talking about how critical literacy is. And so this has been something I've been, I'm very proud of the work that Representative Gamble has done, and that Dr. Sharma has done, and I'm very excited about the study committee. And just as a reminder, I do want you to know that we do have all the tools for all of our kids to be literate, and we can identify, uplift, support, and expand the many programs that are already working on this. And reading proficiently by the end of third grade has been listed to a host of outcomes, students who cannot read proficiently at third grade are four times more likely than their proficient counterparts to drop out of high school, and more likely to experience long term behavioral and mental health outcomes. So this means that kids that aren't reading proficiently are more likely to end up in jail, or in low-age jobs, and propagate a negative cycle into the next generation. Okay, I'm going to study it. All right, I'm going to skip over all my good stuff. I have lots of good stuff here on evidence-based literacy. I'll go ahead and skip over that. I do want to say that there are a lot of wonderful organizations in Georgia already studying this, and this study committee will bring them together, and I will conclude. Yes! Okay, but we won't have a 21st century workforce without literate citizens, and we do have the tools for all of our Georgia citizens to be literate. And we have a lot of big pieces of this puzzle, and we need to work together, and we can create these adults who can support their children literacy and support themselves as members of the 21st century workforce. So I ask for your support. I don't have more, I left one at it. Ladies, you'll need the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the adoption of the resolution? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this resolution now be adopted? All those in favor of the adoption of the resolution will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Sains rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Statue of inquiry. Is it not true that I stand with the gentleman from the 179th in the hopes that this bill addresses the literacy of his first readable text, which was Mesotopian script in 3,200 BC? You are living dangerously. What purpose does Chairman Hogan rise? Could he repeat that? Would you repeat that? You yield and repeat it. He forgot what he said, Mr. Chairman. He has a short memory after last night. What purpose is representative McLeod rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that HB71, which I was introduced also covers pre-K in that particular bill? I have the lady so states what purpose is representative Kenner rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that two thirds of Georgia third graders are not reading on level and has a consequence most of the individual serving time in our state prisons dropped out of school? I think I've read this statistic and I know that third grade is a critical academic time for our young people. What purpose is representative Kenner rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that there is evidence-based literacy instruction that discusses the importance of young readers learning from those who look like them and being able to empathize by having books that are written by folks that they can identify with? If the lady so states I'm sure she believes that to be true. What purpose is representative Jasmine Clark rise? Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not true that the distinguished gentleman from the 180th district and my co-chair for the future caucus probably meant to say Mesopotamian and not Mesotopian? He butchered that word so bad I'm not sure what he was intending to say. All right we're going to lock the machines here have all members voted. Have all members voted if so the clerk will lock the machines on the adoption of House Resolution 650 the eyes of 130 the nasa zero. This resolution having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore adopted. The chair is going to ask members to please take your seats. We have a couple of special orders that the chair is recognizing this morning. Please take your seats. Chair recognizes. Chairman Ed Setsler for a special order. Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Isn't it inappropriate that I'd be speaking to you on a Friday before you go home? But it's a pleasure to rise today and give my fair well addressed to this House. There is probably nobody here in this body who enjoys and loves the sweetness of tears of joy that I do. So if I cry I'm up here having a good time I appreciate that. I want to share today though in the few minutes we have together some words that I would sort of leave you all with is that apart from this chair. Not a pastor that did work with me when I was a young 20 year old college kid working in the inner city projects of Greenville South Carolina. And he said you know if you don't know where it is that you come from you'll never know where it is that you're supposed to be going. So as I recall I was recalling that this morning as I was getting out my black shoe polish in my charcoal pinstripe suit brand new Chris starts white shirt to come down to the Capitol and give my fair well speech to this House. As I was thinking about that I realized you know this is not really where we come from or where we're going. Now think back to my first time in this chamber although I was born down the street and a little public hospital right down the street from us to a 20 year old single mom. My first time in this chamber was right up there in the gut. It was February 10th of 2004. I was here for a meter ledge slitter day. And instead of wearing a pinstripe suit and black polish wing tips I was wearing this old brown sport coat that I'm wearing today. I remember sitting up there looking down I didn't know any members here except when I was in the fort Stewart in Hunsville, Georgia. One of my friends in the first year I met the church of Hunsville was buddy to Loch. And buddy sat right down here in this part of the chamber. I was watching the buddy. He's the only guy I knew that was here. So I didn't come from political royals. I would never been you know never known anybody who was a state rap. In fact I was down here from a meet your legislator day at the Capitol. My legislator then was a man who's become a mentor of mine. He's one of these people that has such joy that he has Jesus just oozing out of his pores. And those of you who've been serving here a couple years his name is Roger Hines. And Roger is my state representative. He was running for Congress that year. And I just came down here to meet him as part of a meet your legislator day. I was wearing this old brown sport coat. My shoulders were broader and my mid area was a little bit thinner back then. But I remember standing here thinking to myself, you know what is it? What is it they were called as regular folks to do? My recollection of my encounter with government at that point had been very recent. I was a young man in 2002 who had gone to a town hall meeting in my H.O.A. clubhouse. I was wearing khaki shorts, a t-shirt and Birkenstock sandals. I sat down about four rows back in our school.

Our member came, talked to us about a school who's being built adjacent to our neighborhood. And what we wanted is neighbors, we had young, had a young, you know, a six-year-old, a time about to start school, four-year-old, a time all we wanted was our neighborhood, where there's a dead industry, the dead ends read it in that school property, to be able to, at the cost of our neighbor, to be able to build a little path, to connect to the sidewalks, or kids could walk to school. Now, she talked about retaining walls and cop county schools and all the big construction program, we're gonna give your kids buses, and so wait a minute, man, we don't want, we don't want buses, we want our kids to be able to walk to school. Now, remember after the town hall meeting was wrapping up, we weren't being heard, and remember I stood up with about 30 or 40 folks in the room and said, man, I don't wanna be ugly, but I just wanna distill something very clearly to you. All we want is to be able to build a little trail so our kids can walk to school. I know the big machine of cop county schools is not gonna give that to us, unless you make it happen, you are a school board member, this is gonna cost the schools nothing, but we want, everyone in the room wants you don't make that happen, just let us build a little trail that can connect to the sidewalk. You think that trail ever got built? That little retaining wall stopped, and where we're gonna build our trail, they put a big fence, and they landscape that, and they block this out, and say, hey, we're giving you guys buses, your kids can get on the school bus, they can ride, they may live 100 yards from the school, they can ride a half mile around all the way around on the school bus, you can drop them off in the bus lane, but we never got that little trail built, why? We didn't matter. It was a little neighborhood in North cop county, you know what under neighborhood had ever run for office, we weren't the East Cop Pacific Association, we didn't wield power, we didn't have anybody in our role of decks we could call to fix that, so let us build this little trail for ourselves. And as I said here, in this chamber, I saw the folks down here make a difference, which is it? And the one thing I want us to never forget is that most of us don't come from royalty, and if you know the challenge of our positions, we're not paid like royalty, and the service we do here is only meaningful if regular folks matter. Regular folks don't matter. I didn't have a speech to read today, as I was driving down from North cop county today, I was, took a phone call, took a constituent call, and I was hoping to prepare my thoughts better for this presentation. I was talking to a friend who's been laid off and had some medical issues, and I was talking to him until I rolled into the parking lot here. And that's what each and one of you guys do. Everybody in this room is committed to regular folks, and I want this chamber to never ever forget with all the power out here in the hallway, all the influence. It's regular folks back on Main Street that were down here to serve. We had a bill last year to look after folks in the hospital. I mean, the powers in those hallways had so much influence. There were CEOs of organizations, there were the melting, the cell phones of senators were melting through their fingers. From CEOs of organizations saying, make this bill stop. When people back home were languishing in pain and tears, our leadership saw that, you all saw that. And I said to a senator who looked at me with a while looking at his face, he said, and I know this is a good bill, I know this is a good bill, but I just can't vote for it. I said to CEOs call me and say, make this stop. And I said, you know what, the folks who want this bill to stop have all the power in this building. They have the best lobbyists money can buy. But grandma and Paul Paul back on the farm in North Georgia, all they've got is you and me. I want us to never forget that. I want us to never forget what I'm long gone from this place and folks who are new here in this chamber of the senior members. I want you to never forget that it's the right of conscience. The ability to speak your mind clearly and be heard that takes the collective wisdom of 10.8 million people and brings it to bear on a proposition. You know, Willie Math Buckley, the founder of National Review Magazine said, I would rather be ruled by the first 2000 names in the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard University. There's wisdom in the walking around sense of regular people. There is wisdom in the walking around sense of the folks and leader Beverly's district. Fused in with a walking around sense of folks represent Hagen's district in my district in each one of your districts. If you take the wisdom of all these folks, you have fused them together. That's what's in this room. You know, I think if you listen to the elevated speech in the anti-room and when we're delisting to be a flama wall, I think the folks in this chamber may include in all of us. Have a whole lot more in common than the first 2000 names in the phone book than we do with the faculty of Harvard University, right? This body or folks that are Hagen from regular gardens. And if we can focus on the right of conscience that whether it's in this well or there is a committee, that every voice can be heard, every voice doesn't feel cowed to sort of sit down and keep your mouth shut and just kind of go along, get along. If we can take the collective wisdom that we bring from our communities and fusing to every proposition we have here, we will have a place that is the genius. That our state knows where regular folks back home are working 55 hour a week jobs to keep the lights on. Represent. My joy here is not been on any bill. My joy here in this chamber is certainly not been in the well of the house. I wanna thank some folks. The joy of my time in office has been downer in 132 the Judiciary Non-Sum Committee. From my time as a freshman legislator when the gentleman from the Senate was our guest chairman, I was engaged in the process of debate where things are won on ideas and principles in truth. Not by who you know or not by who's on your role in DEX. But in that place, the Judiciary Non-Sum Committee, which we joke about, it's been called the Island of Misfit Toys and there's a lot of members that can, when you look at them, you look at us, you realize what a strange mix of folks that was. But that has been the joy of my time here. Spending hours in that committee, having the opportunity, I'd like to thank Chairman Gola in 2010, he signed me as a subcommittee chairman. And the sets of subcommittee have been one of the honors of my life. Does it have all my subcommittee working alongside of me in that temple of deliberation downstairs, the likes of Matt Ramsey, Alex Atwood, Christian Kumer, Stacey Abrams, Dusty Hightower, Regina Quick, Bob Trammell, US Attorney BJ Pack, Stephanie Stucky Benefield, Darshan Kendrick, Josh McClarin and others. The honor of being able to lead that group of people that representative Ben Phil used to call the levers of liberty has been one of the honors of my life. We have wrestled with, and Bert Reeves, he's the other subcommittee chair that served them on committee with me. The ability to wrestle with things that are the most weighty issues that this chamber manages has been an honor, and to me is a metaphor for how this entire body needs to work. Let's be a place that is focused on deliberation. Everyone providing input and letting every single person from every single sub and issue hue out of rock, a sculpture, something that is beautiful, something's right, and something that reflects the truth of our creator. I'll close Mr. Speaker by challenging us all, whether it's in this chamber or whether it's across the hall in another chamber, or if we leave this place and go back to serve our communities in different ways. I want us to never forget the beauty and the truth that this nation represents. Georgia was founded on the proposition by James Oglethorpe, it would be a free place. And it's sometimes these little tweaks to things that make something that pollute good things. Georgia was founded on right principles, and within a generation was twisted and perverted and just shaped, it was founded to be a place of freedom and opportunity to a place of slavery and bondage. Thankfully for our history, we've come through that. And we're in an awesome place today where after all the ugliness of the past, we are huing out of the rock of Georgia history, a place where everybody, everybody can be equal. And we're not there yet. But I want us to never take our eye off the ball that the principles on which our nation are founded, the project that we're all a part of is to not change the principles or ignore them. But to make sure that everybody can come along and participate in fullness. I'll close Mr. Speaker and I want to challenge us all that there's a time that we're facing now that's very difficult. And I want to leave you the words, the last words that Saint Paul ever spoke that he ever wrote. It was in the book of 2 Timothy, he was talking to a man much younger than him, and he was at a time of great peril and conflict, and twisting of truth and perverting of truth. In a commission to myth is, I commissioned myself and us all, preach the word, be instant in season and out of season, convince, reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction. For there will come a time when men will not endure sound doctrine. But wishing to have their ears tickled, they'll heap up for themselves teachers and according to their own desires. And we'll turn away from the truth and we'll turn towards myths. But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist and fulfill your ministries. For the time of my departure has come. I've fought the good fight. I've finished the course. I've kept the faith. Paul said in the future, there's a store for me at Crown of Rights and it's with the Lord the right to judge will give to me on that day. And not only to me, but to all who have longed for his appearing. That's the challenge of all face brothers and sisters with that. I killed the well. So I'm going to ask you to refrain from greeting Chairman Sussler right now. And then we can do that after the next one. Chair, I'm going to ask you to refrain from greeting Chairman Sussler right now. And then we can do that after the next one. Chair recognizes representative West Cantrell. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. February 21, 2014. There I was, mine in my own business. Live on my best life ever. Empty nested for the full time, first time. Every day, every night was date night, celebrating our 28th anniversary. At the Sundial Restaurant just down the street here. I'd made all the arrangements. It was standard time, so sunset was a little bit earlier. But I made sure we were there at sunset. We were having a great time together. And my phone started to ring. It rang once, I ignored it. It rang twice, I ignored it. It rang the third time. I ignored it. And then I remembered. Oh, yes. You're a pastor. This could be an emergency because it was a church member who was calling me for three times. So I texted the person and I said, listen, if this is an emergency, I'll call you back. But otherwise, I'm trying to have a nice quiet dinner with my wife on our anniversary. And this is how he responded. I guess it could wait till tomorrow. But if you could sneak away, without getting into too much trouble, please call me. Well, I decided to be a good husband for maybe the first time. It didn't call him back. But the next day, my wife and I spent the night at the Weston that night. And if she was getting ready, I called him back. And he began to lay out this story for me about something that had happened here the previous day. I didn't understand it at the time. I understand it now. How my predecessor, who had served for a total of three or four days at the time, because he was elected in a special session in a special election in the back half of a session, had introduced some crazy legislation and that a lot of people had come down to this very spot to talk about how bad that piece of legislation was. And now they were looking for somebody to run against that person. And I remember my wife and I were in the car and on speakerphone. And he said, so I want you to consider running to be a state representative. And we just started laughing. We bust out laughing. And I gave him some kind of Christian. You know, the Christian answer for when you want to say no, but you don't want to say it. I'll pray about it, right brother? And I fully intended never to give that a second thought. We got home. It's quiet. Like I said, we were empty nesters for the first time. Oldest sons living in Lawrenceville. My second son was married. My daughter had just graduated high school and she was overseas in Europe for a year-long mission trip. I remember exactly where I was sitting on the couch and our den by myself. And I don't want to make you think I'm a weirdo by saying God spoke to me. But that's basically what happened. There was a stirring in my soul that said, maybe you're actually supposed to think about this. And I remember calling my wife into the room and I said, okay, listen, don't freak out, okay? But I think we're actually supposed to think about this. And that began qualifying was in less than two weeks. And I thought I had to get in shape for qualifying because I thought I was some kind of obstacle course or something. I didn't know what I meant to qualify for office. I didn't realize this had a right to check. And so for the next two weeks, my wife and I prayed and agonized over what we were supposed to do. And I remember Thursday night 11.30 p.m. sitting on that same couch when qualifying closed at noon the next day, agonizing, am I supposed to do this? I was 52 years of age at the time. And I felt like for the first time in my life, God was asking me to do something that I didn't understand and I did not want to do. But I felt like I had to obey that still quiet voice out of strictly a sense of public duty. That's what got me here. So that set off a chain reaction of events that I never dreamed. I went to my first party meeting ever the next day. I remember coming to... I said, let's go to bed early. I mean, go to bed. Let's get up early. I'll go find a suit, put it on. And if we feel good about it, I'm going to drive downtown and qualify for office. And so I remember coming down here in Jain and I were the only two people on the planet who knew I was coming. And I made one phone call to give that person who had called me originally, a heads up, hey, I'm actually going to do it. I'm going down. And it set off a chain reaction of events. And I never worked harder in all my life. Knocked on thousands of doors, made raised thousands of dollars, made thousands of phone calls, all the things that go... Put out thousands of signs. The first wave was at midnight. I remember that was kind of sneaky. So during that time, you know, I've tried to develop a habit in my life of spending time in the Bible in the scriptures each morning. And as fate would have it, I try to read through the Bible each year. And I was in this Bible reading planet. It was a little bit of the Old Testament, a little bit of the New Testament. And that week I read in the book of Acts, there's a story where Paul is trying... There's a apostle Paul is trying to figure out where he's supposed to go next. And he wants to go to this place and he says, God tells him, no. He picks a second place and God says, no. And then that night he has this dream. And in his dream, this person from Macedonia says, would you come and help us? Well, Macedonia is in Asia, right? But you know, in the middle of the House District 22, there's a little community called Macedonia. You're familiar with the bread. And at the same time I was reading in the book of Esther. And I read that famous passage that said, maybe you were born for such a time as this. And it was just like that sealed the deal for me. So I won the election. Now what do I do? I'm like the dog that chased the car and I caught it. And I have no idea what's going on. But I have to tell you, it's been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve with you as a state representative. Now people ask, why are you only serving four terms? And I really don't have a good answer. I was 52 when I got elected. I thought, well, in eight years I'll be 60. That seems about right. There's no magic in that number. It was actually kind of a random decision. But now that I'm at that time, I think it's about right. It's time for me to move on and let somebody else do this job. So people say, what are you going to miss? Are you going to miss this job? Let me start out by saying some things that I'm not going to miss. And it really boils down to four things. Okay? The fancy suit, the challenging commute, the long meetings and the lobbyist greetings. That's it. The suit, the commute, the meetings and the greetings. I hate despise having to wear a suit. I had to buy a bunch of suits to do this job. I don't seem right on $17,000 a year, does it? I despise sitting in traffic. I live the perfect, wrong distance, 39 miles. Too close to sitting down here, but too far to drive home every day. Now I will have to admit, Mr. Speaker, other than receiving Christ as my Savior, marrying my wife Jane and the birth of my three children and the birth of my grandson, the express lane is the greatest thing this ever happened to me. Meetings, meetings about meetings. Meetings with a lot of attorneys in them arguing over the definition of words. I will not miss those long meetings. And although I find most of our lobbyists to be great, great people, I'm not a fan of all the hobnaving I've had to do over the last eight years. Now to the things I will miss. I hope that I will miss the voices that I hear in my head at night. I don't know, maybe you hear these same voices. It kind of goes like this. The hour of convening, having arrived. Do y'all hear that voice? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered to share here's none? The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to the adopting of the Committee's sub-sute? Here's none. Committee's sub-sute. Why does nobody ever object? Shall this bill now pass? Hey, our speaker has the greatest speaker voice on the planet. Can we all agree? And well, I'd like to thank Speaker Rauston for putting up with me for eight years. I mean, I don't know. I remember him and Spiro both have given me some really funny looks through the years when I have done so many. I violated so many unwritten rules. There's so many unwritten rules around here. Why don't we write them down? Help our brother out. I mean, my first couple years I was in a penalty box so much and most of the time I didn't know why. Man, the unwritten rules. Well, what will I miss most? I will miss you. I will miss all of you. I love and cherish every single one of you. I regret that the pandemic... Wow, give him emotional. I regret that the pandemic has kept me from getting to know some of you better and the last that have just recently been elected. You become a second family to me. Some would say a very dysfunctional family, but a second family nonetheless. I have... I cherish the relationships and I hope that those relationships will continue. I particularly miss my seatmate who loves me so much that he didn't even show up today. F.T., my favorite Todd, Todd Jones. He sat next to me the last six years. His humor combined with his brain power and intellect have sustained me on many days when I really didn't want to be here. And I also need to thank the people who had the misfortune of sitting around me. Kim Spencer, Matthew Barry, Charlie's, Todd Darleen, Jenny. Matt and the ever-talkative Dewey McClain. Where is he? Okay, he was here earlier. He jetted. But he, you know, never lacking a comment. I will greatly miss the friendly banter that we had in that group and even the occasional argument. The acceptance and love that we have for each other despite our disagreements will always hold a special place in my heart. Every time Spiro would talk about, you know, rearranging the seats or whatever I would beg and please just let me stay where I am because I love that spot. And I was there for all of my years. But most of all, I need to thank my wife Jane for putting up with supporting another one of my crazy ideas. It's my wife, Jane's in the back corner here. And thank her. Our life has been quite an adventure. I went and traded all the money in the world. You're the love of my life. All right, so I want to leave you with the most important message. My faith sustains me. My relationship with Christ drives everything that I do. And I hope that was always clear. And when it wasn't, I asked that you would please forgive me. I believe that God loves every one of us in this room. And he has an incredible, exciting, meaningful plan for all of us. And with merciful to us and gracious, he's merciful and that he doesn't give us what we deserve when we think that the world revolves around us. He's gracious to us and that he gives us what we don't deserve, his forgiveness, his love, his acceptance. My heartfelt desire for each of us is that we would experience the relationship with God that he offers us through his son, Jesus Christ. If you've never given Jesus a chance, I urge you to do so. And of all things that deserve your favorable consideration, it's him. So I would ask you to give him your favorable consideration. I've been hung up on a song for the last several weeks called Son of Suffering. And to me it clearly articulates God's desire for us. And I'm not going to sing it, but I'm going to read it to you. And it goes like this. Oh, the perfect Son of God in all his innocence, here walking in the dirt with you and me. He knows what living is. He's acquainted with our grief, man of sorrow and son of suffering. Blood and tears. How can it be? There's a God who weeps. There's a God who bleeds. O praise the one who has reached for me, hallelujah to the Son of Suffering. Some imagine you are distant and removed, but you chased us down in merciful pursuit. To the center you were grace and the broken you embraced. And in the end, the proof is in your wounds. Yes, in the end, the proof is in your wounds. Blood and tears. How can it be? There's a God who weeps. There's a God who bleeds. O praise the one who has reached for me, hallelujah to the Son of Suffering. The Lord bless you and keep you. Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace. May his favor be upon you and a thousand generations and your family and your children and their children and their children. May his presence go before you and behind you and beside you, all around you and within you. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield the well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to give you a hand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Lurker, read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions.
