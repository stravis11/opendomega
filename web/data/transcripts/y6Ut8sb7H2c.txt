----------
for it. And then I said, God, forgive brother Bert for over praising me. And then I prayed
for myself. And I said, and God, forgive me for enjoying it so much. Amen. No, I do, I
do greatly appreciate, I do appreciate our lieutenant governor and Miss Jan and their
family, their family means much to me and I've been coming here, I've been coming here
for over three decades and it's a wonderful privilege to be able to share with you men
and women today. I want to take just a few moments. Is there anybody in the group that would
say, Brother Benny, I've not heard you speak. I've not heard you speak. Every person has
He's heard me speak this one right here.
Well, this one right here.
Well, I say to you two men,
what Elizabeth Taylor said to her eighth husband,
I'm not gonna keep you long, man, man.
All right, I'm gonna keep you long.
I wanna talk to you from 2 Timothy, chapter 1, verse 16.
This is what the Bible says.
It says, the Lord give mercy
unto the house of Onesiferus.
for he often refresh me and was not ashamed of my chains.
The Lord give mercy unto the house of my own Cyprus,
for he often refresh me and was not ashamed of my chains.
I wanna talk to you this morning on the first day of session
about what every person needs.
I'm not an anthropologist,
what I do know what every person needs.
I remember on one occasion, I was with Mr. Truitt Cathy.
And Mr. Truitt Cathy said to me, he said,
preacher Benny, do you know how you determine
whether or not a person needs encouragement?
I said, no, Mr. Truitt, how do you know?
He said, if they're breathing, he said,
if they're breathing, they need encouragement.
In serving in the Georgia Senate, I would assume you need encouragement.
I heard about a man that was running for office and he was speaking.
And while he was speaking, a heckler stood up and said, I wouldn't vote for you if you
was St. Peter.
And the politician said, if I was St. Peter, you wouldn't be in my district, amen?
We all need encouragement.
A teacher was teaching a little boy about encouragement.
This little boy was in school
and he was making these ugly faces.
And Mrs. Johnson said to him, she said,
Johnny, when I was a little girl,
I was taught that if you make ugly faces,
your face will, your face will literally freeze that way.
He said, well, Mrs. Johnson,
you can't say he wasn't warned, amen?
Okay. How can we encourage other people? Four quick points. How can we encourage other
people? First of all, we can encourage other people with praise. We can encourage other
people with praise. The Bible says in Proverbs 18 and 21, Death and Lives in the Power of
tone. How was this world created? We believe that God spoke this world into existence. We don't
believe that once it was a tadpole beginning to begin and then it was a frog with my tail
tucked in and then it was a monkey in a banana tree and now I'm a professor with a PhD. We don't
believe that. We believe that God spoke this world into existence and folks if words spoke this
world into existence. Your words make a difference in somebody else's world. Your words make a
difference in somebody else's life. I learned this very young. I participated in sports.
I love sports. I played baseball, played basketball, played even football. I played tailback. Every
time I ran on the field, the coach said you get your tail back here. But I remember playing baseball
And a baseball coach saying to me, good play, little man, good play, little man, and it
made an impact on me.
You want to encourage people?
You encourage them with your words, a book that I wrote.
It's entitled, yes, she can, yes, she can.
Because I believe people need to hear, yes, she can.
Because people need to be encouraged, and we encourage people with our praise.
Let me tell you a second way we encourage people.
We encourage people with our presence.
We encourage people simply being there for them.
Somebody said a free and walks in when everybody walks out.
I said, no, no, a free and never leaves.
A friend stays with you.
You won't encourage somebody today.
You encourage them with your praise.
But you encourage them with your presence
because the Bible says a friend love it at all times
and a brother is born for adversity.
And most of us don't have near as many friends
as we think we have.
So we encourage people with our praise.
We encourage people with our presence.
Some of you've got the third point in your hand right now.
You encourage people with your pen.
I know we're in the day of instant communication.
We can text, we can tweet.
But I still believe there's power in a handwritten note.
I still believe Martin Luther said, if you want to change the world, pick up your pen.
Today you want to encourage somebody.
You do it with your praise.
Today you want to encourage somebody.
You do it with your presence.
You just be there for them in the low times, in the good times.
You want to encourage somebody you do it with your pen.
Then there's the last way.
You knew you would get this one. I'm a preacher. You encourage people where you're prayers.
You say I'm praying for people. We'll let them know you're praying for them.
You know what I've learned, folks?
True and Kathy was correct.
We all need encouragement.
We all need encouragement.
And if you don't need it now,
by the end of 40 days you will.
So I just came today to say, I appreciate you, I just came today to say thank you for
what you do.
I wish I could speak to your mates, I really wish I could speak to your mates, I wish
I could speak to your children because I'd like to say to your mates and children, thank
you for the sacrifice, thank you for sacrificing your daddy, thank you for sacrificing
your husband. Thank you for sacrificing your wife, for the people of Georgia, people just
like me, so I just came today to say thank you. When Abraham Lincoln was killed, they started
looking through his, what was on him when he was killed. And they looked when he was
was killed, much like me, had a pair of glasses on him. When he was killed, they noticed
in his pocket, he had a pocket knife. They noticed that he had a handkerchief. He had
a confederate, $5 meal. But then they noticed something else that he had on him. He had some
newspaper clippings. Newspaper clippings. And it was a few newspaper clippings where these
few newspapers had said complimentary things about Abraham Lincoln. And it was obvious that
he pulled them out and read from time to time the complimentary things that somebody had
set a body, even Abraham Lincoln needed encouragement. So today, you be that
encourager. Let's pray.
Our most kind gracious Heavenly Father, I thank you for every man or woman
that's serving today. God, we refer to him many times as politicians, but in
Romans chapter 13, you refer to them as ministers and servants. And Lord Jesus said,
let the greatest among you be your servant. And Martin Luther King Jr. said, any man or
woman can be great because any man or woman can serve. Thank you for the service of these wonderful
people under this go-dome. I pray that you would give them a great year. I pray that you would
would give them a great year of accomplishment.
But Lord also, I pray for their families.
I pray for those that are not here today
that you would be with them,
that you would make up the time that's lost,
that you would restore the time that the locust have eaten.
So God, would you bless this body and keep them,
make your face to shine upon them, be gracious and to them,
lift your countenance upon them,
and may they experience your peace
for I pray this prayer in Jesus' name, amen.

Donnie Kerr-Patrick, Donnie Kerr-Patrick, come on.
We have, if I get everybody sent you real quick, obviously we always like to recognize
our doctors of the day and we've got a very special physician here with us and to introduce
him I'll call on one of our distinguished members who is a doctor as well, the center
from the 31st, center?
Good morning, colleagues.
I want to introduce you to an old friend of mine.
Not as old as I am, but he's going to look very familiar to some of you.
This is Dr. Bobby Kaufman, and Dr. Kaufman has been coming here as the doctor of the
day for 35 years, and we're so happy to have him.
Dr. Kaufman is a Georgia Bulldog.
He went to more house for medical school and then did his internal medicine training at
Emory. And he's been in practice here in the Atlanta area since 1989. So you may not
know this, his father or Dr. James Kaufman actually started the Doctor of the Day program
many years ago. And we're so appreciative of the Kaufman family. So with that, please
welcome Dr. Bobby Kaufman.
35 years, that sure makes me sound really old. I guess because I am. But yeah, I did
in Toronto medicine for 35 years and kind of on the downward slide, but still working
a little. It's an honor to be here and it's honor to be here in my legacy of my father
who is a very special friend to all the legislators back in the day. And hopefully I've continued
that legacy. I feel it's such an honor to be here, and in 35 years, I finally got one
of my family members come. This is my daughter who's a grad school at Emory, so she's going
into public health, so I'm very proud of her. But truly, you know, it's great having
a physician here, but the most important person here is Julia, the nurse, hiding over in
the corner. You got to make sure you know Julia. She's much
important than all of us. But again it's an honor and a
pleasure and if I can do anything for anybody please let me
know and thank you for allowing me to talk.
All right, so you're ready for the protein thing?
All right.
All right.
The next order business is going to be the seeding of our protein, our new protein, and
also majority later.
Before we do that, I would like to recognize, there's a number of spouses in here of senate
members and everything, but there's one special lady right behind me right here that I'd
like to recognize, and that's my wife, Jan, we stand up real quick, Jan, my wife's
I can remember the first time I told her I was going to run for political office, she was
eight months pregnant with our son, Banks now, and she thought I was out of my mind,
And I said, yeah, I probably am, but she said, well, if that's what you want to do, that's
what you do.
And she's always been very supportive, she's always been the rock in our household, and
I just greatly appreciate all the support and love and help that she's given me through
the years.
And I think we got one more run left in us though, Jan, don't you think?
Yeah, we got one more run here, but anyways.
But as y'all know, you can't do this without supportive spouses, and so, and she's been,
she's been my rock there, I'm so appreciative and love her so much for everything that she
does.
So I greatly appreciate you and I appreciate that and we've got another, another couple
guys we want to introduce and they've got some very strong women in their households
as well.
This time, I'd like to recognize the Senator from the 31st of the nomination.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Great to see you as always.
Mr. President, I nominate the Senator from the 20th Larry Walker, the 3rd for President Protum.
The Majority Leader has moved on the nomination of the Senator from the 20th Office of the President Protum.
Is there a second?
I recognize them, I'm already later, hey, how are you doing, but I'm doing well, Mr. President.
I second the nomination of Senator from the 20th Larry Walker III for President Pro Tem.
All right, thank you, Senator.
Senator from the 31st, you're welcome to speak to your nomination.
These microphones need a little bit of adjusting since we're back in here.
Good morning colleagues, in the heart of Georgia,
where hard work and Southern values define us,
stands a leader in bodies the spirit of our great state.
Senator Larry Walker III, born and raised in Perry, Georgia,
is a third generation Georgian, works in insurance,
and a devoted family man to his wife, Adrian.
I know Adrian's in the room, and let's give a round of applause
to the First Lady of Houston County.
His roots run deep in our soil, representing the resilience of faith in the community pride
that makes Georgia shine.
As a senator since 2015, Larry has championed bold reforms, laden the charts, mature agricultural
growth in our history, slashing red tape for small businesses, and ensuring families
These are equipped to be successful in grow our economy.
He fought for rural communities like Blakely, in Houston, in Lawrence, in Blaski counties,
ensuring their voices are heard here in Atlanta.
Larry Walker is the right leader at the right time, guiding Georgia through economic growth and
challenges with unwavering integrity.
It is my honor to nominate him as President and Pro Tem of this Georgia Senate.
Thank you, Mr. President.
So now we have a motion and a second motion by the majority of the leader, a seconded by the minority leader, I recognize Senator from the 31st.
Mr. President, I ask you now to consent that the nomination is closed and the Secretary of the Senate be instructed to cast the vote for the entire body for Senator Larry Walker of the 3rd of the 20th.
Is there objection?
Hearing none, nominations are closed, all ballots are cast and I hereby declare the senator from the 20th, the duly elected President Pro Tem of the Georgia Senate.
At this time, I'd like to recognize again the following members of the serve as the
Committee of the Escort, to escort the President Pro Tem, Senator from the 15th, Senator
Senator from the 31st, Senator from the 22nd.
If you'll go join the pro-TM in the back.
Recognize the sergeant at arms.
Mr. President, the honorable Larry Walker,
Senator from the 20th District and newly elected President
Brotin of the Georgia Senate awaits entrance to the chamber.
Thank you so much.
Could you call it a day?
Come on up, Larry.
There's a zone wrong.
It's at the bottom.
It is a minor to introduce my good friend.
Mr. Larry LeWalker, not only has he been a fine senator for many, many years from
House in County, but he's just, he's been a good friend to each and every one of us here in this room.
He and his wife, Adrian, has just been, they've pitted me a southern hospitality.
They're warm and loving and they've never met a stranger before.
And I just really am glad and honored and proud of all the work that he has done in this body.
And I know he will do this chamber well in representing each and every one of you.
So at this time, there's recognize our Senator from the 20th.
is our new President Pro Tem, Larry Walford.
Thank you, thank you, wow, this is awesome, thank you all so much.
So I was seven years old when my father was elected to the House and over the next 32
years. I spent a good bit of time here at the Capitol along with my mother, Janice, and
our family. And I could never have imagined I would serve in this August body, the Senate,
much less be the President, pro-tem. So I'm deeply humbled by the trust you've placed
and me to serve as your president, pro-Tam, and I'll try to live up to any expectations
and do you proud.
I want to thank my colleagues in the Republican Caucus for nominating me, by acclimation
back in the summer, and I want to thank my good friend, the minority leader, and the minority
caucus for your support. Actually when I was first elected the minority
leader was my office sweet mate and we became fast friends and ever main
friends so I appreciate that very very much. I stand here today as a product of
Georgia values. I was reared in middle Georgia in Perry. I was born in the
County and home of some mighty good leaders, Senator Sam Nunn, Governor Perdue, to name a few.
And those folks modeled what I think it means to be servant leaders and to be true statesman.
And I hope I can learn from that and somewhat emulate them.
My heart and my roots are firmly planted in the Soul of District 20, and I carry the
values of my amazing communities that I represent across the state with me every day.
For me, the importance of community and public service was taught to us at our house around
the dinner table and instilled in me and my father, Larry Walker Jr., as I already said,
spent 32 years serving in the house and he served 16 of those years as majority leader
and I learned a lot from him and realized the opportunity we have from our constituents
putting us in this position, the opportunity we have to make a difference and to do good.
And I think what we've done really good work in the 10 years that I've been here.
I'm real proud of the work we've done.
But at the end of the day, it's really not about the bills we pass or the budgets we pass,
although those are very important.
It's really about the friendships we build, and the relationships we make, and the positive encouragement, as Dr.
Tate said, that we can give to the people around us, our constituents, and the folks working here in this building.
And I hope we'll remember that, and we're giving a really unique opportunity to have a positive
influence on people's lives and especially the young people because we need to leave
this place better than we found it and be training up the next generation of leaders.
So I hope we will do this.
My father taught me that while we sit on different sides of the aisle or come from different
areas of the state or different perspectives, we're all bound by a common duty to leave
Georgia better than we found it. He understood that leadership isn't about the title you hold,
but the people you serve. And as I take this guy while I hope to honor his legacy
by bringing the same spirit of steady principal leadership to this role.
In my decade of service in the Senate I've fought for a better Georgia and I want to use this
platform that I now have to continue to do the same. As your President ProTIM, my goal
is to ensure that the Senate continues to lead, remains a place of deliberation, efficient
procedure, and transparent government. I want us to debate vigorously but to treat
each other with courtesy and respect. Now more than ever, it is important to remember
that the people that sent us here, and the work they expect us to do, we're here to serve
the people of Georgia, not political agendas or ambition. To my family, my high school sweetheart
is here with me today, Adrian, my wife of over 40 years. I'm so proud of her. Stand up,
She's been a rock and my encourager and she also helps keep me centered and helps
me keep this in perspective and I appreciate and love her.
Our three sons Ben Cody and Wade, they've been unwavering in their support and understanding
of the time away, and I wouldn't be standing here without any of them.
And then to my colleagues, I look forward to working with each and every one of you with
civility and purpose.
Let us honor the traditions of the Senate while working toward a bright future for our
state.
I believe that Georgia is the greatest state in the nation
to live, work, and raise a family.
And I'm honored to join all of you in working
to ensure that it stays this way.
Thank you, and God bless the great state of Georgia.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Applause
I don't know what I'm going to need at this point.
Man, I agree.
I got to figure out where I had to work at.
All right, we'll get him out.
It was nice to see all the House that were here because of the Secretary of the President.
Oh my God.
Mr. Wood, he's done.
That was just cool.
Mr. Wood, that was just cool.
That was just cool.
Mr. Wood, that was just cool.
That was just cool.
Mr. Wood, that was just cool.
Mr. Wood, that was just cool.
All right, very, very nice, and I appreciate the, the protein for his kind words and he'll
be a great leader.
Next order of business will be the adoption of the resolution related to the convening
of the Senate, Secretary Reed announces.
the resolution 557 by Walker of the 20th.
And of Attarte of the 31st and Jones, the second of the 22nd.
A resolution to notify the House of Representatives that the Senate has convened in for other purposes.
Thank you, Mr. President, that could be the order.
He is the objection to the adoption of resolution.
Chair here is done and the resolution is adopted.
I recognize the majority leader for a motion.
Mr. President, I ask you an am to consent that SR557 and all resolutions adopt a today requiring
transmittal be immediately transmitted to the House.
Majority leader has moved for immediate transmit of SR557.
Is there objection?
Objection is approved.
I also, while we have a moment here, the senator from the 35th, he went in here earlier
when we recognize them, but let's give our new senator from Cobb County, Senator Howard
from the 35th here. Let's give him a big round of applause.
Senator and I had a nice long conversation right after you won a couple of weeks ago and
I enjoyed our talks and learned a lot about him.
I think he'd be a great member to this body.
So looking forward for him serving.
Nice to have you here, Senator.
Are there any unanimous concerns?
Does any Senator rise on a point of personal privilege?
Senator from the 26, our longest serving member
the General Assembly right here.
tell you what, in the history of the General Assembly, the man from
Megan Georgia. I sat beside her for 10 years, he's got that looking on his face,
he's got business on his mind right now.
Thank you, Mr. Governor. I come this morning to
to ask the lieutenant governor to take the chairman of the insurance committee and have
the folks who run our health plan before the committee.
They are doing things and making decisions that I disagree with.
Let me tell you something.
I played football, it was good I got education, but I wanted to want to end up with bad knees,
three knee operations.
I don't feel like laying on the table no more unless I'm about to die.
I went and asked the insurance company, you know, we got new technology now.
I went to an orthopedic surgeon and it said, I had bone,
own bone, which meant every time I made a step, it hurt.
There's new technology.
They can inject the knee.
And what they inject with, it's almost like grease.
It lubricates the knee where you're not getting the lubrication
between the loans.
They refused me, so I had to pay $1,000
for the injection to go in my knee.
Now, if I had to have a knee replacement,
that's about $65, $70,000.
And then you're talking about two knees.
I do pretty good.
I got a shot about four months ago,
about time for me to get a note.
But I don't feel like laying on the table three hours
to be cut on and then turn around
and you got the rehab.
I know about rehab because I had to do it
when I wanted to play football with those knee operations.
And so what I'm asking the insurance committee
do is to bring them in. You will pay 75,000 for a knee replacement, but you won't give
me a thousand dollars to get the injection in my knee, so I don't hurt. I like hunting
and I like fishing, but what they ain't about it, if you can't walk into woods, how you
going to walk out. So I would ask the Lieutenant Governor to appoint a committee to deal with
the folks who held our insurance. And the reason I said it, for 51 years they got my money
on time, not a mispayment. Now I need something from you, because I'm old. Not a strange chicken
Can't jump, can't run that fast, take step, one by one.
But something is wrong, when we have all this new technology, and then you tell me I can't get an injection in my knee that'll make me walk without paying.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Any other Senator wish to rise on point of personal privilege?
Chair, hearing none.
Are there any motions to withdraw and recommit?
You have a consent calendar of local bills before you.
Chair, recognize the senator from the 45th.
Reunanimous consent for all the bills on the Senate local consent calendar to be
recommitted to the committee on state and local government.
Senator has moved in all the bills pending, be moved back to local,
state and local government operations.
Here's their objection.
Hearing none, all bills appearing on today's Senate local consent calendar are
recommended to the committees on the state and local government operations.
We're going to ask the senator from the 31st.
Mr. President, I ask you names consent that all bills and resolutions that were placed on the table during the 2025 legislative session will be taken from the table.
The majority leader has moved his objection.
Out of objection, all bills will be taken from the table.
And I was the majority leader again for a motion.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bills and resolutions on the Senate calendar be committed to the committee from which they were last reported.
Majority leaders move and ask for unanimous consent that the bills and resolutions on the Senate calendar are being committed from the last committee for which they were reported.
Is there objection?
Here none of those are re-committed.
We're waiting on the sea if the house is going to be able to get the calendar over to
us.
But I was reminded I was looking at my good friend, Greg Bloomstein back there in the back and
My pastor was talking about the articles
that were in Abraham Lincoln's front pocket when he died.
And I got the thinking about that.
I said, I wonder if I'll have a reporter
write a good article about me.
And then I thought, well, Greg, at some point in time
in his career, I'm sure we'll write a good one about me.
Right, Greg?
I love Greg, I'm just picking at him.
Good to have Eric Johnson here, one of our former members.
Let's give Eric a big round of applause.
Applause.
Let's give it to have Eric.
Looking good.
Are we going to have Eric Johnson here, one of our former members?
Let's give Eric a big round of applause.
great to see you again. I move under Senate rule 7-1.10B to give notice that on the next
legislative day I intend to move SB 204 after house action.
Director, read the caption.
Senate bill 204 bill to be in the bill, Senator Jones,

an act to amend code section 17-7-70.1 of the OCGA relating to trial upon accusation of certain felony and misdemeanor cases and trial upon plea upon guilty, or in a little contender and further purposes.
Mr. President, that completes the order.
Thank you, Senator Knows has been served.
I do recognize one, another Senate member's wife is in the chamber here today.
We've got Lindsey Strickland here today.
Lindsey, give everybody a round of applause, give everybody a wave here.
I'm looking around they're supposed to let me know and some of these special guests come in here, but we're learning we're learning
All right, we're now moving on to center calendar
