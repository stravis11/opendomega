you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you You You Well, good morning. That was weak. I said, good morning. It's Friday. Does everybody get their plans canceled for tonight? If you need plans tomorrow, you can come to Blue Ridge, Georgia and see two or three inches of snow or more. So I'll give you a list of restaurants and other places to go when you get up there. Spin money. We're going to begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by the chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the gentleman from the 9th House District Representative Will Wade. Representative Wade. Thank you, Speaker. Colleagues, good morning. I have the honor and privilege today to introduce to you a personal friend, one of my dad's favorite students in the pastor of Silver City Baptist Church that's back home in my district. This guy was one of my biggest heroes when I was a youngster because he was the biggest strongest football player on our team. And he'll tell you he was mean back then, but he was kind to me as one of his teachers, my dad's great students. And I'll tell you this is especially special for me and my community because today, one year ago, this is the gentleman that I called on that my mother and father wanted to help us celebrate the life of my dad. And he has been a rock for us and always been helpful. And I hope you will listen to him today because he will speak truth from the heart. It's my honor and privilege. Pastor Russell Burton. Let me say certainly I consider it a great honor and a privilege to stand before you today. I would be remiss if I didn't make mention of Will's father, brother Roy Wade, who was my fifth grade school teacher. This was a man that was a giant of a man, a six eight, a boisterous, voice carried throughout the classroom. But one of the generalist, most loving, compassionate man that I've ever met, and he made a huge impression upon my life. Here, brothers and sisters and colleagues, I don't have anything new to tell you this morning, to remind us of some things of old. In the tent chapter of the gospel of Luke, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was asked a question by a lawyer. And the lawyer asking this, he said, what can I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said unto him, what is written in the law? How did you read it? When the answer is saying thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength, with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thy sale. In Jesus answered and said, thou hast answered right, this do and thou shalt live eternally. But he willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, and who is my neighbor? Friends and colleagues, I've come to ask you this morning with an appeal from my heart for us to define who is our neighbor. So often we think of our neighbor as the person that lives down the road from us, or maybe a family member that we're close to, maybe someone in our community. But our neighbor is much more than the people that we associate with and the people that live down the road from us. There are people that look different than we do and think different than we do and may have different beliefs than we do. But brothers and sisters, we are commanded to love. The greatest commandments on all or to love the Lord thy God with all of our heart, all of our soul, our strength and our mind, and to love our neighbor as ourself, who are living in a day and an age where that brotherly love, that companionship, those relationships are connection that we've had so often we have no longer. We live in such a fast-paced society and it seems like we've lost the value of relationships. I can't pretend this morning to tell you what somebody from Savannah George feels like or thinks or someone from the inner city and me being from North Georgia. But what I can do is sit down with my brother and my sister and I can have conversation and find out who they are and have that connection. The Lord Jesus began to tell a parable by the man who left Jerusalem and went down to Jericho and on his trip he was mugged and beaten and left half dead on the side of the road. The Bible said that there was a priest that came by and looked upon him and passed by on the other side. Maybe that priest thought to himself he didn't have time. Maybe that priest thought to himself and raised him within himself. I might get dirty or I might mess up my fine linen garment. There also came a leave out a man whose job was to take care of the things in the temple and he also came and looked upon him and passed by on the other side of the road. But oh thank God this morning there was a man there the Bible calls a Samaritan. That Samaritan is a representation of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He is a representation of the love that Christ brings into our heart for when he saw him he was moved with compassion. And all brothers and sisters I know we feel compassionate or we feel passionate about so many issues and that's well and good. But all we've got to learn how to have compassion on one another. How to truly love an individual as the creation of God. We're more than just a demographic. We're more than just a statistic or a voter block. We're all created with a capacity to love and the need to be loved. And aren't you glad that in this parable this man had compassion on him and begin to pour all in wine upon his wounds. Brothers and sisters in the day and age we live it seems like our society is coming unravel and it is the love of God and our love for each other that hold our society together. Let us be of those that are of the household of faith pour in the oil and the wine the love of God and the mercy of God. Let us see our brother as a human that needs love and help and compassion. And all how I appeal to you this morning you as leaders and me as a minister of the Gospel let us go out into the world and find the unlovable and love him with a love of Christ. And it's so doing we can change this world. Dr. Martin Luther King he made this statement. He said I have decided to follow love. He said hey it is too heavy a burden to bear. And all my dear brothers and sisters will never be more like God than when we love one another. And let me say this with all confidence with all humility I can tell you this morning that I love you and I love the people of this state. Now thank you for your service and I just wanted to come and encourage you for just a little while. May we go to the Lord in prayer. Dear Lord and Heavenly Father God as we come to you in the most precious name of Jesus. And I thank you for these men and women that are gathered here today to do the people's business. God I thank you Lord that there's no power but what is ordain of God. Father I pray for them I pray for our society. God do we my love one another. God hate you. And all this negativity has stifled us as a people. But Lord let us find that cause that is greater than our say it. The cold will love our brother and love our sister. God knows that Lord are on the way side those that are broken. Those that are wounded may we show them love and mercy. God love is more than just a word. It is an action. It is a call to respond. God I'm thankful.

Lord, you're able to do this in a people. God, we love you and we praise you and we thank you in Christ's name. Amen. I praise the leases to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Doorkeepers will unlock the doors. The members may greet the chaplain in the south any room. The chair recognizes chairman Hogan. The chair of the committee on information and audits.

Jones to the 47th burns, the 159th and Beverly to the 143rd. A resolution congratulating the Land of Rage and inviting them to be recognized by the House of Representatives and for other purposes. Whereas on November 2nd, 2021, the Land of Rage claimed their first World Series title since 1995 after shutting down the Houston Astros, 7 to nothing, finishing the series with four wins and two losses. And whereas, after securing an early league, the Braves utilized their superior pitching and landed numerous home runs in order to close out the game, allowing the Astros only six hits and three at bats with runners in scoring position. And whereas, Horace Solar was named the 2021 World Series MVP for his outstanding performance, joining the ranks of Hank Aaron, Lonnie Smith and Ryan Klesko. And whereas, the victory gives the City of Atlantis first major professional sports league championship title since the Atlanta United won the MLS Cup in 2018. And whereas, this phenomenal performance of the team is a clear indication of the outstanding athletic ability, dedication, hard work and unity of purpose and spirit of each member of the team. And whereas, this magnificent team earned its well-deserved reputation for excellence by performing with courage and precision over the months of training and competition, it is abundantly proper to call them champions. Now therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives that the member of this body congratulate the Atlanta Braves for winning the 2021 World Series title, extends sincere best wishes for continued success on the field and beyond. Be it further resolved the clerk of the House, the representatives is authorized and directed to make appropriate copies of this resolution available for distribution to the public and the press. Thank you, Mr. Clerk. I think it's only fitting that we celebrate the return of baseball today with having members of the executive leadership of the Atlanta Braves with us. We'd like to have had some of the players and coaches, but they've got to get ready to play ball now. So they've had it out. You know, last year was an amazing year in sports in Georgia. And we've honored the coach Smart and the Georgia Bulldogs and today we're honoring our Atlanta Braves because they belong to every Georgian. And we're just very, very proud of last year's success. I still remember that third out. That was a great, great World Series and a great second half of the season. I was going to do without that first half, but we're honored to have with us today the co-CEOs of the Braves, Mike Plant and Derek Schiller. And they've been friends of ours for a long time and we're just delighted to have them here. I'm going to recognize it this time for a few words. The CEO of the World Champion at Atlanta Braves, Mike Plant. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So on behalf of Derek and everyone in our entire organization, it's our privilege and honor to be with you here today. And obviously to bring that World Championship trophy, it is a coveted worldwide recognition of excellence. We strive for it every single year. Every member of this house in the state of Georgia, as a speaker said, has been part of our journey. We were proud to bring 9 million people last year to the battery and truest park and have a global television audience watch us win this World Championship. We have done a lot, we believe, in the last eight years to build and develop truest park and the battery and create an incredible economic engine that has now rivaled around the world. We've had 150 teams from all over the world come and see what we've done to change the landscape of professional sports, not just focus on a sports venue anymore, but to create an incredible activation and high energy center. We are three fortune 500 companies now that have their headquarters there and have really changed the landscape of Cobb County and the state of Georgia. So we appreciate your support. I can assure you that Derek and I, we are probably as happy as anyone in this room that we are going to have opening day at truest park on April 7th and that we are going to once again go after winning this trophy and bringing it back to the state of Georgia. So thank you very much. There's a bill on the day's calendar to compel them to resign Freddie Freeman. All right, we're going on now to the local calendar. Third reading and passage of uncontested local bills. If there is no objection we will vote on the local calendar as a whole with a recorded vote. Hearing none it is so ordered.

We have got a lot of stuff on the rules calendar today. So I am going to limit morning orders strictly to one minute each chair recognizes chairman Parsons for a morning order. Thank you Speaker. I know I have only got a minute. I want to speak just for a minute about we see a lot about gasoline prices especially on social media. I just want to speak about that for a minute. During my last three years with the 335 signal unit down at these point I was the intelligence NCO. I got a pretty good glimpse into misinformation coming from different places around the world. I see a lot of misinformation on the internet especially social media. But in particular I want to mention the Keystone pipeline. For your information or anybody might want to know and I see a lot of misinformation about this on social media. The Keystone pipeline was finished several years ago. It is operational. Continue to operate. The Keystone XL pipeline is not finished. I think it is about less than 10%. I know I think 8% completed so I see social media posts but we need to reopen it. Completed. It is not going to be that easy. Only 8% complete. Thank you. Chair recognizes representative Bruce for a morning order. Good morning everyone. I want to thank Chris McQuerry, Cash Trivitt and Andrew Long for purchasing these books. You have one on your desk in your office. This is born out of a mother who had breast cancer and her daughter didn't understand why she was losing her hair. So she and the daughter wrote a book together called No Hair Don't Care. We are going to use the money that comes from this book to create a scholarship for the little girl. Unfortunately the mother passed away. The little girl is going to be in the aneroom to sign the books if you want or to take a picture with you. We wanted to share this with you and we asked you to take it to your library or school or somewhere and share it so that if there is another child somewhere that is going through the same thing that they will be able to get the benefit of this book. Thank you. The grandmothers there as well as the little girl. They won't let them both in the aneroom but the little girl will be there if you want to meet her. Thank you so much. Chair recognizes representative Ken Trill for a morning order. Does everyone know what time it is this weekend? It's a favorite weekend of the year we get to spring forward and she came appropriately attired. She knows what time it is. All right. So last year we passed legislation that could make this year spring forward the last one ever. We could lock the clock and never change time again but it's up to the congress to do so. There are two bills in our congress right now. HR 69 has 33 sponsors. It's bipartisan. So I would encourage you to encourage your congressman to support this bill. Make Georgia congressman or on that bill and then Senate bill 623 has 17 sponsors. It's also bipartisan. Neither one of our senators or on that bill yet encourage you to reach out. I've reached out to him multiple times. Some of you may have a little more influence on them than I do and I would encourage you encouraging them and let's lock the clock forever in Georgia and the surrounding states. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Chair recognizes representative Hutchinson for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, colleagues. Today I bring to you Alyssa. Alyssa is a kind hearted and compassionate girl who loves to help others. She enjoys spending time with her friends, swimming, skating, singing and playing games like Monopoly. She enjoys going to church, participating in church activities and the falcons are her favorite team. Whoever adopts Alyssa would have to support her relationship with her sibling who is also a place for adoption in Georgia. Colleagues, during women's history, imagine what this little girl can do as an adult and as a woman in Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Chair recognizes representative Cannon for a morning order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning, members. I rise today to discuss music in our school's month. It is the entire month of March. And as many of you may know, the way that children learn is not always from a textbook, not always from a PowerPoint. Sometimes it's from a song. Sometimes it's from a performance evaluation. So the official idea is that it is the biggest school chorus in the world every March. But as you just reach out to your local public schools and see how they're doing with music in our school's month and hopefully in the years to come we'll be able to have some at the Capitol. Thank you so much. Chair recognizes representative Wade for a morning order. Thanks, Speaker. Colleagues, I ask you to rise to recognize and celebrate the life of a very amazing member of my community. Mr. Ernest Paul Stringer, known as Paul around town, passed away peacefully on March 2nd. Paul is a native and lifelong resident of Lumpkin County where he attended in Georgia College and was in the core cadets. And I was told to say this because he knew buddy, Deloge, when buddy was a young, young man. He was also on the rifle team, played baseball, a phenomenal human being and I just asked you give a moment of silence to recognize his life and contributions to his community. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. The clerk will read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions. Recording the life and memory of Mike Duckel.

The resolutions are adopted. We are now going on to the Rules calendar. Going on to the Rules calendar. Clark will read the caption to House Bill 1452. Our representative will lever it. Of the 33rd to be entitled to amend chapter 13A of 19 of Title 19, the Fisher go to Georgia and Tated relating to dating violence protective orders so as to revise the definition and to provide for related matters. This bill ever referred to the Committee on Judiciary Non-Civil that Committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Gaines to present the bill. Apparently, I need to work on the handwriting. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm proud to present House Bill 1452, clean up language to address an issue we saw since last year we passed protections for victims of dating violence to file a temporary protective order against their abuser. We've seen issues including in my district where last year the legislation allowed while they were dating for six months since they've been dating but that has been an issue so we've extended that to 12 months and that's all this legislation does. I have to answer any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield well. I'm sorry you do. You got a question or not. Chair recognizes representative Williams Rick Williams for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I will. Have you ever been the victim of a violent date? I'm not. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The Chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The Chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye? Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machines. On the passage of House Bill 1452, the eyes are 156, the nays are zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1409. House Bill 1409, my representative, work eyes of the 157th to be entitled to amend the Chapter 9 of Title 34 of the Fish Go to George Annotated, relating to workers' compensation so to change certain provisions related to workers' compensation benefits. This bill will have referred to the Committee on Industry and Labor. That committee recommends a disbile due pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Workhizer to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an agency bill from the State Workers' Concord, which comes as a recommendation to them from the Workers' Compat Gossary Council. House Bill 1409 increases the maximum amount of benefits an employee can receive under workers' comp for a temporary total disability to $725, which is a $50 increase. The maximum amount of benefits for temporary partial disability to $483 per week, which is also a $50 increase. The maximum total compensation for a surviving spouse for an employee who died from injury in the workplace has increased $20,000 to the amount of $290,000. That is the bill. Happy to answer any questions. You do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask for your favorable consideration on 1409. We have two members who wish to be heard on the bill. The Chair recognizes Representative Stacy Evans to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning. I rise in favor of House Bill 1409, but also want to share with this body. This is pathetic, y'all. Georgia is 46th in the rates that we pay for workers' comp. 46th. We are adding $50 to the max that someone can get when they get hurt on the job. This rate that we pay right now, $675 as a max. That means a lot of people are getting less than this. Is 60% of the statewide average of weekly wages in this state. These are working people who do jobs that a lot of us in this room are not willing to do. Some jobs that are very dangerous. When they get hurt, no matter what their wage was, we say this is the most that your time is worth. Maybe if they are lucky, 60% of the statewide average. Almost every other state, I mean literally almost every other state ties their max, workers comp rate to the average state wages and they index it. They don't have to have their legislature come back and give them a $50, $50 here and $50 there. They don't have to beg like that. We're better than that. And I say this as the daughter, the granddaughter and the niece of folks that spent their whole lives working in carpet mills, sticking their hands in and out of machines to get yarn, climbing under machines to fix them so that you and I can have this plush carpet to walk on. As the sister of a lineman who climbs up on utility poles to make sure that when we flip the switch, the light comes on. As the niece of a coal miner who climbed in and out to make sure that we had the energy that we needed. And there but for the grace of God, go I. There but for the grace of God, did our family not fall in hard times because somebody got hurt. It could have happened at any moment and it happens to Georgians every day. And we talk a lot in here about wanting to support hard working Georgians. This is not helping hard working Georgians. This is insulting them. And so while I will be voting yes on this bill, I am sick that this is how we treat our folks. $675 as the max. Our neighbor to the North Tennessee. $1,022. I'm not talking about what California does or New York. Tennessee y'all. Red State. We can do better. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will. Chair recognizes representative Wolensky to speak to the bill. Thank you, Speaker. I also speak to the bill. I wish I didn't have to go after representative Evans because that was amazing. I echo all that she said. I'll just fill in some gaps real quick in terms of some of y'all may not know what workers comp is, but workers comp is a federal law and each take its aside how much is paid. Workers comp occurs because it makes it where you can't sue your employer when hurt on the job. You can see what third party but not your employer. That's where this steps in. And my biggest concern is not just about Georgia football, but we ever say we're behind Alabama. We know something's wrong. And we're behind Alabama on this. We are only one of two states who don't index. That's where the average salary income in Georgia goes up. It gets raised. We haven't raised this in three years. That means our blue collar employees, our employees who are getting hurt on the job. Their income for when they get hurt hasn't gone up in several years. But we need to get ahead by this raise that we're doing. We're still in the bottom five in the United States. In the bottom five, what we're paying workers, you get hurt on the job who do not have the ability to sue their company because that's what we're doing here and that's important. But in workers comp, we pay people the less that we're the fifth worst state in Georgia. And so I echo everything represented Evan said and I said this is a good bill because we're headed in the right direction. But we really need to catch up with other states. We are the number one state for business. And we didn't make sure now that we are also the number one state for employees. Thank you Speaker. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none the report of the committee is agreed to. All this bill now pass. All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no in the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative Wilson rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Mr. Speaker, is it not true that while we're increasing the pay out here and the advisory council has asked for this bill, the advisory council asked that at a minimum we tie this to 67% of the average wages and this is only 60%. If the gentleman so states, I'm sure he has followed that. What purpose does representative main arise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Is it not true that the Georgia workers' comp force should really have a physical therapist on it? That way they would more readily be able to tell the state of Georgia what these rates should be and how workers can get back to work quicker. Well, not a bad idea actually representative. Okay. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1409. The eyes are 158th and the knees are one. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1433. House Bill 1433 by the represent of Ballinger, the 23rd and others to be entitled to amend code section 356A11 with the official code of Georgia, and to the advisory board created and membership relative to the criminal justice coordinating council. This bill I've referred to the committee on judiciary. Now in civil that committee recommends a disbile do pass. Chair recognizes chairman Ballinger to present the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a very simple bill. Bottom behalf of the CJCC, it simply updates the definition of one of the members of the special advisory group. It also allows for parents as well as children who've been involved with DJJ to sit on the advisory board. And if we pass this legislation, it brings us into conformity with federal regs and laws and it protects. We're subject to lose at least 20 to 25% of the grant if we don't bring it into conformity. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Do you yield for questions? Yes sir. Chair recognizes representative Cannon. Do you're left for a question? Thank you. Do you yield? Yes ma'am. Can you tell us more about why we were out of compliance or out of uniformity? It was just an update that the federal, the Congress had done. They had updated their definition of one of the positions. And so we needed to bring ours into conformance with that. Okay just to follow up, do you spread the yield? So when did that happen? I'm not sure. Within the last year. If there are no more questions. There are no more questions. I yield the well, Nassarie, your favorite, what consideration? Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here's none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee? Which was favorable to the passage of the bill. The chair here's none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. And the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 1433. The eyes are 158 to nasor zero. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 934. House Bill 934, I was an Elever to the 33rd. No, this is being titled an act to amend part one of Article 5A of Chapter 8 and Title 48. The official vote of Georgia is headed relating to special district mass transportation sales and use tax. So it's a revive for the maximum amount of time frame for the collection of such tax when an intergovernment agreement has been entered into. This bill ever referred to committee on ways and means. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Chair recognizes the chief deputy whip of the majority caucus representative, Elever to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House is my pleasure to present to you for your consideration House Bill 934 this morning. This bill amends the single county T-splots statute. That is the transportation and special purpose local option sales tax. It does not affect the regional T-splots, which many of us are familiar with. It's just the single county T-splots. About 40 counties currently have this throughout the state. Currently the tax, if approved by the voters of the county, runs until a certain amount stated in the ballot question is collected and then it ends. Under this bill, the single county T-splots could run for a specific period of time up to five years as stated in the ballot question. If the county and the cities within the county have an intergovernmental agreement governing what projects the tax can be spent upon. Of course, they still have to be transportation projects, but this is a way just to specify what the money will be used for and make sure they've got consensus among the other jurisdictions. And this brings the single county T-splots in line with every other splot tax that I'm aware of where it was levied for a period of time. The bill does not diminish or take away any of the current guardrails that apply to the single county T-splots such as the intergovernmental agreement, such as the need for passing a resolution by the county to call the referendum. The voters have to approve the imposition of the tax and a referendum and there also is a reporting obligation after the taxes imposed to make sure the proceeds are being spent appropriately. This bill is not retroactive. It does not affect any of the current T-splots. It would apply only once those run out if the counties were too levy and knew when or if a county that currently doesn't have a T-splot, levy is one going forward after the effective date of that, this act. So it doesn't do anything to change those T-splots that are currently in effect. It's just prospective in its operation. And I would ask that you please favorably consider this. It's supported by ACCG and GMA and I think it puts another good tool in the two box for our counties and avoids the sort of flick in the light switch which is frustrating till our local merchants where the tax is imposed and then it's not imposed and then gets re-imposed and it's not imposed again. So I would ask your single, your favorable consideration will yield the welfare questions. Do you yield for questions? Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman. Chair recognizes the minority caucus whip representative Wilkerson for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Just for my understanding, in a regular splot, not a T-splot, if there are excess funds and you completed the projects, you can either, I believe, like a school system can either buy down the military or refund it back to taxpayers. In this case, is there any such mechanism or would just go toward building more roads or building whatever transit projects you're dealing? Under the amendment, it just simply provides, you can levy for a period of time. I believe currently the splot ends when a stated amount is collected and it's not available for applying to other counts of expenditures or debt. Thank you for the question. Do you further yield? Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, do you recognize as Chairman Carfender? Do you ride for a question? Does the gentleman yield? Yes, sir. Is it not true that it's very difficult on your local retailers when tax rates change midstream?

with this. Yes, sir. I would seek to help keep uniformity for all your retailers so they know what to charge the consumer when they're coming to buy their products. Absolutely. Thank you for that question. That's an excellent point. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will yield the well and ask your favourable consideration of House Bill 934. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favourable, to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee has agreed to shall this bill now pass all those in favour of the passage of the bill. We'll vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. What purpose does representative singleton rise? Parliamentary inquiry. State your inquiry. Yes, sir, I wish I could have had a chance to ask my question. Is it not true that this bill would remove the dollar amount on the ballot question, therefore not putting a cap on the amount of funds raised? And is it not further true that this bill would allow counties to raise beyond, if they reach their goal, let's say it's 100 million, it would allow them to raise beyond their stated goal? Well, in the time that it took you to ask the parliamentary inquiry, you could have walked down here and asked representative Lebritt, and I'm sure it would have told you, and if you still want to do that, I'll indulge you a few seconds. What purpose does chairman workhizer rise? A few waves. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 934. The eyes are 150. The nays are 8. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 895. House Bill 895, I was in a crow of the 110th and others to be entitled to amend chapter 16 and title 17 of the official go to Georgia annotated relating the discovery and criminal procedure. So as a survivor of restrictions in the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information of non sworn employees of law enforcement agencies, this bill haven't referred to committee on judiciary non civil. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Crow to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, this House Bill 895. It is a GBI bill. Currently law enforcement officers, sworn law enforcement officers are not required to have their personal information, their home address and phone number given out as part of a witness list to the defendant in prosecution if they are testifying for the prosecution. That same courtesy is not given to non sworn employees of law enforcement agencies. For example, your crime scene technicians and your crime lab scientists. And all this bill does is to give them those same protection so if they are testifying for the prosecution in a criminal case, they don't have to give out their personal information to the defense. So with that, I will yield for questions, Mr. Speaker. You have no questions. Thank you. I yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass? All those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. Have all members voted? Have all members voted? So the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 895. The eyes are 156. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 1232. House Bill 1232, members, an apartment of the fifth and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 16111-12 in Chapter 2, Title 40. The official code of Georgia and Saturday relating the vehicles with false or secret compartments and registration and licensing of motor vehicles, so it's a revised terminology. This bill I'm referring to the committee on motor vehicles. I committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Barton to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, colleagues. This is the bill from the Department of Revenue. The bill cleans up terminology for making it from a temporary, license plate to a temporary operating permit. The reason why the auto industry, new and used and the Department of Revenue, they call them tops and this just makes it to where it's consistent and lived together. And that's pretty much it, Mr. Speaker. If there's no questions, I'll ask for a paperful opinion. No questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none.

If all members voted, if all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1232. The eyes are 157. The nays are zero. House Bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 725. House Bill 725, I have a limit of the 99th and others being titled an act to amend code section 441228. The fish go to George annotated relating to counsel on American Indians concerned, created membership, assignment for administrative purposes, terms of office. Mr. Lamon referred to the committee on state properties and community affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by rules committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Marvin Lyom to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hello again, colleagues. Today I ask for your favorable consideration on HB725. It's a bill with a slightly different subject matter, but ultimately still one regarding localized, self governance and self determination. And certainly, thus of great importance. As you may or may not know, the state of Georgia has a counsel on American Indian concerns under the Department of Natural Resources. The scope of which beyond the self explanatory title is to ensure proper burial and artifact preservation to promote cultural heritage and to support the economic development of our indigenous Americans in the state. What this bill seeks to do is to ensure that the council's membership will always have representation by at least one member from each of our state recognized tribes of which we currently have three. The Georgia tribe of Eastern Cherokee in North Georgia. The Cherokee of Georgia in the southeast and the Lower Muscogee Creek tribe in the Southwest. In addition, with the urging of the council and the three tribes, the bill updates the codification of the addresses for each of those tribes. As all three do have new addresses and have thus requested this information be updated. While this appears clerical on its face, this is very important because oftentimes people do have trouble reaching out and ultimately connecting with them, which was certainly true in my experience during my initial outreach to each of the three a few years ago. Given their importance to our history and our need to support their visibility and ultimately their flourishing, it becomes necessary to ensure that in a quite literal sense they can be found. That is what this bill attempts to do and I am grateful for the council on American Indian concerns and the three tribes for supporting and entrusting me with these simple but meaningful updates. I ask for your favourable consideration. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield for any questions. You do have a question. Do you yield? I do yield. Chair recognizes Chairman Darley and Taylor to your left for a question. I do. I want to thank you very much for bringing this bill. I do have in my district, the low Miss Guggy Creek and they really appreciate all your hard work on this. Thank you. I thank Chairman Taylor for helping sure we got the absolute correct addresses. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well and ask for your favourable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is done. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to withdrawing the committee substitute? The chair here is done. The committee substitute is withdrawn. Is there any objection to adopting the substitute offered by the committee on rules? The chair here is done. The rules committee substitute is adopted.

The report of the committee is agreed to shall this bill now pass. All those in favour of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. All members voted. Have all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 725. The eyes are 156. The nasor zero.

House Bill 1391, members of Governor of the eighth and others to be entitled to amend Article 2, Chapter 12, Title 17 of the official go to George Ante, relating to public defenders. Those are revised, the compensation public defenders and assistant public defenders. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary non-civil committee recommends a disbile due pass. Senator recognizes Chairman Gunter to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 1391 raises the pay of the Circuit Public Defender to equal that of the district attorney. It also bumps the pay of the assistant public defender, which is category 4 by 5%. So they would receive 95% of the pay of the public defender. This isn't done in order to retain better qualified attorneys for that position. And that's basically what the bill is about. If we pass the budget, it will be covered in the budget. I'll yield for any questions. You do not appear to have any. I yield the well and ask for your favorite book consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none.

This bill then referred to the committee on defense and veteran affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. There recognizes chairman heath Clark to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I have House Bill 1343. It does two things. It removes the requirement in the annual report that the Aged General provides to the public that the requirement to list the commission officer's names. This is a security concern that they have in today's environment. And also to print and distribute all the laws every year to their units in the Georgia Department of Defense. And currently they have to contract to print and distribute so this will save money and they will they already do make their digitized and so they are available to all their units online. So that's the bill and I will yield for any questions. You have a couple of questions if you care to yield. I will yield. Chair recognizes chairman Parsons to your left for a question. Thank you, Speaker. General Manile. I will yield. I apologize. This is a tree for not asking about this earlier. Just one to acquire. There's the law applied equally to commissions and in lessons personnel. There's no requirement for them to list NCO officers. So there's only a requirement for the list of commission officers and this removes that requirement. Very good. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I will yield the well and ask for the members favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair here is none. The committee substitute is adopted.

House Bill 1438 by the motion of Thomas the 21st and others be titled an act to amend chapter 2, title 32 of the fiscal to George Antony relayed in the Department of Transportation so as to amend notice provisions relative to meetings for the election of board members of the committee. The committee recommends the disbilled do pass. Chair recognizes representative Brad Thomas to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I present HB 1438. This is the Department of Housekeeping Bill. The bill does four things. Section 1 allows for notification of election of board member via email, which I'm sure we would all appreciate. Section 2 clarifies the language with a technical correction and replaces requests for proposals with requests for proposal revisions, which is important because during the proposal process sometimes the scope is revised slightly. Section 3 provides an additional reference to the authorized rules and regulations of the Department covering alternative contracting methods. Section 4 seeks to make it absolutely clear that no one can abuse the Open Records Act to obtain personal information on our Georgia drivers. With that, that's the presentation of the bill. I'll yield for one question and then yield the well. You have no questions? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ask for your favorable consideration. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to.

If so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 1438. The eyes are 157. The nays are two. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Clerk will read the caption to House Bill 689. The case is registered to House Bill 689 to be entitled to amend Article 2 of Chapter 3 of Chapter 35. The official Court of Georgia and its tentative relating to the Georgia Crime Information Center is also repaid that persons who were victims of an offense and trafficking may petition to clerk court to have sealed certain criminal history record information maintained by the clerk. This bill I refer to the committee on judiciary noncivil. That committee recommends that the bill do pass. Chair recognizes Chairman Gaines to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 689 cleans up some important legislation that we passed a couple of years ago to protect survivors of human trafficking. This legislation fixes an unintentional statutory requirement that these survivors wait two years before asking a court to restrict and seal their offence. Legislature, I don't believe ever intended for that waiting period to apply. And so this ensures that human trafficking survivors are able to immediately have their offence vacated. And Mr. Speaker, I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any. You do have a question if you care to yield. I will. Chair recognizes representative McLaren. Do you ride for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As a gentleman, yield. I will. I'll start by trying to immunize myself from the type of admonition the speaker delivered about asking the author of the bill before doing this. Try to chase you down on the floor. The concern that I have, maybe a couple of colleagues have, and I'm probably ultimately going to vote yes, so I just want to make you as friendly as possible, but I want to understand. With law enforcement official who comes in the possession of restricted information, sealed information, for whatever reason goes rogue, decides a public, a publicized that information, what are the types of penalties or prohibitions in the code section or the statutes to make sure that they're, you know, what's the limitation on using that sealed information and properly? You know, I don't think that's something that we address in this bill, but certainly I'd be open to looking at something to address that issue, but I don't think that that would be something that, you know, I don't think it's addressed in this legislation. I think that need to be a separate measure, but certainly open to that. Okay. I mean, and I guess just to flag it, the concern is just, I assume that what you're doing in line 32, 33 is just codifying what the access that law enforcement agencies already think they have. That's right. So in practice, and that's the second part of the measure is it does allow and clarifies that criminal justice agencies have access to, you know, these records. That is already happening under the legislation we passed a couple years ago, Senate bill 288 that allowed for record restrictions on misdemeanors. They're already have access to that, but it's just clarifying it in law. That's correct. Well, I support your bill and I appreciate you taking time to clarify. Thank you. Thank you. You have another question if you're here to yield. I'll yield for one more. Chair recognizes representative Jasmine Clark to your left for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman yield? I will. This is actually a really simple question. I just want to make sure I'm reading the same bill. What LC number are you working for? LC 413032. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well and ask for the body's favorit will consideration House Bill 688. Is there any object? I'm sorry. We had one more member that wished to be heard. Chair recognizes representative Beesmore to speak to the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you, colleagues. Thank you to representative Gaines. We have been passing extraordinary bills to help our children in human trafficking. And for those of you that may not know, part of my district sits at the busiest airport in the world and over 30 hotels, which is a recipe for human trafficking. And I have been working closely with the First Lady Marty Kemp for over three years on this issue and law enforcement and others. So I so appreciate it and I will be voting for this bill and I encourage you all to do the same. I yield the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none. The previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? The chair here is none. The report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all those in favor of the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no and the clerk will unlock the machines. If all members voted, if all members voted, if so, the clerk will lock the machines on the passage of House Bill 689. The eyes are 159. The nasors zero. This bill having received the requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. We'll create the caption to House Bill 1004. House Bill 1004 by resident of Maynard, 56, and others to be entitled back to them. Title 20, the fiscal to Georgia and tentative related to education. So it's a drive for the establishment of unified campus police forces through agreement centered into bi colleges and universities. This bill having referred to the committee on public safety and Homeland Security. That committee recommends this bill do pass by committee substitute. Chair recognizes representative Maynard to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, colleagues. This is a really simple bill. In my district, it's more House Bill, in Clark, Mars, Brown, and several other HBCUs. They're the only consortium in the state of Georgia. And right now, if a crime is happening on one campus, the police on the separate campus cannot cross over into the other persons campus. They have to call 911. So this bill just simply allows the colleges and the AUCC to enter into an agreement. And this has been vetted by the Sheriff's Association. Every college president of these universities also signed a letter of support as well as the Atlanta Police Foundation. And I would love your favorable support. And I'll yield the will. Do you owe for any questions? It's up to you. Who is that? You know, I've never had anybody ask that question. The representative just looked at me and said, who is it? You got to love it. And I'm not going to tell you. I yield the will.

Very intelligent move. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? The chair here is none the previous question is ordered.

Spaker that given some of the events the last few years Whenever we expand the jurisdiction or the authority of law enforcement that traditionally don't take on a full Law enforcement role that the very least duty that we owe our constituents is to at least apply strict scrutiny and ask why those additional law enforcement powers are necessary to expand Gentlemen so states All right final inquiry What purpose of chairman Collins rise parliamentary inquiry mr.
