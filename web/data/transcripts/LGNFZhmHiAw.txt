----------
Your state represents the left of you and serves as a page of your working health for residents. This is a great honor and you should be proud of switching the conversation. As a page, you will ask your liaison between musicians and representatives by distributing the messages and its homage. But still, over some of the rules to follow while falling through you as a health page. All pages must sign in complete registration. See this under the age of 16 as you sign in and out by parent or garden. However, see this under the age of 16 you have provided your own grants for taking to the capital. Without a parent or garden, you may complete sign in registration and check out on your end. You may not choose on, run or leave while falling in the house floor and choose messy or in at all times. Please your friends leave in cell friends or leave as a left-climbing device. Always walk along the outer areas of the house floor to deliver messages and left instructor that allows. Always deliver messages from the front of the message and never from the back to the lock wall instead of out. Now that we have gone out of these rules to follow and let us be stressed by when she's performing the deed. See some light pages in the back of the house, can't avoid you will see it and take some still free messages to the representative. At registration, you will have a season yellow split with your representative's name and receiving cut. Once the session is made, you will be struckly by the page staff to deliver the yellow split to your representative as a way to introduce yourself. The page staff is the designated area for retrieving messages to deliver the representative. If you return the message from the page staff upon returning to the chamber, please proceed through the center towards and meet it to a page staff member. If the representative is away from their depth when he delivers a message, can he leave the message on their depth? The message will look like this on the paper. The page staff will write a code that represents the location of the representative's depth. The house floor is divided into four sections, A, B, B, and B. This letter is the first part of the code that represents the section in which the guest is loading. The next code is the number specified in which rows the representative is set. The last part is the seat number in that row. At the first three times during the section day, the page person is cordon anger or a member of the first staff will inform you that it is time to have the same exact same with the picture and your representative. Once your side is taped, the page staff will guide you to not be much. If there is time available, they will also pay you on a tour of the panel. At the end of the page, you must sign up at the page staff in order to receive your package with your certificate and your page. The certificate will serve as your page there for paying for your support. Remember, your school must count you as credit. It's not in the fees or unites fees out by state law who are credit. Now, if you know the rules and views of these page, let's review. All pages must completely stretch in that fine and human. Only steps and deliver messages that have been approved and given to you by a page staff member may not be done running or being followed on the health floor and chief messenger when it all comes. If you are not eligible to leave the capital building for any point in them unless there is an emergency, if your key health is represented with life's safety for starting the day as a page, your hard work will help the process run smoothly and will help keep the representatives informed.

We're going to have the morning row call. All members present will please vote green to signify their presence in the chamber. Mr. Clerk will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. Yes. Yes. Yes. The clerk will lock the machine. Door keepers will you please close the doors and keep them closed? Well, we have a chaplain today is going to bring a little sunshine on a cloudy day a bit. Come on up, brother, take. If you'll sit right here. Our chaplain this morning, as as our custom, we will begin our day with scripture reading and prayer by our chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the flag of our country. Our chaplain this morning will be introduced by the lady from the 82nd House District represented Karen Mathyag, representing Mathyag. Good morning and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Wow, what a day to have Pastor Benny Tate here today. Not only with this crazy weather, but just we need that ray of sunshine. You are so right, Pastor, our speaker. Today, I not only want to welcome his staff, but we also have the eighth graders from Rock Springs, Christian Academy. And I'd love for them to stand and just see how great these kids are. And I'm just so proud that they're here. And thank you. Thank you. Representative Clint Crowe is also a member of Rock Springs Christian Academy's school board. So we're excited to have Clint representing not only the school, but us there. But today, Pastor Benny brought Pastor Kenny Chester, Pastor Clay Chastine, Pastor Gordon Powers, and the illustrious Don Mapp. And I'm so glad that you always come and visit with us too. It's always good to see you. Without further ado, I don't think Pastor Benny needs a whole lot of introduction. He comes and blesses us every year. And it's with my great pleasure that I get to represent, or I get to present my pastor, Pastor Benny Tate. Thank you. Speaker, thank you. God bless you. Good morning. Great to be here. And I just simply want to begin by saying, I appreciate you. And hey, folks, I realized it's a rainy day, but it's still a good day. It's still a good day because this is the day that the Lord has made. I remember getting up and saying to my wife, one morning, good morning. And she said, good morning. And then she said, Benny, do you know what today is? Now, I began to think what is today? Is today our anniversary? Is today my wife's birthday? Tell you how to always remember your wife's birthday. That's just forget it one year, amen? But nevertheless, I went on to work called a lady in our church and said, send Barbara some flyers. They said, what's the occasion? I said, just do what I said. Just send the flyers to Barbara. And there's a little boutique that we shop at in Griff in Georgia. I think the name of its Walmart. I ran by there, picked her up a nice blouse, went to the house and said, Barbara tonight, we're going to go out and celebrate. We're going to go celebrate. And we went out and we had a wonderful evening. I mean, literally, Applebees had more of those two for 25. And it was just wonderful. And we were getting ready to retire for the night. And I said, Barbara, it's been a great day, hadn't it? She said, Benny, it has been a great day. I said, you know, Barbara, I didn't forget that. She said, Benny, you did not forget. She said, you know, Benny, I believe it's been the greatest groundhog today. I've ever experienced. Well, folks, it's a rainy day, but this is the day that the Lord had made. And we get to rejoice and be glad in it. I want to share verse of scripture. Look, and say what a list of tailors said to her eighth husband. I'm not going to keep you along, but I want to share verse of scripture. It's in Philippians chapter 3 verse 13. This is what the Bible says. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things, which are before, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things that are before. For about 35 years, I've been coming to this capital every year. And it's always at the beginning of the year. And so I want to talk to you about how to have a good year, how to have a good year this year. That'd be relevant to all of us. Two simple steps, and you can stick a fork in me I'm done. The first step to having a good year is we got to settle the past. You know, a lot of people are not going to have a good year in 2025, because they haven't gotten past 2024. And they hadn't gotten past 2017. They hadn't gotten past 2015. But if we're going to have a good year, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to settle the past. We've got to let our guilt go and realize God didn't come to rub our sins in. He came to rub them out. We've got to let our grief go and realize that if we've got a pulse, God still got a plan. We've got to let our glory go. I hear me and my age talking about when they played high school football. Get over it, amen. But I'll tell you something else we got to do. We got to let our grudges go. Grudges go. Let me tell you about Hazel Von Jekki. Hazel Von Jekki, ladies, was 94 years old. And as far as I know, Hazel Von Jekki had never had a date. She was an old maid. She never had a date. 94 years old. Hazel Von Jekki died. And she left some specific instructions for her funeral. This is what she said. She said, I want no male polymers. And this is what she said. She said, if they wouldn't take me out when I was alive, I don't want them taking me out now that I'm dead. Well, that's holding on to the grudge, amen. But I just want to encourage you today. I just want to encourage you today to settle the past. That is to say, just let it go. And then there's one other thing I'd say to you. Not only settle the past, but I would encourage you to start praying. Start praying. See, prayer is the difference between the best you can do and the best God can do. I've never stood here what I was not honored. But this whole deal about praying in the capital is not a new thing. See, there was a man by the name of Ben Franklin. And they were meeting in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia. And Mr. Speaker, they had argued for about five weeks. They couldn't agree on state's rights. And Mr. Ben Franklin stood up and it's the reason why, by the way, I'm speaking here today. He said, we need the Father of Lights to illuminate our minds. He said, man, if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without God noticing it, do we think a nation can rise without his aid? And Mr. Ben Franklin led that body in prayer. And by the way, that's the reason why I'm here today. And we still have this as a part of our Constitution. Because we need wisdom from somewhere else other than us. Probably most of us can agree that Abraham Lincoln was a pretty good president. I think with that something, no matter which side you're on and by the way, for somebody that said, Brother Benny, what do you think about a right wing? What do you think about left wing? I'm for the whole bird. Because see, I believe everybody's got needs. And the other day, I believe we all have basically the same needs. But Abraham Lincoln led our country, folks, during a very difficult time. We can agree on that. And when our country was so divided during the Civil War, he said these words. He said, I've been driven in my knees by an overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My wisdom and all about me seemed insufficient in the day. I got up this morning and rushed into the day. I had so much to accomplish. I didn't have time to pray. Problem was just tumbled about me. Hever came each task. Why doesn't God help me? He replied you didn't ask. I wanted to see Joanne Beauty, but the day told on Gray and Bleak. I wondered why God doesn't help me. He replied, oh, Benny, you didn't seek. I got up this morning. I paused before entering the day. I had so much to accomplish. I had to take time to pray. Let me tell you one more story. And I mean this in conclusion. Little girl stayed all night, Mr. Speaker, one night with my daughter and that little girl didn't go to church. And I was preaching at the church that Sunday morning. And I said just what I said, in conclusion, Miss Jan, and that little girl said to my daughter, what does it mean when your daddy says in conclusion? She said absolutely nothing. But I'll promise you today, in conclusion. Let me tell you about this pastor. And he had this cat that climbed up in a tree in the backyard was afraid to come down. That pastor, he offered it warm milk, the kitten wouldn't come down. The tree was not sturdy enough to climb. So he decided that he tied a roof to his car and drove away. And the tree could be bent down. He could reach up. He could grab the kitten all the while. He was checking his progress in the car frequently. He figured if he just went a little bit further, the tree would be bent down and he could reach the kitten. But as he moved a little further, the rope broke. The tree went booing and the kittens sailed out of sight. The pastor felt terrible. He walked all over the neighborhood trying to find that cat. And finally he did what we need to do. He said, God, I just pray and I commit that kitten to your care. That pastor a few days later was in the local grocery store and he saw a lady in his church and she had a grocery card and it was full of cat food. And he knew that that lady hated cats. And he said, why are you buying this cat food when I know that you hate cats? She said, Pastor, you won't believe this. But she said, my daughter has been begging for a cat. And I told her, honey, if God gives you a cat, I'll let you keep it. And she said, preacher, I only you would believe this. She said, preacher, she goes out in the backyard. She gets down on her knees and she starts praying for a cat. And she said, Pastor, I wouldn't believe this if I hadn't seen it with my bare own eyes. But suddenly flying out the blue sky with its poles, out spread a cat landed right in front of her. And then she said, Pastor, don't you ever underestimate the power of prayer. Can we all stand? Can we do that? I want you to know from the bottom of my heart, I love you, I appreciate you. What you do is a sacrifice. It's a sacrifice to your family. It's a sacrifice to yourself. And I just want to, from the bottom of my heart, from the speaker on down to the first term representative. Thank you for your service. I mean that. Probably don't get told that a lot. But I greatly appreciate what you do. Eighth grade class. I'm so honored to have you all here today. Hey, would you make them welcome more and more time? Let us pray. Our most kind gracious Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads in our hearts in your presence. I want to thank you for this body. I want to thank you for speaker burns. I thank you for every member, Lord, and the sacrifice they make for our state. They truly are servants. And I appreciate their service. I ask you, God, would you just bless them? I ask you, would you just give them wisdom? I pray not only for them, but I pray for their families, Lord, because there's mates that are sacrificing and children that are sacrificing. And so I just pray for families. So God, I ask you, would you bless them and keep them? Make your face to shine upon them. Be gracious and to them. Would you lift your count and expel them? And may they experience your peace for I pray this prayer in Jesus name. Amen. Mr. Speaker, before we pledge, can I do one thing? Talking about good Presidents, I think George Washington was pretty good President too, don't you say that? George Washington said these words. He said, we can't govern. We can't govern without God and the Bible. We can't govern. He said, without God and the Bible. And this is a rock springs Bible. And it's my honor and privilege to present this Bible to your speaker, speaker John Burns. Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, are you listening? Yes. Yes. Yes. Mr. Karen said, Benny, will you do one other thing? I'll do it. She's asking me. She said, would you pray for the chief of staff, Terry England? I said, I'd be honored to. I'd be honored to. Yeah, I mean, I know we're out of protocol, but I think it's always right to pray. Don't you all? Okay. Lord, I do even right now. You tell us and the prayer faith should save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up. And God, I'm asking you to continue to raise up Terry England. I ask you to touch this man. Be with his family. Be with his precious wife. I know this is difficult time. And we just ask you for continual healing in cross name. Amen. Thank you, brother Benny. Members, I know you all know what I know. Terry England is getting better because of the power of prayer. And I know this gentleman and his team and his church have already been praying for him. So thank you, brother Benny. And thank you for that message this morning. The door keeper, you may unlock the doors, members. You may join brother Benny in the south any room for a photo and greet him and thank you from his service here today. Members, we have a doctor of the day. It's Dr. Andrea Huntley. She is brought to us by Representative Lauren McDonald. Thank you, Miss. Representative McDonald for bringing our doctor of the day.

Title 7, the official code of Georgia and it's headed related to banking and finance. It was to update terminology. This bill has been for its committee on banks and banking. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Members, we're on the rules calendar. We have a couple of bills. This is our first bill, House Bill 15, Representative Bruce. Williamson from Walton County and Monroe has recognized to present the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Pastor Tate this morning, a reminder of the song that he thought that Groundhog Day was his wife's birthday. Well, today's not Groundhog Day, but it is Vicky Williamson's birthday. So if you all happen to see my wife in the hall, wish her happy birthday for me. But today, I bring for you the annual House Bill this year for the Department of Banking and Finance. This year, the bill number is 15. And like in the years past, this is about the 10th year we've been modernizing and simplifying our banking code. It's the Department of Banking and Finance and House keeping bill. The Department works very closely with affected industries, everything from our credit unions, banks, money service lenders, Georgia's dominant lenders association, mortgage bankers and servicers, the whole ecosystem for our banking products and works with the industry to make sure that where they're proposing, changing, applications and background checks and such as that, that there's no unintended consequences in this year. Once again, there's no objection to this bill. All the industry is in favor of it. Have nobody spoken against it. It came out of the Department of Banking and Banking, I mean out of the Banking Committee unanimously and there's been no, these bills get let out even nationally. And any inbound questions we've had from out of state people, we've been able to answer any questions they have. So Mr. Speaker, that's the bill. Be happy to answer any questions. Otherwise, I'll be willing to yield the will. Gentlemen, you go for a question. Yes, sir, I do. Representative Wade has a question to your right. Does gentleman yield? I do. Just want to make sure, is it not true that House Bill 15 aims to modernize, Georgia's banking and financial regulations as you've done for over a decade to ensure quality service for our consumers in this state? That's correct. Thank you. You may have no further questions, sir. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the will and ask for your favorable consideration. The gentleman's yield is the will. Is there an objection to the previous question being ordered? Here he none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report to the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here he none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass, I'll in favor the passage of the bill. We'll vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted if so. Not quite. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine. On the passage of House Bill 1515, the yeas are 163, the nays are one. The bill has received a requisite constitutional majority. Is therefore passed. Okay, we're going to talk about South Georgia for a moment. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 5555? House Bill 55, I represent a 4 to the 170th and others to be entitled to amend Code Section 1562, the fiscal to Georgia and antenna relating the number of judges, the superior courts, so it's to provide for additional judges, the superior courts of the little Lapa Ha, judicial circuit. What circuit was that, Clerk? Mr. Clerk? A Lapa Ha. That's it. My tone gets tied all the time. I like it when yours does, so I get the correct. The Lapa Ha, the lady from a Lapa Ha who's feeling some very big shoes is recognized to present the bill. Representative Ford, thank you so much for bringing this to the judicial system. Members of your give the lady and the will, your attention. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and fellow members, for the opportunity to introduce to you, House Bill 55, which adds a third judge to the Lapa Ha judicial circuit. I'd also like to thank my colleagues and co-signers, some of who represent districts in this circuit for their support on this bill. The Lapa Ha, circuit includes Atkinson, Berrien, clinch, cook, and Lanier counties, and rank number one on the Judicial Council's Work Lead Study. But a lot has changed since the district received its second judge back in 1979. Over the last 45 years, our five counties have seen a 33% increase in population. Case counts have doubled due to increased crime rates. Divorce rates have increased over 60% nationwide. Lawsuits have increased, and landlord-tenant disputes have increased as well. Luckily, one-third of our civil cases involve self-represented citizens, people without means for an attorney. Several of you attorneys understand this and know that these cases can take longer. To ensure justice, the judge has to explain the proceedings, slow down, refute, fileings, and continue cases to allow these citizens seeking justice and opportunity to correct their clerical mistakes. So the cases can be judged on the merits. It takes time. I'd like to point out that this area is mostly rural with a poverty rate of 26%. I would also like to note that I-75, which runs from Miami to Detroit, runs right through the heart of Cook County in this circuit, bringing with it over 55,000 cars across the area daily. If all that traffic comes in uptick in drug trafficking, as well as human trafficking, and a myriad of gang activity. So don't be misled. We are rural Georgia, but we have big city crime. To the point that Governor Camp, along with Attorney General Chris Carr, came to Cook County to do a gang task force roundtable with FBI, GBI, and the drug task force just a few years ago. Lastly, I would like to mention that we have unanimous support for the additional judgeship among all five counties in the district, along with amenities and the physical space to support the position. Funding for this position is in the Governor's 2026 proposed budget. On behalf of the citizens of this circuit, I would appreciate your support of House Bill 55, and that access to justice it will bring for the communities in the Lapa Hall Judicial Circuit. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I welcome questions. Well, I want to remind you of something now representative. I think this is the first time you've been in the well. So here's how this is going to go. I know you've read the rules. So you have a couple of questions. And I'm going to recognize the member for a question. They're going to ask you to yield for a question. You don't have to yield. I don't have to yield. It's up to you. It's up to you. We're going to start with the gentleman from down in that neck of the woods, Ripley Chaz Cannon to your right for a question. Does the gentleman lady yield? I do. What jurisdiction would this new Superior Court judge have? Ten fourths the laws. No further questions, Mr. Speaker. Ask an answer. Gentlemen, right up the center representative Gamble has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman lady yield? I do. Good. I've noticed it here on line 64 section 7. It talks about the qualifications of the additional judge. Can you elaborate on what those qualifications are? On line 67. 64. 64. Let's see. I would think it would need to be a good, right, honest person, a good character and good morals. Very good. Thank you for your explanation. You have a couple of more. Let's see. A gentleman down in that area too. Representative Dexter Sharper to your left in the back has a question. Thank you, Speaker. Would the gentleman lady yield? I will. Is it true today that when I walk near you, you said you have a nice outfit on and you look good today. And I'm going to be doing my first bill today if you can help me. Is that true? Yes, it is. All right. And you always let us. I like her states. All right. Representative Sharper. To your left, Representative Park Cannon. Is it recognized for a question? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I do. Are there any women on this court? Not presently. There are no, there are no ladies there. We have to gentlemen. This will maybe give it an opportunity, right, with a new judge. A couple more. Let's see. Repetit. Chairman John Corbett from down in southwest Georgia. Mr. Chairman's recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman lady yield? I do. The code of judicial conduct, the ethical standards, the KUC holds judges against. It's called the judicial cannons. Can you tell this chamber what those seven cannons are? I can't help you. Representative Corbett. I can't tell you those things, but I can tell you this is a great bill for the great people at the great state of Georgia, more specifically for the lapahog judicial circuit, which is also your district is in and you signed on to this bill. So I appreciate your support. And with that, I will yield. Well, we're going to watch the board to see how Repetit Corbett votes, but I think I know. I think I know. Thank the ladies. You're to the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to adopting the committee substitute? The chair has none. The committee substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee is agreed to. Shall this bill now pass all in favor of the passage of the bill? Will vote yes, all those opposed? Will vote no, and the clerk will unlock the machine. Well. Let's see if he can help you. Let's see if he can help you. For what purpose does Chairman Weedauer arise? We need to see if we get. Parliament's reenquisher. State your inquiry. Is it not true that if the representative had simply just read the entire bill to us, it would have been a shorter presentation? I'll let you make that remark. I won't agree with you on that one. The lady did an excellent job. I think the gentleman has a point. I'm glad you were the well. The last one. The dean of this house. Representative Green from down there in South Georgia. I think the gentleman has a point. I'm glad you were the well. The last one. The dean of this house. Representative Green from down there in South Georgia has recognized. Parliament's reenquired. Is it not true that former representative from the area has just called me and said all of y'all better vote for this bill. I don't know how long she worked on this bill, but I'll tell you what. Looks like they may get a judge. If all members now voted, all members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of the bill. We like to see North Georgia and South Georgia working together on the passage of the bill. The yeas are a 100 house bill 55. I'm still. The yeas are 166 and the nay is one. This bill haven't received a record of the constitutional majority. Therefore, passed. Congratulations, Representative Ford. Good job. I like the way you used the well. That was the most important thing you did. Great work. I'm sure this will help that judicial circuit. Your work was easy here. It's over in the Senate where you have a problem. I'm missing how that works out for you. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 137137? House Bill 137, my representative Anderson, the 10th and others to be in the title of an act to amend chapter 10 of the title 13. The district court of Georgia annotated a delay in the contracts for public works. So it's an increase in dollar value, certain public work contracts exempt from provisions. This bill I'm referring to the committee on government affairs. That committee recommends that this bill do pass. Representative Anderson, you recognize, but I have a quick question before you begin. You've been practicing presenting this bill. Have you not? Yes. You've presented it before this House. How many times? Twice. It's good bill. So Representative Chairman Anderson has recognized to present a House Bill 137. Gentlemen's recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've heard the comment made many times. The third time is the charm. And I'm hoping that is the case colleagues. House Bill 137 is a three-peat. We've passed it out of this chamber two times. Two years ago, we passed House Bill 193, which was, in essence, the core portion of this bill. It made it all the way to the governor's desk. Did not have some things that the governor wanted in it. So we, they decided to veto the bill. We reintroduced it last year, adding those items in. It passed out. Got held up in the Senate rules. So I'm asking you for your support again. House Bill 137 increases the bid limits for public works purchasing projects from $100,000 or $250,000. The $100,000 limit was set in 2001, that's 24 years ago. We have taken into account the inflationary factor since that time to settle at a number that is close to what it should have been at this point anyway. This bill covers municipalities, counties, consolidating governments, state agencies, and school systems. And Mr. Speaker, with that, I will yield for questions. Gentlemen, has no questions. Thank you. And I ask for your favorable consideration. I'll draw you on the well. He's yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here in none, the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to report to the committee, which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Here in none, the report of the committee has agreed to. Shout this bill now passed. All in favor of the passage of the bill. Will vote yes. All those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? All members voted. All members voted. If so, the clerk will lock the machine on the passage of House Bill 137 the yeas are 152. The nays are nine. This bill hasn't received a requisite constitutional majority. Is there for the past? Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 199. 199. House Bill 199, my resolution of killing the 16th and others to be titled back to amend chapter 5 and total 15. The district of Georgia and the administrative of courts have record generally. So it's the model by provisions related to protection of personally identifiable information of judges and their spouses. Ms. Bill, I'm referred to the committee on judiciary. That committee recommends that this bill do pass by committee substitute. Representative Tray Kelly is recognized to present the bill. Representative Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House. Last year, this body made the policy decision that we were going to give our judges and their spouses an opportunity to have their personally identifiable information redacted when it comes to websites or information at the city, county or state level. The reason for doing this is because we had seen instances of judges being targeted and swatted at their homes, harass at their homes and through their cell phones. What we decided to do at that time was to ask our judges through our administrative office of the courts to compile a database that they could then enter their information into and then send that information out to the appropriate form of government to then be redacted. Well, through the process of implementation this year, we've realized that asking all of our judges to submit this sensitive information to one central database may not be the most secure way to protect that information. It's also going to be fairly costly. It would have had a fiscal impact our budget this year in the amended budget of $177,000. Working with the administrative office of the courts and individuals, cyber security experts, we focused on it and now it said that the administrative office of the courts will simply provide a form for judges to fill out that they will then disseminate to the appropriate level of government and remove the database. By doing that and by voting for the amended budget, you voted to reduce that cost from $177,000 to $27,000, making this a more secure way to protect their information at a better cost to our taxpayers. With that being said, Mr. Speaker, I'll yield for any questions. Gentlemen, has a question to your left. Representative Park Cannon has recognized for a question. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you yield? I will. I'm deeply concerned about LGBTQ families, families of judges. You know, we do have some judges who are lesbians or who are gay and maybe are transgender. And so would this also help those families making sure that their personal information of their spouses would not be released? Thank you for the question. This will apply to all judges across our state. Gentlemen, ask them for the questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll yield the well and ask for your favorable consideration. Thank you. Gentlemen, as yielded the well, is there any objections to the previous question being ordered? Chair, has none of the previous questions ordered? Is there any objections to adopting the Committee's substitute? Here, none of the Committee's substitute is adopted. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of the bill? Is there any objection to the passage of the bill that Chair has done? Report of the Committee. Is there any objection to the passage of the bill? Yes. All those opposed will vote no. Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? For what purposes represent the heft nariz? Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is it not true that HB... Is this a parliamentary inquiry? Parliamentary inquiry, yes, sir. Thank you. Is it not true that House Bill 199 aligns with other legislative efforts that emphasize security and streamlined services, potentially making state employment more attractive for Georgia veterans, sir. I thank you, clarify the issue very well. Thank you for their inquiry. Thank you, sir. Now, if all members voted, all members voted if so, the clerk will unlock the machine.

All in the passage of House Bill 199, the Yays are 165, the Nays are zero and this bill having received the requisite Constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to House Bill 216? House Bill 216, five reps, and of Smith of the 138th being titled, NAC2 men chapter 7 and title 50, the fiscal to Georgia and attended relating the Department of Economic Development, so it's agreed to Georgia chips in Advanced Technology Commission, this bill I'm referring to the Committee on Economic Development, Tourism, NAC Committee recommends this bill, do pass. Representative, Vince Smith is recognized to present a bill that we've talked about in the past and I think one of our dear friends was a champion of this bill. I'm sure you'll tell us about that. Representative Smith is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Appreciate this opportunity to present this bill to y'all. If you think back last year we discussed a chips act on the floor of the House and it passed and passed the Senate. This chips act was really one of the big items that our former representative, Representative Richard Smith was all involved in. He was strategic, strategic issues in other words. He was really trying to advance the chips act and trying to bring the chips back to the United States but to Georgia specifically and he was very much involved and a lot of people in our area have worked hard on this bill. In the interim, we want to thank several people, Department of Economic Development, Josh Stevens has helped me out a lot with this bill, Department of DCA. We sat down also with the Governor's staff and to make sure we had this bill like we needed it. It's a good bill. It starts with on page two, you see how it creates a commission. People from the Governor's Office, the Speaker, the Lieutenant Governor, our education system. It deals with research and technology. We need to bring that home because over 90% of the chips right now that go in your phone, your appliances, your cars, all that's made in Taiwan, over 90% of it. We need to bring it back to Georgia. I would hope that you have had a chance to take a look at this. It does create a commission. We're going to work hard to see if we can't bring that industry here. It's high paying jobs and I think it'd be great for our citizens and Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I don't know if you have any questions. If not, I certainly appreciate your favor. Gentlemen has a couple of questions for your yield. Yes, sir. To your left in the back, Representative Reese from over in Columbus. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gentlemen, you? Not it. Isn't it true that our former below chairman, Richard Smith, understood the gravity of the chip situation here in national within the United States and the impact that it has on national security? Absolutely sure it is. And does the gentleman further you? I did. Isn't it also true that the people of Columbus, Georgia was extremely appreciative of his efforts to lead this chip effort for our state and our region and we are exceptionally excited at you as well as our speaker has joined on with signing this legislation to make this possible for the people of Georgia. That's correct. Thank you sir. And I do appreciate the Columbus delegation. They all signed on this bill. We've tried to work this together as a team which we do a lot of issues but thank to them. Gentlemen, you have one more? Yes, sir. Another member of that Columbus delegation I think agrees with you as Representative Rice, Representative Carmen Rice. Gentlemen, you yield the well. Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much for this and is it not true that House Bill 216 not only honors the legacy of Richard H Smith but also aims to improve the lives of Georgia by fostering innovation and economic growth in the semiconductor industry? Absolutely, yes ma'am. Thank you for the question. Thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate everybody's efforts. I appreciate your efforts working on this bill also. I would ask you favorable both. Thank you. Gentlemen, has no further questions and has yielded the well. Is there any objection to the previous question being ordered? Here none of the previous question is ordered. Is there any objection to agreeing to the report of the committee which was favorable to the passage of this bill that Chair Hiss none of the report the committee is agreed to? Shall this bill now pass, all in favor of the passage of the bill, will vote yes, all those opposed will vote no. And Mr. Clerk, will you unlock the machine? Have all members voted? All members voted. This is the bill. Mr. Clerk, will you lock the machine? Own the passage of House Bill 216, the Richard H. Smith, Georgia Chips, Advancement and Research and Economic Development Act. The Yees are 163, the Nays are 2. This bill having received a requisite constitutional majority is therefore passed. Mr. Clerk, will you read the caption to a group of privileged resolutions? Honoring the life and memory of Barbara Jean Allen. Recognizing commending Troy Cosby upon his retirement, recognizing commending to the violinist, recognizing February 26, 2025 as a paystay at the state capital and commending the impact of the Georgia Department of Behavior, Health and Developmental Disabilities Community Service Board and First Responders and for other purposes that completes the reading of the privilege resolutions. Is there an objection to adopting the privilege resolution here in the resolution for adopted? We will move on to afternoon orders. Representative Barry, who recognize for an afternoon order. Representative Barry, there he comes. We'll park your own deck and then represent Westbrook and then lead it hugely. Representative Barry, you recognize. Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues and distinguished guests, I rise today to honor a pivotal figure for our Black History Month moment. Someone who holds deep significance for me. He was a founding member of the student nonviolent coordinating committee, a four member of this house who once represented the same Southwest Atlantic community that I now serve and at the time he was the youngest member of this house. He was also a proud graduate of Murhaus College, a fact that feels especially fitting as he celebrate Murhaus Day at the capital. That man is none other than the great Julian Bond. Julian Bond's life was guided by a deep and unwavering commitment to justice, democracy, and truth. From his early days he exemplified courage, integrity, and dedication to the public good. When he elected to the State House in 1965 he faced significant challenges, not because he lacked the qualifications, but because of his willingness to speak truth to power about issues that still plague us today, including war, racism, and inequality. Despite overt attempts, he remains steadfast in his convictions and his spring court ultimately uphold his right to serve, affirming his place as a leader and advocate for the people. Scripture teaches us in Amos, chapter 5, verse 24, to let justice row down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. That was Julian Bond's mission, to keep justice flowing, keep righteousness moving, and to ensure that the doors he opened never closed behind us. This legacy lives on in each of us who refuse the torch of justice, grow down. If Julian Bond were here today, he would still be using his voice to speak truth to power, ensuring that the promise of democracy is upheld for all. Julian Bond did his part, and now he must do ours. Thank you Mrs. Speaker, you are the well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Representative. Will Park is recognized for an afternoon order. For easy. Okay. Representative Sam Park. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to commend the Ronald Reagan appointed federal judge, John Koonauer, who blocked a 34 count convicted felons attack on birthright citizenship as blatantly unconstitutional. Birthright citizenship is a cornerstone of American democracy and shrine the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution to guarantee citizenship to formerly enslaved African Americans and their children. It is the legal shield that has protected generations, a black Asian and Hispanic communities, and immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and other European countries from being cast out of the country they built and loved. As a barrage of unconstitutional and illegal actions by President Trump and his Republican enablers continue, may all true American patriots who recognize that we are a nation of laws, not of dictators or fascists, may we continue to stand firm in this moment and put country before party so that our constitutional democratic republic perseveres and emerges stronger and more united in service to we the people. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. Representative Ann Allen Westbrook from the great city. We just talked about Savannah while ago, Representative. Yes, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today on the occasion of President's Day. Yesterday, from the well, the President was portrayed as a defender of women and girls. I was wondering if this was the same President who's record on women and girls I had thought was well known. So, I felt it necessary to remind folks of the fuller story. I moved on her actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and bleep her. She was married. No, no, I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, I'll show you where they have some nice furniture. I moved on her like a bleep. I couldn't get there and she was married. Then all of a sudden, I see her. She's now got the big phony bleep and everything. She's totally changed her look. Yeah, that's her with the gold. I better use some tic-tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. You don't even wait. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the bleep. You can do anything. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield the well. I yield the well. Members, leoed it well. Leader Hewgley is recognized for an afternoon order. Give the lady your attention, please. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, a federal judge, block president Donald Trump's efforts to slash funding for the National Institute of Health Research Programs at universities and medical systems that was a threat to the key source of funding and for jobs in Georgia. I rise today to thank the 22 mostly Democratic-led states who challenge this action of the National Institute of Health funding cuts. And as you know here in Georgia, this would have meant real money. Emory University, 488 million. University of Georgia, 76 million. Augustine University, 73 million. Georgia Tech, 46 million. I rise today because Georgia remains silent when this was happening. We need to stand up for Georgia and speak truth to power regardless of who's in the White House because this is our state and we have to defend it from within and without. Thank you. Members, will we frame from any show of support or emotion after speakers in the well? University of Let's see, Ripley-Bertchett, Ripley-Bertchett is recognized for an afternoon order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I feel the need to come up here and de-escalate the situation. It appears as though a nerve was struck maybe yesterday and it appears as though we're in the rebuttal position. I think what we do up here is very important folks and we do hold political positions. So it forces us into a position of the right of the left. What I'm asking for you all to emerging you to not push yourselves in that direction. Let's continue to govern together. Let's continue to do what's best for the state of Georgia. Now you may feel one way or the other about President Trump. He was elected and I recall many, many times my colleagues across the aisle supporting the former President. And if you see one of our colleagues doing that respond accordingly as we have in the past. So I'm asking you to please, please, please. Let's not escalate this chamber into a fight from the right or the left. Let's work together. Let's continue to do the good work of the state of Georgia and push the DC politics and national politics aside. And let's just concentrate on Georgia politics. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thanks, sir. Members will refrain. That completes our afternoon orders. We do have some announcements and I'm going to go ahead and remind you before you get out of here. We do have pages a day.
